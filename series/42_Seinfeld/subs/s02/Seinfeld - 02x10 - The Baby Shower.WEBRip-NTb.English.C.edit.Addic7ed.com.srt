1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,400
Men, uh...
flip around the television

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:06,900
more than women, I think.

3
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,533
Men get that remote control
in their hands...

4
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:11,533
they don't even know what
the hell they're not watching.

5
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:13,033
You know, they just keep going.

6
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,233
"Don't even know
what I'm watching."

7
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:15,800
"What are you watching?"

8
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,800
"I don't care. I gotta keep
going." "Who was that?"

9
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,233
"Isn't that your father?"
"I don't know what it was."

10
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,533
"I gotta keep going!"

11
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:24,533
Women don't do that. See, now,
women will stop and go,

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,866
"Well, let me see
what the show is

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,233
before I change the channel."

14
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:30,000
You see, but men just fly.

15
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,200
You see, but men just fly.

16
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:35,333
Because women, you see,
women nest, and men hunt.

17
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:37,300
That's why
we watch TV differently.

18
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,066
Before there was
flipping around,

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,466
before there was television,

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,733
kings and emperors and pharaohs
and such had storytellers

21
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,900
that would tell them stories.
That was their entertainment.

22
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,200
I always wonder, in that era,

23
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,166
if they would get, like,
30 storytellers together

24
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,166
so they could still flip around.

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,966
Just go, "All right,
start telling me your story.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,999
"What's happening? I don't want
to hear any more. Shut up.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,200
"What's happening? I don't want
to hear any more. Shut up.

28
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,300
"Go to the next guy.
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,866
"Is there a girl in that story?
No? Shut up.

30
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,666
"I don't want to hear
that either. Shut up.

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,340
"No, go ahead.
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:09,066
I don't wanna hear that.
I'm going to bed."

33
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,800
She's pregnant?

34
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,333
Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:19,966
Leslie is pregnant?

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, see?
There is no justice.

37
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,633
She's the performance
artist, right?

38
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,733
Yeah, performance artist.

39
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,966
She's a real performer,
a real trooper.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,366
What's her husband's name again?

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,966
Chip? Kip?

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Skip?

43
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,400
Todd.

44
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:36,700
Todd...
Oh, yeah.

45
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:37,966
He's a Kennedy.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,233
No, he's not.

47
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,200
Come on, he's a third
cousin or something.

48
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:41,613
By marriage.

49
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:42,800
By marriage.

50
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,566
Oh, by marriage, yeah.

51
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,966
We went to the wedding.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,333
You should have
heard them talking

53
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,533
about Chappaquiddick.

54
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,033
Tried to blame the whole
thing on bad directions.

55
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,533
That woman was unequivocally
the worst date of my life.

56
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:56,366
Oh, pardon me
for trying to set you up

57
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,633
with a beautiful,
intelligent woman.

58
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,533
What, you don't think
I can attract

59
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:02,466
beautiful, intelligent women?

60
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,566
Thin ice, George, very thin ice.

61
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,233
Maybe for her new
performance piece,

62
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,366
she'll give birth on stage.

63
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,300
She stopped performing.

64
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:11,613
Oh! What a huge blow
to the culture.

65
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:15,300
Oh! What a huge blow
to the culture.

66
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,633
Can you believe this guy?

67
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,466
He holds a grudge like Khomeini.

68
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,800
She dragged me
down to that warehouse

69
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,700
on the waterfront in Brooklyn
to see one of her performances.

70
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,700
Oh, when she's on stage

71
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,366
cooking dinner
for some celebrity?

72
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,566
God...

73
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,866
She's cooking dinner for God.

74
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,033
She's yelling and screaming,
and the next thing I know,

75
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,333
she throws
a big can of chocolate syrup

76
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,533
all over my new red shirt.

77
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:38,866
It was an accident!

78
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
Oh, yeah, accident, right.

79
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,612
She was aiming right at me,
like she was putting out a fire.

80
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:42,866
She was aiming right at me,
like she was putting out a fire.

81
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,633
So for the rest of the show,

82
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,506
I'm sitting there
with chocolate over my shirt.

83
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,500
Flies are landing on me.

84
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,900
I'm boiling!

85
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:53,133
I'm fantasizing all the things
I'm going to say to her,

86
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,300
and later, finally,
backstage when I talk to her,

87
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,833
I'm like a little
groveling worm.

88
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:59,866
I'm... "What kind of chocolate
was that?"

89
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,866
"Do you throw
any other foods?"

90
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,533
He thought he still had a shot.

91
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:07,700
And then, then, then!

92
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,233
She leaves with somebody else.

93
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,612
Never even...
never even said goodbye.

94
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:12,533
Never even...
never even said goodbye.

95
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:15,200
Never called me back,
never apologized, nothing.

96
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:18,033
Like I was dirt.

97
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:21,333
Whatever happened to the shirt?

98
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:22,800
I still have it.

99
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,733
The collar's okay.
I wear it under sweaters.

100
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,966
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,200
She asked me to give her
a baby shower.

102
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,466
Asked you?

103
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,900
You're not gonna
do that, are you?

104
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:37,166
Anyone else, never,
but Leslie...

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,033
I have a problem
saying no to her.

106
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,866
For some reason,
I seem to want her approval.

107
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,613
Let Maria Shriver
give her a baby shower.

108
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:43,866
Let Maria Shriver
give her a baby shower.

109
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,866
Ask not what I can do for you,

110
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,233
ask what you can do for me.

111
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:48,233
<i>Ich bin ein</i> sucker.

112
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,066
Oh...

113
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,866
Would you two stop
with the Kennedys?

114
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,066
Why does everybody make such
a big deal about the Kennedys?

115
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,733
I mean,
what is this fascination?

116
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,200
Who cares?

117
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:59,400
It's all so boring.

118
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,900
Look, she doesn't deserve
a baby shower.

119
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,133
She deserves a baby monsoon.

120
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,366
She deserves Rosemary's baby.

121
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:11,000
I do have one
teeny little problem, though.

122
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:11,613
Never said goodbye.
Never apologized. Nothing.

123
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:15,133
Never said goodbye.
Never apologized. Nothing.

124
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,066
See...

125
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,900
I was gonna give
the shower in my apartment...

126
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,066
But?

127
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,500
My roommate has Lyme disease.

128
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,700
Lyme disease?

129
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,533
I thought she had
Epstein-Barr Syndrome.

130
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:30,366
She has this
in addition to Epstein-Barr.

131
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,666
It's like Epstein-Barr
with a twist of Lyme disease.

132
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,400
How did she get Lyme disease?

133
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,700
I don't know.

134
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:39,700
She did some outdoor version
of <i>Hair</i>

135
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:40,866
in Danberry, Connecticut.

136
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,613
They still do that play?

137
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:42,033
They still do that play?

138
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,333
It's a classic.

139
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,566
With the nudity?

140
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,500
I guess. She must've rolled over
on a tick during the love-in.

141
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,833
Never said goodbye. Hah!
"Goodbye."

142
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:58,333
Explain to me how
this baby shower thing works?

143
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,700
What do you want to know?

144
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:04,066
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt
into a drunken orgy of violence?

145
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,666
Rarely.

146
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,333
There's no hazing of the fetus,

147
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,612
or anything, is there?

148
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:12,566
or anything, is there?

149
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,566
No. Mm-mm.

150
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,866
When is this supposed to be?

151
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,866
Saturday.

152
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,233
Saturday.

153
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,833
Well, I have a show
in Buffalo on Saturday.

154
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,200
They're not gonna
bust up my apartment,

155
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,233
or anything, are they?

156
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:24,366
No, I'll take
full responsibility.

157
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,700
You won't regret it.

158
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,366
You know, because I've
seen these pregnant women,

159
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
and they sometimes misjudge
their fetal girth...

160
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,200
and they'll... just like
one wrong turn,

161
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,533
the whole buffet is,
like, right off the table.

162
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:38,200
Someday, before I die,
mark my words,

163
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,400
I'm gonna tell that woman
exactly what I think of her.

164
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,612
I'll never be able
to forgive myself

165
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:41,833
I'll never be able
to forgive myself

166
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,233
until I do.

167
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:44,400
And if you do?

168
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,200
Well, I still won't be
able to forgive myself,

169
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,066
but at least
it won't be about this.

170
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,566
What are you doing this for?

171
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,966
Look at you!

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,566
Quiet. I'm trying
to get a picture.

173
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
But you don't have to do this.

174
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,366
The guy is waiting in my house!

175
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,466
Leave me alone!

176
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,300
It's a one-time fee.
150 bucks.

177
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,366
Why live like this?

178
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,612
I'm not getting illegal cable.

179
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:11,800
I'm not getting illegal cable.

180
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,566
Oh, so what are you gonna do?

181
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,033
You gonna wait for
the cable companies

182
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,333
to resolve their dispute?

183
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,366
They're gonna be
in court for years.

184
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,566
No, I read in the paper...

185
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,566
Oh, oh, the paper, yeah.

186
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, they might
hook us up again.

187
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,033
Oh, God, you're so naive.

188
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:27,533
All cable companies care about
is the big mamoo.

189
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:31,866
Oh... look at you.
You're banging things.

190
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,466
It's just pathetic.

191
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,333
You're just wasting your life.

192
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:38,533
I'm offering you 56 channels.

193
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,612
Movies, sports, nudity,
and it's free for life!

194
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,566
Movies, sports, nudity,
and it's free for life!

195
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,800
Stop shouting.
You're ruining the reception!

196
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,233
Can you hear yourself?

197
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:50,400
Can... Do you know
what you're saying?

198
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:53,133
What you're suggesting
is illegal.

199
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,866
It's not illegal.
It's against the law.

200
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,166
Well, yeah.

201
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,700
Just... just hold this.
Can you hold that?

202
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,333
Look, will you at least
let me bring the guy over?

203
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,833
He's an amazing man.
He's a Russian immigrant.

204
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:09,333
He escaped from the gulag.

205
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:11,612
He's like the Sakharov
of cable guys.

206
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:12,533
He's like the Sakharov
of cable guys.

207
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,533
He'll slow your gas meter.

208
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:19,200
He sells slugs, Jerry.
Slugs for the subway.

209
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:22,166
He's a real
human rights nut, huh?

210
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,866
Yeah. He's intense, man.

211
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,700
I don't know.
What if I get caught...

212
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:29,533
Oh, you're not gonna get caught.
Look, let me get him, man.

213
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,966
It's the 90's. It's Hammer time.

214
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,966
Come on.
Just let me get him.

215
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,033
Jerry, Jerry,
this is the cable man.

216
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:41,613
You know, why don't we wait,

217
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:43,733
You know, why don't we wait,

218
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,300
because I'm going
out of town tomorrow.

219
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,833
Tomorrow okay.

220
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,066
No problem.

221
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,500
Yeah, you'll have
the whole thing installed

222
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:51,700
by the time you get back.

223
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,500
No, every time I turn on a TV,

224
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,200
sirens are gonna go off.

225
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,466
They're gonna track me down
like a dog. I know it.

226
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,700
No, no. Look, now, Jerry, Jerry,
it's no risk. I swear.

227
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:05,100
The Mets have 75 games
on cable this year.

228
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:09,933
Put it in.

229
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:11,613
You won't regret it.

230
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:12,366
You won't regret it.

231
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,966
♪ Yeah, Jerry's going to be
A cable boy ♪

232
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,533
♪ A cable boy
A cable boy... ♪

233
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,366
Mr. Steinfeld?

234
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,033
Seinfeld.

235
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,500
We're with the FBI.

236
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,300
Want to tell us
about your cable hook up?

237
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,966
My cable hook up? What about it?

238
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,033
It's been illegally installed,
Mr. Steinfeld.

239
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,900
It has? I've been out of town.
How did you know?

240
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,866
Hey, Jerry, I had to tell them.

241
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,533
I had to.
I had no choice.

242
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:41,613
Ah, they were onto the scam
from the very beginning.

243
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:44,866
Ah, they were onto the scam
from the very beginning.

244
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,066
You're in very serious trouble,
Mr. Steinfeld.

245
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,066
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Hold on.

246
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,500
We're just patsies.

247
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,733
We're just a couple of users.
We never sold the stuff.

248
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,300
What about the Russian guy?

249
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,700
The Russian guy's
the guy you want.

250
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,066
Mr. Seinfeld?

251
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,566
Agent Stone, FBI undercover.

252
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,833
No, Jerry!

253
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,500
No!

254
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:32,200
Cable boy...

255
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:35,133
Cable boy?

256
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,433
What have you done
to my little cable boy?

257
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,333
Excuse me, can I get
something to drink?

258
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,433
I'm afraid not.

259
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,033
Well, what's with this airline?

260
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,633
What, are you cutting out
the drinks now?

261
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,533
No, sir,
we're flying into a blizzard.

262
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,966
Please fasten your seat belt.

263
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,320
We're making
an emergency landing.

264
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:05,833
Are they gonna go over
the instructions again?

265
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:08,533
My name is Bill.

266
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,612
I might be the last person
you ever see.

267
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,173
I might be the last person
you ever see.

268
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,533
Not afraid of flying.

269
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,133
Although, many people do have
fear of flying,

270
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,800
and, uh,
I have no argument with that.

271
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,700
I think fear of flying
is quite rational

272
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:29,233
because human beings cannot fly.

273
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:32,033
Humans have fear of flying

274
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:35,300
the same way
fish have fear of driving.

275
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:41,166
You put a fish behind the wheel,
and they go, "This isn't right.

276
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,466
"I shouldn't be doing this.

277
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,233
I don't belong here."

278
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:50,500
Sounds like a rough trip.

279
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,066
Oh, there were fire engines,

280
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,366
ambulances all along the runway,

281
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,566
and then when we landed safely,

282
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,666
they all seemed so disappointed.

283
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,966
So the college canceled the gig?

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Oh, there was so much snow,
the roads were closed.

285
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:03,633
I really appreciate you
picking me up.

286
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,633
Thanks again.

287
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,633
Ah, forget it.

288
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,400
No, really, an airport run.

289
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,666
It's nothing.

290
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,233
No, it's one thing
if I asked you,

291
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,700
"Could you do me a favor?"
but to suggest it...

292
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:16,700
When you told me what you
went through on the plane,

293
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:17,492
it makes you stop and think.

294
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:18,033
it makes you stop and think.

295
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:21,366
I appreciate having
a real friend.

296
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,866
You know, if Richie Brandis
did this, I'd be suspicious.

297
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,740
You know, he's always got
some ulterior motive.

298
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,700
Ulterior motive...

299
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,800
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

300
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,200
Don't take the bridge,
get off here.

301
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,566
We can't go back to my place.

302
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,733
Elaine's having the shower.

303
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:37,000
What, tonight? Now?

304
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, yeah.
I forgot all about it. Uh...

305
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,500
All right, it's no big deal.
We'll go back to your place.

306
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,233
My place?
No, no, no, I hate my place.

307
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:46,066
I don't want to go back
to my place

308
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,491
Well, you want to get a bite?

309
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:47,566
Well, you want to get a bite?

310
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,033
Well, yeah, I would,

311
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,600
it's just I, you know,
I just ate a whole pot roast.

312
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:56,233
Well, so what should we do?

313
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:59,033
Well, shouldn't we at least
drop off your bag?

314
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:03,533
Red shirt!
Red shirt!

315
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:05,700
That's the red shirt!
What are you talking about?

316
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:08,533
You're wearing
the chocolate shirt!

317
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,166
I am. What a strange
coincidence.

318
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,366
Ah-ha! Nice try, my friend,

319
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,233
but you got to get up
pretty early in the morning.

320
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:17,491
You gotta let me go over there.

321
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:17,666
You gotta let me go over there.

322
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,866
What are you gonna do,

323
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,333
badger a pregnant woman
at her own baby shower?

324
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,133
Are you gonna take it off and
make her rinse it in club soda?

325
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,333
No, I'm gonna hold it
under her nose,

326
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,166
so she can smell
the scent of stale Bosco

327
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,333
that I had to live with
for three years.

328
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,700
I'm gonna say, "Remember
this shirt, baby?

329
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:34,033
Well, now...
it's payback time!"

330
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,166
We just bought an apartment
on Riverside Drive.

331
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,633
Bernard Goetz's mother
used to live there.

332
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,700
So where's Todd?

333
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,492
Up in Hyannis Port.

334
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:48,492
Up in Hyannis Port.

335
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,966
Oh, my God.
Hyannis Port?

336
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,366
With the Kennedys?

337
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Who else is up there?
Is Rose up there?

338
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,333
Ah, ha, ha.

339
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,166
So when's your due date?

340
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,633
March 20th, 9:00 a.m.

341
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,700
You know the time?

342
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:02,833
I'm having
a planned C-section.

343
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,033
My therapist told me

344
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,900
if I go through labor
I might get psychotic.

345
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,366
Uh, Leslie, Leslie,

346
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,166
what ever happened
to Sergeant Shriver?

347
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,866
Is... is he still
with them?

348
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,466
You don't hear much
about him these days.

349
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,133
Is he, like,
out of the loop, or...

350
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,491
Elaine, who catered this, Sears?

351
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,772
Elaine, who catered this, Sears?

352
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,033
What is this?
What are you doing here?

353
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:29,966
Ah, we're putting in the cable.

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,366
I'm having a party here.
You can't do this now.

355
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,533
Oh, we have to do this now.

356
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,700
Who is this guy?

357
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,733
Well, which one?

358
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:38,900
Both of them.

359
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,133
Oh, they're Soviet cable guys.

360
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,033
Okay.
Does Jerry know about this?

361
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,633
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all authorized. Yeah.

362
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,491
Well, you can't.
You can't do this now.

363
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, you can't.
You can't do this now.

364
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:51,633
Elaine, do you know
how booked up this guy is?

365
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,366
If I send him away now,

366
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,500
it's gonna take Jerry
months to get him back.

367
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:56,833
He won't like that.

368
00:13:56,866 --> 00:14:00,300
All right. Just do it fast,
and then get out.

369
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,700
All right. Anatole?

370
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:03,900
Giddy up. Go.

371
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:08,333
Look, it's only gonna take
a few minutes.

372
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:10,333
Then you and the gals
can take a load off

373
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,566
and watch something on <i>Lifetime.</i>

374
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,491
And what if we go up there?

375
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:17,800
And what if we go up there?

376
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,700
What are you gonna say to her?

377
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,133
What am I gonna say?

378
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,900
Yeah.

379
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:26,466
What did you go out with me for?

380
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,133
Just to dump chocolate
on my shirt,

381
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,700
and then dump me altogether?

382
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:33,200
I don't deserve
that kind of treatment.

383
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,166
You don't have
the common courtesy

384
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,133
to return my calls?
To apologize?

385
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,966
You think
I'm some sort of a loser

386
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,733
that likes to be abused
and ignored?

387
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:46,200
Whose shirt can be ruined
without financial restitution?

388
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,491
Some sort of a masochist

389
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:48,133
Some sort of a masochist

390
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,400
who enjoys being humiliated?

391
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:52,400
You think you can just avoid me?

392
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,033
Like I have
some sort of a disease?

393
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:56,500
You have the disease!
You have the disease!

394
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,000
You may be beautiful and rich

395
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:00,333
and physically
just unbelievable,

396
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,533
but you sicken me.

397
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:04,900
You disgust me!
You and everyone like you!

398
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:07,133
You'll never say that
to her face.

399
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,066
Watch me.

400
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,700
Yeah, I eat the whole apple...
core, stem, seeds...

401
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,000
just everything.

402
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,491
Kramer...
Kramer, look at him.

403
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:17,733
Kramer...
Kramer, look at him.

404
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:20,566
Look, he's eating all the food.

405
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,166
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,133
Well, you know,
there are many differences

407
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,966
between American
and Soviet cultures

408
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,300
that you're not aware of.

409
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,066
See, in Russia,

410
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,533
the cable guy, oh, they got
the whole run of the house.

411
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,533
Yeah, that...
That's tradition. Yeah.

412
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,300
You ever eat the bark
off of a pineapple?

413
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,600
Kramer! Kramer!
Kramer! Kramer!

414
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,491
Hey... Wow, man.

415
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:48,492
Hey... Wow, man.

416
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:02,700
What are you doing here?

417
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,133
I thought you were out of town.

418
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,900
The show was canceled.
There was a blizzard.

419
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,866
I can't believe you told Kramer

420
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,500
it's okay to put cable in
during the shower, Jerry.

421
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,033
Look, look,
they've eaten everything.

422
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,066
Jerry, what a surprise.

423
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,500
I thought you were out of town.

424
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,491
Well, Leslie, sometimes
the road less traveled is...

425
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:19,366
Well, Leslie, sometimes
the road less traveled is...

426
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,866
less traveled for a reason.

427
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,533
George,
don't even think about it.

428
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:28,966
Don't even dream about it.

429
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,333
About what?

430
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:32,466
Kramer! Kramer!

431
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Hey.
Hey.

432
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,033
Leslie...

433
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:51,366
Yeah?

434
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,000
George...

435
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:58,900
George Costanza.

436
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,000
Hi.

437
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:08,966
I guess you don't remember me,

438
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,033
but we actually went out
a couple years ago.

439
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,666
Once.

440
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,466
Remember?

441
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,492
Vaguely.

442
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:17,833
Vaguely.

443
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,700
Yeah. You took me
to see one of your shows.

444
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:22,966
And?

445
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,866
And, um...

446
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,000
it was quite good.

447
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:33,133
In fact, you even
incorporated me into the show.

448
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,566
I'm not actually a performer,

449
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,400
although my parents
felt I had talent.

450
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,466
Jerry?

451
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,400
Remember me?

452
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:43,700
I'm sorry...

453
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,533
Mary Contardi.

454
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,491
No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry?

455
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:48,033
No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry?

456
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,533
We had a date three years ago.

457
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,133
You took me
to one of your shows.

458
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,700
Oh, I... I think I remember.

459
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:55,533
Told me you had a great time.
Said you'd call me the next day.

460
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:57,966
Well, I'm sure I meant to call.
I probably just lost your...

461
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,966
Liar!

462
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,300
Liar!

463
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,566
You were never going to call me!

464
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,566
You thought you could waltz
through the rest of life

465
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
and never bump into me again,

466
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,033
but you were wrong, Jerry!
You were wrong!

467
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:09,400
I... I...

468
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:11,300
What do you think,
I'm a poor pathetic wretch?

469
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,666
I didn't think that...

470
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,466
Some person who could be
dismissed and ignored?

471
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,900
Some insignificant
piece of dust?

472
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,491
Some person who doesn't deserve
your respect and your attention?

473
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:18,666
Some person who doesn't deserve
your respect and your attention?

474
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,966
Well, you're the one

475
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,900
that doesn't deserve
my respect and my attention!

476
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,566
You're the insignificant
piece of dust!

477
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:35,900
Actually, I never had
any formal training.

478
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:37,900
I guess I'd be
better suited for improvs...

479
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,700
Oh!

480
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,000
Thanks a lot.

481
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:47,492
Oh, bye.

482
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:48,300
Oh, bye.

483
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,500
I'm so sorry you have to go.

484
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:52,133
Yeah, I really have to be going.

485
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,366
All right, listen,

486
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,000
I've changed my mind
about this whole thing.

487
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't want the cable.

488
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,333
Look, Jerry, don't be a fool.

489
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,366
You don't want?

490
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,666
No, I don't want.

491
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,833
So just tell what I owe you
for your trouble, and...

492
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,266
$400.

493
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,366
$400.

494
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,491
You told me 150.

495
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:18,900
You told me 150.

496
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:21,666
Well...

497
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,133
I'm going.

498
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,533
Obviously.

499
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,566
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry

500
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,000
about everything that went on
here tonight.

501
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,200
You know, I had no idea...

502
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,833
Elaine, you know,
I was watching you tonight,

503
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,000
and I realized something.

504
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:36,533
You're just like
you were in college.

505
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:39,566
Oh... Thank you.

506
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:45,533
What was I like in college?

507
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:46,766
Come on, let's go.

508
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,900
I'll be right back.

509
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,300
I'm not paying $400.

510
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,500
I don't even want the thing.

511
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:07,766
What are you gonna do?

512
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:20,400
Every woman
on the face of the earth

513
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:23,533
has complete control
of my life...

514
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:27,866
and yet I want them all.

515
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,700
Is that irony?

516
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,866
Why can't I meet a Kennedy?

517
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,466
I saw John Junior once downtown.
I was on a bus.

518
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,466
I hit the... ding.

519
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,733
It didn't stop.

520
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:47,491
All right, I said I had
a good time and I'd call, but...

521
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:47,966
All right, I said I had
a good time and I'd call, but...

522
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,533
who takes that literally?

523
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,400
Hey, come on over.

524
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:55,433
<i>Doctor Zhivago's</i> on cable
in five minutes.

525
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,900
I'm making popcorn.

526
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:05,000
What do you do
at the end of a date,

527
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:09,466
when you know you don't want
to see this person ever again

528
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,333
for the rest of your life?

529
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:14,033
What do you say?
What do you say?

530
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,491
It doesn't... No matter
what you say, it's a lie.

531
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:18,400
It doesn't... No matter
what you say, it's a lie.

532
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,500
"I'll see you around."

533
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:24,033
See you around.

534
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:26,366
If you're around,
and I'm around,

535
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,033
I'll see you around that area.

536
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:34,733
You'll be around other people,
you won't be around me,

537
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:38,400
but you will be around.

538
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,233
"Take care now."

539
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,800
Ever say that to somebody?

540
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,700
"Take care now."

541
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:46,700
Take care...

542
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:47,492
Now.

543
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:49,633
Now.

544
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,533
Because I'm not gonna
be taking care of you.

545
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:55,866
So you should take care now.

546
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,633
"Take care, take care."

547
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,700
What does that mean?
"Take care."

548
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:03,200
"Take off." Isn't that
what you really want to say?

549
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:05,166
"Take off now."

550
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,000
Get out of here.
