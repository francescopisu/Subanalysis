1
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:04,366
I'm on the street the other day,
make a pay phone call,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,466
go overtime on the call,

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
hang up the phone, walk away.

4
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,000
You've had this happen?

5
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:14,666
Phone rings.
It's the phone company.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,566
They want more money.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,500
Don't you love this?

8
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:21,033
And you've got them
right where you want them

9
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:22,700
for the first time in your life.

10
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:25,233
You're on the street.
There's nothing they can do.

11
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,700
I like to let it ring
a few times, you know,

12
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,499
let her sweat a little
over there,

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:30,966
let her sweat a little
over there,

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,733
and then just pick it up.
"Yeah, hello, operator?

15
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,866
"Oh, I've got the money.

16
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:40,033
"I've got the money right here.

17
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:41,300
"Do you hear that?

18
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:46,300
"That's a quarter.

19
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,766
Yeah, you want that, don't you?"

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
No, they just have to get
more cops on the force.

21
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:03,466
It's as simple as that.

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,300
Cops. I don't even
care about cops.

23
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,900
I want to see garbage men.

24
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,333
It's much more important.

25
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,033
All I want to see
are garbage trucks,

26
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:12,366
garbage cans, and garbage men.

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,500
You're never gonna stop crime.

28
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,000
We should at least be clean.

29
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,833
I tell what they should do.

30
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:18,633
They should combine
the two jobs.

31
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,132
Make it one job,
cop/garbage man.

32
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:21,833
Make it one job,
cop/garbage man.

33
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:24,000
I always see cops walking around

34
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,000
with nothing to do.

35
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:26,733
Grab a broom.

36
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:28,333
Start sweeping.

37
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:30,133
You sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep.

38
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,233
Catch a criminal,
get right back to sweeping.

39
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:34,500
You should run for mayor.

40
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,900
Ah, nobody listens.

41
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,800
Where is someone?
I'm starving.

42
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,866
This is him right here.

43
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,066
Is there a table ready?
How many?

44
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,500
How many?

45
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:48,166
Is Tatiana coming?

46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,966
Well, I don't know.
I have to call her,

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,133
tell her where we are.

48
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,500
tell her where we are.

49
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,700
I'm very lucky she's even
considering seeing me at all.

50
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,533
Really? I thought
things were going okay.

51
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:59,800
They were.
It's... kind of complicated.

52
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,133
Well, what is it?

53
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,133
How many?

54
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,500
All right, uh...
Four. Seinfeld.

55
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,300
Four.

56
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,033
That'll be 5, 10 minutes.

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,500
What do you want to do?

58
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,333
Let's go someplace else.
I am too hungry.

59
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,700
We might as well stay here.

60
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:20,133
We haven't got much time
to make the movie.

61
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:21,666
We haven't got much time
to make the movie.

62
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,533
Okay. I'm gonna call Tatiana.
There's the phone.

63
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,333
Tatiana...

64
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:31,366
Excuse me. Are you
gonna be very long?

65
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,966
Lasbrook, four!

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,833
So did I do a terrible thing?

67
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,300
You mean lying to your uncle?

68
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,500
I couldn't have dinner with him.

69
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,866
<i>Plan Nine From Outer Space.</i>

70
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,333
One night only. The big screen.
My hands are tied.

71
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,166
You know, it's a public phone.

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,033
You're not supposed
to just chitchat.

73
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:50,133
Jerry, get menus
so when we sit down,

74
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:51,833
Jerry, get menus
so when we sit down,

75
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,333
we'll be able to order
right away.

76
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:54,733
Can't look at a menu now.

77
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,166
I gotta be at the table.

78
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,733
He knows I'm waiting.

79
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:00,666
He sees me. He just
doesn't want to look.

80
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,666
Everything's gotta be just so

81
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,200
all the time with you,
doesn't it?

82
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:06,500
Hey, I offered you those
cookies in my house.

83
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:07,833
Health cookies.

84
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:12,033
I hate those little
dust-board fructose things.

85
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,700
I just can't believe
the way people are.

86
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,200
What is it with humanity?

87
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,266
What kind of a world
do we live in?

88
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,866
What?

89
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,066
There's a woman over there
looks really familiar.

90
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,166
Dark hair, striped shirt.

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,466
I've never seen her before.

92
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
I know this woman.

93
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,333
This is gonna drive me crazy.

94
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,466
Excuse me.

95
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,833
Ooh, I'm sorry.

96
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,566
Did you see that?

97
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,000
Those people... Look,
they're getting a table.

98
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,366
Well, maybe they were
here from before.

99
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
No, no, no,
they weren't here before.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,533
Excuse me, are you
gonna be much longer?

101
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,166
I have to make
a very important call.

102
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:03,933
Jerry, find out what's going on.

103
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,533
Excuse me.

104
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:10,166
Didn't those people
just come in?

105
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
I believe we were ahead of them.

106
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:13,533
What's your name?

107
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:14,666
Seinfeld.

108
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,966
No, no. They were here before.

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,166
Uh, Kackige! Two!

110
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:34,866
You ever notice
how happy people are

111
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,333
when they finally get a table?

112
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:41,633
They feel so special
because they've been chosen.

113
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,066
It's enough to make you sick.

114
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,166
Boy, you are really hungry.

115
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,866
Hey!

116
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,566
If anything happens here,
can I count on you?

117
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:05,533
What?

118
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,733
If we decide to go at it.

119
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,566
Yeah, I want to get
into a rumble.

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,666
I have to get in touch
with Tatiana.

121
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,033
Look at his little outfit.

122
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,166
It's all so coordinated.

123
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,566
The little socks
match the little shirt.

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,133
I really hate this guy.

125
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:23,233
I really hate this guy.

126
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,166
Oh, I'm gonna faint.

127
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,900
George...

128
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,833
Who is that woman
in the stripes?

129
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,666
I don't know her.

130
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,033
She looks so familiar.

131
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,400
You know, it's not fair

132
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:39,233
that people are seated
first come, first serve.

133
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:42,366
It should be based
on who's hungriest.

134
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:46,466
I feel like
just walking over there

135
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,166
and taking some food
off of somebody's plate.

136
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,133
I'll tell you what.

137
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:50,666
I'll tell you what.

138
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,900
There's 50 bucks in it for you
if you do it.

139
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,533
What do you mean?

140
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:02,000
You walk over to that table,

141
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,633
you pick up an egg roll,

142
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,033
you don't say anything...

143
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:09,000
you eat it,

144
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,366
say, "Thank you very much,"

145
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,133
wipe your mouth, walk away,

146
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,666
I give you 50 bucks.

147
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:19,133
What are they gonna do?

148
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,133
They won't do anything.
In fact...

149
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:20,733
They won't do anything.
In fact...

150
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:22,333
you'll be giving them
a story to tell

151
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,900
for the rest of their lives.

152
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,366
50 bucks?
You'll give me 50 bucks?

153
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
50 bucks.

154
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,200
That table over there.
The three couples.

155
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:34,200
Okay, I don't want
to go over there

156
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,500
and do it
and then come back here

157
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:39,166
and find out there was
some little loophole,

158
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
like I didn't put
mustard on it or something.

159
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,400
No. No tricks.

160
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,733
Should I do it, George?

161
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,033
For 50 bucks?

162
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:50,132
I'd put my face
in their soup and blow.

163
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,533
I'd put my face
in their soup and blow.

164
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:59,500
All right.
All right.

165
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:00,666
Here, hold this.

166
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,433
I'm doing it.

167
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,166
I know this sounds crazy,

168
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,166
but the two men
who are standing behind me

169
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,500
are gonna give me 50 bucks

170
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,132
if I stand here
and eat one of your egg rolls.

171
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:20,166
if I stand here
and eat one of your egg rolls.

172
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,666
I'll give you 25
if you let me do it.

173
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
What?

174
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,200
What is she talking about?

175
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,166
What'd she say?
What did she say?

176
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Will someone tell me
what she said?

177
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,333
What did she say?

178
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,300
What happened?

179
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,666
Did you see that?

180
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,833
What were you telling them?

181
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:39,966
I offered them 25.
They had no idea why.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,666
George, the phone's free.

183
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,866
Hallelujah.

184
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,800
Excuse me.
I-I was waiting here.

185
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,333
What, I didn't see you.

186
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:50,133
I've been standing here
for the last 10 minutes.

187
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:51,200
I've been standing here
for the last 10 minutes.

188
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,166
I won't be long.

189
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,366
Um, that's not the point.

190
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,033
The point is I was here first.

191
00:07:57,066 --> 00:08:01,233
Well, if you were here first,
you'd be holding the phone.

192
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:12,166
You know, we're living
in a society!

193
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,033
We're supposed to act
in a civilized way!

194
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,166
Does she care?

195
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,466
No.

196
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,066
Does anyone ever display
the slightest sensitivity

197
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,166
over the problems
of a fellow individual?

198
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,466
No. No.

199
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,966
A resounding no.

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,233
Hey. Sorry
I took so long.

201
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:36,733
Oh, that's okay. Really,
don't worry about it.

202
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,200
How do people fast?

203
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:42,233
Did Gandhi get this crazy?

204
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:43,700
I'm gonna go walk around

205
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,000
and see what dishes look good.

206
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,000
I told my uncle I had
a stomachache tonight.

207
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,500
You think he bought that?

208
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,132
Yeah, he...

209
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:50,300
Yeah, he...

210
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,200
probably bought it.

211
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,033
So, what happened with Tatiana?

212
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,466
I shouldn't even tell you.

213
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,466
Come on.

214
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,566
Well, after dinner last week,

215
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,166
she invites me
back to her apartment.

216
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm with you.

217
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:07,233
Well, it's this little place
with this little bathroom,

218
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:08,666
and it's, like, right there,
you know?

219
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,466
It's not even down a little hall
or off in an alcove,

220
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,866
you understand?
There's no... buffer zone.

221
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:20,132
So...

222
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:20,366
So...

223
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,800
we start to fool around,
and it's the first time,

224
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,500
and it's early in the going,

225
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:30,966
and I begin to perceive
this impending...

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,333
intestinal requirement...

227
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,833
whose needs are going to surpass
by great lengths

228
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,466
anything in the sexual realm.

229
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,066
So I know I'm gonna
have to stop,

230
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,000
and as this is happening,

231
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:50,132
I'm thinking even if I can
somehow manage to momentarily...

232
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,633
I'm thinking even if I can
somehow manage to momentarily...

233
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,333
extricate myself
from the proceedings

234
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:59,333
and relieve
this unstoppable force,

235
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,466
I know that that bathroom
is not gonna provide me

236
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
with the privacy
that I know I'm going to need...

237
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:07,500
This could only happen to you.

238
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:10,033
So, uh...

239
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:12,766
I finally stop and say, um...

240
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,733
"Tatiana, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way,

241
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,866
but I think it would be best
if I left."

242
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,066
You said this
to her... after?

243
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,400
No.

244
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,666
During.

245
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, boy.

246
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,133
Yeah.

247
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,400
Wow. So?

248
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:36,500
So I'm dressing,
and she's staring up at me,

249
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:41,000
struggling to compute this
unprecedented turn of events.

250
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:43,066
I don't know what to say
to reassure this woman,

251
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,833
and worst of all,
I don't have the time to say it.

252
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,666
The only excuse
she might possibly have accepted

253
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,133
is if I told her
I am in reality Batman,

254
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:54,333
is if I told her
I am in reality Batman,

255
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:56,866
and I'm very sorry,
I just saw the Bat signal.

256
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:00,833
It took me three days
of phone calls

257
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:02,666
to get her to agree
to see me again.

258
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,333
Now she's waiting
for me to call,

259
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:06,700
and she's still on the phone.

260
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,466
I hate this place.

261
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,833
I don't know why we came here.

262
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:14,333
I am never coming
back here again.

263
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:15,400
Who is that woman?

264
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,132
Remember when you first went out
to eat with your parents?

265
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:20,900
Remember when you first went out
to eat with your parents?

266
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:24,666
Remember?
It was such a treat to go.

267
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,633
And they serve you
this different food

268
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,666
that you never saw before,

269
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,500
and they put it in front of you,

270
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:35,833
and it was such a delicious
and exciting adventure.

271
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:39,166
And now I just feel
like a big, sweaty hog

272
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,533
waiting for them
to fill up the trough.

273
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,333
Oh.

274
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:45,366
She's off.

275
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:49,833
Jerry, talk to that guy again.

276
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:50,133
What am I gonna say?

277
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:50,966
What am I gonna say?

278
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,666
Tell him we want
to catch a movie

279
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,266
and that we're late.

280
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:58,366
Hey.

281
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,533
What stinks in here?

282
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:04,366
Mr. Cohen, haven't seen you
for a couple of weeks.

283
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,080
Well, I've been looking
for a better place.

284
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:09,233
Better place.

285
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,833
Want a...?
Want a table?

286
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:13,600
No, just bring me a plate,
and I'll eat here.

287
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,000
Bring him a plate.

288
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,500
He'll eat here!

289
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:19,533
Come on. I'll give you a table.

290
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Excuse me.

291
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:27,666
We've been waiting here.

292
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,733
Now, I know we were ahead
of that guy. He just came in.

293
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,900
Oh, no. Mr. Cohen always here.

294
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,000
He's always here.
What does that mean?

295
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,333
What does that mean?

296
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:43,900
Oh, Mr. Cohen very nice man.
He live on Park Avenue.

297
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,066
Where am I?

298
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,132
Is this a dream?

299
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,833
Is this a dream?

300
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:55,100
What in God's name
is going on here?

301
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:58,200
She's not there.
She left.

302
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,733
She must have waited and left

303
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:01,900
because those people
wouldn't get off the phone.

304
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,366
Did you leave a message?

305
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,233
Yeah, I told her to call me here

306
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,833
and to tell anyone that answers
the phone

307
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:10,166
to ask for a balding stocky man
with glasses.

308
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,933
I better tell them
I'm expecting a call.

309
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,966
Uh, Jerry,
here comes that woman.

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,166
Where do I know her?

311
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:20,131
Hi, Jerry.

312
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,000
Hi, Jerry.

313
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,733
Hey!

314
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,233
How are you doing?

315
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,133
How is everything?

316
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,766
Good, good, good.

317
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,533
What's going on?

318
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,400
Oh, working hard. And you?

319
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:42,166
Oh, you know, working around.

320
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Same stuff.

321
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,500
Doing...

322
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,900
whatever.

323
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,132
Well, you haven't been
around in a while.

324
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:50,966
Well, you haven't been
around in a while.

325
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,700
I know.
I know. Well...

326
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,566
You know.

327
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,566
You should come by.

328
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,400
Definitely.

329
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,000
I plan to.

330
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:04,100
I'm not just saying that.

331
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:07,533
Hi. I'm Elaine.

332
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:09,833
Oh, Lorraine Catalano.

333
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm sorry.

334
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,700
Lorraine, this is Elaine.

335
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,133
Well, it was nice
seeing you, Jerry...

336
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,333
and nice meeting you.

337
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,033
Oh, nice to meet you too,
Lorraine.

338
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,166
Oh, my God, Lorraine.

339
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,533
That's Lorraine
from my uncle's office.

340
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:36,333
I am in big, big trouble.

341
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,333
The one you broke
the plans with tonight?

342
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:40,333
Yeah, she works in his office.

343
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,466
Now she's gonna

344
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,466
see him tomorrow

345
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,900
and tell him she saw me here
tonight.

346
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,133
He's gonna tell his wife.

347
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,500
His wife's gonna
call my mother...

348
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,133
Oh, this is bad.
You don't know.

349
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:51,666
Oh, this is bad.
You don't know.

350
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,833
The chain reaction of calls

351
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:56,066
this is gonna set off.

352
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,033
New York, Long Island, Florida.

353
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:01,166
It's like the Bermuda Triangle.

354
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,233
Unfortunately,
nobody ever disappears.

355
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:07,133
My uncle to my aunt,
my aunt to my mother,

356
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,166
my mother to my uncle...

357
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,700
And my uncle to my cousin,

358
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:15,066
my cousin to my sister,
my sister to me...

359
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,900
You should've just had dinner
with your uncle tonight

360
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,033
and gotten it over with.

361
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,033
It's just a movie.

362
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,900
Just a movie?

363
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,400
You don't understand.

364
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:25,300
This isn't <i>Plans 1-8</i>
<i>From Outer Space.</i>

365
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,066
This is <i>Plan 9.</i>

366
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,833
This is the one that worked,

367
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,833
the worst movie ever made.

368
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:33,200
I'm really
looking forward to it.

369
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,966
Hey. I got news
for you.

370
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,366
If we're making this movie,

371
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,633
we gotta get a table
immediately.

372
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,200
All right. Look it. Let's stop
fooling around.

373
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:40,409
Let's just slip him some money.

374
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:41,400
Let's just slip him some money.

375
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,766
In a Chinese restaurant?
Do they take money?

376
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:49,033
Do they take money?
Everyone takes money.

377
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:51,466
I went out with a guy
who did it all the time.

378
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,166
You just slip them 20 bucks.
Twenty bucks?

379
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,466
Isn't that excessive?

380
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,200
Well, what do you wanna
give him, change?

381
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,833
It's more than the meal.

382
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, come on.

383
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:03,733
We'll divide it up three ways.

384
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:05,066
All right.

385
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,633
Seven, seven...

386
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,800
six.

387
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,408
I'm not gonna eat that much.

388
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:10,833
I'm not gonna eat that much.

389
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:14,466
I'm counting your shrimps.

390
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,066
Okay, who's gonna do it?

391
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,366
Oh, no.
I can't do it.

392
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,733
I'm not good at these things.
I get flustered.

393
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:22,166
Once I tried to bribe an usher

394
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
at the roller derby.

395
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,333
I almost got arrested.

396
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:26,533
I guess it's you, Jer.

397
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:27,900
Me? What about you?

398
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:31,066
Oh, I can't do that.
It's a guy thing.

399
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,000
The women's movement

400
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,833
just can't seem
to make any progress

401
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,866
in the world of bribery,
can they?

402
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:40,266
Give me the money.

403
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,333
How's it going?

404
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,266
Very busy.

405
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,500
Boy, we are really anxious

406
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:08,000
to sit down.

407
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,408
Very good specials tonight.

408
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,489
Very good specials tonight.

409
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,700
If there's anything you can do

410
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:18,833
to get us a table,

411
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,800
we'd really appreciate it.

412
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,666
Oh, what is your name?

413
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,233
No, no.
I want to eat now.

414
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,400
Yes,

415
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:29,000
whole sea bass dinner tonight,
very fresh.

416
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,700
Here. Take this.
I'm starving.

417
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:33,700
Take it.
Take it.

418
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,566
Uh... Dennison, four!

419
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,033
Your table is ready.

420
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:46,000
No, no, no.
I want that table!

421
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,200
I want that table.

422
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,800
Oh, come on. Did you see that?

423
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,633
What was that?
He took the money.

424
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,833
He didn't give us a table.

425
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:54,866
You lost the 20.

426
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,333
Well...
How could he do that?

427
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:58,500
You didn't make it clear.

428
00:17:58,533 --> 00:17:59,666
Make it clear?

429
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,666
What a sorry exhibition
that was.

430
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,300
All right,

431
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,866
let me get the money back.

432
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:16,000
Excuse me.

433
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:18,633
I realize this is
extremely embarrassing.

434
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,033
My friend here apparently
made a mistake.

435
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,066
Your name?

436
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:26,700
Seinfeld.

437
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,400
Yes, Seinfeld, four.

438
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:29,533
No, no, no.

439
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,366
Do you see the girl
with the long hair?

440
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,966
Oh, yes, yes.

441
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,333
Very beautiful girl.
Very beautiful.

442
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,566
Your girlfriend?

443
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,408
Well, actually, we did date
for a while, but...

444
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:41,833
Well, actually, we did date
for a while, but...

445
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:43,900
that's really not relevant here.

446
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,333
Relationships are difficult.

447
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,566
It is very hard
to stay together.

448
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,700
All right, listen.
All right.

449
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,366
How much longer is it gonna be?

450
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,033
Oh...

451
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,733
Be about five, 10 minutes.

452
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,466
So?

453
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,408
There seems to be
a bit of a discrepancy.

454
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:10,500
There seems to be
a bit of a discrepancy.

455
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,000
So when are we gonna eat?

456
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,466
Five, 10 minutes.
Oh.

457
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,566
We should've left earlier.

458
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,566
I told you.

459
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,166
I don't see any way we can eat

460
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,333
and make this movie.

461
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh, well, I have to eat.
Let's order it to go.

462
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:24,166
We'll eat it in the cab.
Eat it in the cab?

463
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,666
Chinese food in a cab?

464
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,000
We'll eat it in the movie.

465
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,500
Where do you think you're going?

466
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,833
Do you think that they have
big picnic tables there?

467
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:33,366
Well, what do you suggest?

468
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,333
I say we leave now,

469
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:37,833
we go to Sky Burger,
and we scarf 'em down.

470
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,300
I'm not going to Sky Burger.

471
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,333
Besides,

472
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:40,407
it's in the opposite direction.

473
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:41,500
it's in the opposite direction.

474
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:43,133
Let's just eat popcorn
or something.

475
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,300
Cartwright?

476
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,333
I can't have popcorn for dinner.

477
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:48,333
Cartwright!

478
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:50,433
I have to eat!

479
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,333
Well, they have hot dogs there.

480
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:56,200
Oh, movie hot dogs.

481
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,866
I'd rather lick the food
off the floor.

482
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,066
I can't go anyway.

483
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,500
I have to wait here
for Tatiana's call.

484
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,000
Let me just check.
Excuse me.

485
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,966
I'm expecting a call.
Costanza.

486
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,866
Yes. I just got a call.

487
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,408
I yell... Cartwright!

488
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,000
I yell... Cartwright!

489
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,500
Cartwright!

490
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:15,200
Just like that.
Nobody came up. I hang up.

491
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,966
Well, was it for Costanza or...

492
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,900
Yes, yes, that's it.
Nobody answered.

493
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,533
Was it a woman?

494
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,833
Yes, yes.

495
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:32,400
I tell her you not here.

496
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:34,533
She said curse word. I hang up.

497
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,409
She called.

498
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,666
She called.

499
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,666
He yelled, "Cartwright."

500
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,666
I missed her.

501
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,333
Who's Cartwright?

502
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,666
I'm Cartwright.

503
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,300
You're not Cartwright.

504
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,733
Of course I'm not Cartwright!

505
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:58,800
Look, why don't you two

506
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,500
just go to the movies
by yourself.

507
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:01,633
I'm not in the mood.

508
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,866
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.

509
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,166
So you're not going?

510
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,166
You don't need us.

511
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,566
I can't go to a bad movie

512
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,300
by myself.

513
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:10,409
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks

514
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,033
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks

515
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:14,166
to strangers?

516
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
I guess I'll just go
to my uncle's.

517
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,566
Should we tell him
we're leaving?

518
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,866
Oh, what for?

519
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,033
Let's just get out of here.

520
00:21:27,248 --> 00:21:29,066
Seinfeld, four!

521
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,533
Hunger will make people
do amazing things.

522
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:35,633
I mean, the proof of that
is cannibalism.

523
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,700
Cannibalism. What...?

524
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:38,966
What do they say?

525
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,408
I mean, they're eating,
you know?

526
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:40,900
I mean, they're eating,
you know?

527
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:44,666
"This is good. Who is this?

528
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,500
I like this person."

529
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,066
You know, I mean...

530
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,666
I would think the hardest thing
about being a cannibal

531
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,633
is trying to get
some really deep sleep.

532
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,033
You know what I mean?
I would think you'd be like...

533
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,733
"What is it? Who is that?
Who's there?

534
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:03,033
"Who's there? Is somebody there?

535
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,666
"What do you want?
What do you want?

536
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,833
"You look hungry.
Are you hungry?

537
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,500
Get out of here."
