1
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:06,817
I have never seen an old person
in a new bathing suit...

2
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:09,953
...in my life. I don't know where
they get their bathing suits.

3
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:13,222
But my father has bathing suits
from other centuries.

4
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:14,760
My parents live in Florida.

5
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:17,705
And if you go down there and
you forget your bathing suit...

6
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:20,255
...then they want you
to wear one of theirs.

7
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:21,928
You know how that gets?

8
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:24,874
''You need trunks, son?
I got trunks for you.

9
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:26,857
You can wear my trunks.''

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,605
Fathers don't wear bathing
suits, they wear trunks.

11
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:33,155
It's kind of the same thing a tree
would wear if it went swimming.

12
00:00:33,676 --> 00:00:37,026
So I get in the water in this thing,
and it's, like, floating around me...

13
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:38,954
...somewhere.

14
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:41,387
You ever put on a bathing suit
that you don't know...

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,656
...exactly where you are
inside the bathing suit?

16
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,962
You bump into somebody,
''No, I’m parasailing.

17
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:48,036
I’m waiting for the boat
to come back.''

18
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:56,365
It was supposed to be here at 7:30.

19
00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:59,179
-Call the airlines again.
-What happened to the Scotch tape?

20
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:00,806
Who takes the Scotch tape?

21
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,399
Nobody returns anything
around here.

22
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:05,096
Oh, I think that's them.

23
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,792
Know what I’ll do next time?

24
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:08,456
I’ll hide it so nobody can find it.

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,457
-Hi! Welcome!
-Hi!

26
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:14,089
-Welcome.
-How are you?

27
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:17,456
-Welcome to Florida!
-Hi, Mr. Seinfeld.

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,889
Hey, there's the old man.

29
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:22,419
So, what took you so long?

30
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:25,002
We waited 35 minutes
in the rent-a-car place.

31
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,311
I don't know why.
We would have picked you up.

32
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:29,649
-What's the difference?
-You could use our car.

33
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:31,243
I don't want to use your car.

34
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:33,454
-What's wrong with our car?
-Nothing. It’s fine.

35
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:35,313
-What if you want to use it?
-We don't.

36
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:38,228
-What? We use it.
-lf you were using it, we wouldn't.

37
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,601
So, what, you'd hitch?

38
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,223
-How much is a rent-a-car?
-I don't know, 25 bucks a day.

39
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:45,239
-What? Oh, you're crazy.
-Plus the insurance.

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,861
Oh, I didn't get the insurance.

41
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,171
How could you not
get the insurance?

42
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:50,802
We'll pay for the car.

43
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,009
-You're not paying for it.
-Morty.

44
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,057
God, it's so hot in here.

45
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,542
Why don't you put on
the air conditioning?

46
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:03,351
You don't need the air conditioner.
Do you have your speech all ready?

47
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:05,108
Do I have to make a speech?

48
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,894
Of course. They're giving
a testimonial for your father.

49
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,132
-You could do your comic routines.
-Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,918
That'll go over real well
with that crowd.

51
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,773
You have a lake.

52
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,856
-The lake isn't real.
-The lake is real.

53
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,614
Are you kidding? They built the lake.

54
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:21,302
But it's real, it's water.

55
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:25,076
-Where are you going with those?
-I’ll put Elaine's stuff in here.

56
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:27,101
Don't sleep in there.
Sleep in the bedroom.

57
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,860
I can't take your bedroom.

58
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,122
-I’m up at 6:00 in the morning.
-I can't kick you out of your bed.

59
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:34,294
We don't even sleep.

60
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:36,856
-Ma.
-It’s a sofa bed.

61
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,934
-You'll be uncomfortable.
-What about you?

62
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:40,282
Why should I be comfortable?

63
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,609
-What about him?
-Don't worry. He's comfortable.

64
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:45,719
I’ll sleep standing up. I’ll be fine.

65
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:50,207
-Will you stop?
-Yeah, I’ll just stay in here.

66
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,701
Jerry.

67
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,242
Jerry, you don't have to stay
on the couch on my account.

68
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:01,273
-You two can stay in there together.
-That's not a good idea.

69
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:04,127
-I thought that you--
-Not now. She's right inside.

70
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:05,667
What happened?

71
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:08,707
I don't know. We decided we
don't really work as a couple.

72
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:11,101
-What does that mean?
-Well--

73
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,124
Why are you whispering?

74
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:15,580
-Nothing, nothing.
-Elaine.

75
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,692
-What about her?
-Would you please be--?

76
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:22,085
You know, look at the
sun-dried tomatoes.

77
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,419
Where were they five years ago?

78
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,950
It just goes to show you,
you never know what--

79
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:29,347
What, you know, could happen...

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,117
...to a vegetable. It could just
take right off at any time.

81
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:38,245
We've tried all kinds
of arrangements...

82
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,028
...but we can't seem to be friends
when we sleep together.

83
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,712
Why do you need more friends?

84
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:45,343
You've got plenty of friends.

85
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:48,642
-He's an idealist.
-What are you looking for?

86
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,297
-I’m looking. I like looking.
-He likes looking.

87
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:52,994
-So look.
-But how long can you look?

88
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:55,139
I’m going for the record.

89
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:59,911
Your father wouldn't say so,
but he's really glad you came.

90
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:01,986
-Oh, come on.
-This is a big thing for him.

91
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,546
Outgoing president
of the condo association.

92
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:10,691
So they arrived safely.

93
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:13,230
-Remember Jack and Doris?
-Nice to see you.

94
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,984
-This is Elaine.
-Hi.

95
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:16,558
-Nice to meet you. Hello.
-Hello.

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,476
-Pleased to meet you.
-Hey, Jerry...

97
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,193
...you came all the way
down here for this?

98
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,637
And scuba diving.

99
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:24,719
Scuba diving?
Who's going scuba diving?

100
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,735
We're going. We'll be back in time.

101
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:28,588
What do you have to go
scuba diving for?

102
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:30,542
-For fun.
-For fun?

103
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:32,397
Jack, have some sponge cake.

104
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,218
No. Thanks, no.

105
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:36,556
Jack is emceeing tomorrow.

106
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:40,045
-He's in charge of the whole thing.
-So, Jerry, your mother tells me...

107
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,830
...you're gonna do one of your
little comedy skits tomorrow.

108
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:45,451
-I don't think so.
-No?

109
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,987
Listen, Morty, you want to
settle up for last night?

110
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:53,103
All right. I owe you $ 1 <i>9</i>.45.

111
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:55,341
What did you have?
You had the minute steak.

112
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:57,102
-Yeah.
-Did you have a Coke or what?

113
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:59,691
I did not have a Coke.

114
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:01,040
Somebody had a Coke.

115
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,124
-I had a Coke.
-Oh, and I had the scampi.

116
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,152
So, that's $ 1 7.1 0,
and the tax and the tip.

117
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:09,519
All right, make it 20 bucks.

118
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:12,950
It’s $ 1 <i>9</i>.45, Morty.

119
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,673
$ 1 <i>9</i>.45?

120
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,462
See, you know your father.

121
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:18,673
You got to get it right
to the penny.

122
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:21,296
But that's why he was
such a good president.

123
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,998
Hey, what kind of pen is that?

124
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:25,751
-This pen?
-Yeah.

125
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:28,402
Oh, this is an astronaut pen.

126
00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:31,603
It writes upside down.
They use this in space.

127
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:35,601
Oh, that's the astronaut pen. I heard
about that. Where did you get it?

128
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:39,059
-It was a gift.
-Because a lot of times I write in bed...

129
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:42,196
...and I have to turn and lean on
my elbow to make the pen work.

130
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:45,692
-Take the pen.
-Oh, no.

131
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:46,868
-Go ahead.
- I couldn't.

132
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:48,215
-Take it.
-I can't take it.

133
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,487
-Do me a personal favor.
-No, I’m not comfortable.

134
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:52,443
-I cannot take it.
-Take the pen.

135
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:55,640
-Are you sure?
-I’m positive. Take the pen.

136
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,966
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you. Gee, boy.

137
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,200
-Jack, what are you doing?
-Stop it.

138
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,993
Jack, we should go.

139
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:08,122
It was nice meeting you.

140
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:09,696
-Nice to meet you.
-Thanks again.

141
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:11,359
Come on!

142
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,409
She's adorable.

143
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:18,847
What did you take his pen for?

144
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,880
-He gave it to me.
-But you didn't have to take it.

145
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:25,182
She's gotta make a big deal
out of everything.

146
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:28,097
-He offered it to me.
-Because you made such a big fuss.

147
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,649
Well, I liked it. Should l
have said I didn't like it?

148
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,406
You shouldn't have said anything.
What did you expect?

149
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:36,323
He could have said, ''Thank you,''
and put it back in his pocket.

150
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:39,169
-He loves that pen.
-Come on.

151
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:42,084
He talks about it all the time.
He goes on and on...

152
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:44,767
...about how it writes upside down,
how astronauts use it.

153
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,560
He never should have offered it.

154
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:49,542
-He didn't think you'd accept.
-Well, he was wrong.

155
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:53,314
I know his wife.
She has some mouth on her.

156
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,742
She'll tell everyone in the condo now
that you made him give you the pen.

157
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,983
They're talking about it right now.

158
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,543
-So you want me to return it?
-Yes.

159
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:03,942
He's not gonna return that pen.
That's ridiculous.

160
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:05,698
I don't even want the pen now.

161
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:08,681
Jack can afford to give away a pen
with all his money, believe me.

162
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,331
He gives me a check for $ 1 <i>9</i>.45.

163
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,052
He didn't have a Coke.

164
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:17,643
Here, let me see it.

165
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:22,854
-Hey, it writes upside down.
-Yeah.

166
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,117
Come in.

167
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,286
You okay in here?

168
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:42,351
Why is it so hot in here?

169
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:45,226
How can they sleep like this?

170
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:46,952
It’s only for three days.

171
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,778
Today's over.
Then we have tomorrow.

172
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:51,879
We leave on Sunday.
It’s one day, really.

173
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,162
What is with this bar?

174
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:00,111
It’s right in my back. It’s killing me.

175
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:02,184
You wanna switch?
I’m on a love seat.

176
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:05,672
I got my feet up in the air
like I’m in a space capsule.

177
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,978
I am never gonna fall asleep.

178
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:10,537
Oh, no, don't say that.
You'll jinx me.

179
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:14,449
How can they not put
the air conditioning on?

180
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:16,751
They're nuts with temperature.

181
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:21,972
This bar is right in my back.

182
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:26,319
It’s making a dent.

183
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,979
How about that guy
writing a check for $ 1 <i>9</i>.45?

184
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:35,245
I’m sweating here.

185
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,055
I’m in bed, sweating.

186
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,976
It’s one day.

187
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,060
Half a day, really.

188
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:47,542
I mean, you subtract showers
and meals, it's like 20 minutes.

189
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,809
It'll go by like that.

190
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,295
Stay on <i>9</i>5 South
to Biscayne Boulevard.

191
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:56,853
Then you make a left turn.

192
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,469
Put your blinker on immediately,
there's an abutment there.

193
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:03,702
Then you're gonna merge over
very quickly, but stay on Biscayne.

194
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:05,624
Don't get off Biscayne,
you understand me?

195
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:07,675
Stay on Biscayne.

196
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,948
You're going underwater?

197
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:12,957
Yes, generally, that's where
scuba diving is done.

198
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:16,028
What do you have to go for?
What's down there that's so special?

199
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,874
What's so special up here?

200
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:22,713
What's the matter?

201
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,268
-My back.
-What happened?

202
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,847
That-- That bed.

203
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:29,343
The bar was right in my back.

204
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:31,446
I told you to let us sleep in there.

205
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:33,274
Then you would be hunched over.

206
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,761
I don't even know if
I can go scuba diving.

207
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:39,166
-You can't go?
-So stay home.

208
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:41,438
-You can go.
-Without you?

209
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:43,009
That's the reason you came down.

210
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,959
-Don't go.
-You sure?

211
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:46,399
Maybe you should see a doctor.

212
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,147
-We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
-No, we'll stay in there.

213
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:50,624
Why don't you get a new sofa?

214
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:52,930
Nobody uses it.

215
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:54,910
I’m buying you a new sofa.

216
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,418
Jerry, don't talk crazy.

217
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,467
Mrs. Seinfeld, please...

218
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:00,635
...I am begging you:

219
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:04,734
Put the air conditioner on.

220
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,664
You're hot?

221
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,472
I’ve lost six pounds.

222
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,520
I don't even know how to work it.

223
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,076
I keep telling her
it's like an oven in here.

224
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,029
Is everybody up?

225
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:22,850
Hi, how are you?

226
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:24,445
Hello, Jerry.

227
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:26,079
Evelyn, this is Elaine.

228
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:27,522
Hi, Evelyn.

229
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,140
Jerry, you got thin.

230
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:32,832
-Too thin?
-Oh, stop worrying...

231
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:34,431
...so much about how you look.

232
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:38,247
So where's the new pen?

233
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,420
-What?
-The pen.

234
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:51,523
The one Jack Klompus gave you.

235
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,252
-How did you know that?
-Blanche told me.

236
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:57,927
-Blanche?
-That's some good pen.

237
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:01,225
-Writes upside down.
-Yeah.

238
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:05,001
-The astronauts use them.
-What did Blanche say?

239
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,534
I don't know, she said
Jerry wanted the pen.

240
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:09,768
I never really wanted the pen.

241
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,725
-He gave him the pen.
-Morty.

242
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:14,474
-Why? You don't like the pen?
-No, no, l--

243
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,550
Because if you don't,
give it back to him.

244
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,575
-Is that what she said?
-Who?

245
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:20,876
-Blanche.
-What are you talking about?

246
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:25,131
Hello?

247
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:28,048
Oh, hello, Gussy. What?

248
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,407
Jerry wouldn't do that.
Jack gave it to him.

249
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,601
All he said was he liked it.

250
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:37,706
I mean, nobody put
a gun to his head.

251
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:40,364
You're giving him back that pen.

252
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:43,786
Somebody, please.

253
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:45,582
The air conditioner.

254
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,535
Oh, my God, I forgot all about it.

255
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:51,346
All I said was, ''I like the pen.''

256
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,484
How the hell do you
work this thing?

257
00:11:57,943 --> 00:12:00,213
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

258
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:02,351
Oh, no, no, I wanna go.

259
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,927
But your back hurts.

260
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:06,259
Maybe a couple of muscle
relaxers would help.

261
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:08,177
Oh, okay.

262
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:12,724
You can turn down the air
conditioning if you want.

263
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:14,580
No, I’m fine.

264
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,653
-You're not too cold?
-No.

265
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:21,846
-Don't be alarmed.
-Oh, my God.

266
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,865
-What the hell happened to you?
-I’m okay.

267
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:26,581
-My capillaries burst.
-Your capillaries?

268
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:29,268
-Do you know what you look like?
-How you doing?

269
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:31,095
Having a good time.

270
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,649
Is it my imagination
or is it freezing in here?

271
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,283
What happened to your eyes?

272
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:37,973
-Well, I started to go under--
-With the instructor?

273
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:39,603
Yeah, I got about 1 0 feet down...

274
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:42,425
...and felt this tremendous
pressure on my mask...

275
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,438
...like my eyeballs were being
sucked out of their sockets.

276
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,843
I told you.

277
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:48,565
Excuse me.

278
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,518
Doris would like to borrow
your red pocketbook...

279
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,240
...to go with her shoes.

280
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,196
The shoes have to match
the pocketbook.

281
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:58,015
What's she doing, yoga?

282
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,544
-My back hurts.
-Morty, better hurry up.

283
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:02,615
-Get ready.
-We got plenty of time.

284
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,891
-What happened?
-I got in a fistfight...

285
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:07,327
...with one of the ladies at the pool.

286
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,217
It’s from scuba diving.

287
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:10,968
What's there to see underwater?

288
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:13,154
Listen, Mr. Klompus...

289
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:17,177
...it was a nice gesture to give me
the pen, but I don't really need it.

290
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,062
-You what?
-It’s a terrific pen...

291
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,788
...but I think you should keep it.

292
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:24,095
-Well, I mean--
-Take it.

293
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,267
All right.

294
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:29,787
You know, Jack, you got a hell
of a nerve taking that kid's pen.

295
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,418
-Whose pen?
-His pen.

296
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,800
This happens to be my pen.

297
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:35,551
-You didn't give it to him?
-What are you talking about?

298
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:37,279
He practically begged me for it.

299
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,486
Where do you come off
with this crap?

300
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:42,557
Listen, do you think I take
everything everybody offers me?

301
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,644
You offered me
sponge cake yesterday.

302
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,596
-Did I take it?
-You didn't want it.

303
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,826
Of course I wanted it!
I love sponge cake.

304
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:51,650
Who said you couldn't have it?
I mean...

305
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:54,184
...what the hell do I care whether
you have sponge cake?

306
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:56,418
Because I saw the look
on your face last week...

307
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,277
...when I took the Scotch tape.

308
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,389
So you got the Scotch tape.

309
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:02,888
-I’ve been looking all over for it.
-I’ll give it back.

310
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,960
-I don't want it.
-I don't want it!

311
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:08,035
You know, Jack,
do me a favor, will you?

312
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:11,400
Take the pen and the Scotch tape
and get the hell out of here.

313
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:13,223
Listen, do you think I give a damn?

314
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:19,879
Nerve of that guy,
taking back that pen.

315
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,540
Well, that's it for them.

316
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,125
What is going on
in this community?

317
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,274
Are you people aware
of what's happening?

318
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:29,805
What is driving you
to this behavior?

319
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,105
Is it the humidity? Is it the Muzak?

320
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,094
Is it the white shoes?

321
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,088
I have no use for either one of them.
I don't want them there tonight.

322
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:39,565
Isn't he supposed to emcee?

323
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,643
Yeah, he's supposed
to be the emcee.

324
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,361
Well, this should be
a very interesting evening.

325
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:49,233
What about those muscle relaxers?

326
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,115
Say ''astronaut.''

327
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,713
Say what?

328
00:14:58,227 --> 00:15:00,267
Say what?

329
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:02,704
You took too many of those pills.

330
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,912
-Astronaut?
-Say it.

331
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:08,273
-Astronaut!
-Astro....

332
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:13,071
Good. Okay.

333
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:15,474
Last year, I took him
to the hospital every day.

334
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,548
Did he ever say thank you?

335
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,212
Oh, God.

336
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:21,041
Uncle Leo.

337
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:23,379
Hello!

338
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:27,918
-Morty, are you nervous?
-What nervous?

339
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:30,608
What's with the sunglasses?
Who are you, Van Johnson?

340
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:31,954
I got a black eye.

341
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:34,420
Hello.

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,073
Oh, Elaine...

343
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:39,151
...this is my Aunt Stella.

344
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:42,129
Stella!

345
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:46,834
Stella!

346
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:49,971
Her back hurts.

347
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:54,613
We saw you on
<i>The Tonight Show</i> last week.

348
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,333
I thought Johnny
was very rude to you.

349
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,500
-He didn't even let you talk.
-No, no.

350
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:01,978
You need some new material.

351
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:05,457
I’ve heard you do that
dog routine three times already.

352
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,663
Stella!

353
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:10,811
Stella!

354
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:15,769
You should get your cousin Jeffrey
to write some material for you.

355
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:18,488
What? Jeffrey works
for the Parks Department.

356
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:20,991
You should read
the letters he's written.

357
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:23,454
He's funnier than the
whole bunch of you.

358
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:26,330
Oh, here's Jack.
We should sit down.

359
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:32,470
This better be good.
I’m missing <i>Golden Girls</i> for this.

360
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,796
I hate her like poison.

361
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:41,756
Hey, Jack, let's get started.

362
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:50,046
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you know...

363
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:55,140
...every year, phase two
of the Pines of Mar Gables...

364
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:58,051
...honors the previous
year's president.

365
00:16:58,214 --> 00:17:00,003
And this year, we are honoring...

366
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,540
...Morty Seinfeld.

367
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,426
Morty!

368
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:09,731
A man who slept more hours
on the job than Ronald Reagan.

369
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:14,278
Slept on the job?

370
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,190
Being president of the condo
is not easy.

371
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:20,484
It requires hard work, dedication,
and commitment.

372
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:25,506
And unfortunately, he possesses
none of these qualities.

373
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:29,895
I wonder what he ever did.

374
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,947
He's joking.

375
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:35,271
His administration did
excel in one department:

376
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:37,891
The hiring of incompetents.

377
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:40,011
That's what you say.

378
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:43,107
But we do owe him
a debt of gratitude...

379
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:46,855
...because by not fixing
the crack in the sidewalk...

380
00:17:47,021 --> 00:17:51,365
...it put Mrs. Ziven out of
commission for a few weeks.

381
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,600
Tell them about when you
took my son's pen back.

382
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,393
Tell them about that.

383
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:57,899
Dad.

384
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:00,551
He gave my son a pen,
and then he takes it back.

385
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,280
-Tell them that!
-I took it back?

386
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,620
-He gave it to me!
-That's enough. Sit down.

387
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,272
-I’m not finished!
-Give me that microphone. Give it!

388
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:09,830
-Morty, give me that.
-Give him the pen.

389
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:13,549
You broke my dental plate.

390
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:15,953
Doris! He broke my dental plate.

391
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:18,285
You son of a bitch. I’ll sue you.

392
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,792
Jerry, do your act.

393
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:21,807
I can't. Nobody's even listening.

394
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,465
Well, they're all gonna leave.

395
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:26,345
-I got witnesses here.
-Even your wife is on my side.

396
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:28,555
How you folks doing tonight?

397
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:32,074
Hey, have you ever noticed how they
give you the peanuts on the planes?

398
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,962
-Not my Harry! He flies first class!
-Who thought the thing...

399
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,329
...everybody wants on a plane
is a peanut?

400
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,592
-I’d rather have a bottle of Scotch!
-Do the dog routine.

401
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:44,529
All I said was, ''I like the pen!''

402
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:50,196
Stella!

403
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:52,596
You could aggravate it.

404
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:55,246
I wouldn't go anywhere
for at least five days.

405
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,459
Five days?

406
00:18:57,624 --> 00:18:59,959
You want me to stay here
for five more days?

407
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,877
There must be some mistake.

408
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,791
I’m afraid not.

409
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,034
Five days. Here.

410
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,364
So we have you for five more days.

411
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:12,464
There's no point in me staying.
You're just gonna be--

412
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:14,129
Excuse me?

413
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,081
Nothing.

414
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,091
-Good morning.
-Hi, Evelyn.

415
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:23,283
Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?

416
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,784
-I don't think so.
-Because my nephew Larry...

417
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:27,956
...could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer.

418
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,165
He says Jack has no case.

419
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,317
I’ll ask him when he gets up.

420
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:34,333
Oh, and I spoke to Arnold...

421
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:39,062
...and he says that according to the
bylaws of the condo constitution...

422
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,454
...they need six votes to throw you out
for unruly behavior.

423
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:45,437
Not five.

424
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:48,380
Dr. Chernov is the one
you'll have to suck up to.

425
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:53,951
Oh, my back.

426
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:55,902
Oh, my back.

427
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:59,164
That bar. Who the hell
could sleep on that thing?

428
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,011
-I was very comfortable.
-Morty...

429
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:05,244
...Arnold says they need
six votes to throw you out.

430
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,818
It’s in the constitution.

431
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:09,849
-Who are you?
-I’m a chiropractor.

432
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,256
What, are you kidding me?

433
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,715
Five more days?

434
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:19,908
Well, today's almost over,
and weekdays always go by fast.

435
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:22,524
And Friday, we're leaving,
so it's like two days, really.

436
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,014
It’s like a cup of coffee.

437
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:28,284
It’ll go by like that.

438
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:32,220
Is Florida not hot and muggy
enough for these people?

439
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:33,853
They love heat.

440
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,390
lf they ever decide to
land men on the sun...

441
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:39,301
...I think these old retired guys
will be the only ones...

442
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,799
...that will be able to handle it.
They'll sit there...

443
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,256
...on the redwood benches,
washcloth on their head, going:

444
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:48,072
''I’m trying to get a sweat going.''
