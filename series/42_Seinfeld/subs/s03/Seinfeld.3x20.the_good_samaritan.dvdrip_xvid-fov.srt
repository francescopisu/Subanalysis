1
00:00:01,857 --> 00:00:03,418
The concept behind the car phone...

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,069
...speakerphone, airline phone,
portable phone...

3
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:09,275
...pay phone, cordless phone,
multiline phone...

4
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:11,103
...the phone pager, the call waiting...

5
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:15,260
...call forwarding, conferencing, speed
dialing, direct dialing and redialing...

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,017
...is that we all have
absolutely nothing to say...

7
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,120
...and we've got to talk to someone
about it right now.

8
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:24,160
Cannot wait another second.

9
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:26,183
You're at home, you're on the phone.

10
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:27,525
You're in the car making calls.

11
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,319
You get to work,
''Any messages for me?''

12
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:33,797
You gotta give people
a chance to miss you a little!

13
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:41,289
<i>It's bad enough you have a car</i>
<i>phone. You have to use the speaker?</i>

14
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:45,421
It's safer. Plus, it's more annoying
to the other person.

15
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:48,595
-Oh, look at this guy.
-What's going on?

16
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,541
A guy's trying to get in front of me,
has to ask permission. Yes.

17
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:53,777
Go ahead. Get in, get in.

18
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:57,430
-<i>Did you get a thank-you wave?</i>
-No, nothing.

19
00:00:57,593 --> 00:00:59,252
How could you not
give a thank-you wave?

20
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:02,387
Hey, buddy, where's
my thank-you wave?

21
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,984
Give me that wave!

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,569
-<i>Hey, Jerry, are you free on Friday?</i>
-Yeah, I’m free. Why?

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,965
Oh, God. I bumped into
Robin Sandusky today.

24
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,847
She asked me to have dinner
with her and her husband.

25
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:16,699
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

26
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:19,934
You won't believe what I saw.
A car just bashed into a parked car...

27
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,889
...and sped off, right on my block.

28
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:25,311
-You've got to follow that car.
-<i>What?</i>

29
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,546
-You can't let him get away with that.
-The guy could be dangerous.

30
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:32,579
-What are you, yellow?
-I’m not yellow.

31
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:36,295
Jerry, if you don't follow him,
you're yellow.

32
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,369
-Wait. He stopped. He's parking.
-<i>What?</i>

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,264
What? I can't hear you. Jerry?

34
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,656
Excuse me.

35
00:01:43,823 --> 00:01:46,410
I was driving behind you, you know...

36
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:49,424
...a few blocks back, and l--
I couldn't...

37
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:52,140
...help.... Maybe you didn't realize l--

38
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:54,380
I-- I witnessed that...

39
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,544
...your-- Your left rear tire's
a little low.

40
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,256
That can affect the performance
of the twin l-beam suspension...

41
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:06,287
...not to mention, you know,
your rack-and-pinion steering.

42
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,593
So I wound up going out
for a decaf cappuccino with her.

43
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,530
Boy, what a story.

44
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:20,061
I’m speechless, speechless.
I have no speech.

45
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,403
You know, I really liked her.
We talked, we flirted.

46
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,702
And when she'd laugh,
she'd reach out and touch my arm.

47
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:33,853
Love when they touch your arm.
I can't get enough of that.

48
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:35,811
-Me either.
-Why is that?

49
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:38,532
Let's not even analyze it.

50
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,604
-So you didn't turn her in.
-I couldn't go though with it.

51
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:44,104
-You gonna see her again?
-Friday night.

52
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:46,086
-Yeah.
-<i>It's me.</i>

53
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,659
Come on up.

54
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:52,388
By the way, Elaine does not
need to know about anything.

55
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:54,664
Hey, hey, hey.

56
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,748
I dig.

57
00:02:58,128 --> 00:02:59,755
-Oh, you dig?
-Yes.

58
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:02,475
-I see enormous potential here.
-Why?

59
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:06,189
Because great couples always have
a great story about how they met.

60
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:08,691
That's why I’ve never been in
a long-term relationship.

61
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,260
I never had a good meeting story.

62
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:12,819
I wonder if I’m nuts
for pursuing this woman at all.

63
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:14,161
I don't think so.

64
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,565
Look, she slammed
into a parked car.

65
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,927
She took no responsibility for
mutilating the property of a stranger...

66
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,873
...and then she sped off
like a criminal.

67
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:26,486
On the other hand...

68
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:29,075
...should she never be
allowed to date again?

69
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:31,898
Scratch one car and you're
forbidden to have social contact...

70
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:34,071
...for the rest of your life?

71
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,176
What am I drinking, milk?

72
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:41,147
-Hey.
-Hi.

73
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:42,494
-Sweater.
-Thank you.

74
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:45,215
So? What happened?

75
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:47,488
-With what?
-With the car.

76
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:48,833
What car?

77
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,177
The hit-and-run.

78
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:54,088
Oh, right, right, right.

79
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:55,460
Well...

80
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,634
...actually, the guy
went into Queens.

81
00:03:58,188 --> 00:03:59,366
Queens?

82
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:02,217
-You followed him over the bridge?
-Over the bridge.

83
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,652
Oh, I-- I didn't know you
went into Queens, Jerry.

84
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,142
Yeah, Queens.

85
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:09,327
So? Then what?

86
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:13,614
He gets out of the car. I said,
''Hey, buddy, I saw you hit that car.''

87
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,372
So he says to me:

88
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,580
''What are you gonna do about it?''

89
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:20,619
So I said to him,
''Whatever's necessary.''

90
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,036
I am speechless.

91
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,240
I am without speech.

92
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:31,249
Tell her about the shoving.

93
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:35,927
What?

94
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:38,843
What shoving?

95
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:41,499
-Oh, it was nothing.
-No.

96
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:43,638
Tell her.

97
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,814
Come on. Tell me.

98
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,190
Well, he kind of lost his temper...

99
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,843
...and he was pushing me
up against the car...

100
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:53,730
...so I went into a karate stance.

101
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,359
-You know karate?
-I know a little.

102
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,627
Well, l-- This is so amazing to me.

103
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,582
Jerry, what did he do?

104
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:06,634
He backed off.

105
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,641
He was pretty pathetic, actually.

106
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,032
Hey.

107
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:15,844
-Did you tell Kramer?
-No.

108
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,739
What, what? Tell me.

109
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:21,576
Jerry saw this guy smash into a car,
and he followed him.

110
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:24,303
Good for you.

111
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,248
What kind of a sick lowlife
would do a thing like that?

112
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,162
You know, those people,
you know they're mentally disturbed.

113
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:32,148
They should be sent to Australia.

114
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,376
-Australia?
-That's where England...

115
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,006
...used to send their convicts.

116
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:39,763
-But not anymore.
-No.

117
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,786
Hey, Kramer?

118
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:46,679
Kramer.

119
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:50,105
-What happened to you right here?
-I don't know.

120
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:54,079
You know, I was watching
<i>Entertainment Tonight...</i>

121
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,958
...and suddenly, you know,
I got dizzy...

122
00:05:57,121 --> 00:06:00,636
...and the next thing I know,
I hit my head on the coffee table.

123
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,012
-Well, that is-- That is strange.
-Yeah, it's....

124
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:11,074
All right. Oh, Jerry, we're still on
for Friday night, right?

125
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,761
Oh, Friday. No, I can't.
I’m sorry. I have a date.

126
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:18,145
-But last night you said you were free.
-We just met.

127
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:21,218
You know, maybe it was
a reaction to the sardines.

128
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,531
I-- I can't go alone.

129
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:24,970
Ask George to go with you.

130
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,490
George, come on. I’ll pay for you.

131
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:29,834
You'll pay? I’m there.

132
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,504
-Why do you need anybody?
-Because...

133
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:37,872
...I hate being at a table alone
with a married couple...

134
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:41,779
...talking about their married friends
and their married furniture.

135
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:45,009
They're always trying to make me
feel like their life is so much better.

136
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:47,762
You know, I have a very exciting life.

137
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:49,718
It’s very exciting.

138
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:53,809
You went out with a bullfighter?

139
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,854
Yeah, yeah.
Well, an ex-bullfighter now.

140
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,607
-Wow.
-What was his name?

141
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:03,223
His name? His name was-- Was...

142
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:06,110
...Eduardo...

143
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:08,608
...Caroccio.

144
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:11,167
Pass the salt, please.

145
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,025
Where did you meet him?

146
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:15,011
Actually, I met him in Switzerland...

147
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,181
...and he was fighting....

148
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,385
Is that the word they use, ''fighting''?
They don't really fight the bull.

149
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:21,828
They avoid fighting the bull.

150
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:26,626
Bread.

151
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,358
Oh, I just love meeting
new people, you know?

152
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:35,176
That's how you really
do learn about life.

153
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:42,828
-God bless you.
-Thank you.

154
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:47,309
I wasn't gonna say anything, but l
saw he wasn't gonna open his mouth.

155
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:52,303
You know who's a good actor?
Anthony Quinn.

156
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,128
Oh, Anthony Quinn. Fine actor.

157
00:07:54,294 --> 00:07:56,532
But from what I understand,
not a very good driver.

158
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,231
Hits everything on the road,
but always leaves a note.

159
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:03,154
Did you ever see <i>Zorba the Greek</i>?

160
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:04,697
Excellent film. In fact...

161
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,835
...Quinn said he never felt so good...

162
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,426
...as when he left a note
after smacking into a car.

163
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:12,021
Come here.

164
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,978
Really, I was only kidding around.

165
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,551
He was only joking, Michael.

166
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:18,266
You think you're special
because you say, ''God bless you''?

167
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:22,297
I don't think I’m special. My mother
always said I’m not special.

168
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,566
He was only joking, Michael.

169
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,773
-I’m sorry.
-Oh, right.

170
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,114
-Take his side!
-I’m not taking his side.

171
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,536
-Well, whose side are you taking?
-Well, I’m not taking your side!

172
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,278
Kirk Douglas. Now, there's
another very bad driver.

173
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:47,973
But he's such an unbelievable guy...

174
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:50,183
...when he hits someone,
he doesn't leave a note.

175
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:52,742
He sits in his car
and waits for the other person...

176
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:55,980
...so he can exchange license,
registration and apologize.

177
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,590
I said, ''God bless you.''
Was that so wrong?

178
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,253
The question is...

179
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:08,660
...did you allow a space...

180
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:11,476
...for the husband to come in
with his ''God bless you''?

181
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:14,326
Because as the husband,
he has the right of first refusal.

182
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:18,870
-Yeah.
-<i>It's me.</i>

183
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:20,728
-Come on up.
-Yes.

184
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,683
Yes. I definitely waited.

185
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:24,156
But let me say this.

186
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,360
Once he passes on that option...

187
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:29,147
...that ''God bless you''
is up for grabs.

188
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:32,795
No argument, unless she's
one of these multiple sneezers...

189
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:35,298
...and he's holding his
''God bless you'' in abeyance...

190
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,370
...until she completes the series.

191
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:41,062
I don't think she is
a multiple sneezer...

192
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:44,093
...because she sneezed again later
and it was also a single.

193
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,210
What if she's having an off night?

194
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:51,050
-Hi.
-Hi.

195
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,389
Well.

196
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:54,596
lf it isn't Mr. Gesundheit.

197
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:57,100
Oh, yeah. Like there's
something wrong...

198
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:58,855
...with saying, ''God bless you.''

199
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:01,227
I was raised to say, ''God bless you.''

200
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:03,311
Shut up.

201
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:06,828
What does it mean anyway,
''God bless you''?

202
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:09,581
It’s a stupid ''stuperstition.''

203
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:11,308
A stupid what?

204
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:13,807
Whatever.

205
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:17,684
You wanna make a person feel better,
you shouldn't say, ''God bless you.''

206
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:20,980
You should say,
''You're so good-looking.''

207
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:28,438
Yeah. Yeah. That's better
than ''God bless you.''

208
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,600
Anyway, she left a message on my
machine. She wants you to call her.

209
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,036
-Who?
-Robin.

210
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,378
Why?

211
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:39,392
Well, I assume she called to
apologize. That's why she called me.

212
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:40,698
<i>Entertainment Tonight</i> is on.

213
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:42,557
-Where's the phone?
-Bedroom.

214
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:45,593
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater
for me, would you?

215
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,166
<i>Georgia peach Marla Maples</i>
<i>reportedly threw...</i>

216
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,778
<i>...yet another stiletto heel at</i>--

217
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,256
What's it like out?

218
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:03,143
It’s chilly out.

219
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,757
Should I take a sweater?

220
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:09,607
Yeah. You could take
a sweater if you want.

221
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:11,237
A scarf?

222
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:15,402
No. Hey, shut this off.
Shut it off.

223
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:21,233
-What's the matter? What's going on?
-What happened?

224
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:23,470
-What?
-I think I hit my head again.

225
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:26,256
-What is wrong?
-Hey, hey, wait a minute.

226
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,917
Let me ask you something, Kramer.

227
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,911
The last time you hit your head,
was Mary Hart on TV?

228
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:35,991
-Yeah.
-That is it!

229
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,716
-What?
-That is it!

230
00:11:37,883 --> 00:11:40,186
Mary Hart's voice! Don't you see?

231
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:42,554
There's something
about Mary Hart's voice...

232
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:44,377
...that's giving you seizures.

233
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:47,261
Just like-- Just like-- Just like
that woman in Albany!

234
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,018
Mary Hart!

235
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:51,455
-Oh, my God.
-What?

236
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,882
Well, she apologized,
and she wanted to know...

237
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:56,354
...if we could get together
Wednesday afternoon.

238
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,135
-Get together?
-Maybe she just wants to talk to me.

239
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,829
Married women don't get together.

240
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:02,559
They have affairs.

241
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:05,313
Oh, my God, an affair.

242
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:07,042
It’s so adult.

243
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,736
It’s like with stockings and martinis
and William Holden and....

244
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:18,892
On the other hand, it probably
wouldn't cost me any money.

245
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:23,080
Are you actually considering this?

246
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:25,932
I can't have an affair with a married
woman. That's despicable!

247
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:29,128
It’s like hitting a car and driving away
without leaving a note.

248
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,954
Yeah.

249
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,293
Hey, you know who owns that car?

250
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,534
-What car?
-The one that was hit the other night.

251
00:12:35,702 --> 00:12:38,191
-Yeah, who?
-That blond across the street.

252
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,393
The one with the long ponytail,
she wears those blue sweatpants.

253
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,617
The blond with the blue sweatpants.

254
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:48,501
Yeah, I think I’ve seen her.

255
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:51,639
Well, I gotta get going.

256
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,588
I’m meeting a guy
with gray sweatpants.

257
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:01,017
Wait, wait, wait. How do
you know it's not John Tesh?

258
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:06,368
-The blond with the blue sweatpants!
-Who is she?

259
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:09,435
I had a crush on her for a year!
I’ve been afraid to approach her.

260
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,613
She belongs on one of these
Hallmark cards.

261
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:14,817
Oh, right! Right!
The blue sweatpants!

262
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:18,467
It’s too bad you can't say
anything because of Angela.

263
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:21,796
Yeah.

264
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:24,997
Too bad.

265
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:31,428
Angela.

266
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,026
Lousy thug.

267
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,710
What kind of sick person
does something like that?

268
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:40,079
The woman belongs in prison!

269
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:44,235
I mean, I actually owe it to society
to do something about this!

270
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:46,675
I can't sit by and allow this to go on!

271
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:50,134
-It’s a moral issue, is what it is.
-Can't compromise your principles.

272
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:51,757
-How can I live?
-Can't live.

273
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:54,198
I’m not religious, but I know
where to draw the line.

274
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:56,217
This country needs
more people like you.

275
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,583
Don't sell yourself short,
saying, ''God bless you''...

276
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:02,010
...to every Tom, Dick and Harry,
at great personal risk.

277
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:06,235
-I believe strongly in that. You know.
-There should be more people like us.

278
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:09,334
That's why the world's
in the shape that it's in.

279
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:11,414
You're telling me.

280
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:19,644
I just want you to know
I’m gonna do everything I can...

281
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:22,432
...to make sure the party responsible
is made responsible...

282
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:24,093
...or something very close to that.

283
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,306
Well, God bless you.

284
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,125
Thank you very much.

285
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:37,192
Oh, my God. I must be crazy.
What have I done?

286
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:39,911
-Oh, no. What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

287
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:42,792
I’ll tell you what's wrong.
I just committed adultery.

288
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:45,582
You didn't commit adultery. I did.

289
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:49,192
Oh, yeah.

290
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,174
lf I didn't do it with you,
I would have done it someone else.

291
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,723
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that.
There's a lot of losers out there.

292
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,592
Maybe even someone who didn't say,
''God bless you.''

293
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,483
Well, that's a given.

294
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:05,300
In three years with Michael,
not one ''God bless you.''

295
00:15:06,394 --> 00:15:08,599
Must be hell living in that house.

296
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:13,242
-<i>Hi, it's Michael.</i>
-Hi, Michael.

297
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:16,472
-<i>Is Robin there?</i>
-Robin? No, why?

298
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,511
<i>She said she was gonna be with you.</i>

299
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,551
No, I haven't spoken to her all da--

300
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:25,784
Yeah, right.

301
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,898
As a-- As a matter of fact....

302
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:31,998
She-- She was here and she--
She left a note...

303
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:36,575
...but l-- I wasn't here, but l--
I have the note right here.

304
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:38,913
<i>If she's not with you, where is she?</i>

305
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,772
Well, I-- I don't know.

306
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:44,419
<i>Is she with your bald friend</i>
<i>from the other night?</i>

307
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,502
No. No.

308
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:49,091
Come on, Michael.

309
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:53,513
<i>He's finished. I'm gonna</i>
<i>sew his ass to his face!</i>

310
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,451
<i>I'm gonna twist his neck so hard</i>
<i>his lips will be his eyebrows!</i>

311
00:15:57,617 --> 00:16:00,967
<i>I'm gonna break his joints</i>
<i>and reattach them!</i>

312
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:05,131
You're so good-looking.

313
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:10,604
Now, you listen to me, suck-face!

314
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,727
You tell anybody anything...

315
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,988
...and I will carve my initials
in your brain tissue.

316
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:18,544
-Let me rephrase--
-I’ll bash your skull in...

317
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:22,099
...like a bad cabbage,
and I’ll have a party on your head!

318
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:26,454
-Elaine. This is Angela.
-I’ll pluck your body hairs out...

319
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:28,477
...with my teeth!

320
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,524
Well, I think I get the gist of it.

321
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:32,990
So you don't say anything
to anybody...

322
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:35,259
...about me hitting that car.

323
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,052
What car?

324
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,005
Good.

325
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:42,271
-I’m glad we understand each other.
-It’s not complicated.

326
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,120
Very nice meeting you.

327
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:53,190
Come on up.

328
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:57,831
Well, well, Mr. Seinfeld...

329
00:16:57,996 --> 00:17:00,812
...that must have been
so frightening...

330
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:04,139
...when you confronted
that guy in Queens.

331
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,671
Now, let me just see
if I’ve got the scenario right.

332
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:08,873
-All right, Elaine.
-No, no, no...

333
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,180
...because I’m picturing....
What? What?

334
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:13,071
<i>French Connection</i> kind of thing.

335
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:16,051
You know, sort of a Popeye Doyle
chase through the city.

336
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:18,449
-It was just a couple of blocks.
-Oh, no, no.

337
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,556
Come on. Don't be so modest.

338
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,341
-Hey.
-Oh.

339
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:25,935
Did you check your machine?

340
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:28,015
No. Why? What's happened?

341
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,448
Michael called me today,
and he asked me where Robin was.

342
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,808
-Yeah, okay.
-And I said I hadn't seen her.

343
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:37,941
-What?
-No, George, you don't understand.

344
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,533
She didn't tell me she was
using me as an excuse.

345
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,547
Okay? But then I realized
what was going on...

346
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:46,528
...and I said that she left a note.

347
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:48,825
But he didn't really buy that.

348
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:51,418
And then-- And then
he did mention your name.

349
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:54,464
He mentioned my name?
What did he say?

350
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:57,892
He said he was gonna...

351
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:01,472
...sew your ass to your face.

352
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:03,872
What?

353
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,426
-Why couldn't you think of something?
-I don't know! He caught me off guard!

354
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:09,669
You lie! How hard is it to lie!

355
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:11,365
It’s not that hard.

356
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,400
Well, who told you
to sleep with her, George?

357
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,455
Not my fault.
I wasn't gonna do anything...

358
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:21,066
...until you got her juiced up with your
story about the affair with the matador!

359
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,683
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't said, ''God bless you''!

360
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:28,017
-Don't start.
-Hold it, hold it, hold it, people.

361
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,092
-Matador?
-Oh, god.

362
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:31,921
What matador?

363
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,094
She told them she had
an affair with a matador.

364
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:35,638
A matador.

365
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,743
Well, well.

366
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,334
Pray tell, what was
the young man's name?

367
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,094
Eduardo Caroccio.

368
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:54,968
Eduardo...

369
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:57,626
...Caroccio.

370
00:18:58,018 --> 00:19:01,697
That's good. That's very good.
Kind of just rolls off the tongue.

371
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,822
Where on the Upper West Side
might a single girl meet a matador?

372
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,518
-Perhaps, Zabar's.
-No.

373
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:10,241
Or Ray's Pizza.

374
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:16,162
This person told me to tell you
to get an estimate on the damage.

375
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:20,107
I already got an estimate. It’s $8 75.

376
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:22,342
$8 75?

377
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:24,295
That's right.

378
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,046
Well, I’ll tell you what.

379
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:31,146
I’ll give you a check, and then
this person can pay me back.

380
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:34,186
Who do I make it out to?

381
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:37,969
Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.

382
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,549
So, what are you doing this weekend?

383
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:43,503
You have got some nerve.

384
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:45,777
You smash up my car,
you don't admit it...

385
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:47,406
...and now you want to ask me out?

386
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:50,393
-l didn't do it!
-Yeah, right.

387
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:53,362
You are so good-looking.

388
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:55,026
Thank you.

389
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,890
Jerry, let's go. You ready?

390
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:03,609
You really want to do this?
I’m on the road for three weeks.

391
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:06,778
Excuse me, I’ve got a maniac
stalking me. I’m not staying in the city.

392
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:10,462
-All right.
-Come on, let's get out of here.

393
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,107
How could you?

394
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:16,896
-What?
-I never thought you were capable.

395
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:19,267
-What did I do?
-I talked to Becky Gelke outside.

396
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:20,708
She told me you hit and ran.

397
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:24,167
I don't even want to
look at you anymore!

398
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,680
All these years of friendship, and
you're-- You're nothing but a felon!

399
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,892
You're an embarrassment
to the building.

400
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,056
I didn't do it. I just had to pay her
to cover for somebody else.

401
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:37,162
-You're not gonna lie to me, are you?
-No. Never.

402
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:39,849
All right. I’m glad we got that
straightened out...

403
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:41,905
...because I got a date with her.

404
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:46,347
You got a date with Becky Gelke?

405
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:49,100
-I’m going out with her Saturday.
-Can we get out of here?

406
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:52,467
lf it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
had an excuse to talk to her.

407
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,374
Well, I’m happy to help
in any way that I can.

408
00:21:13,664 --> 00:21:17,560
A man is paralyzed, mentally,
by a beautiful woman.

409
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,487
Advertisers really
take advantage of this.

410
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:22,205
Don't you love ads where
you see the woman in the bikini...

411
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:24,926
...next to the 32-piece ratchet set,
you know, and she's...?

412
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:26,850
We'll be looking at the girl...

413
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:31,489
...looking at the ratchet set going, ''All
right, if she's next to the ratchet set...

414
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,554
...and I had that ratchet set...

415
00:21:35,722 --> 00:21:38,953
...I wonder if that
would mean that....''

416
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:44,907
''I better just buy that ratchet set.''
