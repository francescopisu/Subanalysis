1
00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:03,749
It seems the way they
design the car alarms...

2
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:09,035
...is so that the car will behave as if it
was a nervous, hysterical person.

3
00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:13,192
Anyone goes near it,
anyone disturbs it, it's:

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,208
Lights flashing on and off,
acting all crazy.

5
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:18,955
Not everyone wants to draw
that much attention to themselves.

6
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:21,709
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a car alarm that was more subtle?

7
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,877
Maybe just, you know, somebody
tries to break in, and it goes:

8
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:31,892
''Excuse me?''

9
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:34,997
I would like a car alarm like that.

10
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:42,357
Do you believe this?

11
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,088
Car was parked right out front.

12
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:47,006
-Was the alarm on?
-I don't know. I guess it was on.

13
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:51,165
I don't know my alarm sound.
I’m not tuned into it like it's my son.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,338
I don't understand. How do
these thieves start the car?

15
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:57,667
-They cross the wires or something.
-Cross the wires?

16
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,971
I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.

17
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:02,340
-Hey.
-They stole my car.

18
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:04,578
-Who did?
-They did.

19
00:01:04,747 --> 00:01:06,570
Was it more than just one?

20
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,194
What should I do?
Call the police?

21
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:10,921
What are they gonna do?

22
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:15,082
You know, I’d better call the car-phone
company, cancel my service.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,769
Maybe you should
call your car phone.

24
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,826
Yeah.

25
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:22,127
He's probably driving it right now.

26
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:25,163
Wait a minute. Call the car phone.
See what happens.

27
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:27,026
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, go ahead. Call.

28
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,974
I don't even know if l
remember the number.

29
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,239
What do I say if he picks up?

30
00:01:33,402 --> 00:01:35,159
-<i>Hello.</i>
-Hello.

31
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:40,508
-Is this 555-8383?
-<i>I have no idea.</i>

32
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,809
-Can I ask you a question?
-<i>Sure.</i>

33
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:46,171
-Did you steal my car?
-<i>Yes, I did.</i>

34
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:50,041
-You did?
-<i>I did.</i>

35
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:53,890
-But that's my car.
-<i>I didn't know it was yours.</i>

36
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:57,668
-What are you gonna do with it?
-<i>I don't know. Drive around.</i>

37
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:01,215
-Then can I have it back?
-<i>No, I'm gonna keep it.</i>

38
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:04,420
Let me talk to him.
Give it, give it, give it.

39
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,364
-Hello.
-<i>Yeah, who's this?</i>

40
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:09,955
-Kramer.
-<i>Hello, Kramer.</i>

41
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:13,838
Listen, there's a pair of gloves
in the glove compartment.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,407
<i>Wait, hold it.</i>

43
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:19,017
-<i>Brown ones?</i>
-Yeah.

44
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:21,873
Could you mail those to me?
Or bring them by my building.

45
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:25,267
-It's 129 West 81 st Street.
- <i>1 29.... Okay.</i>

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,077
All right, thanks a lot.
Here's Jerry.

47
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,359
Gloves.

48
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:35,288
-Hello.
-<i>Jerry.</i>

49
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:40,535
Yeah. Let me ask you a question.
How do you cross those wires?

50
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,711
<i>I didn't cross any wires.</i>
<i>The keys were in it.</i>

51
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,705
Sid left the keys in the car.
All right, I gotta go. Drive carefully.

52
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,093
<i>Hey, Jerry, when's the last time you</i>
<i>had a tune-up? Because I can't find</i>--

53
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:55,012
-Sid left the keys in the car.
-Who's Sid?

54
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,380
Guy in the neighborhood.
He parks cars on the block.

55
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,749
-What do you mean?
-He moves them from side to side...

56
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,282
-...so you don't get a ticket.
-You pay him for that?

57
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:05,322
-Yeah. Like 50 bucks a month.
-How many people does he do it for?

58
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,933
-The whole block, 40, 50 cars.
-He only works three hours a day.

59
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:13,032
He makes a fortune. He's been
doing that for years, right, Jerry?

60
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,766
Could anybody do that?

61
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:18,094
-Hey, Sid. What happened?
-I’m sorry, Jerry.

62
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,853
Maybe I’m too old for this stuff.

63
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,646
You left the keys in the car?

64
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:24,335
Well, they're making that
Woody Allen movie on the block...

65
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,286
...and all those people
and trucks everywhere...

66
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:29,620
...and when I saw him,
I must've been distracted.

67
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:31,858
-You know I’m in that movie.
-You're what?

68
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:34,133
-Yeah, I’m an extra.
-How'd you get that?

69
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,597
Well, I was just watching them film
yesterday, and some guy asked me.

70
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:41,020
-Right out of the clear blue sky?
-Clear blue sky.

71
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,152
-Why didn't they ask me?
-I got a quality.

72
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:49,213
-Hey, Jerry, you got insurance, right?
-Yeah, but no car. I’ll have to rent one.

73
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,869
I’m going to visit my sister
in Virginia next Wednesday...

74
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:53,795
...for a week, so I can't park it.

75
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,585
-This Wednesday?
-No, next Wednesday.

76
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,962
Week after this Wednesday.

77
00:03:57,128 --> 00:04:00,359
But the Wednesday two days
from now is the next Wednesday.

78
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,684
lf I meant this Wednesday,
I would've said this Wednesday.

79
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:06,536
It's the week after this Wednesday.

80
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,821
Sid, who's gonna move the cars
while you're away?

81
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:13,448
Whoever wants to move them.
What do I care who moves them?

82
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,211
They can move themselves
if they want.

83
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,484
Maybe I could move them
until you get back.

84
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:21,330
What's a young man like you want
to move cars for? You don't work?

85
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,436
I’m in a transition phase right now.

86
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:26,486
Well, if you want to move the cars,
move the cars.

87
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:30,163
-Just don't forget to take the keys out.
-All right.

88
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:36,570
Hello. Yeah, the defroster's
the one on the bottom.

89
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,004
Just slide it all the way over.

90
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,082
You're welcome.

91
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,933
I’m in awe of his intellect.
When he talks, it sounds like...

92
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:47,711
-...he's reading from one of his novels.
-Owen March. I never heard of him.

93
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:51,354
-Well, he's not a baseball player.
-Yeah, that's true.

94
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,389
-It sounds like it's going pretty good.
-Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.

95
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,982
-What's that?
-He's 66 years old.

96
00:04:58,153 --> 00:05:00,609
Next, please.

97
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,502
Go. Go. She--

98
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:04,196
Go. Come on.

99
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:05,826
Can I help you? Name, please.

100
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:11,402
Seinfeld. I made a reservation
for a midsize, and she's a small.

101
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,085
-I’m kidding around, of course.
-Yes.

102
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:16,844
Okay, let's see here.

103
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:21,204
-Sixty-six years old?
-Yeah, well, he's in perfect health.

104
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:24,050
He works out. He's vibrant.
You'd really like him.

105
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:28,146
Why do people always say that? I hate
everybody. Why would I like him?

106
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:30,616
Could you go out
with a 66-year-old woman?

107
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:34,643
Well, I’ll tell you, she would
have to be really vibrant.

108
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:38,589
So vibrant she'd be spinning.

109
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:42,454
I’m sorry. We have no midsize
available at the moment.

110
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,731
I made a reservation.
Do you have my reservation?

111
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:47,649
Yes, we do.
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

112
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:50,850
But the reservation
keeps the car here.

113
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:53,153
That's why you have
the reservation.

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,031
-I know why we have reservations.
-I don't think you do.

115
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:03,048
lf you did, I’d have a car.

116
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,069
See, you know how to take
the reservation.

117
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,580
You just don't know how to hold
the reservation.

118
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:13,512
And that's really the most important
part of the reservation, the holding.

119
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:17,197
Anybody can just take them.

120
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:20,177
Let me speak with my supervisor.

121
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:22,678
Well, here we go.

122
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,749
The supervisor.

123
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,677
-Know what she's saying over there?
-What?

124
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,713
''Hey, Marge, see those two people?
They think I’m talking to you.

125
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:33,180
So you pretend like you're talking
to me. Okay, now you start talking.''

126
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,638
''You mean like this? So it looks like I’m
saying something, but I’m not.''

127
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,004
''Say something else,
and they won't yell at me...

128
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,439
...because they thought
I was checking with you.''

129
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,025
''Okay, I think that's enough.
See you later.''

130
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,814
I’m sorry. My supervisor says
there's nothing we can do.

131
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,118
Yeah, it looked like you were in
a real conversation over there.

132
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:52,710
Well, we do have a compact
if you would like that.

133
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,727
-Fine.
-All right.

134
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:58,469
Well, we have a blue Ford Escort
for you, Mr. Seinfeld.

135
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:01,092
-Would you like insurance?
-Yeah, give me the insurance...

136
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,262
...because I am gonna beat
the hell out of this thing.

137
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,572
Please fill this out.

138
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:13,326
Do you think
I’m making a big mistake?

139
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,859
lf you enjoy being with him,
that's what's important.

140
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,212
I love being with him.
I mean, I like being with him.

141
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,994
It’s okay being with him.

142
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,221
-I just don't enjoy being with him.
-Well, that's what important.

143
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,427
I’m meeting him for lunch
at Chadway's.

144
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:32,913
Do I have to break up face to face,
or can I just do it over the phone?

145
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,094
-How many times have you been out?
-Seven.

146
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,113
Face to face.

147
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,167
Seven dates is
a face-to-face breakup?

148
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,200
lf it was six, I could've let you go.

149
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:46,304
But seven, I’m afraid,
is over the limit.

150
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:49,438
Unless, of course, there was no sex.

151
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:56,640
How's the pasta over there?

152
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,902
What is going on out there?

153
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,241
I need a bucket of water.
I got a car overheating.

154
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:04,869
I got an alarm that won't go off.

155
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,178
I’m pressing one.
I’m pressing two. Nothing.

156
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:09,352
What do I do? Help me. Help me.

157
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,929
They were supposed to do
my scene today.

158
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:20,469
-Today?
-Yeah.

159
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:24,178
They said they wanted me to walk down
the block carrying this bag of groceries.

160
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:28,340
So I start to walk, and I trip.
And the grocery bag goes flying...

161
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,542
-...and Woody starts laughing.
-He was laughing?

162
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,875
Oh, yeah. He was drinking something.
It started to come out of his nose.

163
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,528
-So then what?
-Well, I got a line in the movie!

164
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:39,868
-Get out!
-That's great.

165
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:43,775
You got a line
in a Woody Allen movie?

166
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,839
-Pretty good, huh?
-You're in the movie?

167
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:51,455
-Is he in the scene?
-Yeah, it's me and him.

168
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:53,479
I might have a new career
on my hands, huh?

169
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:56,643
You mean ''a career.''

170
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,222
-So was Mia Farrow there?
-I didn't see him.

171
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,760
-What's your line?
-Well, okay, I’m there with Woody...

172
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:10,346
...you know. I’m at this bar,
and, you know, it's Woody Allen.

173
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:12,817
-Did I mention that?
-We got it. We got it.

174
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,981
And I’m sitting there with Woody,
and I turn to him and I go:

175
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,283
Boy, these pretzels
are making me thirsty.

176
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:25,168
-Is that how you're gonna say it?
-No, no. I’m working on it.

177
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,193
Do it like this.

178
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:30,969
-These pretzels are making me thirsty.
-No.

179
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:36,154
-These pretzels are making me thirsty.
-No, no. See, that's no good.

180
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,492
You don't know how to act.

181
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:40,633
These pretzels...

182
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,263
...are making me thirsty!

183
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:50,052
-That was no good?
-I didn't say anything.

184
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,519
All right, I’m gonna go
break up with Owen.

185
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:56,578
What was wrong with that?
I had a different interpretation.

186
00:09:56,748 --> 00:09:58,887
Do you know anything
about this pretzel guy?

187
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:00,875
Maybe he's been in the bar
a long time...

188
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:03,974
...and he's really depressed because
he has no job, and no woman...

189
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:05,868
...and he's parking cars for a living!

190
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:09,350
All right! All right!
Shut up! Shut up!

191
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:14,675
I hear you! I’m coming down!
These pretzels are making me thirsty!

192
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,681
Yeah!

193
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:24,408
Oh, my God.

194
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,093
Call an ambulance.

195
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,563
Boy, he took it hard.

196
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:33,595
We were walking down the block...

197
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,543
...I was about to break up with him,
then he started to twitch.

198
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:40,122
Yes, I need an ambulance at 1 2<i>9</i>
West 81 st Street, Apartment 5A.

199
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,397
-Tell them to hurry. Hurry!
-It’s an ambulance.

200
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:47,296
I don't know, but he's unconscious.

201
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,306
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

202
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,185
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

203
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:56,202
-Kramer.
-What happened here?

204
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,819
I don't know. What should we do?
We called an ambulance.

205
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:01,608
-Anyone know first aid?
-Do something with the extremities.

206
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:03,498
-What extremities?
-What's an extremity?

207
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,519
You raise the feet,
get blood to the head.

208
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,591
You raise the head,
get blood to the feet.

209
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:10,251
Okay, what about a cold compress?
They always do that.

210
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,045
-I don't have a washcloth.
-Use a paper towel.

211
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,832
-You can't put that on his head.
-What about a big sponge?

212
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:16,909
-How you gonna hold it on there?
-Use a belt.

213
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:20,463
No, no, no. That'll--
It'll drip all over him.

214
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,838
-Should we walk him around?
-I’ve seen them do that.

215
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:25,425
-That's for a drug overdose.
-Maybe that's what he's got.

216
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:28,117
No, I just had lunch with him.
He didn't leave the table.

217
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:31,003
Well, he could've dropped acid
when you weren't looking.

218
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:33,855
He is not a drug addict.

219
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:36,767
Maybe he's diabetic. He might
just need a cookie or something.

220
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,265
-A cookie!
-Can you give him a cookie?

221
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:42,494
-How's he gonna chew it?
-Move his teeth. Worked for my uncle.

222
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,248
The sugar revived him.

223
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:49,602
Careful, you're getting crumbs
all over him.

224
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:52,646
I’ve got him chewing, but I don't
think he's gonna swallow.

225
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:55,812
Let's put a few cookies in a
blender and he could drink it.

226
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,600
-Cookies don't liquefy.
-They do. You can liquefy a cookie.

227
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:01,156
-I’ll get the blender.
-I don't have a blender.

228
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:03,750
-You've got a blender.
-I’d know if I had a blender.

229
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:06,606
Where is the ambulance?!

230
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,654
Hello, yes. I called for an ambulance
like 35 minutes ago.

231
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,712
I can't believe
what's going on out here.

232
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,874
This is an emergency.
What's taking so long?

233
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,962
Wait a second.
Maybe that's them.

234
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,400
-Hello.
-<i>Paramedics.</i>

235
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:28,183
Come on up. Okay, they're here.

236
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,894
He seems to be breathing.

237
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:37,944
You know, I’ve got to tell you,
he's a pretty good-looking guy.

238
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:39,326
I know.

239
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:42,078
Those eyebrows could use a trimming.
You ever mention that?

240
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:44,002
Almost.

241
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,623
I mean, because, come on,
they're running wild there.

242
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,992
-It’s not an easy thing to bring up.
-Yeah, that's true.

243
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,293
You should see his bathrobe, man.
It’s all silk.

244
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:55,143
Yeah. Does he wear slippers.
I bet he wears slippers.

245
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,626
-He does. How'd you know that?
-I could tell.

246
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:02,090
What happened?
What took you so long?

247
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:04,297
We got here 20 minutes ago,
but we couldn't move.

248
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:07,282
The intersection is gridlocked.
I’ve never seen anything like it.

249
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:10,793
Finally we make the turn, and this guy
who was triple-parking cars...

250
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:14,448
-...slammed into us with a blue Escort.
-Blue Escort?

251
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:16,853
-That's my rent-a-car!
-Oh, man.

252
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:18,162
What happened to the car?

253
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:21,560
I’m sorry. You don't know
what's going on out there!

254
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:22,705
Who's he?

255
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,436
-This guy I’m seeing.
-What happened?

256
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:28,403
-We don't know.
-Who put cookies in his mouth?

257
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,423
-Cookies?
-You're not supposed to do that.

258
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:34,236
-So how'd you hit the car?
-I was moving it across the street.

259
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:37,305
I looked up and I saw Woody Allen.
I got all distracted.

260
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:40,924
-It’s not even my car. It’s a rental.
-What are you doing out there?

261
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:43,199
You're holding up the production
of the movie.

262
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,473
We can't shoot, and Woody,
he's really mad at you.

263
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,942
Woody mentioned me?
What did he say?

264
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:51,555
He said, ''Who's the moron who's got
the street all screwed up?''

265
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:53,637
Should I apologize to Woody?

266
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,332
All right, I’ll tell you what.

267
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:59,659
Next time I talk to him,
maybe I’ll bring it up.

268
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,088
I’ll feel him out.

269
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:06,353
What do you think first aid was like
hundreds of years ago?

270
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,338
I mean, they had no medicine,
no drugs...

271
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,047
...no technology, no equipment.
Basically, they were there first.

272
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:15,030
That was it. That was the whole
first aid. They sit with you.

273
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:17,167
That's all they could do.
''Can you help me?''

274
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:20,372
''No, we can't help you,
but we were the first ones here.

275
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:23,704
Did you see our truck?
'First aid.' That's our motto.

276
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,430
We show up before anybody.''

277
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,453
You didn't say you didn't
know how to drive.

278
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:30,616
-Should've mentioned that.
-Well, I know how to drive.

279
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:32,607
Then how did all those cars
get damaged?

280
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,033
Why are people calling me up,
screaming on the phone?

281
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:39,011
-Most of them canceled out on me.
-Can I get anybody anything?

282
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:41,029
Moving cars from one side
to the other...

283
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,257
...don't take no more sense
than putting on a pair of pants.

284
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:48,387
My question to you is:
Who's putting your pants on?

285
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:51,586
-I put my pants on, Sid.
-I don't believe you.

286
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:53,829
You can put your pants on,
you can move cars.

287
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:56,901
I don't want to get into a big
dispute about the pants.

288
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,210
Who's gonna send money to my
sister in Virginia?

289
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,165
Her little boy
needs surgery on his foot.

290
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,801
He'll be walking around with a limp,
because you can't park a few cars.

291
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:07,722
Maybe I could call my father.

292
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:12,685
-Hey, you seen the paper yet?
-Interestingly enough, no...

293
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:15,759
...inasmuch as it is my paper.

294
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,424
There's an article on that writer.

295
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:20,978
''Owen March, prominent author and
essayist, suffered a stroke yesterday...

296
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:23,670
...in the Upper West Side
apartment of a friend.''

297
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:26,227
That's the guy that was here.
You're the friend.

298
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,784
Thanks. ''The extent of the damage
would've been far less severe...

299
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:33,881
...had paramedics been able
to reach him sooner.''

300
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,821
-Oh, Lord.
-''The commotion also delayed...

301
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:41,122
...production of a Woody Allen movie
that was shooting up the block.

302
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,715
A spokeswoman
for the legendary filmmaker...

303
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,215
...said that Mr. Allen
was extremely agitated...

304
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,853
...and wondered if his days of shooting
movies in New York were over.''

305
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,393
Five seconds.

306
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:56,170
Jerry, I was five seconds away
from breaking up with him.

307
00:15:56,334 --> 00:16:00,877
Five seconds! The next words out
of my mouth were, ''Owen, it's over.''

308
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,392
-Can he communicate?
-Yeah. Well, he nods.

309
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,156
And I think he understands me.

310
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:08,397
He seems to enjoy it
when I read to him.

311
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:12,144
All right, she's free.

312
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:16,824
Hi, I called before.
My car got smashed.

313
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:19,638
So listen. What should I do?
lf I break up with him now...

314
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:24,028
...it'll look like I’m abandoning him.
I’ll be ostracized from the community.

315
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,264
What community?
There's a community?

316
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,740
Of course there's a community.

317
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,523
All these years, I’m living in
a community, I had no idea.

318
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:35,361
Sir, the estimate on the damage
to your car is 2866 dollars.

319
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:38,525
-I got the insurance and everything--
-Yes, now, in your report...

320
00:16:38,694 --> 00:16:41,378
...you said you weren't the driver
at the time of the accident.

321
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,137
Somebody else was driving it.

322
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:47,234
All right, well, sir, you're only covered
for when you're driving the car.

323
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:49,640
What's that?

324
00:16:49,804 --> 00:16:53,154
-You're not covered for other drivers.
-Other drivers?

325
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:56,174
Your whole business is based
on other drivers. It’s a rented car.

326
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,671
That's who's driving it.
Other drivers.

327
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,655
Doesn't my credit card cover me?

328
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,339
-Not that particular one.
-I got a hundred cards.

329
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:06,094
Here, here. Pick a card.
Take any card you want.

330
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,854
Go ahead. Whichever one.
I don't care.

331
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:11,985
-lf you had read the rental agreement--
-Did you see the size of that document?

332
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:14,804
It’s like the Declaration of
Independence. Who's gonna read that?

333
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:18,517
Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now,
you are not covered for that damage...

334
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:22,996
...and there is absolutely nothing
that can be done about that.

335
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:27,036
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

336
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,899
It’s good, isn't it?

337
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:39,486
Yankee bean.

338
00:17:40,295 --> 00:17:42,663
Why Yankee bean, huh?

339
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:45,925
Don't they have beans
in the South?

340
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,126
I mean, if you order Yankee bean
in the South, are they offended?

341
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:56,006
<i>Yankee bean. Yankee bean.</i>

342
00:17:56,623 --> 00:18:02,540
<i>I like my Yankee bean.</i>

343
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,721
Owen...

344
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,439
...I think we have to talk.

345
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:23,574
I mean, I have to talk.

346
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:29,054
It would be nice if we could,
but, you know, whatever.

347
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:36,451
Don't get me wrong.
I like coming here and feeding you...

348
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:40,096
...and cleaning a little,
and paying your bills.

349
00:18:40,263 --> 00:18:43,494
I mean, that's good stuff.
Good stuff.

350
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:49,956
I have a wonderful time when
I’m with you. Wonderful!

351
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:54,254
But at this point in my life,
I’m not really sure...

352
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:58,924
...that I’m ready to make
a commitment to one person.

353
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,289
I’m just not really sure that we
have enough in common.

354
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:05,103
I mean, for example:

355
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,402
I like running in the park...

356
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,029
...bicycling...

357
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:14,741
...roller-skating,
tennis and skiing....

358
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:17,210
And, well....

359
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:20,440
I’m gonna be brutally honest
with you now.

360
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,381
It’s a bitch to get here.
It’s two subways.

361
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,611
I have to transfer at 42nd Street
to take the double-R.

362
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:32,960
Anyway, I mean, this doesn't
mean we can't be friends.

363
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:38,173
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

364
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:45,733
Can you die from an odor?

365
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:49,445
I mean, if you were locked in
a vomitorium for two weeks...

366
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:53,739
-...could you die from the odor?
-An overdose of odor. Good question.

367
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,365
Do I smell?

368
00:19:57,522 --> 00:20:00,906
No, no, no. I was just down
at the 42nd Street subway today.

369
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,443
It is disgusting.

370
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:06,355
Guess who I bumped into? Owen.

371
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:09,390
-He's all right?
-Yeah, he's almost fully recovered.

372
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,311
Told me he
was just using me for sex.

373
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:15,766
-Let me get that.
-I got it.

374
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:18,202
-Please.
-Let me. I smashed your car.

375
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:19,926
It cost you over 2000 dollars.

376
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,997
Yeah, a cup of coffee
should cover it.

377
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,580
-Oh, man.
-What are you doing here?

378
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:28,957
I got fired from the movie.

379
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:30,684
-Get out of here. What?
-What?

380
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:33,373
Well, you know, they were
going to shoot it today.

381
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,859
We rehearsed it twice,
and then Woody yells, ''Action.''

382
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,373
I turn to him and I say:

383
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:40,446
''These pretzels are making
me thirsty.''

384
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:42,919
-Right.
-Then I took a swig of beer...

385
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:46,696
...and I slammed the glass down
on the bar, and it shattered.

386
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:51,908
Well, one of the pieces
must've hit Woody...

387
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,665
...and he started crying.

388
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,965
And he yells out, ''I’m bleeding,''
and he runs off.

389
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,290
Anyway, this woman, she came up
to me, and she says, ''You're fired.''

390
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,717
Boy, I really nailed that scene.

391
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:11,440
Oh, wait a--

392
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:15,639
Oh, for crying out loud.

393
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:26,519
The best part of a relationship
is when you're sick.

394
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,470
The best part of being sick
is when you're in a relationship.

395
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:31,546
But if I got married,
you know those vows...

396
00:21:31,717 --> 00:21:33,954
...for richer or for poorer,
for better or for worse.

397
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,837
All I need is the sickness.
That is the most important one.

398
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:40,962
''Do you take this man in sickness?''

399
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,756
That's the time
I need somebody there.

400
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:44,931
The rest of the time,
go out, have a ball.

401
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,068
But if I get the sniffles,
you better be there.
