1
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:06,647
ln parking lots, they have this
''compact car only'' spot.

2
00:00:06,818 --> 00:00:09,602
lsn't that discrimination
against the size of your car?

3
00:00:09,763 --> 00:00:12,863
lf l want my ass hanging out
of the back of my parking spot...

4
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:15,233
...that's my business.

5
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:18,017
There are people with real asses
hanging out of their pants.

6
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:19,972
Nobody's stopping them.

7
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:24,095
Nobody goes, ''Hey, hold it, sir.
Those are compact jeans.

8
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,240
You can't pull that in there.''

9
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:34,214
Hey.

10
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:36,899
l got bad news for you, buddy.

11
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:38,957
l think your car got stolen again.

12
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,548
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,410
You parked on 84th
and Columbus, right?

14
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,122
l just walked by there,
and that car is gone.

15
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:47,790
Yeah, l know.

16
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:49,198
Well, where is it?

17
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:50,540
What's the difference?

18
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:53,675
Well, there's no difference.
You know, l'm just curious.

19
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:56,365
Always have to know everything
that's going on, don't you?

20
00:00:56,533 --> 00:01:00,178
-What happened to the car?
-lf l don't tell you, it'll kill you, won't it?

21
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:02,285
-Yeah, yeah. lt'll kill me.
-You have to know.

22
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:05,326
-You must know.
-l must know.

23
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,433
Well, l'm not telling you.

24
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:09,911
Come on.

25
00:01:10,074 --> 00:01:11,351
Nope. l don't think so.

26
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:14,003
-Well, please?
-Not today, pal.

27
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:15,382
Okay, l beg you.

28
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:18,835
Now, see, just saying ''beg''
doesn't make it a real beg.

29
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:20,347
You gotta put some beg into it.

30
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,511
Okay. Please!
Please tell me!

31
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:26,488
All right, but your begging
needs a lot of work.

32
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:29,756
-Okay, okay. What is it?
-l loaned the car to George.

33
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,744
George. All right.

34
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:33,630
Well, what for?

35
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:37,724
George and Elaine went to
a flea market in Westchester. Okay?

36
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:39,551
All right.

37
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:43,136
Why'd they go there?

38
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,994
Would you stop it, already?

39
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,102
-Why didn't they ask me to go?
-l don't know!

40
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:49,377
How am l supposed to know?

41
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:52,708
-What, they don't like me?
-l don't like you.

42
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:55,241
Well if they liked me,
why didn't they ask me to go?

43
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,803
Yeah.

44
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,536
l really think it looks good.

45
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:09,006
Ten bucks.
How can you go wrong?

46
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:11,274
All bald people look good in hats.

47
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:15,281
You should have lived in the '20s and
'30s. Men wore hats all the time then.

48
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:17,832
What a bald paradise
that must have been.

49
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:19,730
Nobody knew.

50
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:22,476
You can wear a hat all the time now.

51
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,718
-Who's stopping you?
-No, l can't.

52
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:26,413
What if meet a woman?

53
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:29,333
l'd always worry about that first
moment where l take it off...

54
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:32,464
...and see that look of disappointment
on her face.

55
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:34,962
You sure you like
these sunglasses?

56
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:39,766
Man.

57
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:42,234
Well, l'm very disappointed
in George and Elaine.

58
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:45,813
And you know l'm somebody you don't
wanna have on your bad side.

59
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:48,886
-Why not?
-Because l'm like ice, buddy.

60
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:50,779
When l don't like you,
you got problems.

61
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:57,914
-ls this for the fight?
-Yeah. Starts in 35 minutes.

62
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:03,936
Yeah.

63
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,628
Hey, l invited Mike Moffett.
You don't mind, do you?

64
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,581
No. l like Mike.

65
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,258
l just got off the phone with him.
We had a great conversation.

66
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:16,387
-Yeah? What did you talk about?
-Actually, we talked about you.

67
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:20,391
Yeah. He had some pretty
interesting things to say.

68
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:22,820
Yeah? What did he say?

69
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:25,542
You have to know everything,
don't you?

70
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:28,071
-Come on. What'd he say?
-Why is that?

71
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:29,995
Why do you have
to know everything?

72
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,909
-Kramer, just tell me what he said.
-Beg me.

73
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:36,430
-Please don't make me beg.
-No, l want you to beg me.

74
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,910
And l don't want you to say it. l want
you to put some beg in it. Go on.

75
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:42,352
Kramer, please tell me
what the guy said.

76
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:44,490
No, no. That's no good.

77
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,570
No, l really don't think that's a beg.

78
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:48,881
No way. lt's close, but....

79
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,413
-Kramer!
-Look, l can't say anything.

80
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:54,478
The guy told me this stuff in
confidence. l'd be betraying a friend.

81
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:57,037
Well, you can't just mention it
and then not tell me.

82
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:00,148
All right. l'll tell you,
but you can't say anything to him.

83
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:02,551
l'm not saying anything.
l'm putting it in the vault.

84
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,788
l'm locking the vault.
lt's a vault!

85
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:07,826
-He thinks you're a phony.
-He what?

86
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,885
l told you. He thinks you're a phony.

87
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,894
-A phony? He called me a phony?
-A big phony.

88
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:14,910
Big one.

89
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,423
Why did you tell me that
if l can't say anything?

90
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,186
You begged me.

91
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,469
Do you hear that?

92
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:27,261
Of course l hear that.

93
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:28,989
You had to move the mirror.

94
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:30,782
l wanted to check out
my sunglasses.

95
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:33,918
Went to look in the mirror, it was gone.
You threw off my equilibrium.

96
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:37,088
Yeah. Blame it on me
because you can't drive, George.

97
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:38,849
-l can't drive?
-Yeah.

98
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,773
Nobody drives like me. Nobody.

99
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,655
l'm doing things in this car,
you have no idea they're going on.

100
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,673
Want to see a right turn
from the left lane?

101
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:47,493
No, l really don't.

102
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:50,922
-l can make a left from the right lane.
-l'm sure you could.

103
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:53,893
-What are we gonna tell Jerry?
-l don't know.

104
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:55,623
Start looking for spaces.

105
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,989
You're never gonna find a space on
Jerry's block. Just put it in a garage.

106
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:02,120
Look, l have my system.
First, l look for the dream spot...

107
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:05,869
...in front of the door, then l slowly
expand out in concentric circles.

108
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:08,556
No. Come on, George.
Please put it in a garage.

109
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:11,026
l don't wanna spend an hour
looking for a space.

110
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:13,011
l can't park in a garage.

111
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:15,214
-Why?
-l don't know. l just can't.

112
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,969
Nobody in my family can pay
for parking. lt's a sickness.

113
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:21,909
My father never paid for parking.
My mother. My brother. Nobody.

114
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:24,976
-l'll pay for it.
-You don't understand.

115
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,444
A garage.

116
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:29,237
l can't even pull in there.

117
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:31,128
lt's like going to a prostitute.

118
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:36,149
Why should l pay when, if l apply
myself, maybe l could get it for free?

119
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,909
What? What do you want?

120
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,691
Go around me.
l'm looking for spaces.

121
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,481
George! There's
a space right there!

122
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,592
-Beautiful.
-You just passed it, see?

123
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:49,788
Look at that, the dream space.
Right in front of Jerry's building.

124
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:52,378
Dreams can come true.
What did l tell you?

125
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:55,200
You didn't even have to
take it out to dinner.

126
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:01,991
All right, now you're gonna see
some parallel parking.

127
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:06,022
l wish you could make a living
parallel parking.

128
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:09,831
lt's all geometry,
knowing all the angles...

129
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,231
...when to make that first turn
and when to...

130
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,218
...swing it back in.
That's the key.

131
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,104
Will you just park it, already?

132
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:18,822
There's nothing l can impart to you.
That's the sad thing.

133
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:20,877
lt's so inborn.

134
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,862
l can't pass it on.

135
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,502
Look at this guy.

136
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:29,128
What, are you crazy?
What are you doing?

137
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:32,013
Hey, hey! You're stealing
my space!

138
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:33,903
Wait, you don't know who this guy is!

139
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,141
People kill for a parking space
in this city.

140
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:38,546
-He's not getting away with this.
-George!

141
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,301
What are you doing?

142
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,900
l think l'm parking my car.

143
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:44,941
You can't do that. You can't sneak
in from the back like that.

144
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,639
l'm not sneaking!

145
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,591
l didn't even know you were parking.
You were just sitting there.

146
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:52,689
lf you didn't think l was parking,
why did you put it in headfirst?

147
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:54,386
That's the way l park!

148
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,204
You didn't start backing in
until l pulled in.

149
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:59,129
l was in the middle of a conversation.

150
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,722
Hey, buddy, what can l tell you?

151
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:02,487
The point is, l was here first.

152
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,379
l was closer to this space
than you were!

153
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:07,194
But l'm backing in, you can't
put it in headfirst!

154
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,216
l can if l have room!

155
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:11,841
Are you gonna move the car?

156
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:13,755
No, l'm not gonna move the car.

157
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,790
-Jerk.
-You're not?

158
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:20,226
-You believe this guy?
-We'll put it in the garage.

159
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,812
l am not putting it in the garage.
lt's my space.

160
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:25,535
What are you gonna do, you're
gonna leave it here like this?

161
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,809
-l'm going upstairs.
-Are you coming back down?

162
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:30,595
l gotta tell Jerry we're here.
l gotta go to the bathroom.

163
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:32,901
Make sure he reserves
the good chair for me.

164
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,434
What are we gonna tell him
about the clanking noise?

165
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:37,859
Me? No, no, no. You.
You're gonna tell him.

166
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:40,167
-l'm not gonna-- No!
-You're good at this.

167
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,958
-What am l gonna say?
-l don't know.

168
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,581
You'll think of something.
Just break it to him gently.

169
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,125
Man!

170
00:07:57,202 --> 00:08:00,203
Oh, my God. l need a drink.
Got any Hennigan's here?

171
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:01,998
Yeah. Under the counter.
What happened?

172
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:07,251
God. Jerry, it was so terrible, what we
just went through on the way home.

173
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,966
You wouldn't believe it.

174
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:12,373
What? Tell me what happened.

175
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,865
Okay. Now listen.

176
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,873
We were at the tollbooth at the
Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?

177
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,460
And there were these, like,
this pack of...

178
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:33,943
...extremely wild teenagers
in a convertible behind us, okay?

179
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:37,463
And for some reason, l don't know,
they just started to taunt us.

180
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:41,345
And so-- So then we paid the toll,
and then we went through...

181
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:43,232
...and then they started to follow us!

182
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,885
So George tries to lose them,
and-- And--

183
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:49,088
But-- But they were in this really--
Like a souped-up car, you know?

184
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:52,103
And so he turned
off the road really suddenly...

185
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:55,680
...and the car was on two wheels,
and l was just screaming...

186
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,664
...and then--
George is such a great driver.

187
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:01,347
-He is?
-He is fantastic.

188
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:04,233
And then they fired
a gun right up in the air!

189
00:09:04,396 --> 00:09:07,714
-A gun?
-l think it was a gun.

190
00:09:07,885 --> 00:09:10,341
And then they followed us
all the way into the city.

191
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,440
And then they stopped, and they
turned around and they went home.

192
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:20,010
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

193
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:22,862
-Yeah, yeah. l'm all right. God.
-Oh, man.

194
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:28,274
By the way, the car hit a pothole,
and now it's making a clanking noise.

195
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:32,182
Well, l mean,
as long as you're okay, that....

196
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:37,334
That's the important thing.

197
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,061
Exactly.

198
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:41,108
Where's George now?

199
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:44,754
He's out in front arguing
with some guy about a parking space.

200
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:47,674
-What are you talking about?
-Look out the window, you'll see.

201
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:50,619
Hey, Georgie!

202
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:51,959
Hey!

203
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,915
Are you okay?

204
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:55,355
Yeah. l'm fine.

205
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,887
Crazy kids, huh?

206
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,029
What?

207
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,701
lt's my cuticle.

208
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:08,797
ls that Jerry?

209
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:11,354
-Jerry!
-Hey, Mike.

210
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,995
What, you know Jerry?

211
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:15,581
-Yeah, l know Jerry.
-How do you know him?

212
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,856
-What's the difference?
-Because l know him too...

213
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:21,341
-...and probably a lot better than you.
-Well, bully for you.

214
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:25,987
Hey, Jerry. You know, your friend
here is a real piece of work!

215
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:28,971
-l'm coming down.
-Hey, will you tell Kramer l'm outside?

216
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:30,955
What, you know Kramer?

217
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,711
-Hi.
-Hello.

218
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:49,710
Hey, your friend Mike's outside.
He wants to talk to you.

219
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,944
Hey, Mike!

220
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:55,214
Come on up!
The fight's almost starting.

221
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,230
-You're watching the fight at Jerry's?
-Yeah.

222
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,918
Oh, great.

223
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:02,802
-You know that guy downstairs?
-Yeah. He's a real phony.

224
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:06,003
What's going on?

225
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,822
Will you come on down?
This guy's in my space!

226
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:10,329
lt's my space!

227
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:11,920
l'll be down in a minute.

228
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,781
-Are you going down?
-Yeah.

229
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:22,651
-ls anything wrong?
-Why should anything be wrong?

230
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,530
l'll be down in a minute.

231
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,015
Hey, pal.

232
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,895
You're not getting that space.

233
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,484
l mean, l'll sleep in my car
if l have to.

234
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:38,434
l'll die out here.

235
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:40,902
He was down there.

236
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,552
Once he passed his front bumper,
it's no longer his space.

237
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,070
-No. lt doesn't matter. He was here--
-Hey, Jerry.

238
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:50,372
-Long time no see.
-Hi, Mike.

239
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:52,164
-lndiana.
-Hey, Krame.

240
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,614
-You know this guy?
-Yeah. Yeah, l know him.

241
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,699
You're looking tremendous.

242
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:00,203
What, are you on some regimen?

243
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:01,611
Yeah, 25-percent bran flakes.

244
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:04,678
The 40 percent was too much, so l
found a store to make it special.

245
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:07,020
They take it down
another 1 5 percent.

246
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,112
That's killer! Killer!

247
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,453
l love that.

248
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:16,497
You've got to use that.
That's a definite.

249
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,151
Come on.

250
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:20,528
Hey!

251
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:23,057
-Your friend here has real problems.
-Me?

252
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:25,645
See what he did? See how he
tried to sneak into my space?

253
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:27,376
Going in front-first
isn't sneaking!

254
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:30,513
You went in front-first
because you saw me backing up!

255
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:33,999
l went front-first because l can make
it front-first. Pull out! l'll show you!

256
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,862
You got a prayer.

257
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:37,686
l go in front-first all the time.

258
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:40,952
Front-first. That's how you park
when you're pulling a bank job.

259
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,478
-Did you talk to him?
-Yeah.

260
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,957
-lt's all taken care of.
-You told him? What did you tell him?

261
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:50,584
l did a number on him.

262
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:54,333
lt was a thing of beauty. You really
had to be there to appreciate it.

263
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:55,961
l can't believe it.
What'd you say?

264
00:12:56,131 --> 00:13:01,697
l told him a pack of teenagers
in a convertible were terrorizing us...

265
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:04,382
...and they followed us into the city.

266
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:05,957
A pack of teenagers?

267
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,225
Yeah. By the time
l got to the end of the story...

268
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:11,742
...he was so relieved we were alive,
he couldn't care less about the car.

269
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:15,170
You are a genius.
lt's as simple as that.

270
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:16,931
What can l say?
You know, it's a gift.

271
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:21,257
l only wish l could teach you,
but, you know, it's inborn.

272
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:24,716
By the way, thanks for inviting
me to the flea market.

273
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,242
-What?
-Yeah. Jerry, he told me all about it.

274
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:29,893
-Great.
-l didn't know.

275
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:32,971
Oh, so that's why
you were acting so funny.

276
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:35,079
Well, l didn't know you wanted to go.

277
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,617
A flea market?
You went to a flea market?

278
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:40,845
-Who's talking to you?
-We just didn't think of you.

279
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:43,598
-You said it, sister.
-Every time l leave my house now...

280
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:46,766
...l have to call everybody and ask
if they wanna do what l'm doing?

281
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:49,804
People forget. Look at <i>Home Alone</i>.
They forgot.

282
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:52,310
Great move telling him, by the way.
Real smart move.

283
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,478
l didn't know l wasn't supposed
to say anything.

284
00:13:55,673 --> 00:13:58,936
Judgment, Jerry, judgment.
You exercised no judgment!

285
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:00,793
You're right. My fault.

286
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,166
l'm sorry, Kramer.

287
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,056
l'm so sorry. Really.

288
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,010
Yeah. l'm sorry.

289
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:08,825
l'm sorry. l don't care for that ''sorry.''

290
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,708
What's wrong with that sorry?
That was a good sorry. Jerry...

291
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:14,906
-...was that a good sorry?
-lt was a so-so sorry.

292
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:18,714
Hey! Move this car!
l gotta get through!

293
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,242
You heard the man.

294
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:23,363
l guess you better be moving your car.

295
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:25,761
Like you're not just gonna
back it in if l do that.

296
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:28,347
Well, somebody better move
something soon!

297
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:31,553
l got a truck full of ice cream here!

298
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:38,982
They had to move the cars so the
truck could get through, right?

299
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:42,408
These guys don't trust each other,
so they got two nonpartisan drivers...

300
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:43,816
...to move them.

301
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:50,471
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?

302
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:51,816
Yeah.

303
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:55,949
Amazing how they pick you
out of everyone to terrorize.

304
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:59,943
Yeah. l know. l said to myself,
''Why us?'' You remember?

305
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:02,602
Sounds like you did
some pretty nifty maneuvering.

306
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:06,482
You know, it's interesting, under that
pressure, what you're capable of.

307
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:09,066
-Right.
-l learned a lot about myself.

308
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:12,526
-What did you do to my car?
-l couldn't help it!

309
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:14,768
Elaine moved the mirror!
l got discombobulated!

310
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:16,659
Like you've ever been ''bobulated.''

311
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,679
l thought you said
you were a good driver.

312
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:21,809
No, l never said l was a good driver,
l said, l was a good parker.

313
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,793
l think you said driver.

314
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:26,647
Parker. l never said driver.
l said, parker. Great parker.

315
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:28,667
That's not the way it was.
Move it up.

316
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,284
-No, that's the right position.
-No, no. l was further in.

317
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:32,860
No, you weren't. Stop there.

318
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:34,364
-Do you mind?
-Do you?

319
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:36,120
Somebody better move these cars.

320
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:38,270
-You're making a commotion.
-Hey, Sid.

321
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:40,604
-Who are you?
-Never mind who l am.

322
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:41,979
l know who l am.

323
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:43,324
Do you know who you are?

324
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:46,552
Why is it every time
you park a car in this block...

325
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:48,578
...everything gets disrupted
and disjointed?

326
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,075
-Sid, it's completely his fault.
-Right.

327
00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:52,928
Why don't you start
taking the bus.

328
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:56,607
Let's go. l'm putting it in the garage.
The fight's starting in two minutes.

329
00:15:56,774 --> 00:15:57,953
-Enough!
-No! Don't do it!

330
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,774
Are we gonna stay here all night?

331
00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:02,312
Yes. l'm not giving him the
satisfaction. lt's my space.

332
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:04,361
Why don't you just flip a coin, already.

333
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:06,082
No, this is a matter of principle.

334
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,699
That would be saying anybody can
pull into any space any way they want.

335
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:12,738
l'm making a stand here.
l'm saying no to headfirst parking!

336
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,298
We put up with too
much crap in this city!

337
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,413
We're not putting up
with headfirst parking!

338
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,196
Maybe if you hadn't been pontificating
about what a great parker you were...

339
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,954
...you might have got the space.

340
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,673
So you're against me now?

341
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:28,559
He could have pulled up
to that car and backed in...

342
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,349
...but he chose to go in headfirst.

343
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:33,746
No, he couldn't, because the other
car was already backing in.

344
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,910
-No, he wasn't.
-All that matters is who was there first.

345
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:39,894
You're not even old enough to drive,
you little puke.

346
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:41,266
You just spit on me!

347
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:44,243
Don't you raise your voice to me.

348
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,002
You're not my father!

349
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:47,443
Hey, Matthew.

350
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,788
Hi, Jerry.

351
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,548
This guy's really a jerk.

352
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:53,105
-How you doing?
-Okay.

353
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:55,193
l hear your father's closing his store.

354
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:57,015
What?

355
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:59,571
-No. Nothing.
-What's happened to Daddy?

356
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:02,111
-He's going out of business?
-No, no, no.

357
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,898
We're not going to have
any money?

358
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,236
-We're out of money?
-No, of course not.

359
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,579
Mommy!

360
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:09,502
Jerry says Daddy's closing the store.

361
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,576
He's going out of business.

362
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:13,406
We don't have any money?

363
00:17:13,572 --> 00:17:15,677
Jerry, what's the matter with you?

364
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:17,506
l didn't....

365
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,197
l don't know about
your friend Jerry.

366
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:21,155
He says some stupid
things sometimes.

367
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,628
Yeah.

368
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,564
-Congratulations.
-What for?

369
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,256
Well, you're pregnant.

370
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:30,630
-What?
-You're not pregnant?

371
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:32,256
No, l'm not pregnant.

372
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:36,264
-Are you sure you're not pregnant?
-Yes, l'm sure!

373
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,347
-That's weird.
-Come on, Matthew.

374
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:40,201
-No!
-Come on, Matthew!

375
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:42,535
l thought she was pregnant.

376
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:44,773
Hey, do you think l'm a phony?

377
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:46,667
-What?
-Mike thinks l'm a phony.

378
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,167
-He thinks you're a phony?
-But l can't say anything...

379
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:52,145
-...because l'm not supposed to know.
-You have to say something.

380
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,096
l can't. l told Kramer
l was vaulting it.

381
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:56,234
-You gotta open the vault.
-Open my vault?!

382
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:58,412
-Open your vault.
-Once l open the vault...

383
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:00,753
-...it ceases to be a vault.
-You have no choice.

384
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,737
The vault.

385
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:05,842
You know why you can't go
in front-first? l'll tell you why.

386
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:08,627
Because it signals a breakdown
in the social order.

387
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:12,340
Chaos! lt reduces us to jungle law.

388
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:15,089
When can you park headfirst?

389
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,470
Never.

390
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:18,643
-Why are you asking him?
-Who's talking to you?

391
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:20,918
He's right! Never!

392
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,874
What if you got 1 0 car lengths?

393
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,243
Should you pull all the
way to the front car?

394
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,836
lf you got 1 0 car lengths....

395
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,666
When do you ever have
1 0 car lengths?

396
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:30,239
What about Sundays
and holidays?

397
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,190
Please.

398
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:33,914
What's going on here?

399
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:36,985
This guy tried to sneak
into my space.

400
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:40,833
l really hate people who do that. l hope
you don't let him get away with it.

401
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:43,234
Thank you for your support.

402
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,663
Hey, that's a great hat.

403
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,489
Really? You like it?

404
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:49,607
l got it at a flea market today.

405
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,874
-Hey, George, nice hat.
-Yeah, thanks.

406
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,864
-Can l try it on?
-No! lt wouldn't fit you.

407
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:55,936
-Sure, it would.
-No! Get out of here, Newman.

408
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:57,601
-Let me try it.
-No! Stop it!

409
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,714
-Let him try it on.
-l don't want him to!

410
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,705
What is wrong with you?

411
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:05,387
You want to see? There!
There it is! Run!

412
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,918
All right! You wanna try on the hat?!
Try on the hat!

413
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,414
Stop it, George! Stop it.
l was defending your parking.

414
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,681
-Come on, George!
-Okay, just keep the hat!

415
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:15,435
That's it. The fight's already started.
l'm going upstairs.

416
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:18,156
-Who's coming? Elaine?
-Depends on who's going. You going?

417
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,396
-l'm not going if he's going!
-Me either!

418
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:22,703
-Well, l'm going.
-lf he's going, l'm not going!

419
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:24,462
-lt's your house!
-l don't have to go.

420
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:26,996
-l won't go if Jerry's not.
-Why won't you go if l go?

421
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:29,133
Why? l'll tell you why.

422
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:32,337
-No. Don't, Jerry.
-Like you didn't call me a phony!

423
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:33,846
What?

424
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,700
-Thanks! Real good!
-All right.

425
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,142
Jerry.

426
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,863
l think you completely
misunderstood what l said.

427
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:41,588
l meant it in a complimentary way.

428
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:45,078
You know, when people say, ''He's
bad,'' it really means, ''He's good.''

429
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:46,652
That sort of thing?

430
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:49,749
-You know, slang.
-Use it in a sentence.

431
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:53,236
Man, that Michael Jordan
is so phony.

432
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,812
Why did you tell him?!

433
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:58,044
-He begged me!
-He begged you?!

434
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,382
Come on, who wants
to watch the fight?

435
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,417
Okay, whose cars are these?
Let's move them. Let's go.

436
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:05,376
Officer, can l explain
something to you?

437
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,858
Let's go, or l'm gonna write both
of you a ticket in about two minutes.

438
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,754
He can't pull in headfirst!

439
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,806
Officer, he backed up
from down the street!

440
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,877
He was double-parked!
He was sitting there!

441
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:19,943
All right, you move your car. lt's his
space. You can't go in headfirst.

442
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,560
Wait a second.

443
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:25,763
Why can't he go in headfirst?

444
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,066
He said the guy
was just sitting over there.

445
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:30,699
What are you talking about?
This guy was here first.

446
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,416
-But he didn't take it.
-Hey! lt's his space!

447
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,372
No, it's his space!

448
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:38,155
You're gonna have to go
to the bathroom!

449
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,361
-You'll have to go to work!
-l don't have a job!

450
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,570
Neither do l!

451
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:49,779
<i>Seven.</i>

452
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:51,506
<i>Eight.</i>

453
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:53,775
<i>Nine.</i>

454
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:55,857
<i>Ten.</i>

455
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:02,256
People will kill each other
for a parking space in New York.

456
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:05,972
Because they think, ''lf l don't get
this one, l may never get a space.''

457
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:10,291
You know. ''l'll circle for months until
somebody goes out to the Hamptons.''

458
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:15,033
Everybody in New York City knows
there's gotta be way more cars...

459
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,443
...than parking spaces.

460
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:19,642
You see cars driving in New York
all hours of the night.

461
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:23,966
lt's like musical chairs, except
everybody sat down around 1 <i>9</i>64.

462
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:28,353
The problem is, car manufacturers
are building hundreds of thousands...

463
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:29,628
...of new cars every year.

464
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:32,218
They're not making any new spaces.

465
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,757
That's what they should work on.
Wouldn't that be great?

466
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,701
You go to the auto show,
they got that big revolving turntable...

467
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,554
...and there's nothing on it.

468
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,110
''New from Chrysler: a space.''
