1
00:00:04,097 --> 00:00:05,591
There's no easy way
to break up.

2
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:08,013
When you start dating,
they should give you...

3
00:00:08,184 --> 00:00:10,058
..."Get out of Relationship Free"
cards.

4
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:12,766
You know? So you could just go up
to the person...

5
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,599
...and go, " Here you go. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:17,479
I'll grab the tennis racket.
Don't even bother to get up.

7
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,479
Have a good one. Sorry."

8
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:22,857
Which is fine, unless the person
you're in the relationship with...

9
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:26,199
...has a " Eight More Months of Guilt,
Torture and Pain" card.

10
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:28,819
"Hold it. I got a little something
for you."

11
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:36,123
- We're dead.
- We're not dead.

12
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:37,624
- We are dead.
- Come on.

13
00:00:37,797 --> 00:00:39,873
We got all day tomorrow
to think of a story.

14
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,885
All day tomorrow? We had a month
to come up with something.

15
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:44,547
We didn't do anything.

16
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:46,678
So we'll do it tomorrow.

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,015
Let me ask you: when's the last time
you went skiing?

18
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:53,139
- About six years ago.
- I think you can take the lift ticket...

19
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:54,855
...off your jacket now.

20
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,604
Women like skiers.

21
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,313
So what? You can't meet anybody.
You're with Susan.

22
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:03,361
Yeah. Right.

23
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:05,949
See those two women over there?

24
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:09,284
I almost dated the one on the right.
She's in the closet business.

25
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:11,245
Closet business?

26
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:14,166
- What's the closet business?
- What is it your business?

27
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:18,002
- I'm interested.
- She reorganizes your closet...

28
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:21,125
...and shows you how to maximize
your closet space.

29
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,627
She looked into my closet.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,718
You thought she was good-looking.
This was a way to meet her.

31
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,594
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So, what happened?

32
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:31,172
She mentioned she had
a boyfriend. Then it hit me:

33
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,842
What do I need
more closet space for?

34
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:37,893
- Hi, Marla.
- Jerry.

35
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,394
- George, Marla.
- Marla.

36
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,145
George. Jerry, Stacy.

37
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,861
- Stacy. George, Stacy.
- Jerry.

38
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:44,571
- Stacy.
- George.

39
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:48,866
George.

40
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:52,036
Jerry, Marla. Stacy.

41
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:59,169
- So how was your trip to Berlin?
- Trip to Berlin?

42
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:01,460
Remember, that's why you
put off the closets.

43
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,964
- You said you were going to Berlin.
- Oh, right, right.

44
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:07,970
The Wall had just come down.
You told me you wanted to be...

45
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,466
...part of the celebration.

46
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,889
Yes, yes, I did, but you know,
I was watching it on CNN...

47
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:17,685
...and they covered it so well, I
thought, why knock my brains out?

48
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:19,350
You know, my boyfriend went.

49
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,813
- Really?
- Yes, I told him all about you going...

50
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:24,226
...and he got all excited
and decided to go.

51
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:27,108
- Oh, did he like it?
- I don't know. He never came back.

52
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:30,361
Anyway, we met with NBC
about a month ago, and they...

53
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:33,240
...gave us the green light
to go ahead and write a pilot.

54
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:35,286
We got a big meeting
with them tomorrow.

55
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:38,327
They gotta approve the story
before we can write it.

56
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:42,795
Wow. What a great job. A writer.

57
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:45,669
Not a bad way to earn a buck.

58
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:47,170
Sounds great.

59
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:49,300
Well, I'll tell you, Stacy...

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,926
...it's a lot of hard work.

61
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:54,636
But it comes fairly easy to me.

62
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:58,762
Some people write symphonies.
This is my gift.

63
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,314
- So you gonna go out with her?
- I might.

64
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,354
- What about Susan?
- What? I'm not married.

65
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,691
I'm not allowed to go out
with somebody else?

66
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,280
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

67
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:16,577
- On many factors.
- Like what?

68
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:19,867
Well, how long
you've been seeing her.

69
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:22,616
What's your phone-call frequency?
Are you on a daily?

70
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,749
No. Semi-daily. Four,
five times a week.

71
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:29,624
Saturday nights, do you ask her out,
or is the date implied?

72
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:31,213
- Implied.
- She got anything...

73
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:32,716
...in your medicine cabinet?

74
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:35,755
Might be some moisturizer.

75
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:39,344
Let me ask you this:

76
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,308
Is there any Tampax in your house?

77
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:49,277
Yeah.

78
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:51,696
- I'll tell you what you got here.
- Yeah?

79
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,194
You got a girlfriend.

80
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:56,322
Oh, no, no. What-?
Are you sure, a girlfriend?

81
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:59,615
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily,
with Tampax in his house...

82
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,163
...and an implied date
on Saturday night.

83
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:05,834
- I would like to help you out, but-
- Do you believe my luck?

84
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:07,914
The first time I have
a good answer to...

85
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:10,214
..."What do you do?"
and I have a girlfriend.

86
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,042
You don't need a girlfriend
when you can answer that.

87
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:15,509
That's what you say
in order to get girlfriends.

88
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:19,549
Once you can get girlfriends,
you just want more girlfriends.

89
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,847
You're gonna make
a very good father someday.

90
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:25,598
Well, it's not fair, Jerry.
It's just not fair.

91
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:27,684
That's it. I'm getting out
of this thing.

92
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,191
Break up with her.
But you know what this means.

93
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:32,439
- No, what?
- The script, the pilot, TV show.

94
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:34,275
- That's all over.
- What do you mean?

95
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,573
Figure it out. She's one
of the executives...

96
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,662
...that makes the decision
whether to pick up the show.

97
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:41,907
She's one of our biggest fans.

98
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,408
You drop her, you think
they're gonna pick us up?

99
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,670
Oh, right. Oh, no! Man.

100
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:50,254
You know, it's a very
interesting situation.

101
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:53,129
Here you have a job that could
help you get girls.

102
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:55,010
But you also have a relationship.

103
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:58,133
But if you get rid of the
relationship so you can get girls...

104
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:00,181
...you lose the job.

105
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:04,263
- You see the irony?
- Yeah, yeah. I see the...

106
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:06,893
All right, what about this?

107
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,438
What if I could find a way
to break up with her...

108
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,445
...so she'll still like me,
and it doesn't affect the deal?

109
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,108
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait. Hear me out.

110
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:16,986
Hear me out. Don't dismiss this.
You're quick to dismiss.

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,784
Don't dismiss.

112
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:23,207
She's got a big crush on
David Letterman. A big crush.

113
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:24,952
She talks about him all the time.

114
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,248
Suppose I go up to
David Letterman.

115
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:32,086
He works at NBC. I work at NBC.

116
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:33,717
I explain my situation.

117
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,921
He agrees to meet her. They go out.
They fall madly in love...

118
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:40,014
...and she dumps me
for David Letterman.

119
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:44,050
- This is your plan?
- No, no, I'm just thinking.

120
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:46,435
I don't think you are.

121
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,481
Well, let me tell you what I see.

122
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,491
Please. And be brutal.
I have no closet sensitivity.

123
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:03,580
- Are you very fussy about your pants?
- I don't think I am.

124
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:05,491
Because I have a very radical idea.

125
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,374
- Can you handle it?
- Try me.

126
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,878
Here's what I'm proposing.
We'll eliminate all this.

127
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:16,005
The hangers, the bar, the shelves, and
in its place, install a series of hooks.

128
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,259
We'll put everything on hooks.

129
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:20,089
- Everything?
- Everything.

130
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:23,349
The shirts, pants,
sports jackets, pyjamas.

131
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:26,009
We can get 80 hooks on here.

132
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,186
You're quite mad, you know.

133
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,184
Oh, I don't believe this.

134
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,238
Hey. Well, what are you doing?

135
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:38,315
<i>I'm watching
The Bold and the Beautiful.</i>

136
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:39,950
- No.
- Wait, wait.

137
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:41,991
- This is not a good time.
- Five minutes.

138
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:44,035
What did you give your TV
to George for?

139
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:47,740
Because I've been watching too much.
It was an addiction. I couldn't stop.

140
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,577
It was destroying my brain cells.

141
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,787
Yeah, but now you're in here
all the time.

142
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:54,755
- Well- Whoa.
- Marla, Kramer.

143
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,792
Hello.

144
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:01,553
- Go out. It's nice out.
- There's nothing out there for me.

145
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,596
- There's weather.
- I don't need weather.

146
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,141
Weather doesn't do it for me.

147
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,385
I'm telling George to give you
your TV back.

148
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:10,017
No, no. I don't want it back.

149
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:12,229
Are you gonna watch
the Knick game tonight?

150
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,392
- I don't know.
- Will you tape it?

151
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,854
- Kramer.
- Oh, yeah.

152
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:27,528
So your boyfriend never
came back from Berlin.

153
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:30,328
- Never came back.
- Oh, you must have been devastated...

154
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,830
...being left for a wall.

155
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:35,585
Well, it was about to end anyway.

156
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,378
There was this problem.

157
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,546
Excuse me one second.

158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,048
<i>- Yeah.
- It's me.</i>

159
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:44,261
Come on up.

160
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:46,424
That's Elaine. She's just
a friend of mine.

161
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,427
I don't know what
she's doing here now.

162
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:53,309
<i>- What?
- I didn't get it.</i>

164
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,270
So you were saying
there was this problem.

165
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:01,902
Well, he wanted me
to move in with him.

166
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:04,067
- Snapple?
- No, thanks.

167
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:08,779
- Go on.
- Well, I wouldn't move in, because-

168
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,949
- Yes?
- Well, because-

169
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,576
- Yeah?
- Well, because I'm a...

170
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:16,212
...virgin.

171
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:18,125
Hello.

172
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:22,083
Hi. Marla, Elaine.

173
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:23,969
Sorry, I didn't know
you had company.

174
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:27,258
- I wanted to return your tape.
- Oh, thanks a lot. Two weeks late.

175
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:31,597
<i>Now it cost me $35 to see Havana.</i>

176
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:36,104
I'm sorry. I really am.
I just kept forgetting.

177
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,398
- I should be going.
- No, no, no. I'm leaving.

178
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:40,063
I like that thing in your hair.

179
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:41,897
Yeah? This woman
was selling them...

180
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:44,196
...at this crazy party
I was at last night.

181
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,360
You'll appreciate this. Snapple?

182
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:48,327
No, thanks.

183
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:52,540
I was talking to this guy,
and I just happened to throw...

184
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:57,619
...my purse on the sofa.
And my diaphragm goes flying out.

185
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:03,377
So I just froze, you know:

186
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:06,257
Staring at my diaphragm, you know?
It's just lying there.

187
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,506
So this woman who sold me
this hair thing...

188
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:11,220
...she grabbed it before
the guy noticed, so I mean...

189
00:09:11,394 --> 00:09:13,635
...big deal, right?

190
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:16,482
So I carry around my diaphragm.
Who doesn't?

191
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,606
I mean, like, it's a big, big secret...

192
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:20,852
...that women carry around
their diaphragms.

193
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:25,489
You never know when
you're gonna need it.

194
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:32,865
I should be going.

195
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,990
- So we'll talk about the hooks then.
- Yes.

196
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:43,039
- What, was it something I said?
- She's a virgin. She just told me.

197
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:46,882
- Well, I didn't know.
- Well, it's not like spotting a toupee.

198
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:53,052
Well, you think I should
say something?

199
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,887
Should I say something, apologize?

200
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,185
- Was I being anti-virgin?
- No, no.

201
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,515
- I mean-
- Because I'm not anti-virgin.

202
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:03,357
- I'm gonna- I'll be right back.
- Don't- Elaine. Elaine.

203
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,687
<i>- Yeah?
- It's George.</i>

204
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:09,701
- She's a virgin?
- A virgin.

205
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:12,953
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

206
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:16,455
I'm very attracted to her.
That accent is so sexy.

207
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,951
I don't think I could do it.

208
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,915
They always remember
the first time.

209
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,759
I don't wanna be remembered.
I wanna be forgotten.

210
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:28,218
You need a little pioneer spirit.
You don't have any of that...

211
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:30,261
...Lewis and Clark in you.

212
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,224
You know, sometimes those guys
don't make it back.

213
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,182
- I'm really hungry.
- Yeah, me too.

214
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:41,349
We gotta get something.
I don't wanna go...

215
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,518
...on an empty stomach.
Let's get Chinese.

216
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:46,399
- Wanna order?
- All right, then we gotta get work done.

217
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:49,573
Let me just call Kramer.
See if he wants anything.

218
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,278
Hey. We're ordering Chinese food.

219
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:54,362
If you want anything,
let me know what...

220
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:57,705
...and I'll order it...

221
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,951
...for you.

222
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:03,166
- I'm in. Let's go for it.
- All right. What do you want?

223
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,792
- I don't care.
- All right.

224
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,875
Let's get a couple of dishes
and share.

225
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,628
- All right.
- What are you getting?

226
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:11,340
- I think I'm gonna get a chow fun.
- What's a chow fun?

227
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:13,305
It's a broad noodle.

228
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:16,641
- What do you mean "a broad noodle"?
- It's a big, flat noodle.

229
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:19,343
Well, I don't want a big, flat noodle.

230
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:24,182
- What kind of noodle do you want?
- Who says I want a noodle?

231
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,851
I'm getting the chow fun.
You don't have to have any.

232
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,363
I'll get the pea pods, and you can't
have any of my pea pods.

233
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:33,071
- Fine.
- And get extra MSG.

234
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,663
Look, Marla, this whole sex thing
is totally overrated.

235
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,459
Now, the one thing
you've gotta be ready for...

236
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,959
...is how the man changes into
a completely different person...

237
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:50,677
...five seconds after it's over.

238
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,927
I mean, something happens
to their personality.

239
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:56,090
It's really quite astounding. It's like...

240
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:59,849
...they committed a crime and wanna
flee the scene before police get there.

241
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:03,888
- So they just leave?
- Yeah. Pretty much, yeah.

242
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:08,693
Well, the smart ones start working
on their getaway stories during dinner.

243
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:11,484
How, you know, they gotta
get up early tomorrow.

244
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:13,484
It's always about being up early.

245
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,533
They all turn into farmers suddenly.

246
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:19,284
It must be really good
to put up with all that.

247
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:26,166
Let's go. We don't have time
before the meeting.

248
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:27,880
The food. What happened to Ping?

249
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,421
Don't worry, he'll be here.
We only got two hours.

250
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:34,008
We need to come up with one good
idea, we can get through this meeting.

251
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,469
There's your food.

252
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,218
Hey, what about this?

253
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:41,512
I'm in a car accident.
The motorist is uninsured.

254
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,395
- You with me?
- Yeah.

255
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,141
My car's totalled.

256
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:47,807
It's all his fault. Now, he has
absolutely no money.

257
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:50,274
There is no way
that he could pay me.

258
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:52,688
So the judge decrees...

259
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:54,442
...that he becomes my butler.

260
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:57,659
- Your butler?
- Right.

261
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:00,995
He cooks my food, cleans my house,
does my shopping, there you go.

262
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:02,624
That's your program.

263
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,579
- What about me?
- Don't worry.

264
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:06,791
We find something for you.

265
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:11,545
That's the stupidest idea
I ever heard.

266
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:14,801
Sentenced to be a butler.

267
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:18,177
- Ping, what happened?
- There was an accident.

268
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:20,092
Head hurts.

269
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,016
- Head really hurts.
- What happened?

270
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,391
Marla and I went out for coffee,
and I was crossing the street.

271
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:30,520
He was biking towards me,
so I got out of the way in time.

272
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:32,687
He ran into a parked car,
hit his head...

273
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:34,322
...and everything went flying.

274
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,613
Something happened to the food?

275
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:38,529
Could only save one bag.

276
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:40,909
Should I call an ambulance?
Wanna see a doctor?

277
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,740
I'll get some ice.

278
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:45,667
The pea pods? All you saved
was the pea pods?

279
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:47,703
- Hey, you got the food?
- Yeah, here.

280
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,752
Man, what took you so long?
Hey, Ping.

281
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:52,040
- Kramer.
- Yeah.

282
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,958
- Where's yours?
- He dropped it.

283
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,053
Oh, that's too bad.

284
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:01,176
You should slow down.
It's dangerous to go that fast.

285
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,556
No, no, I have green light.
You jaywalk.

286
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:05,601
<i>- Are you watching Oprah?
- I did not.</i>

287
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,265
You're giving him back that TV.

288
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:09,313
- Yes, you jaywalk.
- No, I don't want it.

289
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,191
Jaywalker. I can slap a suit on you.

290
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,688
- What?
- We've got work to do.

291
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:15,399
- What about the meeting?
- An hour with Patrick Swayze.

292
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:22,909
A month and a half we had.
We did nothing.

293
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,618
We put it off until today.
We couldn't do anything...

294
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,163
...because Elaine runs
to apologize to a virgin...

295
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,621
...crosses against the light and
knocks over a Chinese delivery boy.

296
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:34,584
Now we're gonna make
fools of ourselves. We got nothing.

297
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:38,293
You're not even in show business.
I got a reputation.

298
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,008
You're dragging me into
the sewer with you.

299
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,388
I've been on TV, buddy boy.

300
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,770
You know how fast word spreads
in show business? Just like that:

301
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:51,058
One bad impression,
you're out of the business!

302
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,232
Let's postpone it.
Let's get out of here.

303
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:54,730
What? They know we're here.

304
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:58,569
I'll fake an illness. My back!
My back! I can't move my back!

305
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:00,116
No, no. Would you get up?

306
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:02,609
- I could do this, Jerry.
- No.

307
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:05,277
All right, I'll tell them
that my sister died.

308
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:07,532
My poor sister died.

309
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,543
She was standing on the street,
and then she was laughing...

310
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,166
...and then they shot her!

311
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:15,545
That's the kind of a sick city
we're living in!

312
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:17,459
They shoot you for laughing!

313
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:20,304
I must go and comfort my poor family.
Jerry, come on.

314
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:23,887
Take me home so I can comfort my-
My poor family.

315
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,016
- What?
- That's David Letterman.

316
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:28,011
I just saw David Letterman walk by.

317
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:30,978
Be right back.

318
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:33,022
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready
for you now.

319
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,907
Yes, I was very wise
to hitch my wagon to his star.

320
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:46,991
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

321
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:48,824
How you doing?
Nice to see you all.

322
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:52,035
- Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

323
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:54,499
- Where's Russell?
- He had to go to L.A.

324
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:56,545
<i>There's a problem on the set
at Blossom.</i>

325
00:15:56,882 --> 00:16:00,714
Oh, poor Blossom.

326
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:02,760
Anyway, he asked me
to sit in for him.

327
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,592
- Where's George?
- He ran to talk to David Letterman.

328
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,554
- David Letterman's on the floor?
- Yeah, he just walked by.

329
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,476
I think we should
get started, anyway.

330
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,726
Yeah. Good idea.

331
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:19,108
- So how are you guys coming along?
- Good. Good.

332
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,521
We've got a number of ideas.

333
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,074
Good.

334
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,660
Have you been to
a Chinese restaurant...

335
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,665
...and they say five minutes
for a table, and you wind up...

336
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,039
...waiting there for 30 minutes?

337
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:36,253
Well, we thought it would be
very funny...

338
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:37,964
...to do an entire show...

339
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:40,539
...where all you're doing
is waiting for the table.

340
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,424
Because we've all
been in that situation.

341
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:51,511
You know, you're- You're waiting,
and you're hungry...

342
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:54,688
...and you bump into somebody
you know.

343
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:02,237
- When is Russell coming back?
- So that's the idea?

344
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:05,151
Well, no. That's one.

345
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,654
We have many others.

346
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,487
We have an idea where-

347
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:14,163
I-I get into an accident with a guy
who has no insurance...

348
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,707
...and the judge sentences him
to be my butler.

349
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:22,873
You know, and he cooks.
He has to cook for me.

350
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:24,676
And cleans my house...

351
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:27,003
...and he's doing my shopping,
you know.

352
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:31,508
And I'm walking around with
one of those big neck-collar things.

353
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,512
Those collars are funny.

354
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:37,808
You see somebody in one of those,
you start laughing immediately.

355
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:41,067
Are you telling them
the butler story?

356
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:43,478
Is that beautiful or what?

357
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,197
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

358
00:17:45,574 --> 00:17:47,198
Russell?

359
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,700
- I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, Rita.

360
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,531
Hey, Mr. Schirmack. How are you?

361
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:56,075
Good to see you, Stu and Jay.
Always a pleasure. Hi, sweetie.

362
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:58,956
Yeah, yeah, that butler idea,
that's beautiful, isn't it?

363
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:00,623
Is that a killer?

364
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:03,170
- I thought I was getting the butler.
- Don't worry.

365
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:05,500
We'll find something for you.

366
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:16,601
So Letterman didn't
spark to your idea, huh?

367
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,518
He said there was nothing
he could do and next time...

368
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:22,099
...I should probably break
the Prozacs in half.

369
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,644
<i>Hey, wanna hold it down.
I'm watching JEOPARD Y!</i>

370
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:27,229
Would you give him back the TV?

371
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:29,738
By the way, Susan called for you
a minute ago.

372
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,946
I'll bet they're probably doing
somersaults about us over there.

373
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:36,039
You think they get butler stories
like that every day?

374
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:41,872
Who is Joseph Cotten? Giddyup.

375
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:44,587
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, it's me. It's Georgie boy.</i>

376
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,881
<i>- What's going on?
- What's going on?</i>

377
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:49,258
<i>What's going on? I'll tell you
what's going on.</i>

378
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,089
<i>I'm fired.</i>

379
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:52,593
Fired, why?

380
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,225
<i>Because you kissed me.</i>

381
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:56,551
<i>You kissed me, you stupid idiot.</i>

382
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:59,682
<i>Rita called Russell, and he fired me
over the phone.</i>

383
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,184
What is pi?

384
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,731
Giddyup again. I'm killing, man.

385
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:07,479
But I didn't- I had no idea-
I didn't realize.

386
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:11,488
<i>You didn't realize? How could you
not realize? You're stupid.</i>

387
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,329
<i>You are a stupid, stupid man.</i>

388
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:16,572
I just feel terrible.
This is just terrible.

389
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:19,074
What is the cha-cha?

390
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:20,579
Yes, indeed.

391
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:23,667
<i>I'll speak to you later.</i>

392
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,373
This is great. He fired her!

393
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:32,922
This is incredible. He fired her!
I'm out, baby! I'm out!

394
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:36,015
- Why'd he fire her?
- Because I kissed her in the meeting!

395
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:38,426
Russell found out. He fired her
over the phone!

396
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:41,094
Finally, my stupidity pays off!

397
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:44,772
What is " Here Come De Judge"?
"Here Come De Judge"!

398
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:48,862
You can't break up.
Her life is shattered. You got her fired.

399
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:52,565
You gotta be there for her. You gotta
wait until she gets another job.

400
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:55,412
- Another job?
- A couple of interviews.

401
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:58,284
Oh, this is unbelievable.

402
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:00,533
I'm stuck.

403
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,536
Every time I think I'm out...

404
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:05,166
...they pull me back in.

405
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:15,426
Are you going to want to leave
after it's over?

406
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,176
You know, if we have sex.

407
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:20,425
What, leave? Where, why?

408
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:23,138
You know, the apartment.

409
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,188
- Why would I? This is my apartment.
- Well, what if it was my apartment?

410
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,353
Who gave you this idea
I would wanna leave?

411
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:33,066
Well, Elaine said men like to leave
after it's over.

412
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:35,732
I wouldn't put stock in
anything Elaine has to say...

413
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,402
...about relationships.
She comes from a broken home.

414
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,115
I mean that literally. A tree fell
on the roof and cracked the structure.

415
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:45,459
Her parents got along beautifully,
but the house was in bad shape.

416
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,129
Maybe I should be going.

417
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,924
- And what else did you say to her?
- Nothing.

418
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:55,301
I was just giving her
the straight dope.

419
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:58,764
More like a dope was giving it
to her straight.

420
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:01,804
Another cup of coffee with you,
she'll wind up in a convent.

421
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:05,021
Listen, there was a lot more
I could've told her, believe me.

422
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,515
And leaving after sex?
Did I leave with you?

423
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:09,815
You might have, if I had stayed.

424
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,401
So you know what,
I got served with papers today.

425
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:17,867
Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as
a witness, so you better be nice to her.

426
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:19,365
I was trying to be.

427
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:21,870
Look at George.
He lucked out, huh?

428
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:25,494
You're not kidding. Who figured
Susan would break up with him?

429
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:27,329
- They had a good thing going.
- Yeah.

430
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:29,543
Since she met him,
she's been vomited on...

431
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:31,624
...her family cabin's been
burned down...

432
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,548
...learned her father's a homosexual
and got fired from a high-paying job.

433
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:39,757
Yeah, they had
a real good thing going.

434
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,058
What do I do?

435
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,510
Well, actually, I'm a writer.

436
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:50,315
In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot
for NBC right now.

437
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:52,943
A sitcom?

438
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:56,564
How can you write that crap?

439
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:59,945
Carol. This guy's writing a sitcom.

440
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,077
A sitcom?

441
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:08,746
A sitcom.

442
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,415
Can you imagine?

443
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:14,040
And he actually tried to use it
to hit on me.

444
00:22:14,217 --> 00:22:18,132
In ancient tribal cultures,
they would actually sacrifice a virgin.

445
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:21,923
I mean, they would find some girl
that had never been with anybody...

446
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,849
...and throw her into a volcano.
There's a first date you'll never forget.

447
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:29,806
She winds up in heaven,
talking with Chuck Woolery, so...

448
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:34,770
"Tell me, Lisa, how did the date end?"
"Not well, Chuck. Not well."

449
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:39,074
"Well, if you'd like to be thrown into
a volcano again, we'll pay for it."
