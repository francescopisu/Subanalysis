1
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:06,473
Ever called someone and were
disappointed when they answered?

2
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:08,717
You wanted the machine.

3
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:10,174
You're always thrown off.

4
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:14,137
You go, "Oh, I-I didn't know
you were there.

5
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:18,977
I just wanted to leave a message
saying, 'Sorry I missed you.'"

6
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:22,860
So here's two people who hate each
other, don't really ever wanna talk...

7
00:00:23,158 --> 00:00:26,361
...but the phone machine
is like this relationship respirator...

8
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:29,205
...keeping these marginal,
brain-dead relationships alive.

9
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:33,951
We do it so when we come home,
you can see the little flashing red light.

10
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:35,751
You go, "All right, messages."

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,913
You see, people need that.

12
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:41,375
It's very important for human beings
to feel popular and well-liked...

13
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:44,006
...amongst a large group of people
we don't care for.

14
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:54,891
Well, this is it.

15
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:56,724
Oh, this is nice.

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,687
- Thanks again for the Chinese food.
- Oh, you're welcome.

17
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:02,613
- I think I ate too much of that garlic.
- Me too.

18
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:06,606
I ate the whole plate. I didn't know.
I thought they were peanuts.

19
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:15,035
<i>You know what, I think Naked Gun
is on. Oh, I've seen it.</i>

20
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:17,374
I laughed through that whole thing.
Wanna watch?

21
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:18,956
No.

22
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,788
- I mean, I don't think so.
- I thought you liked to laugh.

23
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,460
I thought you were
happy-go-lucky.

24
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:28,629
No, no. I'm not happy,
I'm not lucky, and I don't go.

25
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:30,971
If anything, I'm sad-stop-unlucky.

26
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:35,311
That's not funny, Naomi.
I didn't mean to be funny there.

27
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,479
<i>Why don't you check the TV Guide?
I think Holocaust is on.</i>

28
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:47,023
<i>Jerry, it's George. You all set for the
week end? This is gonna be great.</i>

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,860
<i>You'll have a great time with Naomi.</i>

30
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:50,826
<i>All right, she's got that laugh.</i>

31
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:54,329
<i>What'd you say, it's like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?</i>

32
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,954
<i>I was thinking we'd take two cars
up to the cabin.</i>

33
00:01:57,126 --> 00:01:59,368
<i>That way, you know, if one of us
wanted to stay-</i>

34
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:05,211
This thing has never worked right.

35
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,011
You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?

36
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,763
Well, first of all, Elmer Fudd
is one of the most beloved...

37
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:16,267
...internationally known
cartoon characters of all time.

38
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,015
"I'm gonna kill that cwazy wabbit."

39
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:23,649
Come on! Not only that, a juicer
is one of the healthiest ways-

40
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,446
It makes juice, it extracts the pulp
and- And then the vitamins.

41
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:32,696
For long life and vitality.

42
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,367
How could you leave
a message like that?

43
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,284
How could you play it to just anyone?

44
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,835
I didn't think you'd leave it.

45
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:43,206
- I didn't think you'd play it.
- Now she's not coming this weekend.

46
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:46,216
What do you mean, not going?
We got plans. Call her up.

47
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:48,008
Ah, it's better anyway.

48
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:50,253
I mean, really.
What was gonna happen?

49
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,799
I'm a comedian. How can I go out
with a girl with a laugh like that?

50
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:57,637
It's like Coco Chanel going out
with a fishmonger.

51
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:03,607
You know, she's with all the perfumes,
and a fishmonger's a pretty bad smell.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,822
Well, maybe you should ask Elaine.

53
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,232
But if I ask Elaine,
Kramer will feel slighted.

54
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:15,109
Oh, no, no. Don't say anything
to Kramer. Susan can't stand him.

55
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:17,826
He vomited all over her.

56
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,616
Wait a minute. Do you smell smoke?

57
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:24,546
- Ah, Kramer.
- Hello, boys.

58
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:26,374
Top of the morning to you.

59
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,257
What do you say? What do you be?

60
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,841
Put that thing out before you start
another fire.

61
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:32,506
You had to give him cigars.

62
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:35,884
So, what are you guys
doing this weekend?

63
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,758
- Ah, we're...
- Because I'm gonna be playing golf...

64
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:41,558
...at the Westchester Country Club.

65
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:43,605
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?

66
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:47,475
That's right, buddy.
It's private. It's very private.

67
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:52,313
I met the pro at the golf shop up on
49th Street. I gave him a Cuban...

68
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:54,484
...and he invites me for a free round.

69
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,954
Then he says, anytime I lay one of
these on him, it'll be the same deal.

70
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:00,617
- Wow.
- Isn't that beautiful?

71
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:03,247
Man, I'm gonna be hitting
the links all weekend.

72
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,584
- Gee, that's- That's too bad.
- Yeah. Too bad.

73
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:11,041
- Why? What? What?
- Because we were just saying...

74
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,295
...we were gonna ask you
to the country.

75
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:16,342
Susan's father has a cabin up there,
but all right.

76
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,467
They got any
golf courses up there?

77
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:20,885
No, no, no.

78
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:23,304
- No, no, that's pie country.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,604
Yeah, they do a lot of baking up there.

80
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:27,981
They sell them by the road.
Blueberry, blackberry.

81
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:30,311
- Blackberry, boysenberry.
- Boysenberry, huckleberry.

82
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:32,611
- Raspberry, strawberry.
- Strawberry, cranberry.

83
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:34,406
Peach.

84
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:40,279
- I don't know.
- Come on, I don't wanna tag along...

85
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:42,994
...with George and Susan.
With you, it's a better group.

86
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,831
- What's that?
- Oh, it's an autographed picture...

87
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:49,088
...for my dry cleaner. I never know
what to write on these things.

88
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,130
I hate doing this.

89
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,095
"I'm very impressed"?

90
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,596
You mean " pressed"
because it's a dry cleaner?

91
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,974
Yeah, see? That's why I hate it.

92
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,137
So come on, you wanna go?

93
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:08,272
Well, what about the sleeping
arrangements in the cabin?

94
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:14,482
Well... Same bed,
and underwear and a T-shirt.

95
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,034
- What about me?
- Well, you'd be naked, of course.

96
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:23,283
- Excuse me. Jerry Seinfeld?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:27,206
My names Sanger, Mel Sanger.
I drive that truck out there.

98
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:29,122
- The Yoo-hoo?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:32,132
- I love Yoo-hoo.
- Yes, it's a fine product.

100
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,755
<i>I saw you on The Tonight Show
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

101
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:37,216
I was watching the show
with my son Donald.

102
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:40,223
He's got this rare immune deficiency
in his blood.

103
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:44,223
The damnedest thing. Doctors say
he has to live in a plastic bubble.

104
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:46,055
Can you imagine that? A bubble.

105
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,974
- A bubble?
- A bubble?

106
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,976
Yes, a bubble.

107
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,648
- Do you mind? May I?
- Oh, sure.

108
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,562
It'd break your heart
seeing him in there.

109
00:05:57,742 --> 00:06:01,692
He's like a prisoner.
No friends. Just his mother and me.

110
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:05,074
And I'm out there six days
a week hauling Yoo-hoo.

111
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:10,081
We have sacrificed everything,
all for the sake of our little...

112
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,413
...bubble boy.

113
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:15,960
- Excuse me.
- Oh, here.

114
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:26,849
Excuse me.

115
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:30,018
Anyway, we were watching
you on TV...

116
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:31,650
You get in the bubble with him?

117
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:34,024
No. He can see through the bubble,
it's plastic.

118
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:38,145
- Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
- No. It's clear.

119
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,033
Who has the remote?

120
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,612
He does.

121
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,695
The remote goes through the bubble?

122
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:46,908
Yeah. He's in the bubble
with the remote.

123
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,289
So you have no control
over the remote?

124
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,369
No. It's frustrating.

125
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,539
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

126
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,922
So anyway,
you're his favourite comedian.

127
00:06:57,093 --> 00:06:58,753
He laughed so hard the other night...

128
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:01,134
...we had to give him
an extra shot of haemoglobin.

129
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:03,884
That's nice.

130
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:05,766
Tomorrow is his birthday.

131
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:10,063
And it would mean so much to him
if you could find it in your heart...

132
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:14,394
- ...to pay him a visit and just say hello.
- Oh, well, tomorrow, I-

133
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,234
Jerry. Of course he'd pay him a visit.
You'd be happy to.

134
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:21,105
Yeah. Okay...

135
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:24,450
Tomorrow. Where do you live?
Uptown? Up Westside?

136
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,658
- No. Upstate.
- Upstate.

137
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,411
He's a bubble boy!

138
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:37,422
- A bubble boy?
- Yes, a bubble boy.

139
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:40,842
- What's a bubble boy?
- He lives in a bubble.

140
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:42,679
Boy.

141
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:47,806
What kind of a bubble, like an igloo?

142
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:51,844
No, that's what I thought. It's
a piece of plastic dividing the room.

143
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,893
What kind of plastic do you think it is?
Like that dry-cleaning plastic?

144
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,977
That's no good.

145
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:00,360
He wouldn't last 10 minutes in there.

146
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:03,070
What can I do?
I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.

147
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:05,116
It's his birthday.
I can't go to the cabin.

148
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:08,619
- Well, where does he live?
- I don't know. Upstate. Fall-something.

149
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,707
Wait a minute. This is right
on the way to the cabin.

150
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:15,920
Oh, all right. Beautiful. So you stop in,
visit the bubble boy for 20 minutes...

151
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,713
- ...then we can go.
- You think so?

152
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:20,799
I know exactly where this is.
You can just follow us.

153
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,127
Oh, great. Okay, we're going away.

154
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:25,795
- I think I'm excited.
- I'm excited.

155
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:29,425
Oh, you're gonna love this cabin.
My grandfather built it in 1947.

156
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:33,018
- It's incredible.
- There you go. It's a '47 cabin.

157
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:36,060
- So we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

158
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:38,226
Well, hey.

159
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:40,567
Very nice. Very nice.

160
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:43,899
- Well, I'm off to the links.
- Yeah.

161
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,866
I wanna thank you
for the invite upstate.

162
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:47,233
I'm sorry I can't make it.

163
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:49,487
- The what?
- Nothing. Let's get going. Come on.

164
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,740
- Did you-?
- No, no, we'll talk about it later.

165
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,751
Is that one of the cigars
my father gave you?

166
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:01,757
Hey, what's with George and Susan?
Does he actually like her?

167
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:05,425
I don't know if he likes her
as much as he likes it.

168
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,263
Oh, that's nice.

169
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:09,471
What's he doing? What is his hurry?

170
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:12,429
Oh, you know George.
He's gotta make "good time."

171
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:16,268
He once went from West 81st St.
to Kennedy airport in 25 minutes.

172
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,184
I never heard the end of it.

173
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:20,103
Look at him.

174
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:22,734
Would you stop that, please?
Just stop that.

175
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:25,989
- Why?
- Knock it off. You're distracting me.

176
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:28,281
We're making incredible time here.

177
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:33,447
I once made it to Kennedy airport
from West 81 St. in 15 minutes.

178
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,413
Oh, here. Hold this.
It's $10 for the tolls.

179
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,788
What's he doing?
Is he out of his mind?

180
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,799
Do you see him? I don't even
see him anymore. Where is he?

181
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,625
- Isn't that blue car him?
- No, no, that's not him.

182
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:47,922
What happened to him?
I can't believe it. I lost him.

183
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:49,591
That stupid idiot.

184
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:52,054
- Now what are we gonna do?
- It's no big deal, Jerry.

185
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,266
We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

186
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:56,476
I don't even know
where the bubble boy lives.

187
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,889
I don't even remember the name
of the town.

188
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,604
- You don't have the directions?
- No, I was following him!

189
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:03,485
How could you not take the directions?

190
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:05,896
Because he's my directions.

191
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:11,321
I don't see them, George.

192
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:13,951
You make plans,
then he goes 100 miles an hour...

193
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:16,116
...the weekend's over just like that.

194
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:17,996
Poor little bubble boy.

195
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:21,668
He's sitting there waiting for you
in his bubble or igloo thing, whatever.

196
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,330
I don't know what to do.
I don't know where I am.

197
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:27,878
Just get off at this exit.
We'll figure something out.

198
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:31,764
We lost them. Do you know that?
We lost them.

199
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,177
Well, it's not my fault.

200
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,020
Seinfeld can't drive.
How hard is it to follow somebody?

201
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:38,226
Well, now what are you gonna do?

202
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:41,275
It's fine. We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

203
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:43,603
Does he have the address?

204
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:52,235
Yeah.

205
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,532
<i>Leave a message,
I'll call you back. Thanks.</i>

206
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:03,119
<i>Hi, Jerry. It's Naomi.</i>

207
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,417
<i>Listen, if it's not too late,
I changed my mind.</i>

208
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:09,676
<i>- I'd like to go to the cabin.
- Wait. Wait.</i>

209
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:12,217
Yeah, hello. Hi.

210
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:14,181
This is Kramer.

211
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,841
Yeah. I'm the next-door neighbour.

212
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:21,979
You know, Jerry's left, but listen,
you see, my golf game got cancelled.

213
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,976
I'm thinking of going up myself.

214
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,485
They got pies,
and I got the directions right here.

215
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,034
I drive all the way
to the country club...

216
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:37,742
...and then I find out
there's a tournament going on.

217
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:40,455
- You mind if I smoke?
- No.

218
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:42,251
These are Cubans.

219
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,973
I don't know if this is the house.

220
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:58,514
I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.

221
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:02,054
Would you stop it?

222
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,769
Would you quit it, please?
Someone is gonna see us here.

223
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:06,602
So what?

224
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:09,102
You are such a prude.

225
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,818
Hey. I am not a prude, sweetheart.

226
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:14,695
I swing with the best of them.

227
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:16,945
- Come on, let's go in.
- What?

228
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:20,406
We should tell them what happened.
They might be very late...

229
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,156
- ...if they make it all.
- I can't go in there.

230
00:12:23,586 --> 00:12:25,044
I can't face the bubble boy.

231
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:29,793
- What's the matter?
- I don't react well to these situations.

232
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:33,926
My grandmother died two months early
from how I reacted in the hospital.

233
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,219
She was getting better.
Then I paid her a visit.

234
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,963
She saw my face, boom.
That was the end of her.

235
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:40,602
- We're going in.
- Wait, please-

236
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,640
- Come on, George. George, stop.
- Would you wait one moment-

237
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,772
I can't believe a little thing
like George speeding...

238
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:53,148
...and my whole weekend is gone.
The plans, the packing. Everything.

239
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:55,945
Your whole weekend?
What about the bubble boy?

240
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,992
Why do you keep bringing up
the bubble boy?

241
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:00,913
You don't have to mention him.
I know about the bubble boy.

242
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,576
I'm aware of the bubble boy.

243
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,834
Why do you keep reminding me
about the bubble boy?

244
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:12,343
I'll have a cup of coffee
and a turkey club.

245
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:15,179
- How about you?
- I'll just have a glass of water.

246
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:19,015
You can't just have water.

247
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,177
Why not? That's all I want.

248
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,843
This isn't a park bench
where you come in and sit down.

249
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,563
It's a business.

250
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:29,269
Hold it a second.

251
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,021
Don't you play on TV?

252
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:35,689
- Oh, no.
- Yes. Yes, you saw him on TV.

253
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,192
- What's your name?
- Jerry Seinfeld.

254
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,370
- Elaine...
- Gary Seinfield.

255
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:43,780
<i>- I saw you on The Tonight Show.
- Right.</i>

256
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,784
Wouldn't you like
an autographed picture?

257
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:49,083
I don't have any more pictures, Elaine.

258
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:51,627
He's lying. They're in the trunk.

259
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,634
- Now you get to sign another one.
- I'm not lying.

260
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,711
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

261
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,597
She'll have a cup of coffee
and a broiled chicken.

262
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:06,386
See, it's not really a bubble.

263
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:11,481
A lot of people think it's an igloo,
but it's really just a plastic divider.

264
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,578
Can you go in the bubble?

265
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:26,914
Well, you have to put so many things
on because of the germs.

266
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:29,836
The gloves, the mask,
it's a whole production.

267
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:32,076
So then he makes his own bed?

268
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:35,673
Well, that's one of the things
we fight about.

269
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,005
Would you like to meet him?

270
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:41,097
- Ah, well, you know-
- Oh, he loves games.

271
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,341
Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit
with him.

272
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:47,510
Hey, Ma! What the hell do I gotta
do to get some food around here?

273
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:51,763
I'm starving. And if it's peanut butter,
I'm gonna shove it in your face!

274
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:04,071
- One picture left in the trunk.
- Thanks. This is fun.

275
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:06,697
Yeah, this turned out to be
a great weekend.

276
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,451
Where's my water?

277
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,951
Oh, it's coming.

278
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:13,752
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

279
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,922
What'd you write?

280
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:18,629
"Nothing's finer
than being in your diner."

281
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:28,303
There is " nothing finer than being
in your diner"?

282
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:31,480
- No good?
- This is what you came up with?

283
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:33,143
Well?

284
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:35,025
That is so lame, Jerry.

285
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:38,978
People will be reading that for the
next 20 years and laughing at you.

286
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:42,158
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

287
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:44,318
Would you mind?
I'd like the picture back.

288
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:46,950
- Why?
- I'm not happy with what I wrote.

289
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:50,035
- It's good. I like it.
- No, believe me, it's not good.

290
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:52,332
I'll mail you one with something
really funny.

291
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:55,254
Well, when you mail me a new one,
I'll send you back this one.

292
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,747
You don't understand.
I want the picture.

293
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,335
Right.

294
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,553
This is Donald.

295
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:10,973
- Hi.
- Hello.

296
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:12,344
Who are you?

297
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:15,014
- Where's Seinfeld?
- He's on his way.

298
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:16,686
These are his friends.

299
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,689
What are you looking at?

300
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:21,436
Never seen a kid in a bubble before?

301
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:27,365
Of course I have. Come on.

302
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:30,373
My cousin's in a bubble.

303
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,749
My friend Jeffrey's sister also,
bubble, you know...

304
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:37,541
I got a lot of bubble experience.
Come on.

305
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:42,166
- What's your story?
- I have no story.

306
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:44,467
She works for NBC.

307
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:47,010
How about taking your top off?

308
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:50,803
Donald, behave yourself.

309
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:52,602
Come on.

310
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:54,479
I know, I know.

311
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,890
Why don't you play
a game of Trivial Pursuit?

312
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,894
Ah, you know, we gotta be running-

313
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:00,777
What, are you afraid?

314
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:05,700
- No. You see, it's-
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

315
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:08,904
I was nice enough
to give you the picture.

316
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,828
I don't like what I wrote. I don't want
it up there. Please just give it back.

317
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:15,908
You are really starting
to get under my skin.

318
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:18,755
- I want that picture.
- Well, you can't have it.

319
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,674
In fact, maybe you better
just pay your check, and get out.

320
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:23,918
I'm not paying until I get that back.

321
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:25,921
Well, you ain't getting it back.

322
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:28,883
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.

323
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:33,184
This chicken is really good.

324
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:38,437
Okay, history.

325
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,352
This is for the game.

326
00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:42,651
How you doing over there?

327
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:45,444
Not too good.

328
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,489
All right, bubble boy.

329
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,653
Let's just play.

330
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:54,115
"Who invaded Spain
in the eighth century?"

331
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,414
That's a joke. The Moors.

332
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,661
Oh, no.

333
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,296
I'm so sorry. It's the " Moops."

334
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:03,671
The correct answer is the Moops.

335
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:06,879
Moops? Let me see that.

336
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:10,711
That's not Moops, you jerk.

337
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:13,133
It's Moors. It's a misprint.

338
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,726
I'm sorry. The card says Moops.

339
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:23,441
It doesn't matter. It's Moors.
There's no Moops.

340
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:26,940
- It's Moops.
- Moors.

341
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:30,360
- Moops.
- Moors!

342
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:35,867
Hey!

343
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,827
Anybody home?

344
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:42,582
- Oh, boy.
- What should we do?

345
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:45,879
Hold these pies.

346
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,422
Okay.

347
00:18:58,313 --> 00:18:59,642
Help. Someone...

348
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:02,899
- There's no Moops, you idiot!
- Stop it! Let go of him.

349
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:06,235
Donald. Stop it.
Now, let go of him, Donald.

350
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:09,026
- I'm gonna kill him.
- He's choking me.

351
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,026
- Donald. Stop.
- Moors!

352
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,612
Say Moors!

353
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,328
Moops. Moops.

354
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:16,405
Donald, stop it.

355
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:28,422
What are you doing?
You're choking me. Elaine!

356
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:31,678
- Are you gonna pay today?
- No, I want that picture back!

357
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:33,555
Something's happened
to the bubble boy!

358
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:35,515
- They're rushing him to hospital.
- What?

359
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:37,973
The bubble boy?
He lives around here?

360
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:39,555
That's his house, down the road.

361
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,272
He got in a fight with some guy.

362
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,728
Who kind of a person would hurt
the bubble boy?

363
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,059
Some little bald guy from the city.

364
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:50,565
Come on, Vern. Page, Preston, don't
you think we ought to do something?

365
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,949
Naomi, come on, let's get going.

366
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,077
But that lake must be freezing.

367
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:58,907
No, it's good for you.

368
00:19:59,082 --> 00:20:01,158
Retards the aging process.

369
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,082
Ready to go swimming?

370
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:09,669
Let's go.

371
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:11,088
Okay.

372
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,761
Jerry, what happened to you?

373
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,394
What happened to you?
You were going 100 miles an hour.

374
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,274
I was not.
Bubble boy tried to kill me.

375
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:28,067
- What?
- Susan, tell them.

376
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:30,478
It's a long story.

377
00:20:31,448 --> 00:20:34,153
- Hey, Seinfeld.
- Hey, happy birthday.

378
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:35,737
Thanks for showing up.

379
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,616
- You know, your friend tried to kill me.
- He's a lying snot.

380
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,698
He's a cheater, aren't you,
little twerp?

381
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,202
- Moors!
- Moops!

382
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,416
- Moors!
- Moops!

383
00:20:44,586 --> 00:20:47,955
There's the guy who tried to kill
the bubble boy. Get him!

384
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,592
Fire engines.

385
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,513
Must be a big one.

386
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:09,983
Do you smell something?

387
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:11,779
- Yeah.
- Smoke.

388
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:14,070
Yeah. Definite smoke.

389
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,741
Look, it's a fire!

390
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,568
Holy cow, look at that!

391
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,329
- It's my father's cabin!
- The cabin is on fire.

392
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,337
I just realized, you never gave
me back the change from the tolls.

393
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:33,333
How could this have happened?

394
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,008
Oh, my God. The cabin.

395
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:39,557
What are you two doing here?

396
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:41,384
Look at that.

397
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,561
Hey, you didn't:

398
00:21:45,564 --> 00:21:47,437
My Cubans.

399
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,976
Something very scary
and exciting about fire.

400
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:54,613
People always run to see a fire.

401
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,616
They're very proud
if they have a fireplace.

402
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,156
I think that's what smoking
is really all about.

403
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,570
That's the power of smoking.
It's just this thing:

404
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:05,120
"I got fire right here in my hand.

405
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:09,207
Smoke and fire is literally
coming right out of my mouth."

406
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:11,455
And it's very intimidating
to the nonsmoker.

407
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,174
It's like talking to someone going:

408
00:22:13,341 --> 00:22:15,381
"My head could open up.
Lava could explode out.

409
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,588
Pour right down my face.
Doesn't bother me a bit."

410
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,716
And a cigar is even worse.

411
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:22,433
I mean, a cigar is like:

412
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:27,144
You think this end is bad.
Look at this wet, disgusting nub, huh?

413
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,721
How scary is that?
