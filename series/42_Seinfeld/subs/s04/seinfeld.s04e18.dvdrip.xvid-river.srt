1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,195
The life expectancy now is 72,
I think, for men.

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:08,413
Seventy-five or six
or something for women.

3
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:11,076
It's amazing to think that
a couple thousand years ago...

4
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:13,081
...life expectancy was 30.

5
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:17,420
Which, in our terms, would mean you
get your driver's license around 5...

6
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:20,595
...you'd marry at 9, divorced at 15.

7
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:23,681
In your late teens,
you move down to Florida.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,017
I guess that's how spring break
got started. I don't know.

9
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:29,345
And eventually people
say things about you, like:

10
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:32,096
"Well, it's amazing, he's 28,
but he's still very alert.

11
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:35,644
His mind is so sharp, you would think
you're talking to a 2-year-old."

12
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:44,027
What's the point?

13
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:50,290
When I like them, they don't like me.
When they like me, I don't like them.

14
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,957
Why can't I act with ones I like
the way I do with ones I don't?

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,627
Well, you've only got another 50 years
or so to go and it'll all be over.

16
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:04,596
Maybe I need someone
who doesn't speak English.

17
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,972
Yeah, how about a mute?

18
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:09,971
A mute would be good.

19
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:12,646
Where you gonna meet a mute?

20
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:16,066
This is what my life has come to:
Trying to meet a mute.

21
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:19,781
I don't know, Jerry.
Something's missing.

22
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:23,648
There's a void, Jerry.
There's a void.

23
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:26,662
A deep, yawning chasm.

24
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,160
Well, there's gotta be more to life
than this.

25
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,741
What gives you pleasure?

26
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,793
Listening to you.

27
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:37,501
I listen to this for 15 minutes,
I'm on top of the world.

28
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:39,999
Your misery is my pleasure.

29
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:42,466
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, how you doing?

30
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:46,469
Good. Okay. Well, it's all set.
I start tomorrow.

31
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:49,179
- Start what?
- I signed up to do volunteer work...

32
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:51,475
- ...with senior citizens.
- Really?

33
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:54,351
Yeah. God. I can't tell you how I feel.

34
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:58,189
I mean, I feel so good.
I really feel good.

35
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:01,196
The strange thing is, I mean,
I haven't even met the woman yet.

36
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,855
- Volunteer work?
- What are you gonna do down there?

37
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:06,655
They say all it is is you go
over to their apartment and...

38
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:09,615
...you take them out for a walk
and you get a cup of coffee...

39
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,031
...and it's supposed
to make them feel good.

40
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,367
That's what I do with him.

41
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:18,373
Wait. When did you get this idea?

42
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:20,291
Last time I had lunch with you here.

43
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:23,468
You were going on and on and on
about how you wanna...

44
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:25,843
...meet somebody
who didn't speak English.

45
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:30,510
What, do you break it in with her
then you try it out on me?

46
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:34,521
- And anybody could do this?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,231
Really?

48
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,356
Helping people.

49
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:40,729
Of course.

50
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:42,398
Of course.

51
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,861
It makes perfect sense.

52
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:47,275
How could I not be doing this?

53
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:50,737
- I am gonna help somebody, damn it.
- What about you?

54
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:52,194
No, it's not for me.

55
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:54,662
Jerry, if anybody should
be doing this, it's you.

56
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,669
What kind of a person are you?

57
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,997
I think I'm pretty much like you.

58
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:02,664
Only successful.

59
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,882
This is a wonderful thing.
They're so grateful...

60
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,518
...to have someone to talk to.

61
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,974
And I can tell you
that everyone who participates...

62
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:17,103
...finds the experience
extremely rewarding.

63
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:19,065
Well, I feel better already.

64
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:21,522
I mean, I'm feeling like
a good person.

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,980
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,280
Thank you.

67
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:28,740
Hey, hey, what's your guy's
name again?

68
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,950
Fields. Sidney Fields.

69
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,454
Eighty-seven years old.
Eighty-seven.

70
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:39,369
- How about your guy?
- Ben Cantwell, 85.

71
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:41,206
You think we'll make it to that age?

72
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,041
We? No.

73
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:47,426
- Hey.
- Hey.

74
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,090
So, what's up, diggety-dog?

75
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:56,352
George and I just signed up with
the senior citizens volunteer agency.

76
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,801
Same thing Elaine's doing.

77
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,391
Oh, that's too bad.

78
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:01,817
Don't say I didn't try to warn you.

79
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:05,982
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, Jerry, I'm surprised at you.

80
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:07,982
- What?
- It's a con.

81
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,321
These agencies are usually a front
for some money-laundering scheme.

82
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:13,871
Or they're bunco artists.

83
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:17,739
Bilking people out of their life savings.
Oh, yeah.

84
00:04:18,877 --> 00:04:21,831
- Where do you get this?
- The alternative media, Jerry.

85
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:24,081
That's where you hear the truth.

86
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:26,629
Kramer? Kramer?

87
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:31,178
Kramer! Where are you? Kramer!

88
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:33,921
Come on, I'm in here. Come on.

89
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:36,012
- There you are.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:38,759
Hello, Newman.

91
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:43,523
Jerry. George. So did you ask him
about the records?

92
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:44,973
- Well-
- What records?

93
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:50,527
Newman and I are going partners,
selling used records.

94
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:59,081
You know Ron's Records
down on Bleecker?

95
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,828
They pay big cash for used records.

96
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:02,911
So we thought if you had any
of those big...

97
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:05,875
...old-fashioned useless records
just lying around, you know-

98
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:07,709
We'd take them off your hands. Free.

99
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:10,885
Let me ask you something.
What do you do for a living, Newman?

100
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:13,592
I'm a United States postal worker.

101
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:16,717
Aren't those the guys
that always go crazy...

102
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:19,051
...and come back with a gun
and shoot everybody?

103
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:21,977
Sometimes.

104
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:27,067
- Why is that?
- Because the mail never stops.

105
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,359
It just keeps coming and coming
and coming.

106
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:30,989
Never a letup. It's relentless.

107
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:33,944
Every day it piles up more and more
and you gotta get it out...

108
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:35,613
...but more keeps coming in!

109
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:38,907
Then the bar code reader breaks,
and it's Publishers Clearing House day!

110
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:40,742
All right, all right, all right.

111
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,408
Just take the records.
They're in the bedroom. Take them.

112
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:46,160
- Take anything you want.
- Yeah, yeah.

113
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,461
I'll give you 5 bucks.

114
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:54,471
- Five bucks?
- Five bucks?

115
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,553
- Do you know what those are worth?
- Yeah, I do. Five dollars.

116
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,849
Those records are worth more
than 5 dollars.

117
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,929
- He's gypping us.
- You're gypping us.

118
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:06,356
<i>Well, what do you got? You know,
you got Don Ho Live In Honolulu.</i>

119
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:09,610
<i>You got Jerry Vale
Sings Italian Love Songs.</i>

120
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,937
And you got Sergio Mendes.
Now, come on!

121
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,440
Wait, wait, wait. Sergio Mendes
has a cult following.

122
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:16,111
Why, they follow him like a cult.

123
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:18,243
Can't walk down the street
in South America.

124
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:22,327
Look, that's his problem, all right?
Now, you don't like it? Too bad.

125
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,872
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it.

126
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:26,669
Then get out of my store, all right?

127
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:29,922
You bring me something decent,
I'll give you some money.

128
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,297
- All right, we'll be back, Jack.
- All right.

129
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,295
- Come on.
- We'll be back...

130
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,751
...Jack.

131
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,304
Hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.

132
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:48,981
- Agency?
- Yeah. Is this Sid Fields' residence?

133
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:52,568
- Sid Fields?
- What the hell is it?

134
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:54,149
- Mr. Fields?
- What?

135
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:56,696
Hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.

136
00:06:56,868 --> 00:07:01,197
The agency? What agency?
The CIA?

137
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,996
- No, no, the senior-
- Who let you in here?

138
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,325
- The woman.
- Oh, her.

139
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:11,710
She steals from me. Steals my money.
She says she doesn't speak English.

140
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:14,456
My ass, she doesn't speak English.

141
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:18,336
Plays that freaking voodoo music.

142
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:21,432
Tries to hypnotize me.

143
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:23,843
She thinks she's gonna turn me
into a zombie...

144
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,680
...and then rob me blind.

145
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:28,480
Well, I wasn't born yesterday.

146
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,647
I might drop dead today, but I
sure as hell wasn't born yesterday.

147
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,860
Now, get the hell out of my house.

148
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:38,480
But, Mr. Fields, I'm here
to spend some time with you.

149
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,652
Oh, really?

150
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:44,328
Are you the boyfriend?
I know she's got a boyfriend.

151
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:48,117
Are you gonna kill me?
I'm an old man, for crying out loud.

152
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:50,370
You gonna kill an old man,
you coward?

153
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:52,954
No, Mr. Fields. Look. Really. I'm-
Here's my ident-

154
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:56,217
I can't read that, you fool.

155
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:59,422
- Well, what's all this stuff?
- Trash. Garbage.

156
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,802
You're throwing this out?

157
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:05,972
I believe that's what you do
with garbage, you idiot.

158
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:09,641
Really? You don't want any of this?

159
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:15,688
Well, if I wanted it, I wouldn't be
throwing it away, would I, Einstein?

160
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,319
I have friends that would really love
to have these.

161
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:22,820
Well, take it. I sure as hell am not
gonna give it to my family.

162
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:25,913
Well, do you wanna go out and go
for a walk, get a cup of coffee?

163
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:27,197
With you?

164
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,414
I'd rather be dead.

165
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:32,329
Well, maybe I'll get going, then.

166
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:36,250
I just remembered I got
an appointment to get my tonsils out.

167
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:39,545
Good. Thank God. Good riddance.

168
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,509
Oh, listen, before you go...

169
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:45,220
...would you mind
changing my diaper?

170
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:54,526
Oh, I feel great for 85.

171
00:08:54,694 --> 00:09:00,150
You know, the average life span
for an American male is, like, 72.

172
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,736
You're really...

173
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,580
...kind of pushing
the envelope there.

174
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:10,578
I'm not afraid to die,
and I never think about it.

175
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:12,294
You don't?

176
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:14,787
Boy, I think about it a lot.

177
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:16,423
I think about it at my age.

178
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:19,461
Imagine how much
I'll be thinking about it at your age.

179
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:22,589
All I'll do is keep thinking about it
till it drives me insane.

180
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:25,219
I'm grateful for
every moment I have.

181
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:27,300
Grateful?

182
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:31,521
How can you be grateful
when you're so close to the end?

183
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,895
When you know that any second:

184
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:36,986
It could all be over.
I mean, you're not stupid.

185
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:39,395
You can read the handwriting
on the wall.

186
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:42,324
It's a matter of simple arithmetic,
for God's sake.

187
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:45,153
I guess I just don't care.

188
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,616
What are you talking about?

189
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,828
How can you sit there
and look me in the eye...

190
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:53,249
...and tell me that you're not worried?
Don't you have any sense?

191
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,664
Don't you have a brain?

192
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:57,126
Are you so completely senile
you don't even know...

193
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:59,125
...what you're talking about
anymore?

194
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,423
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

195
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:04,346
Life's too short to waste on you.

196
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:08,381
- Whoa, whoa, please.
- Get out of my way.

197
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:13,350
But, Mr. Cantwell,
you owe me for the soup.

198
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:28,117
- Mrs. Oliver?
- Yes, my dear?

199
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:37,577
- What's the trouble? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:40,424
Yeah- Yes. Yeah.

201
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:44,378
It's my goitre, isn't it?

202
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:49,468
Did you say goitre? What goitre?

203
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:55,185
This football-shaped lump
jutting out the side of my neck.

204
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:01,895
That goitre.

205
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:04,653
Hey.

206
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,076
What do you know?

207
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,324
Does it bother you?

208
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,991
Bother me?

209
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:19,743
Why would a little goitre like that
bother me?

210
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:24,002
No. Not a bit. It's nothing.
It's nothing. It's...

211
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:27,759
In fact, it's very distinctive.
You know?

212
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,600
I mean, you wanna
know something?

213
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:33,257
I wish I had one.

214
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,974
Really.

215
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:42,443
<i>Come on, Elaine, it's just a goitre.</i>

216
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:46,443
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I can't look the woman in the face.

217
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:51,198
I mean, I keep thinking that goitre's
gonna start talking to me.

218
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:56,540
You'd think that they'd mention that
before they sent you over there.

219
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:00,789
"Oh, by the way, this woman
almost has a second head."

220
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:05,631
But no, no.
I didn't get any goitre information.

221
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:10,463
They really should mention that in the
breakdown. Height. Weight. Goitre.

222
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,383
You know, you try to do some good.

223
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:15,761
You wanna be a good person,
but this is too much to ask.

224
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,606
Well, I'd rather talk to a goitre
with a nice disposition...

225
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:21,145
...than the nut they sent me to.

226
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:24,645
Georgie, what happened
with your guy?

227
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,734
I don't think it's gonna work out.

228
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,482
- What do you mean?
- He fired me.

229
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,530
He fired you?

230
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:36,824
How do you get fired
from a volunteer job?

231
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:42,417
I don't know. I was just talking
to the man, and he walked out on me.

232
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:44,830
Well, I don't know about you two,
but I'm quitting.

233
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,881
I hate my guy.

234
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,624
He's a mean, mean guy.

235
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:52,421
- I wish I could quit.
- So quit.

236
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:54,757
Yeah, I'm a great quitter.

237
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:57,469
It's one of the few things I do well.

238
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:00,052
I come from a long line of quitters.

239
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:03,315
My father was a quitter.
My grandfather was a quitter.

240
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,975
I was raised to give up.

241
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:09,358
- Hey.
- Hey.

242
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:11,608
Well, here's your albums.

243
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:13,527
- What happened?
- Five dollars.

244
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:17,036
- He offered us 5 dollars.
- What kind of stuff you listening to?

245
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,199
You embarrassed me at that store.

246
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,948
That guy thought we were
a couple of total squares.

247
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:24,167
Oh, yeah,
you and your Sergio Mendes.

248
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,672
Hey, that guy can't even go
to the bathroom in South America.

249
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,384
You should have seen the albums...

250
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,959
...this old guy I was visiting today
was throwing away.

251
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:35,507
Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson,
Benny Goodman.

252
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,767
- Wait, he's throwing them out?
- I asked if my friends could have them.

253
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,561
- He said, "Yeah."
- The coot's sitting...

254
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,473
- ...on a mountain of gold.
- Yeah.

255
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:44,557
You have to get them.
I'm not carrying them.

256
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,141
- But you're gonna come.
- Yeah. I'm going there today.

257
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,359
In fact, you should see
this housekeeper.

258
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,190
She's from Senegal.

259
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:54,070
Wild, wild stuff.

260
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:55,571
Senegal?

261
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:01,663
So you don't speak
any English at all?

262
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:05,837
- English? No.
- No.

263
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:07,997
Hey, what are those bums
doing back there?

264
00:14:08,174 --> 00:14:10,250
You said they could come
and take the records.

265
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:14,720
It's like watching a couple of hyenas
going through the garbage.

266
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,756
- You don't speak any English?
- No English.

267
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:25,764
I would like to dip my bald head in oil
and rub it all over your body.

268
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,604
You don't understand.

269
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,780
It's a miracle.

270
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:36,898
You don't understand
because you don't speak English.

271
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,987
So I just don't know
if this arrangement-

272
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:42,033
Hey. Hey. I don't like
what's going on around here.

273
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,414
- I want all of you bums out of here.
- Calm down-

274
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:46,245
- Don't tell me to calm down.
- Please-

275
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,294
- Get your hands off me.
- Cool it, pops.

276
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,706
- Why, you little-
- Wait, wait, Mr. Fields.

277
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:53,961
He's biting me!

278
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,302
My teeth. My teeth!

279
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,264
Where's his teeth?
Where's his teeth?

280
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,844
I saw something fly over here.

281
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:03,094
Well, turn the light on.

282
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:06,054
That's the garbage disposal.

283
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:12,152
My teeth. You idiots.

284
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:15,073
Well, we'll take you to your dentist.
Where's your dentist?

285
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:16,486
- Downtown.
- All right.

286
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,529
George, Kramer, look after Mr. Fields.
I'll go get the cab.

287
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:21,945
Bunch of morons.

288
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,630
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where's the old man?

289
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,004
I thought George
was keeping an eye on him.

290
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:34,582
- Me? I thought you were.
- Come on, we lost the old man.

291
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,844
Let's go. Get out of the car.
Go. We've gotta find him.

292
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:40,006
He can't have gotten far.

293
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:51,563
And we would take
long automobile trips.

294
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,571
- Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
- Yes, and...

295
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:57,823
...just staring out the window...

296
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:04,196
...you'd see a long view
of rolling pastures and...

297
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:09,664
- Get you going, right there.
- ...and very big Brahman cows and...

298
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:13,087
- Oh, cows? Oh, that's...
- Yeah, that was when...

299
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:17,302
- ...fascinating.
- ...I began my affair with Mohandas.

300
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:23,056
- What?
- Mohandas.

301
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,469
Gandhi?

302
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:30,556
The passion.

303
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:38,146
The forbidden pleasure.

304
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:43,234
You had an affair with Gandhi?

305
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:48,991
He used to dip his bald head in oil...

306
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:55,291
...and he'd rub it all over my body.

307
00:16:56,258 --> 00:16:58,381
Here. Look.

308
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:02,133
Oh, my God.

309
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:05,387
The Mahatma?

310
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:09,469
- We're looking for the old man.
- Oh, we will. We will.

311
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:12,183
Twenty bucks.

312
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:14,564
Twenty bucks?
Are you out of your mind?

313
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:18,946
- Take it or leave it.
- We got Al Jolson here. Al Jolson!

314
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:21,487
Al Jolson. What the hell do I care
about Al Jolson?

315
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:24,232
I'd just as soon hear
you sing " Mammy."

316
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,367
This guy is nothing
but a piece of crap.

317
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,074
You are nothing but a piece of crap.

318
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:32,414
What did you call me?

319
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,911
- A piece of crap.
- A piece of crap.

320
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:39,383
- I find you extremely ugly.
- I find you extremely ugly.

321
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:43,300
- Do you?
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.

322
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:48,549
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
- Oh, is that right?

323
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:52,392
- I loathe you.
- I loathe you.

324
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:54,142
That's it. Get out of my store.

325
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:56,273
- Make us.
- Make us. Make us. Make us.

326
00:17:56,443 --> 00:18:00,144
- I'll make you.
- Wait a minute. Wait! Wait!

327
00:18:01,824 --> 00:18:03,697
Do you realize how irresponsible
this is?

328
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:06,655
Our agency's sole purpose
is to care for senior citizens.

329
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:08,987
And in one fell swoop
you have single-handedly...

330
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:11,074
...destroyed our reputation.

331
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,701
Yes, but...

332
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:18,542
- Yes?
- It's Tim Fields. Mr. Fields' son.

333
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:20,839
All right, come on up.

334
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,708
Oh, great.

335
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:25,840
I don't know what happened.
We tried to take him to the dentist.

336
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,972
Why were you taking him
to the dentist?

337
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,811
Well, his false teeth got mangled up
in the garbage disposal.

338
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,304
What were his teeth doing
in the garbage disposal?

339
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,807
- Well, after he bit my friend-
- Bit your friend?

340
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:42,185
What the hell is going on here?
How do you lose a human being?

341
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:44,606
- I am sorry.
- And who were these other people?

342
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:46,491
What were they doing
in the apartment?

343
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,946
Well, I brought them up there
to take his records.

344
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:51,664
Take his records?

345
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:54,833
Do you realize how valuable
that record collection is?

346
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:56,745
- Hey!
- There you are. Did you find him?

347
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,165
No.

348
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:01,292
We took the records over to Ron's,
and he tried to screw us...

349
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:03,459
- ...and then we got in a fight.
- A real melee.

350
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:05,593
Yeah, a real brouhaha.

351
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:11,516
- Then all the records broke.
- The records? My father's records?

352
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:15,054
- Did anybody try and call him?
- Yeah, I called, but there's no answer.

353
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,475
Well, the line's busy now.

354
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:19,318
The line's busy. He must be home.

355
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:41,294
We...

356
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,754
We couldn't find him.

357
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,928
What the hell's the point?

358
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,008
When you like them,
they don't like you...

359
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:55,019
...and when they like you,
you don't like them.

360
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:57,263
Oh, you don't know what you want.

361
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,099
You should see a psychiatrist.

362
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:01,812
I got fixed up last week.

363
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:04,061
I never would get fixed up.

364
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:07,073
I go to pick her up,
and she opens the door...

365
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:12,483
...and she's got this huge goitre
growing out of the side of her neck.

366
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:15,201
Looked like a football.

367
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,786
- What did you do?
- Well, we get to talking...

368
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:22,626
...and as it turns out,
the woman knew Gandhi.

369
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,923
We talked for hours.

370
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:28,299
Well, are you gonna see her again?

371
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,140
We were getting along real good...

372
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:33,465
...and then she made some tea.

373
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:36,215
Put some milk in it
without asking me.

374
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:38,471
Now, that's a turnoff.

375
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:40,893
You don't need that.

376
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:42,347
The thing about old people...

377
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:44,400
...is everything about them
gets smaller.

378
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,152
You know, their bodies get smaller.
They move into smaller places.

379
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:50,779
They sleep less time,
they eat smaller meals.

380
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,952
Except the car. The older they get,
the bigger their car gets.

381
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,829
I've never understood that.

382
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:58,323
Old people have a way
of backing out of the driveway.

383
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,540
Know what I mean?
They don't turn side to side.

384
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:03,166
They just go, " I'm old.
I've been waiting a long time.

385
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:06,542
I'm backing it out. " You know?
"I'm coming back.

386
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:09,837
Watch out. I'm coming," you know.
And you've gotta watch out for them.

387
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:13,131
And then once they get out there
they drive so slowly.

388
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,346
I would think the less time
you have in life...

389
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:17,510
...the faster you would wanna go.

390
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:20,177
I think old people should be allowed
to drive their age.

391
00:21:20,355 --> 00:21:22,348
If you're 80, do 80.

392
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:24,268
If you're 100, go 100.

393
00:21:24,443 --> 00:21:28,523
They can't see where they're going
anyway, let them have fun out there.
