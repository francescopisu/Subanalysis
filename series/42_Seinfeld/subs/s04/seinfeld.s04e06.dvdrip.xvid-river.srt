1
00:00:02,637 --> 00:00:04,428
<i>Here's what happened last week.</i>

2
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:07,801
George and I went up to NBC, and
we told them the idea for the series.

3
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:09,221
We're waiting to sign the contract.

4
00:00:09,394 --> 00:00:12,311
- Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
- We're gonna sign it.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,556
In fact, George is out with
the woman from NBC right now.

6
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:16,601
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to pass.

7
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:19,813
- You're passing?
- Well, it's much too low.

8
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:21,861
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.

9
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:24,320
- Is it the one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

10
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,532
- Where's that watch we bought you?
- It's at the jeweller.

11
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:28,161
I would like somebody to hit me.

12
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,989
What's the matter
with this Davola guy?

13
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:31,445
He's after Jerry now.

14
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:35,201
I never had a back problem until that
night I slept on the convertible sofa.

15
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:39,708
Cuban cigars.
It's a present from my father.

16
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:41,045
- Here you go.
- What, cigars?

17
00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:42,248
Yeah, Cubans.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,925
- What's wrong?
- The Velcro.

19
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:49,850
I can't stand Velcro.
That tearing sound.

20
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:52,390
Now, listen to me. I'm negotiating.

21
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:55,847
Negotiation.
This is what you do in business.

22
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:57,851
- Leave all my stuff here?
- Leave it.

23
00:00:58,026 --> 00:00:59,853
Tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?

24
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:01,605
He has this power over me, okay?

25
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:05,279
He has this way of manipulating
every little word that I say.

26
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,277
He's like a Svenjolly.

27
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:10,121
Tell this guy you're seeing somebody
else. That's the easiest way.

28
00:01:10,288 --> 00:01:12,411
His name is Kramer.

29
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:14,456
I want you to tell this young man
to give me a call.

30
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,123
My wallet's gone! My wallet's gone!

31
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:18,326
Where did you get that watch?

32
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,794
I found it in the garbage can.

33
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:24,583
What kind of an idiot throws away
a perfectly good watch?

34
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:29,130
It's an entire industry of bad gifts,
all those executive gifts.

35
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:33,560
Any stupid, goofy, brass,
wood thing.

36
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,886
They put a piece of green felt
on the bottom.

37
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:40,228
"It's a golf, desk, tie
and stress organizer, Dad."

38
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,605
Well, to me, nothing compares
with the paperweight as a bad gift.

39
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,946
There's no better way than a
paperweight to express to someone...

40
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:50,402
...that, " I refuse to put any thought
into this at all."

41
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:55,873
Where are these people working that
papers are blowing right off of desks?

42
00:01:56,042 --> 00:02:00,253
Are the desks screwed to the back of a
flatbed truck going down the highway?

43
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,747
Are they typing in the crow's-nest
of a clipper ship?

44
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,466
What do you need
a paperweight for?

45
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,548
I don't understand this jeweller,
Jimmy Sherman.

46
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:17,055
He brings a watch, takes over a week
to fix it. He fixed yours in one day.

47
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,685
Oh, you know these jewellers.
They're enigmas.

48
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:22,479
They're mysteries wrapped
in a riddle.

49
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:26,312
- She's very attractive.
- She's okay.

50
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,114
- Just okay?
- She's nice.

51
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,359
- She's better than nice.
- She's all right.

52
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:32,611
- She's beautiful.
- She's not beautiful.

53
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:35,408
- I think she's beautiful.
- So you ask her out.

54
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,206
- I'm not gonna ask her out.
- Why not?

55
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,783
If you don't think she's beautiful,
something's wrong.

56
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:41,953
She's pretty. She's not beautiful.

57
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,881
I should drop dead
if she's not beautiful.

58
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,798
- I think that's a little extreme.
- She's all right.

59
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,718
Two exact same watches.
He tells you a week and him a day.

60
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,764
How could that be?

61
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:56,678
Something's fishy about this.

62
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,640
He said what?

63
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:02,649
- "The hell with them."
- "The hell with them"?

64
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:06,685
- Those were his exact words.
- Oh, boy.

65
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:10,362
He said, "We've got 500 shows
to choose from.

66
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:15,491
Why should we give two guys with
no idea or experience more money?"

67
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,656
He was pretty emphatic?

68
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:20,370
- He pounded on his desk.
- He pounded?

69
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:22,915
I told you to take the offer.

70
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:27,132
Look, I had nothing to do with this.
It wasn't my decision.

71
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:30,758
It was Jerry. Jerry told me.
I'm the creative guy.

72
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:33,846
- He handles the business end.
- You said it was insulting.

73
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:38,428
I was quoting him. Why would I be
insulted? I'm never insulted.

74
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:42,102
You could call me " baldy," dump soup
on my head. Nothing insults me.

75
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:45,476
- Well, there's nothing I can do.
- Don't they make a counteroffer?

76
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:49,186
How can he just cancel the deal?
What kind of a maniac is this guy?

77
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:52,697
- He just says no, and that's it?
- Yeah, that's the way Russell is.

78
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,821
- He doesn't like to play games.
- He has to play. He can't not play.

79
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,573
We're playing.

80
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,912
I gotta see him.
How do I get in touch with him?

81
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:02,959
- You'll have to wait till Monday.
- No. I can't wait till Monday.

82
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:06,128
That's impossible. I gotta talk
to him now. Where does he live?

83
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,539
I can't give you his address.

84
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:12,336
- Give me that address.
- Hey, give me that!

85
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:17,682
He just wants to talk to you.
I couldn't talk him out of it.

86
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,429
So you just tell him that you're my
boyfriend and that we're in love, okay?

87
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:24,811
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, I'm your boyfriend. Yeah.

88
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:28,316
- Okay.
- Have we been intimate?

89
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,229
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.

90
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:34,814
All right, how often do we do it?

91
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:38,829
Kramer, how is that important?
Honestly, do you really think...

92
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:40,989
- ...he's going to ask-?
- He's a psychiatrist.

93
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,288
They're interested in stuff like that.

94
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,367
All right. All right. We do it...

95
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,246
...five times a week, okay?

96
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:52,342
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, my...

97
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,300
All right, listen.

98
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:57,843
- Just tell me what you'll say.
- I know what to say.

99
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:01,182
- No, but I would like to hear it.
- I don't wanna say it out loud.

100
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,970
It kills the spontaneity. You know,
Gleason, he never rehearsed.

101
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,598
- Go ahead. Do it.
- Okay. You talk to him.

102
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,934
- I'll talk to him.
- Hey, how's your hair?

103
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:11,985
Well, yeah, it's good.

104
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:16,104
You're not the type who should be
playing with matches, seriously.

105
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,870
Yes. Dr. Reston.

106
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:22,825
Is he in?

107
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:26,368
Well, this is Kramer,
and he's expecting my call.

108
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:40,881
- Is he?
- Yes, yes, Dr. Reston.

109
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,178
Well, hello there.

110
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:46,721
- Well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's.
- No, no, not friends.

111
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:51,560
We're actually- We're not friends.
We're much more than friends.

112
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:56,446
And... I'm afraid
we have a bit of a problem.

113
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:59,819
Well, the point is doctor,
I'm very much in love with Elaine...

114
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:04,241
...and she's very much in love
with me, and, well...

115
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:08,199
...we would appreciate it if
you would cease and desist...

116
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:11,248
...and allow us to pursue
our courtship unfettered.

117
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:16,585
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I
can make things unpleasant for you...

118
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:20,426
...and your staff, if you have one.

119
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:25,260
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I-

120
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:31,520
Well, no. Well, yeah, that's-
It's possible.

121
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:36,902
Well, I suppose I could, but I'd
have to shift a few things around.

122
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,951
Wait. Hold on for a second, will you?
Go ahead. Yeah.

123
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,031
All right.

124
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:48,411
Yeah. Yeah. Well, okay.
I look forward to it too.

125
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,953
Okay, so long.

126
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,287
What happened? What did he say?
What's going on?

127
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:57,248
- Okay, he wants to get together.
- Get together?

128
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:59,419
- Why?
- You know, he wants to talk.

129
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,798
Why didn't you just say no?

130
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,009
That's interesting.

131
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:11,555
- Did you enjoy your croissant?
- It was different.

132
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:14,641
- And how was yours?
- Oh, very good.

133
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,274
Try our mousse.
It'll change your life expectancy.

134
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,480
No, thanks. Just the check.

135
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:25,571
What's the matter with you?

136
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,829
- What?
- Why didn't you didn't flirt?

137
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,623
- Come on.
- She was flirting with you.

138
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,915
- Why didn't you say something?
- What would I say?

139
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:35,040
- You just sat there.
- Well, you made me uncomfortable.

140
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:38,417
You're a comedian. Couldn't you
come up with something?

141
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:41,969
- Where's the bathroom?
- In the back, on your right.

142
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,677
- Dad.
- Will you stop it. Jerry, let go.

143
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:51,059
- Jerry.
- Would you let me pay just once?

144
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,101
- You're out of your mind.
- You don't even have a wallet.

145
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,018
- Don't worry about it.
- What'll you do?

146
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:58,186
What's the difference?
We'll figure it out.

147
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:01,447
- You're not paying.
- All right, fine. You figure it out.

148
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:04,367
I'd be curious to know how you
pick up a check with no money.

149
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:07,406
Because if this works, the whole
monetary system's obsolete.

150
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,786
We're back to wampum.

151
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,205
I'm going to the bathroom.

152
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:16,087
How the hell am I gonna pay
for this?

153
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:24,171
They give you some portion here,
huh?

154
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,925
Uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't rude that
day I bumped into you on the street.

155
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:32,517
- I really did have to get to a meeting.
- Oh, no, no, I understand.

156
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:34,480
I got plenty of friends
in show business.

157
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,641
I know you're all very busy.

158
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:39,439
So you found that watch
in a garbage can, huh?

159
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:43,740
Yeah. In fact, it was right after
I ran into you.

160
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,858
You know, a friend of mine
has a watch just like that.

161
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:49,491
I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.

162
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,618
Well, I haven't seen
too many like these.

163
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,950
Yeah, I know.

164
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:58,082
Maybe you wanna sell me that one?

165
00:08:58,255 --> 00:09:00,746
Oh, sure.

166
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,385
Hang on a second.
I got a little proposition for you.

167
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:12,592
There is a George Bonanza
to see you.

168
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,269
- Costanza. Costanza.
- George Costanza.

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,931
The guy who pitched the show
with stories about nothing.

170
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,775
- Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
- Seinfeld friend.

171
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:25,153
He says call him Monday.

172
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:30,068
Mr. Dalrymple, I have to talk to you.
It's about the show.

173
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:35,163
It was all a terrible misunderstanding.
Just five minutes of your time.

174
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:38,165
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Dalrymple.

175
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:41,419
Very good, sir.

176
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,385
You don't understand.
I can't allow my son to pay for me.

177
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:49,301
Look, as soon as I get back to Florida,
I promise you, I'll mail you a check.

178
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:52,640
Why don't you just let him pay,
and then you can pay him back.

179
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,099
- No, no. He won't let me do that.
- Why don't you...

180
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,596
...put the money in his pants
pocket unsuspectingly?

181
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:01,142
- He could wash them.
- We are running a reputable business.

182
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:04,403
Don't tell me about business.
I sold raincoats for 35 years.

183
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:08,272
- But you did not give them away.
- You don't understand-

184
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:11,570
I cannot get involved with you
and your family.

185
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:13,987
Okay, now, look. Don't take too long.

186
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,371
Look at this building.
What is this?

187
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,333
I don't know. It's a building.

188
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:21,172
- The doors are on a diagonal.
- So what?

189
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:24,341
It's architecturally incorrect.

190
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:27,210
Just go.

191
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:36,430
Is this a bad time?
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

192
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:39,011
We were about to sit down to dinner.

193
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:48,984
- This is Cynthia.
- Oh, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you.

194
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:51,943
- What are you having? Veal?
- No.

195
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:54,944
- Looks like veal.
- It's not veal.

196
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,365
Well, it's a good-looking
piece of meat.

197
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,123
Wow, this is some place.
A duplex, huh?

198
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:04,130
Look, stairs in an apartment.
All my life I dreamed about...

199
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:08,212
...having steps in an apartment.
Even one step. Sunken living room.

200
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:11,376
Although one step is not
all that sunken.

201
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:16,762
- Who gave you my address?
- No, that's a fair question. It is.

202
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:20,554
Jerry. Yeah. Jerry's a friend of mine.

203
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:24,688
He gave it to me. Unbelievable
how many addresses this guy has.

204
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,395
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go
to Marlon Brando's house if I wanted.

205
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:33,733
Of course, I wouldn't. The guy is-
Obviously, the guy has his problems.

206
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,487
So you wanna talk about the show?

207
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:38,703
Well, you know,
it's really very funny.

208
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:41,626
Because, you know what we
got here, really?

209
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:44,249
We really just have a terrible
misunderstanding. See...

210
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:47,837
...when I passed on the deal, I thought
that's what Jerry wanted me to say.

211
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:51,840
<i>- I misinterpreted.
- Russell, where's the TV Guide?</i>

212
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,586
What time is it? 8:30. I'll tell you
what's on. You got...

213
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:57,386
<i>...Major Dad, Blossom-
Very funny program.</i>

214
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,848
<i>- Blossom's on Monday.
- Are you sure?</i>

215
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,021
Look who I'm talking to.
The president of NBC.

216
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,611
Mr. Costanza, it's too late anyway. I
made a deal with another writing team.

217
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:11,863
All right, look.
We're people, you and me.

218
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,570
Businessmen, colleagues, if I may.

219
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:17,448
Let's not quibble.
We'll do it for the $13,000.

220
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:20,291
Thirteen thousand, and I never
came up here. We never talked.

221
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,865
You take good care.
It's nice seeing you again.

222
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,285
- Nice meeting you. Cynthia, right?
- Now, look.

223
00:12:25,462 --> 00:12:28,000
These deals are already made.

224
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:30,380
All right. Let me just say this.

225
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:33,802
Ten thousand dollars. I'm going
below what you wanted to pay.

226
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,972
You're having your dinner. Have your
veal or whatever it is. Enjoy.

227
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:39,347
- Mr. Costanza.
- All right. That's it.

228
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:44,227
All right. Good, $8000.
Cynthia, again, nice meeting you.

229
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:48,230
Have I commented on the shoes?
I love suede. It's so thick and rich.

230
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:51,605
Do you ever rub it against the grain?

231
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:55,151
Russell, can we eat?

232
00:12:56,702 --> 00:13:00,747
- All right, 8000.
- You made Jerry very happy.

233
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:11,508
Could I just use your bathroom
for a moment?

234
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,676
All right, 200. That's as high as I can
go. I think you're being unreasonable.

235
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:20,430
Jerry, I'd give you the watch.
It's not the money. I happen to like it.

236
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,804
Look, I happen to know how much
that watch costs. It's a $60 watch.

237
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:26,517
You paid 40 to get it fixed.
That's $100.

238
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,937
- I'm offering you 200.
- I never seen a band like this.

239
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:35,820
All right, 300. Plus 50 for the repair.
Three-fifty, that's it.

240
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,783
Do you have it on you?

241
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,362
Yeah, I think I do.

242
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,955
This is unbelievable.

243
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:48,034
What the hell is going on here?

244
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:56,633
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

245
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:58,880
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you.

246
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:01,179
- Please sit down.
- Alrighty.

247
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:16,609
Could I offer you something to drink?
Coffee, anything?

248
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:21,574
Okay, yeah. I'll have a...
Do you have a decaf cappuccino?

249
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:25,829
I don't think we have that.

250
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,201
Well, that's a little strange.

251
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:34,042
- Why does that surprise you?
- Well, it's a very popular drink.

252
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:38,043
- This is an office.
- That's true.

253
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:41,680
- But, you know, I can't help but think-
- So tell me, Mr. Kramer-

254
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,259
Okay, sure.

255
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:47,101
Tell me all about you and Elaine.

256
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,809
Oh, alrighty...

257
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:54,982
Well, what we have here,
doctor, is...

258
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:58,903
- ...an extraordinary situation.
- Is it?

259
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:00,901
Oh, you'd better believe it.

260
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:12,910
You really have a terrible voice.

261
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,164
Do I know you?

262
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:18,419
- I don't think so.
- Because you really look familiar.

263
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,763
Oh, well, maybe you've seen me.
My face is on...

264
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:25,218
- ...Mount Rushmore.
- Yes, of course. That's it.

265
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,726
I guess I'm just used to seeing
it on a much larger scale.

266
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,766
Oh, yeah, right.
I replaced Teddy Roosevelt.

267
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,399
Oh, really?

268
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:37,275
Trustbuster. Bust this.

269
00:15:44,286 --> 00:15:46,824
You know, I never thought of it
like that before, doctor.

270
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:50,532
- You are absolutely right.
- I'm glad we agree.

271
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,206
Would you like a cigar?
They're Cubans.

272
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:55,455
- I'd love one.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:55,631 --> 00:16:00,174
I think Elaine is a wonderful woman.
You two will make a wonderful couple.

274
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,590
If you ever feel...

275
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:07,590
...you need to talk to someone...

276
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:10,343
...about anything,
you have my number.

277
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:12,763
Well, that's very kind of you.

278
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,684
These are good, huh?

279
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:30,493
I cannot believe I'm doing this.
I never meet people like this.

280
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,913
- You're not a nut, are you?
- No, I don't think so.

281
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,539
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I never do stuff like this.

282
00:16:41,718 --> 00:16:46,179
Really? I give my number to just about
every customer who comes in here.

283
00:16:46,765 --> 00:16:48,722
- You don't seem that desperate.
- Oh, yeah.

284
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:53,222
Actually I'm a little disappointed.
I kind of had my eye on Uncle Leo.

285
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,769
Well, I'll give you a call,
and thanks for the fish.

286
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:59,184
- You know why fish are so thin?
- Why?

287
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,401
They eat fish.

288
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:26,012
- Hey.
- What happened?

289
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,219
- What took you so long?
- He's a terrific guy.

290
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,762
What are you talking about?
What did he say?

291
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:33,971
- We talked about a lot of things.
- You talked about a lot of things.

292
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:36,185
Well, did you talk about us?

293
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:41,611
<i>I'm in love. I just met her outside
in the street. Her name's Elaine.</i>

294
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:44,982
<i>She is the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.</i>

295
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:47,567
<i>Did you say Elaine?</i>

296
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:51,952
How come with the psychiatrist,
every "the hour" is only 50 minutes?

297
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:55,076
What do they do with that
10 minutes that they have left?

298
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,666
Do they just sit there going,
"Boy, that guy was crazy.

299
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:03,253
I couldn't believe the things
he was saying. What a nut.

300
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:06,296
Who's coming in next?
Oh, no, another headcase."

301
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:12,260
- You should've told me it didn't work.
- I know, I know.

302
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:15,720
- You didn't have to throw it out.
- I was always late. It was frustrating.

303
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,805
I'm sorry. I really am.

304
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:20,651
- That must be Leo.
- I would've taken you to the airport.

305
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:23,106
- He has nothing to do.
- Neither do I.

306
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:24,898
<i>- Yeah?
- It's George.</i>

307
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:26,815
Come on up. It's George.

308
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,825
- Oh, George.
- Whatever happened with NBC?

309
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:33,405
- George turned it down.
- He turned it down?

310
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,988
- Why did he do that?
- Because of Ted Danson.

311
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,915
- What does he have to do with it?
- Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.

312
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,578
Who knows? Maybe we'll wind
up getting more money.

313
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:45,290
- Hey.
- Hey, Georgie boy. How are you?

314
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,341
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
How are you?

315
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:49,753
What's the matter with you?

316
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:52,926
- What did I do?
- What about NBC? Hear anything?

317
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,341
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

318
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:58,350
We got a deal.

319
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:03,727
You see, he had the right idea.
Hold out.

320
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:06,025
That's how you get the big money,
huh, George?

321
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:09,363
- Please, Morty.
- He knows how to talk to these people.

322
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,858
No one's gonna take advantage
of Georgie.

323
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:15,037
I'm just happy to be working
with your talented son...

324
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:19,072
...who is not doing this for the money.
That is so refreshing.

325
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:21,290
- So, what did we get?
- Eight thousand dollars.

326
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:25,245
- Beautiful.
- That's for the two of us.

327
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:29,298
- Four thousand apiece?
- Let me see if I understand this.

328
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:33,514
In other words,
you held out for less money.

329
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:37,598
- I was wrong. You were right.
- The basic idea of negotiation...

330
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:42,396
...as I understand it
is to get your price to go up.

331
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:45,765
- You're smart. I'm dumb.
- This is how they negotiate...

332
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:48,566
...in the Bizarro World.

333
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,815
That's gotta be Leo.

334
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:52,900
<i>- Yeah.
- It's Leo.</i>

335
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:55,532
- All right, we're coming down.
- Let's get going.

336
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:59,404
Dad, before we go,
I got a little something for you.

337
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,741
- A present.
- A present?

338
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:08,038
Hey, look at this, a wallet.
Exactly what I needed.

339
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:10,174
- You see?
- Come on, you lost your wallet.

340
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:13,298
- I figured I'd get you another.
- I hope you didn't spend too much.

341
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:16,923
This is one of the most thoughtful
gifts anyone's ever given me.

342
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,932
- He's something, your son, isn't he?
- All right. Let's go.

343
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:24,141
- You're a terrific kid.
- Yeah, he's something, isn't he?

344
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:26,771
How can anybody not like you?

345
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:29,145
- You're very special.
- Yeah.

346
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:31,776
I'm good for about $4000.

347
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:37,485
- Hey, let's go. It's 12:22.
- All right, Leo.

348
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:40,580
- Hey, Uncle Leo. How you doing?
- Hi, hi. I got it.

349
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:43,619
This is some beautiful parking spot
you've got here.

350
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:45,786
- I hate to give it up.
- Yeah.

351
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:47,836
Dad, you're sure you don't
need more money?

352
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,331
- Jerry.
- All right, I'm just joking.

353
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:52,086
Listen, have a nice trip.

354
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,388
- Bye, Mrs. Seinfeld. Take care.
- Thanks again for the wallet.

355
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,882
- Morty, always a pleasure.
- Yes.

356
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,384
Take care, now. So long.

357
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:06,190
- Yeah, like he'd take your money.
- He took it. I put $400 in the wallet.

358
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:09,193
He lost all that cash. It was the
only way I could give it back.

359
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:14,106
- Otherwise, he wouldn't accept it.
- I'd love to see the look on his face.

360
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:18,532
- You believe this?
- What?

361
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:20,862
- It's Velcro.
- You're kidding.

362
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,953
Who needs this? Leo, let's go.

363
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:43,678
The main difference between women's
and men's wallets is the photo section.

364
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:47,978
True? Women carry with them a photo
of every person they've ever met...

365
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,316
...every day in their whole life
since the beginning of time.

366
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:53,693
Every picture's out of date.
You know what I mean?

367
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:57,197
"Here's my cousin, 3 years old.
She's in the Marines now.

368
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:01,116
This is my dog. He died during
the Johnson administration."

369
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:04,029
You get stopped by a cop.
No license, no registration.

370
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:06,366
"Here's 56 people that know me."

371
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:10,870
Cop goes, "Just wanted to make sure
you had some friends. Move it along.

372
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:13,374
Routine pal check."
