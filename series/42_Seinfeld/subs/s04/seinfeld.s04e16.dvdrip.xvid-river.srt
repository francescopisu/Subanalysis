1
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:08,054
I'm tired of pretending I'm excited
every time it's somebody's birthday.

2
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:10,931
What is the big deal?
How many times do we have to...

3
00:00:11,104 --> 00:00:13,310
...celebrate that someone was born?

4
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:17,099
Every year, over and over.
All you did was not die for 12 months.

5
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:20,028
That's all you've done,
as far as I could tell.

6
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:22,604
I love the astrology things
that tell you the people...

7
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:24,490
...that have the same birthday
as you.

8
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:26,450
It's always an odd group of people.

9
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:29,406
It's like Ed Asner,
Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.

10
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,120
I don't wanna live.

11
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:39,870
I don't wanna live!

12
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:42,751
Because of me?

13
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:46,094
You must be joking. Who wouldn't
wanna live because of me?

14
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:48,589
- I'm nothing.
- No.

15
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:51,851
- You're something.
- You can do better than me.

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,104
You could throw a dart out the window
and hit someone better.

17
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:56,601
I'm no good.

18
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:59,016
You're good. You're good.

19
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:00,736
I'm bad. I'm bad.

20
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:02,695
You're killing me!

21
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:05,651
So what could I do?
I couldn't go through with it.

22
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:07,403
She threatened to kill herself.

23
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:09,368
Over you?

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,072
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,292
- Well-
- I'm trying to get in touch...

26
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:18,833
...with Sharon Leonard.
She works for the NYU paper.

27
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:22,255
This is Jerry Seinfeld. She was
supposed to meet me for an interview.

28
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,916
Oh, what are you gonna get
Jerry for his birthday?

29
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:27,134
- I got him a great gift.
- Really? What?

30
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:29,179
<i>I got two tickets
to see Guys and Dolls.</i>

31
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,970
Oh, that is a good gift.

32
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,472
Maybe he'll take me.

33
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:37,105
No, I'm gonna go with him.

34
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,602
What did you get him?

35
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:42,312
- I got him a two-line phone.
- Really? That's good.

36
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:44,563
Unbelievable. She's not there.

37
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,942
- What paper does she write for?
- For the NYU school newspaper.

38
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:51,154
She's a grad student in journalism.
Never been to a comedy club.

39
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,989
Never seen me.
Has no idea who I am.

40
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:55,157
Never even seen you?

41
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,993
Gotta kind of envy that.

42
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,836
You know, you've been developing
quite the acid tongue lately.

43
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,423
Really?

44
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:08,424
Who do you think is
the most unattractive world leader?

45
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:10,678
- Living or all-time?
- All-time.

46
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:14,015
If it's all-time, there's no contest.
It begins and ends with Brezhnev.

47
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:17,015
I don't know. Did you ever
get a good look at De Gaulle?

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,315
Lyndon Johnson
was uglier than De Gaulle.

49
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:23,858
I got news for you. Golda Meir
could make them all run up a tree.

50
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,654
Golda Meir. Good one, babe.

51
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:31,696
Hey, come here. Come here.

52
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:34,906
Those two girls behind you,
they're eavesdropping.

53
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:39,242
- Really?
- You know just because you two...

54
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:41,043
...are homosexuals, so what?

55
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:48,209
I mean, you should come out of
the closet and be openly gay already.

56
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,303
So, what do you say?

57
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:57,475
You know you'll always
be the only man I'll ever love.

58
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,306
What's the matter with you?

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,896
- Come on. Go along.
- I'm not going along.

60
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,152
I could just see you in Berlin
in 1939 goose-stepping past me.

61
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:09,321
"Come on, Jerry.
Go along. Go along."

62
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:12,065
- You're no fun.
- You know, I hear that all the time.

63
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:14,532
- Hear what?
- That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.

64
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,412
People ask me that about you too.

65
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:20,246
Yeah, because I'm single,
I'm thin, and I'm neat.

66
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,579
And you get along well with women.

67
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,328
I guess that leaves me in the clear.

68
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:31,215
Hi, Jerry, it's Sharon Leonard
from the NYU paper.

69
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:33,878
I'm here at the coffee shop,
and I was a little late.

70
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:35,515
We must have missed
each other.

71
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,427
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Me too.

72
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:41,682
I'll be here for a little while longer,
and I'll try to hook up with you later.

73
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:51,984
- Hey.
- Hey.

74
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,701
I just thought of a great name for
myself, if I ever become a porno actor.

75
00:03:58,122 --> 00:04:01,289
Oh, yeah? What? Buck Naked?

76
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,959
Yeah. How did you know that?

77
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:08,126
You told me that already.
Like two months ago.

78
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:10,625
Let me ask you something.

79
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:13,086
What do you think of this shirt?

80
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:16,047
Well...

81
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,132
Allison bought it for me.

82
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:24,851
- How you gonna get out of that one?
- I don't know.

83
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,811
I guess I have to wait for her to die.

84
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:32,775
<i>- Yeah?
- Sharon from NYU.</i>

85
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:34,277
Come on up.

86
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,285
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's that reporter from NYU.

87
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:39,778
She's doing the interview.
I told her to come here...

88
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:41,331
...so we won't miss each other.

89
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,120
- Do you want me to stay or...?
- Sure, I don't care.

90
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:50,338
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm-I'm Sharon.

91
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,417
Hi, I'm Jerry.

92
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,095
- Something the matter?
- No, no. Nothing.

93
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:59,680
- You look familiar. Have we ever met?
- I'm not sure. Have we?

94
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,976
You look familiar.

95
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,517
Why don't we do this over here?
This is George.

96
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,931
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

97
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:10,311
- He'll hang around, if that's okay.
- Sure, I'd like to talk to him.

98
00:05:10,486 --> 00:05:12,609
Oh, really?

99
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:15,358
- Okay.
- Okay.

100
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,075
There we go.

101
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:22,116
- Oh, is that a problem?
- No, I just hate my voice on tape.

102
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,041
It always sounds so high and whiny.

103
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,538
- Well, shall we start?
- Fire away.

104
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:32,837
Okay, let's see. Are you just a
comedian, or do you do anything else?

105
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,879
Well, right now George
and I are writing a pilot for NBC.

106
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,713
Oh, so you also work together.

107
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,217
Yeah.

108
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:43,552
Jerry, did you wash this pear?

109
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:48,261
- Yeah, I washed it.
- It looks like it hasn't been washed.

110
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:50,766
So wash it.

111
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:54,482
You hear the way he talks to me?

112
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,406
You should hear
how my boyfriend talks to me.

113
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,117
What?

114
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,364
Hey, let me ask you something.

115
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,085
What do you think of this shirt?

116
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:10,832
It's nice.

117
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:14,258
Jerry said he didn't like it.

118
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,583
I didn't say I didn't like it.
I said it was okay.

119
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:20,011
- You said you didn't like it.
- Oh, well, so what if I don't like it?

120
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,588
Is that, like, the end
of the world or something?

121
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,594
So how did you two meet?

122
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:26,845
Oh, actually, we met
in a gym locker room.

123
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,515
Yeah.

124
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,809
Actually, it was in gym class.
I was trying to climb the ropes...

125
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:34,107
...and Jerry was spotting me.

126
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,365
And I kept slipping
and burning my thighs.

127
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:41,533
And then finally I slipped,
and I fell on Jerry's head.

128
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:46,195
We've been close ever since.

129
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:47,702
Do you guys live together?

130
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,540
- Live together?
- No, I got my own place.

131
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,037
Oh, and do your parents know?

132
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:55,879
- Know what?
- My parents?

133
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,043
They don't know what's going on.

134
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:02,841
You're that girl in the coffee shop
that was eavesdropping.

135
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:04,344
I knew you looked familiar.

136
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,976
Oh, no! No!

137
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:09,312
- I better get going.
- There's been a big misunderstanding.

138
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,055
We did that for you.
We knew you were eavesdropping.

139
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:15,649
That's why my friend said all that.
It was on purpose. We're not gay.

140
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,647
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

141
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:20,277
- Of course not.
- It's fine, if that's who you are.

142
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:22,442
- Absolutely.
- I mean, I have gay friends.

143
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:26,319
- My father's gay.
- Look, I know what I heard.

144
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:29,166
- Heard. It was a joke.
- You wanna have sex right now?

145
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,085
Do you wanna have sex
with me right now? Let's go.

146
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:36,922
Come on! Let's go, baby! Come on!

147
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:42,424
Hey, come on. Let's go.
I thought we were gonna take a steam.

148
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:46,348
- No, I don't want any steam.
- No. No steam.

149
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:49,222
Well, I don't wanna
sit there naked all by myself.

150
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:51,021
The whole thing's your fault.

151
00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:53,983
You want me to talk to her?
I'd be perfectly willing to.

152
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:56,018
- I don't think so.
- You know me...

153
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:59,278
...I walk into a room,
problem solved.

154
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:02,109
She says she'll think about it.

155
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:06,994
So what, even if it does come out.
It'll just be in an NYU paper.

156
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,198
Why don't you take your jacket off?

157
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:12,374
- No, I'm okay.
- I'm gonna try her again.

158
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,370
Boy.

159
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:17,339
Happy birthday. " Faruba!"

160
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:21,628
- Today's not my birthday.
- Well, I beg to differ.

161
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,212
Well, I think I know
when my birthday is.

162
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:26,879
Yeah, well, you'd think so,
but you'd be wrong.

163
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,884
Maybe he's right.
Maybe it is my birthday.

164
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:34,563
Would you take the jacket off?

165
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:37,649
Leave me alone. Get off
my back about the jacket.

166
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,894
- Oh, look at this. A phone.
- Yeah.

167
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:42,110
A two-line phone.

168
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:45,074
That's terrific! Thanks a lot.

169
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:47,650
Now when someone's
on the phone, I can make a call.

170
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,987
- Yeah.
- Look, Elaine, a two-line phone.

171
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:51,997
Yeah, I see it.

172
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,660
I'm gonna get one myself.

173
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:55,335
Where you going?

174
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:57,495
I gotta go return something.

175
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:00,750
I got a dial tone.

176
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,964
- Okay, this is the maiden call.
- Yeah.

177
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:05,009
Wait, wait. I wanna get the first call.

178
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,255
All right. Go to your house. I'll call you.

179
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,847
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

180
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,774
Hey, it's working. This is great.
Thanks a lot.

181
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,777
<i>- Happy birthday.
- Wait, I got a call on the other line.</i>

182
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:23,780
<i>- Okay, later.
- All right, I'll talk to you later.</i>

183
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:26,403
<i>- Hello?
- Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU.</i>

184
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:28,449
<i>- Hi.
- I was just calling to tell you...</i>

185
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:31,490
<i>...I'm not gonna play up that angle
we talked about.</i>

186
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:34,119
Oh, thank you very much.
That's great.

187
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,292
Hold on a second.
I got a call on the other line.

188
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:38,957
<i>- Hello.
- Hey.</i>

189
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,000
How you doing? I got that reporter
from the newspaper...

190
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,879
<i>- ... on the other line.
- So, what did she say?</i>

191
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,626
She's not gonna play up
that angle in the story.

192
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:50,378
She thinks we're heterosexual.
I guess we fooled her.

193
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,764
All right, I'll get rid of her. Hold on.

194
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:54,471
Sharon?

195
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:56,639
Hello?

196
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,146
Sharon, are you there?

197
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:02,767
<i>- I'm back.
- You know...</i>

198
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:05,566
<i>...I could hear you on the other line.</i>

199
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:15,289
What are you talking about?

200
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,827
<i>I heard what you said:
"Sharon, are you there?"</i>

201
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:21,576
You heard me talking
on the other line? Are you sure?

202
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:24,507
<i>- Yes, I heard you.
- Maybe she was disconnected.</i>

203
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:27,676
<i>Maybe she wasn't. Maybe she heard
the whole conversation.</i>

204
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:32,388
All right. Let me call Kramer, and see
if you can hear anything. Hold on.

205
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,771
<i>- Hello.
- The phone may have a problem.</i>

206
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,683
<i>"The phone may have a problem."</i>

207
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:42,436
Oh, no!

208
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:46,113
Kramer, this phone's
a piece of junk. Goodbye.

209
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,655
<i>"This phone's a piece of junk."</i>

210
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:49,946
Oh, no! She's heard everything!
What will we do?

211
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,988
<i>She thinks we're gay. Not that
there's anything wrong with it.</i>

212
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:55,997
No, no, of course not. People's
personal sexual preferences...

213
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:57,992
...are nobody's business
but their own.

214
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:02,665
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:04,249
Elaine, right? Nice to meet you.

216
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:07,673
- Thanks for meeting with me.
- Sure. Would you like to take a seat?

217
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:09,503
- Sure.
- Thank you.

218
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:12,134
Why don't you take your coat off?

219
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:17,215
So she kept insisting
I take off my coat.

220
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:21,855
I refused, and then she forcibly
tried to get me to remove it.

221
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:24,230
She didn't take her coat off
in my house, either.

222
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:28,569
You know there are tribes in Indonesia
where if you keep your coat on...

223
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,815
...in somebody's house,
the families go to war.

224
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:32,735
Give me a break.

225
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:35,573
So you don't take your coat off,
and now everyone at NYU...

226
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:38,700
...thinks I'm gay. Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

227
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:40,582
Not at all.

228
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,376
- Take that coat off.
- I don't want to take it off.

229
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:47,120
Take your coat off, already.

230
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,835
When will we see it?
I'd like to read the article.

231
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,555
They're sending it to me.

232
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:55,514
All right, well...

233
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:58,767
- Here you go. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

234
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:02,437
<i>Two tickets to Guys and Dolls.
I'm gonna go with you.</i>

235
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:09,143
<i>Guys and Dolls?
Isn't that a lavish Broadway musical?</i>

236
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:13,780
<i>It's Guys and Dolls,
not Guys and Guys.</i>

237
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:17,109
<i>You're right. Guys and Dolls.
Thanks very much.</i>

238
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:20,538
- All right.
- All right, well...

239
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:24,451
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Lainey!

240
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:30,296
<i>The Collected Works
of Bette Midler.</i>

241
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:37,388
What? I-
I thought you liked Bette Midler.

242
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:39,218
She's all right.

243
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:42,098
- You said you liked her.
- So what? Maybe I do like her.

244
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,844
- So what?
- So nothing.

245
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,319
- Well, thanks for the CDs.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

246
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:56,113
Why are those two people
pointing at you over there?

247
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,202
I don't know.

248
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,082
<i>- What've you got there?
- The New York Post.</i>

249
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,494
They've got an article about you.

250
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,913
"Although they maintain
separate residences...

251
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:16,299
...the comedian and his longtime
companion seem to be inseparable."

252
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:19,010
Oh, no, The Associated Press
picked up the NYU story.

253
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:20,594
That's gonna be in every paper.

254
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:23,389
I've been outed. I wasn't even in.

255
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:26,938
Now everyone's gonna
think we're gay.

256
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,777
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

257
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,189
No, not at all.

258
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:40,870
"Within the confines
of his fastidious bachelor pad...

259
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:45,201
...Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over
the cleanliness of a piece of fruit...

260
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,994
...like an old married couple."
I told you that pear was washed.

261
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,417
I thought we were friends.

262
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:02,802
Here we go.

263
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:05,468
I mean, how could you two keep this
a secret from me?

264
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,730
- It's not true.
- Enough lying.

265
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,559
The lying is through.

266
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:13,142
Come on, Jerry,
the masquerade is over.

267
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,405
You're thin, late 30s, single.

268
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:19,362
- So are you.
- Yeah.

269
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:32,412
<i>- Hello.
- George?</i>

270
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:34,548
Mrs. Seinfeld?

271
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:37,504
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

272
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:41,389
Oh, my God. Ma?

273
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:43,217
<i>- Jerry?
- Ma.</i>

274
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:45,266
Oh, my God!

275
00:14:45,477 --> 00:14:47,719
My mother!

276
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,770
- Jerry.
- Ma, it's not true.

277
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:54,439
It was those culottes
you made him wear when he was 5.

278
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:56,770
<i>They weren't culottes.
They were shorts.</i>

279
00:14:56,947 --> 00:15:00,316
They were culottes! You bought
them in the girls' department.

280
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:04,276
By mistake.
By mistake, Jerry. I'm sorry.

281
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:07,491
It looked like he was wearing a skirt,
for crying out loud.

282
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,374
It has nothing to do
with the culottes.

283
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:12,116
Not that there's anything wrong
with that, Jerry.

284
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:18,628
I open up the paper, and this
is what I have to read about?

285
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:20,594
I fell right off the toilet.

286
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,677
My back went out again.
I couldn't move.

287
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,973
The super had to come
and help me up.

288
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,768
I was half-naked.

289
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:31,725
It's not true.

290
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:34,479
Every day it's something else
with you.

291
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:36,644
I don't know anything
about you anymore.

292
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,774
Who are you?
What kind of life are you leading?

293
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:44,617
Who knows what you're doing.
Maybe you're making porno films.

294
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,198
Yeah.

295
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:47,652
I'm Buck Naked.

296
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:50,998
You're who? Buck Naked?

297
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:55,166
Jerry, I can see.
He's so neat and thin.

298
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:57,082
Not that there's anything
wrong with it.

299
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,001
Of course not.

300
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:05,303
Six-thirty, Scott.
Time for your sponge bath.

301
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:12,346
Six-thirty already? I fell asleep.

302
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:17,019
Let me help you off with that.
Here, I'll Just slip it over your head.

303
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:27,410
- The water's nice and warm, isn't it?
- Oh, that feels really good.

304
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:32,123
George, are you
telling me the truth?

305
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,534
George, I'm talking to you!

306
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,668
Guess who left a message
on my machine.

307
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:45,295
That reporter from NYU.
I wonder what she wants.

308
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:51,426
All right.
Now the play is tomorrow night.

309
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:54,141
Would you like dinner first
or just meet at the theatre?

310
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,687
Excuse me, sir,
I'm sorry to bother you.

311
00:16:56,859 --> 00:17:00,109
I want you to know that it took a lot
of guts to come out how you did...

312
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,402
...and that you've inspired me
to do the same...

313
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:05,657
...even though that may mean
a discharge from the service. Thanks.

314
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:18,121
<i>You know, I think I'll pass
on the Guys and Dolls.</i>

315
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:19,875
All right, fine, don't go.

316
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:22,919
I try and go out and do something
special for your birthday...

317
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,928
...and this is the thanks I get.
Everything's tainted now.

318
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:30,723
- Would you keep your voice down?
- No, I will not keep my voice down!

319
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:33,093
Nothing can make me keep
my voice down!

320
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,599
If you boys cannot
control yourselves...

321
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,728
...then I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

322
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:52,276
- Fine, I'll take Elaine.
- Yes.

323
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:55,207
Just don't say anything to Allison.

324
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,664
No, I won't.
Did she see the article?

325
00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:01,916
- No. Just imagine her reaction.
- Yeah.

326
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,457
- Oh, my God.
- What?

327
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,002
She hasn't seen the article.

328
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:10,928
When she sees it,
she's gonna think...

329
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,134
I'm out, baby! I'm out!

330
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:22,265
Yeah, so?

331
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:23,819
"Yeah, so?"

332
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:26,478
Well, this is nice.
They mention your name.

333
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:28,151
Don't you see what it says here?

334
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:30,318
Don't you understand
what that's implying?

335
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:32,321
No. What?

336
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:35,954
I'm gay. I'm a gay man.

337
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:38,117
I'm very, very gay.

338
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,336
- You're gay?
- Extraordinarily gay.

339
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:43,332
Steeped in gayness.

340
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:46,467
I don't believe it.

341
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:48,803
You don't believe me, ask Jerry.

342
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,054
- I will.
- What do you mean, you will?

343
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:52,717
No, no, no. That's a bad idea.

344
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:57,434
- Jerry's a very private person.
- I wanna hear it from Jerry.

345
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:07,027
Oh, can you ever forgive me?

346
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:10,443
I don't know.

347
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:19,329
All right, I forgive you.

348
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:23,378
You know, the funny thing is,
I was attracted to you immediately.

349
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:26,038
I was attracted to you too.
You remind me of Lois Lane.

350
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:41,349
Jerry! Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

351
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:44,562
What?

352
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,688
You're with a woman!

353
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:49,187
I know. What are you doing here?

354
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:53,611
I leave you alone for two seconds,
and this is what you do?

355
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:55,825
I trusted you!

356
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:59,030
- Would you get the hell out of here?
- Stop it.

357
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,496
- What-? What's going on?
- Yeah, what's going on?

358
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:02,997
All right. Tell her. Go ahead.

359
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,913
- Tell her what?
- You know, about us.

360
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:06,962
- Are you crazy?
- Tell her, Jerry. Tell her.

361
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,588
I'm telling her nothing.
Do you know what you're saying?

362
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,384
This-This is too weird.

363
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:14,258
Wait a minute. You wrote the article.
Go ahead. Tell her.

364
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,629
I'm out of here.

365
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:19,259
It's not true! It's not true!

366
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:22,437
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

367
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,727
- You stupid idiot.
- Oh, please don't be upset.

368
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:28,941
Oh, would you stop it
with that stuff?

369
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,187
What's going on?

370
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:34,109
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

371
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:36,818
I'm not gay.

372
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:40,240
My name's Buck Naked.
I'm a porno actor.

373
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,502
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

374
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:53,001
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?

375
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,048
Hello.

376
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,597
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

377
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,472
All right, we'll see you later.

378
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:08,556
He's the phone man.

379
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:15,188
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

380
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,160
I am not gay.

381
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:29,670
I am, however,
thin, single and neat.

382
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,583
When someone is thin,
single and neat...

383
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,332
...people assume they're gay
because that's the stereotype.

384
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:37,844
We normally don't think of gay people
as fat, sloppy and married.

385
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:41,515
Although I'm sure there are, I don't
want to perpetuate the stereotype.

386
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:44,686
I'm sure they're the minority,
though, within the gay community.

387
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:47,856
Probably discriminated against.
Because of that, people say to them:

388
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:50,147
"You know, Joe,
I enjoy being gay with you...

389
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:54,399
...but it's about time you got in shape,
tucked your shirt in and lost the wife."

390
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:58,237
If people are gonna assume
that neat people are gay...

391
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,070
...instead of doing this:

392
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:01,905
"I think Joe might be a little-"

393
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,200
They should vacuum.
"You know, I think Joe might be-"

394
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:07,579
Yeah.

395
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:11,081
I got a feeling he's a little-
