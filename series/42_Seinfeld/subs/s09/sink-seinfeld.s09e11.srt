1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,164
When are they gonna have
the flying cars?

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,932
Yeah, they have been
promising that.

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,272
Years. When we were kids it seemed
like it was around the corner.

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,606
I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,408
No, that's just electric.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,275
<i>What about Harrison Ford?
He had one in Blade Runner.</i>

7
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,851
That was a cool one.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,683
<i>Well, what's the competition?
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?</i>

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,552
What do you think
the big holdup is?

10
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,019
The government is very touchy
about us being in the air.

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,060
Let us run on the ground
much as we want.

12
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,960
Anything in the air
is a big production.

13
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,465
Yeah, right. And what about
the floating cities?

14
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:39,298
- And the underwater bubble cities?
- It's like we're living in the '50s here.

15
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,309
That's good suspension.

16
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,935
Would you stop it? You'll have plenty
of time to destroy it after I get it.

17
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,649
Hey, George, I'm buying this car.

18
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,413
What is wrong with you?
You never tell them you like the car.

19
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,614
You're not sure what you want.
You don't even know why you're here.

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,448
That vein again.

21
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,686
- I'm starving. I should've had lunch.
- It'll be 20 minutes.

22
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,957
I told you, Puddy's getting me
an insider deal.

23
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,260
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend
selling cars?

24
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,734
- I thought he was a mechanic.
- I guess he graduated.

25
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,237
Easy move. Go from screwing you
behind your back...

26
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,568
...to screwing you
right to your face.

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,907
Thank you.

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,570
Puddy's just gonna give you
the car, huh? You'll see.

29
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,683
They stick you with the undercoating,
rustproofing, dealer prep.

30
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,716
Suddenly you're on your back
like a turtle.

31
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,480
- All right, calm down.
- My father had a car-salesman buddy.

32
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,180
He was gonna fix him up real nice.

33
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,793
Next thing I know, I'm getting dropped
off in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof.

34
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,920
<i>All the kids are shouting at me,
"Hey, Le George. Bonjour, Le George.</i>

35
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,125
Let's stuff Le George in Le Locker."

36
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,029
I don't think this thing
is hooked up right.

37
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,070
All right, we're going in.

38
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,068
You got a good eye there.

39
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,871
I see you've noticed
the unibody construction.

40
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,378
I'm Rick. Are you looking
to buy or to lease?

41
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,014
Borrow. From my friend.
Yeah, he'll by buying it.

42
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,018
- Maybe I should talk to him.
- Oh, I don't think so.

43
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,553
No, he's an entertainer.

44
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,886
You know, all over the place.
That's where I come in.

45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,552
- I see. So you're his manag-?
- Neighbor. That's right.

46
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,964
Why don't we take this boiler out
for a shakedown, huh?

47
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,399
Look at these salesmen.

48
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,236
The only thing these guys fear
is the walkout.

49
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,877
No matter what they say, you say:

50
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,105
- "I'll walk out of here right now."
- Can I help you with something?

51
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,183
Hold it.
One more step and we're walking!

52
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,549
George. Sorry, we're just waiting
for David Puddy.

53
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,021
He is.
You don't know what I'm doing.

54
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,717
- Hey.
- Hey.

55
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,886
- Sorry I'm late.
- My new salesman boyfriend...

56
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,894
...took me out
to celebrate his promotion.

57
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,589
Oh, where'd you go?

58
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,462
- To a restaurant.
- Arby's.

59
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,397
I had the roast beef.

60
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,736
So I decided I'm gonna go
with a 900 convertible.

61
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,175
All right, classic. High-five.

62
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,308
Can you tell me
where the Xerox machine is?

63
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,886
Oh, sure, babe.
Salesmen-only copy room right there.

64
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,780
Come on, I'll show you the 900.

65
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,086
Yeah, you show us the 900.

66
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,092
And look at these features,
Mr. Kramer.

67
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,392
Antilock brakes,
automatic climate control-

68
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,229
Make a right at this corner, please.

69
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,895
- An adjustable steering wheel and-
Oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn.

70
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,007
- No, no, no, I didn't.
- Well, that's okay.

71
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,700
Make this next right
and swing back to the dealership.

72
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,211
Well, it's a test drive, right?
I never drive around here.

73
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,905
If I'm gonna recommend this car...

74
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,381
...I need to see that it'll handle
my daily routine.

75
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,144
Well, where're we going?

76
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,654
Just a little place I like to call
You'll See.

77
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,285
I'm starving.

78
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,758
You got any of those free doughnuts
you use to soften people up?

79
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,629
By the Service Department.

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,066
All right, remember, no rustproofing.
Commit to nothing.

81
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,297
If you have to speak, mumble.

82
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,507
- Au revoir, Le George.
- Don't think it can't happen.

83
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,243
Puddy, this is a pretty good move
for you.

84
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,349
- No more grease monkey.
- I don't care for that term.

85
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,683
Oh, sorry, I didn't know.

86
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,914
I don't know too many monkeys
who could take apart a fuel injector.

87
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,354
I saw one
that could do sign language.

88
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,517
Yeah, I saw that one.

89
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,160
Koko.

90
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,321
Yeah, Koko.

91
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,564
Right. Koko.

92
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,033
That chimp's all right. High-five.

93
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,330
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on here?

94
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,804
You didn't agree to anything.

95
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,910
No, we both just saw
the same monkey.

96
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,903
Well, I got screwed
on the doughnuts.

97
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,309
There were none left.

98
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,883
There's a vending machine.
I can show you where it is.

99
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,686
Hey, give me a dollar.

100
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,943
Where's your money?

101
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,488
I'm here helping you.

102
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,354
Hey, where's Puddy?
The copy machine is broken.

103
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,519
That's what they want you to think.

104
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,189
Have you noticed your boyfriend has
developed an annoying little habit?

105
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,198
- The squinting?
- No.

106
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,031
- The staring?
- No.

107
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,201
He keeps asking me
to give him a high-five.

108
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,971
I thought all guys do that.

109
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,012
Slapping hands is the lowest form
of male-primate ritual.

110
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,241
In fact, some of them have moved on.
They're doing sign language now.

111
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,578
It's that bad?

112
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,085
<i>What do you think the Nazis
were doing? That was the heil-five.</i>

113
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,219
Isn't that from your act,
like, 10 years ago?

114
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,930
It was a good bit in the '80s,
and it's still relatable today.

115
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,026
Good news, we got a 900 in black.

116
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,068
That's the hot color. High-five.

117
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:43,234
David, can you come help me
fix the copy machine? Come on.

118
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,206
You owe me five.

119
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,539
Twix.

120
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,873
B5.

121
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,089
Come on.

122
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,779
Excuse me, do you have
change of a dollar?

123
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,876
No.

124
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,050
Could I trade you for another dollar?

125
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,190
- Don't have one.
- Excuse me.

126
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,719
When your wallet was open,
I glanced inside...

127
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:40,130
...and I couldn't help but notice
that you have several crisp dollar bills.

128
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,665
You're incorrect.

129
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:46,134
Perhaps you could look again, please.
I'm very hungry.

130
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,471
We had doughnuts earlier.

131
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,312
I guess everyone here enjoys giving
the old scroogie, huh?

132
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,678
You're all doing a hell of a job.

133
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,484
What I would do with you.

134
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,491
Mr. Kramer, we're really not allowed
to use the cars to run errands.

135
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,288
Now, look, Rick,
I'm very close to giving this car...

136
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,455
...that my celebrity friend
is considering, my full endorsement.

137
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,333
Well, let's see if I can get a smile
from these femininas.

138
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:22,900
Hey, ladies. It's a Saab 900.
What do you think?

139
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:27,512
Can I interest you
in a little supplemental restraint?

140
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,186
I think the candy comes out
over there.

141
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,886
People drop change
down here, Jerry.

142
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,857
And they're too lazy to pick it up.

143
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,022
Either that or they've got a weird little
hang-up about lying face down in filth.

144
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,995
Why don't you just go
to the cashier?

145
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,662
The cashier is at lunch,
which is where I'd like to be.

146
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,742
- How much was under there?
- I think something bit me.

147
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,976
I just need another nickel.

148
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,843
Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for
the CD player. What do you think?

149
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,914
He's got a live one.
He's just reeling this big fish in.

150
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,554
Hey, could I have my dollar back?

151
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,555
It's wrinkled. It's worthless.

152
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,804
Come on.

153
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,536
Jump!

154
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,582
They put out some more doughnuts.

155
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,014
- They did?
- Last one.

156
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,050
Well, just one more errand
and we can head back.

157
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,319
Actually, it looks like
we're gonna need some gas.

158
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,759
Well, how much gas you think
is in there right now?

159
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,262
Well, it's on E.

160
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,890
You know, Rick, often times,
Jerry, he lends me his car...

161
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:01,028
...and I find myself in a situation
where the car is almost out of gas.

162
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,300
But for a variety of reasons...

163
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,310
...I don't wanna be the one responsible
for purchasing costly gasoline.

164
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,049
So you wanna know how far you can
drive your friend's car for free.

165
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,647
Well, I make it up to him
in other ways.

166
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,985
As you will see,
the candy bar is paid for...

167
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,252
...and yet remains dangling
in the machine.

168
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,362
Hey, it's gone.

169
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,226
Where is my Twix?

170
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,166
That guy's eating it.

171
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,805
How do you know that one's yours?

172
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,271
It was dangling.
There were two left in the machine.

173
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,239
He must have bought one
and gotten both.

174
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,936
- Sir, are you gonna buy a car?
- No.

175
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:46,451
Hey. Hey. I see you.
That is my Twix.

176
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,688
Paper jam. Got it.

177
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,986
High-five.

178
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,161
On the flip side.

179
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,334
- David, I-
- Don't leave me hanging.

180
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:08,064
You're a salesman now.
The high-five is-

181
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,935
It's very grease monkey.

182
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,236
- What did I tell you about that?
- I'm sorry.

183
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,936
But the high-five is just so stupid.

184
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,912
Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what's stupid.

185
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,346
You, stupid.

186
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,045
Oh, that is really mature.

187
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,850
Yeah? So are you.

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,952
You're the grease monkey.

189
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,560
That doesn't make any sense.

190
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,364
- I am leaving.
- Yeah, if you leave, we're through.

191
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,594
- Fine, we're through.
- Oh, so you're leaving?

192
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:42,707
That's right.
High-five, on the flip side.

193
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,035
Taking me to Arby's.

194
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,474
- Hey, where were you-?
- Let's finish this up.

195
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,085
- Did you two break up?
- That chick's whacked.

196
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,480
We're history.

197
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,555
Just left out a couple of things.
Rustproofing.

198
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,419
- Rustproofing?
- Transport charge.

199
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,858
Storage surcharge.
Additional overcharge.

200
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,931
- Finder's fee.
- Finder's fee? It was on the lot.

201
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,566
Yeah, that's right.

202
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,226
- And floor mats, keys.
- Keys?

203
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,570
How are you gonna start it?

204
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:26,342
Excuse me.
I believe you just ate my Twix bar.

205
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,010
It was dangling and when you
purchased your Twix bar...

206
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,021
...you got a little freebie
and you never bothered to ask why...

207
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,783
...or seek out its rightful owner.

208
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:38,126
First of all, it wasn't a Twix.
It was a 5th Avenue bar.

209
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,857
You must think I'm pretty stupid.

210
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,266
That's no 5th Avenue bar. I can see
the crumb in the corner of your lip.

211
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,704
Now, that is a cookie and we all know
that Twix is the only candy bar...

212
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,740
...with the cookie crunch.

213
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,069
That's a little nougat.

214
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,506
Nougat? Please.
I think I've reached a point in my life...

215
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,173
...where I can tell between
nougat and cookie.

216
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,980
So let's not just say things that we
both know are obvious fabrications.

217
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,248
You know you're getting
a little vein there?

218
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,019
I know about the vein. This guy.

219
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,628
- Hey, George.
- Hey, I'm starving.

220
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,627
Last one.
Listen, you gotta help me out.

221
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,824
Elaine and Puddy broke up. He's
treating me like a regular customer.

222
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,492
I tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen. No.

223
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,832
You were gonna get a deal.

224
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,464
There's no law in this place.
Anything goes. It's Thunderdome.

225
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,974
- Is someone helping you?
- Stay back.

226
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,273
Where is it now?

227
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,010
There's overlap between the needle
and slash below the E.

228
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,585
How low are you gonna go?

229
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,484
Oh, I've been in the slash
many times.

230
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,521
This is nothing. You'll get used to it.

231
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,489
Just put it out of your mind.

232
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,524
Have you ever been completely
below the slash?

233
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,191
Well, I almost did once
and I blacked out.

234
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,964
When I came to the car was in a ditch
and the tank was full.

235
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,200
I don't know who did it.
And I never got to thank them.

236
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,310
Mr. Kramer, the road.

237
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,372
When we started this deal, I thought
things were gonna be different.

238
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,916
If you wanna play hardball,
I got my friend George...

239
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,213
...and he can play pretty hard. Ball.

240
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,981
George. Vein it up.

241
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,327
All right, Puddy,
listen and listen good.

242
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,759
I need to know the name of that
mechanic that walks around here.

243
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,765
Big guy, a liar, short name.
Sam, Mo, Sol-

244
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,961
George, can we focus
on the car here?

245
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,973
I'm starving. I can feel my stomach
sucking up against my spine.

246
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,268
Well, I need your signature here...

247
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,913
...and we'll get you
that yellow car ready to go.

248
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,915
Yellow? I wanted black.

249
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,074
I can't give you black at that price.

250
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,383
George, would you help me,
please?

251
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,216
Yes. This is wrong.

252
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,281
Sing it, sister!

253
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,393
Just because a candy bar fails
to fall from its perch-

254
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,551
Oh, God.

255
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,095
- Does not imply transfer
of ownership.

256
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,632
Mo, Sol or Lem is not gonna
get away with this.

257
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,360
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

258
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,731
Hey, George.

259
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,768
Is it just the angle I'm looking from?

260
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,742
- No, sir. We are down there.
- Oh, this is amazing.

261
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,847
Oh, I never felt so alive.

262
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,449
All right, I'm satisfied.
We better get some gas.

263
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,610
- What? Well, we can't stop now.
- What do you mean?

264
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,450
We have to keep going to
the dealership. That was the plan.

265
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,785
- There's no plan.
- Well, let's make it the plan.

266
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,793
<i>Let's just go for it
like Thelma and Louise.</i>

267
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,091
- They drove to a dealership?
- No, they drove off a cliff.

268
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,631
You are one sick mama. I like it.

269
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,102
Mr. Kramer, the road.

270
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,236
- Hello?
- You gotta back down to the dealer.

271
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,142
Puddy is screwing me on this car,
which is yellow now.

272
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,809
- Who is this? What?
- Elaine.

273
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,581
You gotta get back with Puddy
so I can make this deal.

274
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,660
You know, just that you cared enough
to call means so much, Jerry.

275
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,558
You're gonna get back together.
It's thousands of dollars.

276
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,789
I don't know.

277
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,162
You don't have to see him again
until my 15,000-mile check.

278
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,327
- Will you pay my cab fare out there?
- Fine.

279
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,837
I didn't like that roast beef
so how about lunch?

280
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,108
- No, no lunch.
- I'll hang this phone up right now.

281
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,905
- All right, lunch.
- See you.

282
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,606
Bye. Everybody's ripping me off.

283
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,475
I'd like to report a problem
with one of your mechanics.

284
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,349
When did you bring your car in?

285
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,958
Yeah, right. I'm gonna get my car
repaired at a dealership.

286
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,654
Why don't I just flush my money
down the toilet?

287
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,360
Sir, what exactly is the problem?

288
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,229
One of your guys, Kip or Ned-

289
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,702
Short name.
- Stole my Twix candy bar.

290
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,364
Are you saying he grabbed
your candy bar away from you?

291
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,600
He might as well have.

292
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,873
I caught him and his face was covered
in chocolate and cookie crumbs.

293
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,107
- I thought you said it was a Twix?
- Oh, it was.

294
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,013
But he claimed
it was a 5th Avenue bar.

295
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,778
- Maybe it was.
- Oh, no. No.

296
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,685
Twix is the only candy
with the cookie crunch.

297
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,451
- What about the $100,000 bar?
- No, rice and caramel.

298
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,891
- Nougat? Positive?
- No. Please.

299
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,396
You know they changed the name
from $100,000 bar to Hundred Grand?

300
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:14,500
All I want is my 75 cents back,
an apology, and for him to be fired.

301
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,341
I remember when you used to be
able to get a Hershey for a nickel.

302
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,473
What's the one with the swirling
chocolate in the commercial?

303
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,085
They all have swirling chocolate
in the commercial.

304
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,187
Not Skittles.

305
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,856
Dad, I told you you could sit here
only if you don't talk.

306
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,722
You make your father sit here
all day?

307
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,624
- He likes it.
- All right. Do you mind?

308
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,765
I have the window.

309
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,597
Now, what're you gonna do
about my Twix?

310
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,102
- Twix has too much coconut.
- No, there's no coconut!

311
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,365
- I'm allergic to coconut.
- I'm not.

312
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,270
A nickel.

313
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,076
- Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.
- I'm with a customer.

314
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,218
No, no, no. Elaine, the car can wait.

315
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,016
What's important is you two
getting back together.

316
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,521
Then we'll talk about the car.

317
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,683
I don't wanna get back with her.
She's bossy.

318
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,158
David.

319
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,330
Okay.

320
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,998
Now, I know
this is an important decision.

321
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,795
Why don't we all just sit down
and talk about it?

322
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,738
Come on. Come on.

323
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:24,137
Now, look. You both find each other
attractive, right?

324
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,600
- Right.
- Right.

325
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,976
Clearly, no one else can stand
to be with either one of you.

326
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,979
- I guess.
- Good point.

327
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,620
All right.

328
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:41,315
Now, what do I have to do to put
you two in a relationship today?

329
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,557
Cars can go on empty,
but not us humans, huh, fella?

330
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,597
- I'll get us a couple of Twix bars.
- No.

331
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,496
No coconut for me.

332
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,127
All right, I'll get you a Mounds bar.
Keep the engine running.

333
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,316
No, man, not the gas.

334
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,282
But it needs it, Kramer.
It needs it bad.

335
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,150
You really think this will make
you happy? Because it won't.

336
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,620
You should go on without me.

337
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,090
Listen to me. When that car
rolls into that dealership...

338
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,253
...and that tank is bone-dry,
I want you to be there with me...

339
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,729
...when everyone says,
"Kramer and that other guy...

340
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,768
...they went farther to the left of the
slash than anyone ever dreamed."

341
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,369
Maybe we'd better get moving.

342
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,538
It's good to have you back, Stan.

343
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,805
- It's Rick, by the way.
- No time.

344
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,517
Mr. Costanza, I really don't have
time for this.

345
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,621
Now, if this mechanic guy was,
in fact...

346
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,781
...eating a 5th Avenue bar,
as he claims...

347
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,393
...wouldn't you agree
he would have no problem...

348
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,052
...picking one out
from a candy lineup?

349
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,161
Candy lineup?

350
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,069
I've spent the last hour
preparing 10 candy bars...

351
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,172
...with no wrappers or identification
of any kind...

352
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,534
...for him to select from.

353
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,868
That took you an hour?

354
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,409
Only I hold the answer key
to their true candy identities.

355
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,682
And so without further ado...

356
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,715
...I give you...

357
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,010
...the candy lineup.

358
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,586
Hey, Willie, check it out, free candy.

359
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,863
That's my candy lineup.
Where are my cards?

360
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,554
They're all on the floor.

361
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,329
And you? How many Twix does
that make for you today?

362
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,993
- Like, eight Twix?
- No.

363
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,073
- Hey, this Clark bar is good.
- It's a Twix.

364
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,436
They're all Twix. It was a setup.

365
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,703
A setup, I tell you.
And you've robbed it.

366
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,074
You've all screwed me again.

367
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,909
Now, give me one. Give me a Twix.

368
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,074
They're all gone.

369
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,087
Twix!

370
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,284
What was that?

371
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,422
There's a mental hospital
right near here.

372
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,853
All right, Elaine, David...

373
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,398
...I believe we have a deal here
in principle.

374
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,627
Arby's no more than once
a month...

375
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,738
...and in exchange Elaine comes
to your softball game...

376
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,464
...and doesn't read a book.

377
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,137
- Well, that's not bad.
- I can live with that.

378
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,843
- So you're back together?
- Yeah.

379
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,309
All right, all right, that's enough.
Now, let's get back to my deal.

380
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,818
That undercoating, that's a rip-off,
isn't it, David?

381
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,957
Oh, we don't even know what it is.

382
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,616
- So I'm getting the insider's deal?
- The insider's deal.

383
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,819
High-five.

384
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,034
There's the dealer.

385
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,863
We did it. We pulled it off.
I can't believe it.

386
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,972
- Where's the needle?
- Oh, it broke off, baby.

387
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,871
Oh, Mr. Kramer,
I gotta thank you. I learned a lot.

388
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,978
Things are gonna be different
for me now.

389
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,273
Well, that's a weird thing to say.

390
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,950
I wonder how much longer
we'd have lasted.

391
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,177
Yeah, yeah, I wonder.

392
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,436
This is nice.
What kind of car is this?

393
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,081
Caprice Classic.

394
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,140
You couldn't just give him
one high-five?

395
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,479
And where does it end?
Then everyone's doing it.

396
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,418
It's like the wave at ball games.
Air quotes.

397
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,353
The phrase, "Don't go there."

398
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,584
Someone's gotta take a stand.

399
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,194
This Arby's is good.

400
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,197
So, George, I still don't understand.
How is that a setup?

401
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:45,063
Who were you trying to setup anyway?
The mechanic or the manager?

402
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:49,037
I don't know.
All of them, they're all crooks.

403
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,005
I couldn't get all different
candy bars anyway.

404
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,769
What was that?

405
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,415
I think there's a mental hospital
near here.

406
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,517
Yeah, very near.

407
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,599
Well, I think we stopped.

408
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,899
You can probably let go
of my hand now.

409
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,075
Well, I'll think about it.

410
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,546
Do you have my card?

411
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,817
<i>A nickel.</i>
