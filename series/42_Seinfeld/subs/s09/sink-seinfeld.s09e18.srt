1
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,041
- Elaine, cake?
- Oh, no thanks.

2
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,577
It's Walter's special day.

3
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,138
There are 200 people
who work in this office.

4
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,784
Every day is somebody's
special day.

5
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,252
Elaine, where you going?

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,412
It's Walter's last day.
We have to celebrate.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,421
It's his birthday
and it's his last day?

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,560
This is other Walter from returns.

9
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,422
Hey, what's going on here?

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,063
Surprise!

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,425
Oh, guys.

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,393
Elaine, it's my last day.

13
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:36,592
Have a piece.

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,204
All right, pile it on.

15
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,514
What is so bad about having
a piece of cake?

16
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,089
It is the forced socializing.

17
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,250
Just because
we work in the same office...

18
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,396
...why do we have to act like
we're friends?

19
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,791
Why aren't you there now?

20
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:08,695
I had to take a sick day,
I'm so sick of these people.

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,866
I talked to Lisi and tomorrow night's
good for her.

22
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,998
I shouldn't go out with
a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.

23
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,737
You're better off sitting around
reading comic books...

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,847
...and eating spaghetti
at 2 in the morning.

25
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,984
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce,
wanna come with me to Mario's Pizza?

26
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:29,247
- Your old high school hangout. Why?
- They're closing. Going for a last slice.

27
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,387
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, huh?

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,859
Official police caution tape.

29
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,588
Look at that.

30
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,592
Step back, son,
there's nothing to see here.

31
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,327
Where did you get this?

32
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,131
I got it from my cop buddy, Doug.

33
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,275
You sure have a lot of friends.
How come I never see any of them?

34
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,307
They wanna know
why they never see you.

35
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,213
I'm gonna eat that later.

36
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,778
So they just gave you this?

37
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,785
Oh, no, no, I had to fish around
in the evidence room for it.

38
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,183
They're all preoccupied...

39
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,824
...trying to hunt down
this new psycho serial killer...

40
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,187
...the Lopper. All right, I'll see you.

41
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,488
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Who is the Lopper?

42
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,652
It's no big deal.

43
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,358
It's just some guy, he's been running
around Riverside Park, you know...

44
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,470
- ...cutting people's heads off.
- How have I never read about this?

45
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,802
The police, they've been having some
internal dissension about the name.

46
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,307
What are the other titles?

47
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,504
Heads-o. The De-Nogginizer.

48
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,681
Son of Dad.

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,011
- Son of Dad?
- Yeah, that was my suggestion.

50
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,586
It's sort of a catch-all.

51
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,018
Mario's Pizza.

52
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,354
Just as she was.

53
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,929
Hey, Mario. Remember us?

54
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,788
No.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,261
We used to come in every day.

56
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,062
So where you been?

57
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,568
We're tanking here.

58
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,839
We'll have two slices
and two grape sodas.

59
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,876
Oh, thanks. That'll save us.

60
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,805
All right, make it the large sodas.

61
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,716
Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger?

62
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,013
I used to be so into this game.

63
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,124
Getting that frog across the street
was my entire life.

64
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,783
Yeah, and then you went on to...

65
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,955
It's a good game.

66
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,456
Watch the truck.

67
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,859
Double jump.

68
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,365
Eat the fly. Eat it!

69
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,428
Thanks a lot.

70
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,232
Beat it, punk.

71
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,707
Hey, look at the high score. "GLC."

72
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,902
George Louis Costanza.
That's not you, is it?

73
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,474
Yes.

74
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,171
Eight hundred and sixty thousand.

75
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,112
I can't believe it's still standing.

76
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,184
No one has beaten me
in, like, ten years.

77
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:44,983
- I remember that night.
- Oh, I was unstoppable.

78
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,956
Perfect combination of Mountain Dew
and mozzarella.

79
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,961
Just the right amount of grease
on the joystick.

80
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,793
Here's your pizza, pea brains.

81
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,070
I think I remember
why we stopped coming here.

82
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,940
<i>This pen smells really bad.</i>

83
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,513
<i>So why do I keep smelling it?</i>

84
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,817
<i>Is it too late for me
to go to law school?</i>

85
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,412
- What is this?
- You were out sick yesterday...

86
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,057
...so we got you a get-well cake.

87
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,920
It's carrot. It's good for you.

88
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,460
<i>Get well, get well soon
We wish you to get well-</i>

89
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,190
Stop it! That's not even a song.

90
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,867
I mean, now we're celebrating
a sick day?

91
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,002
- I think it's nice.
- What? What is nice?

92
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,231
Trying to fill the void
in your life...

93
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,468
...with flour and sugar
and egg and vanilla?

94
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,637
I mean, we are all unhappy.

95
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,339
Do we have to be fat too?

96
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,012
Not you, Becky. I know you have
a slow metabolism.

97
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,955
I don't want one more piece of cake
in my office.

98
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,889
<i>Get well, get well soon-</i>

99
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,858
It's not happening.

100
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,531
Can we still eat it?

101
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,705
I'll tell you, Lisi, I never expected
that movie to-

102
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,171
End underwater.

103
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,970
- Be that long.
I mean, most action movies are-

104
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,976
So much more violent.

105
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,746
- Not as long.

106
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,475
- Well, I should probably-
- Get going.

107
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,343
Yeah.

108
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,213
Well, it was nice meeting you.
I'm sure, I'll see you-

109
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,382
- Eight tomorrow?
- Actually, that's -

110
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,754
What you were thinking.

111
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,320
Right.

112
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,335
Oh, here you are. You want to...?

113
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,872
Sure. How about this one?

114
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,103
Well, I'm doing it, Jerry.

115
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,008
I'm buying the Frogger machine.

116
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,617
- Now the torch will burn forever.
- Fabulous.

117
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,344
- Now, you're really doing something.
- Yeah.

118
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,119
Wanna come to Mario's Pizza
and help me pick up the Frogger?

119
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,192
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine
plugged in while you move it?

120
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,385
What?

121
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,123
Once you unplug the machine,
all the scores will be erased.

122
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,503
You're right.

123
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,934
Why must there always be
a problem?

124
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,634
You'd think just once,
I could get a break.

125
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,143
God knows I earned it
with that score.

126
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,475
Well, more bad news, Jerry.

127
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,644
The police found another victim
of the Lopper in Riverside Park.

128
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,882
I saw the photo
and it looked a lot like you.

129
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,892
There's a lot of people walking around
that look like me.

130
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,561
Not as many as there used to be.

131
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,535
No, I need a guy that can rig
a Frogger machine...

132
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,230
...so that I can move it without losing
power because I have the high score.

133
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,999
Hello?

134
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,101
George, you're not gonna find
an electrician like that...

135
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,337
...in the yellow pages.

136
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,914
No, I know just the guy
who can do this.

137
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,950
- Another friend?
- Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend.

138
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,212
In fact, we don't even get along.

139
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,912
Well, is he good, Kramer?

140
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,489
Oh, he's the best.

141
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,421
And the worst.

142
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,685
Kramer, listen to me.

143
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,632
I'm never gonna have a child.

144
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,862
If I lose this Frogger high score...

145
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,971
...that's it for me.

146
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,470
Believe me, George,
you can count on Slippery Pete.

147
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,377
- Slippery Pete?
- I don't care for the name, either.

148
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,950
In fact, that's one of the things
that we argue about.

149
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,313
All right.

150
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,614
I'm gonna find a guy with a truck.

151
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,882
GLC must live on.

152
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,829
Come on.

153
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,701
- Hello?
- So how's it going with my friend?

154
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,465
She's a sentence finisher.
It's like dating Mad Libs.

155
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,610
- What is that?
- Oh, it's a cake party.

156
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,269
It's the third one today.

157
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,206
I didn't realize how hooked
I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.

158
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,945
- So join in.
- I can't. I denounced them.

159
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,285
Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge.

160
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,584
He's always got a truffle
or something in there.

161
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,829
- Hey, what? What is-?
- Yeah, I dropped an egg.

162
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,067
Be careful.

163
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,432
Anybody here?

164
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,406
Peter-boy?

165
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,853
It's a cakewalk.

166
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,357
<i>Get well, get well soon
We wish you to get well</i>

167
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,924
Oh, what a stirring little anthem
of wellness.

168
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,568
Elaine.

169
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,069
- Mr. Peterman.
- We missed you at the get-well party.

170
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:03,731
Poor old Walt has a polyp
in the duodenum.

171
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,042
It's benign but, oh, still a bastard.

172
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,639
Oh, Elaine...

173
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,217
- ...can you keep a secret?
- No, sir, I can't.

174
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:20,387
Inside that small, college-boy
mini-fridge is my latest acquisition.

175
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,155
A slice of cake from the wedding...

176
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,732
...of King Edward VIII
to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937.

177
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,197
The price?

178
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,893
Twenty-nine thousand dollars.

179
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,970
- Well, Lisi, that was another-
- Lovely evening.

180
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,081
- Really bad meal.

181
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,682
I was thinking maybe we should-

182
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,545
Go for a hansom cab ride?

183
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,813
- Call it a night. I'll walk you home.
Where do you live?

184
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,684
84th Street, right off Riverside Park.

185
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,256
Riverside Park.

186
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,862
- I thought we were going-
- Back to my place, that's right.

187
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,193
So you slept with her?

188
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,858
She lives right off Riverside Park.

189
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,834
I was scared of the Lopper,
so I let her stay over.

190
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,167
And you automatically
sleep with her?

191
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,776
I just wanted to make out a little,
but she kind of-

192
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,276
- Finished your thought.
- Yeah.

193
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:17,940
Guess what I ate?

194
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,550
An ostrich burger?

195
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,348
No. A $29,000 piece of cake.

196
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,288
Peterman got it at the Duke
and Duchess of Windsor auction.

197
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,793
It was the most romantic thing
I've ever eaten.

198
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,363
- How did it taste?
- A little stale.

199
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,996
So you sleeping with Peterman?

200
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,330
No.

201
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,504
He doesn't know I ate it.

202
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,074
In fact, he almost caught me.

203
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,144
I have to sneak back in
and even it out.

204
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,846
Well, they say ostrich has less fat,
but you eat more of it.

205
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,515
Hey, so I talked to Lisi...

206
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,256
...and she has got
a big surprise for you.

207
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,395
She's planning a weekend trip
to Pennsylvania Dutch country.

208
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,860
Pennsylvania Dutch country?

209
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,024
No, that's the serious-relationship
weekend place.

210
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,102
- What is going on with you two?
- I think by sleeping with her...

211
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,603
...I may have sent her
the wrong message.

212
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,463
What's that?

213
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,499
Four o'clock sugar fix.

214
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,373
Well, I'm calling this off right now.

215
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,844
No, no, you are way past
the phone-call-breakup stage.

216
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,416
I'm not going over there.
That's where the Lopper is.

217
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,150
It's daylight.
It won't take you that long.

218
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,789
Just make a clean break.

219
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:40,590
Just a little off the side. Perfect.

220
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,060
No point in wasting 1200 bucks.

221
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,770
<i>Oh, commander,
isn't the wedding marvelous?</i>

222
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,114
<i>The cake? Oh, I shouldn't.</i>

223
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,807
<i>I mustn't.</i>

224
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,611
What the hell.

225
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,886
Now, each of you is here because
you're the best at what you do.

226
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,049
Slippery Pete.

227
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,396
Kramer tells me you are one hell
of a rogue electrician.

228
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,796
And, Shlomo,
you're the best truck driver.

229
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,300
I don't know if I'm the best.

230
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,460
You're very good.

231
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,503
Let's say good.

232
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,539
Okay, good.

233
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,109
Kramer, you're in charge
of taping off a loading zone.

234
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,745
Lock and load.

235
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,778
Think you can handle that,
numb-nuts?

236
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,780
All right, all right, come on now.

237
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,680
That was my mail-order bride.

238
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,582
You weren't home,
so I signed for her.

239
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,019
It doesn't give you the right
to make out with her.

240
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,589
You weren't even married yet.

241
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,093
All right, all right, calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

242
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,697
Whatever happened
in the past, is past.

243
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,300
All right. Now, this is the-

244
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,527
The basic layout for Mario's Pizza.

245
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:56,073
So, what kind of jail time
are we looking at if we're caught?

246
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,766
What do you mean?

247
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,935
We're stealing this thing, right?

248
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,104
No, I paid for it.

249
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,446
- I thought we were stealing it.
- Feels like we're stealing it.

250
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,608
We're not stealing.

251
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,187
- I definitely thought we're stealing it.
- All right.

252
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,120
Let's focus.
Can we get back to the plan?

253
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,351
Well, I need a battery
for this kind of job.

254
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,553
Can I at least steal a battery?

255
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,660
Fine, steal the battery.

256
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,396
Now, all right, here is the Frogger.

257
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,968
This is the front door...

258
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,502
...and this is the outlet.

259
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,866
What's that?

260
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,439
The outlet?

261
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,300
That's where the electricity
comes out of.

262
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,708
Oh, you mean the holes?

263
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,409
- Which one's the bathroom?
- Here.

264
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,350
They put the Frogger with the toilet?

265
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,921
The Frogger is here.

266
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,024
George, I thought that was the door.

267
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,788
- Where are the pizza ovens?
- I thought the bathroom was here.

268
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,858
All right? You understand now?

269
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,868
It's not that complicated.

270
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,168
I need to replace
an antique piece of cake.

271
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,337
Do you have anything that's been...

272
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,375
...you know, lying around for a while?

273
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,680
Something pre-war
would be just great.

274
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,977
Oh, hey, Elaine.

275
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,746
Oh, you got the munchies?

276
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,413
No, Kramer, I am in big,
big, big trouble.

277
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,152
I need a cake that looks like this.

278
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,153
Oh yeah, Sotherby's.

279
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,389
Yeah, they make good cake.

280
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,698
- Do any of these look close?
- No.

281
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,700
But I know,
I've seen cake just like that.

282
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,270
Oh, Entenmann's, yeah.

283
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,566
Entenmann's?
From the supermarket?

284
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,572
No, they're not really
in the supermarket.

285
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,405
They got their own case
at the end of the aisle.

286
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,305
Hi, Lisi.

287
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,476
- Hi, honey. Is that a bat?
- Yeah.

288
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,588
I found it on the street.

289
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,621
It's gotta be worth something.

290
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,055
So, what do you want to do,
sweetheart?

291
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,388
Well, before we do anything...

292
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,565
...maybe we should talk.

293
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,828
Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing
comes out of nowhere.

294
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,495
I mean, how am I supposed
to respond to that?

295
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,734
Then may I say something
without being interrupted?

296
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,402
Well, I'm sorry if I ruined your life.

297
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,845
That's exactly what I set out to do.

298
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,251
Are you afraid to kiss me in public?

299
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,288
Have we even been in public?

300
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,426
Now you're gonna tell me
what I'm thinking.

301
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,052
Well, go ahead, because
I'd really like to know.

302
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,721
You are not dumb.

303
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,161
Don't say that.

304
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,333
These beans are pretty good.

305
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,596
Twenty minutes.

306
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,074
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Brad.

307
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,903
I'm me.

308
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,472
Nice to meet you.

309
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,972
Boy, did your mother
do a number on you.

310
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,288
Fine. So it's over.

311
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,981
Oh, thank God.

312
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,888
Why is it dark out? What time is it?

313
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,519
Nine-thirty.

314
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,893
We've been breaking up
for 10 hours?

315
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,659
Goodbye, Jerry.

316
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,562
Lopper.

317
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,636
We should give this
a little more time.

318
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,469
- See how it looks in the light of day.
- Out.

319
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,481
Lopper.

320
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,015
Lisi. Lisi, let me in.

321
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,959
We can work this out. I was wrong,
you were right. I'll do anything.

322
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,339
Jerry, you came for the big moment.

323
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,996
No, I'm waiting for...

324
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,835
Everything's timed out to perfection.

325
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,137
Pete's got the Frogger
running on battery power.

326
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,837
The truck'll be there.
Kramer's taped out a loading zone.

327
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,073
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

328
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,082
- Come over tonight. We can play.
- Oh, I can't, I'm busy.

329
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,911
I'm going away on a long weekend.

330
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,715
- Where?
- Look what I found.

331
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,324
I got one for you too.

332
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:10,923
Oh, great.

333
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,057
Why don't you put it in the car
so I don't accidentally...

334
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,100
- ...toss it in that dumpster?
- Okay.

335
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,568
I'll meet thee in front of your place.
15 minutes.

336
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,368
A long, long weekend.

337
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,341
I hear thee.

338
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,378
Elaine, excellent.

339
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,281
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine,
Irwin Lubeck.

340
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,081
- Oh, hello.
- Charmed.

341
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,383
All right.

342
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,786
Brace yourself, Lubeck...

343
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,120
...you are about to be launched,
via pastry...

344
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,822
...back to the wedding of one
of the most dashing and romantic...

345
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,435
...Nazi sympathizers
of the entire British royal family.

346
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,402
- I guess, I'll just-
- Oh, no, Elaine, stay. Lubeck here...

347
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,406
...is the world's foremost
appraiser of vintage pastry.

348
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,307
All right, Lubeck,
how much is she worth?

349
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,948
I'd say about 219.

350
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,812
Two hundred
and nineteen thousand dollars.

351
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,682
Lubeck, you glorious tit-willow...

352
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,189
...you just made me
a profit of a $190,000.

353
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,453
No. $2.19.

354
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,755
It's an Entenmann's.

355
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,627
Do they have a castle in Windsor?

356
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,003
No, they have a display case
at the end of the aisle.

357
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,800
Oh, good Lord.

358
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,001
You all right, Peterman?
You look ill.

359
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,808
<i>Get well, get well soon
We want you to get well</i>

360
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:44,115
<i>Get well, get well soon
We want you to get well</i>

361
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,793
Hey. What are you guys doing?

362
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,158
Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got it.

363
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,697
You idiots.
You're gonna wear down the battery.

364
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,391
Oh, the batteries are fine.

365
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,160
We've got...

366
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,238
- ...oh, God, only three minutes left.
- All right, quick.

367
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,466
- Get this thing back in the pizzeria.
- George, they closed up.

368
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,736
- I need an outlet.
- A what?

369
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:11,178
- Holes. I need holes.
- The pharmacy's still open.

370
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,719
All right, Kramer, you block off traffic.
You two, go sweet-talk the pharmacist.

371
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,887
You owe me a quarter.

372
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,621
Slippery Pete.

373
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,256
Kramer, hurry up.

374
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,562
I'm out. No tape left.

375
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,500
Come on, I'll help you
push it across.

376
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,970
Wait a minute. This looks familiar.

377
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,268
This reminds me of something.

378
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,071
- I can do this.
- By yourself?

379
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:46,707
Jerry, I've been preparing
for this moment my entire life.

380
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,394
He looks like a frog.

381
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,867
So do you.

382
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,394
Game over.

383
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,234
Mr. Peterman, you wanted
to see me, sir?

384
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,242
Elaine, up until a moment ago...

385
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,849
...I was convinced that I was on the
receiving end of one of the oldest...

386
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,575
...baker's grift in the books.

387
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,318
The Entenmann's shim sham.

388
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,184
Until I remembered the videotape
surveillance system...

389
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,023
...that I installed to catch other Walter
using my latrine.

390
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,031
But it also caught this.

391
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,713
- Mr. Peterman, I-
- Elaine, I have a question for you.

392
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,379
Is the item still...

393
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,546
...with you?

394
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,721
As far as I know.

395
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,798
Do you know what happens
to a butter-based frosting...

396
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,233
...after six decades in
a poorly-ventilated English basement?

397
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,633
I guess I hadn't -

398
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,139
I have a feeling what you
are about to go through...

399
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,244
...is punishment enough.

400
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,409
Dismissed.
