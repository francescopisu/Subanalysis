1
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,571
So Elaine, are you gonna sleep
with me or what?

2
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,807
George, I just got off
a 23-hour plane ride.

3
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:20,180
I'm too tired to even vomit
at the thought.

4
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,753
Fine. I'll ask you again
when you're rested.

5
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,219
I'm sure she'll come around.

6
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,621
Yeah, I hope so, for your sake.

7
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,055
I said, I was sorry.

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,059
You can stuff your sorries in a sack.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,357
Would you please stop saying that?

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,023
- What's up with you two?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

11
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,361
So how was the big trip?

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,901
I don't wanna talk about it.

13
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,871
- Well, what happened to your nose?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,067
Well, you gotta give me something.

15
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,145
Come on, how was the wedding?
Was the bride radiant?

16
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,746
She was.

17
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,042
Till she found out Elaine slept
with the groom.

18
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,947
Oh, that sounds juicy.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,886
Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom,
but I wanna hear all about it.

20
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,721
You know, I didn't go to the bathroom
the entire time we were India.

21
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,262
I can't believe we went all the way
to India for a wedding.

22
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,469
- That's it. The wedding's off.
- But Sue Ellen-

23
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,802
Elaine, you were my maid of honor
and you slept with my Pinter?

24
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,102
No, no. It was years ago,
before you met him.

25
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,111
And I gotta tell you,
it was very mechanical.

26
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,272
I have never been so humiliated.

27
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,941
Idiots. This is all your fault.

28
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,180
- Me? Him. His fault. He betrayed me.
- George, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,347
You can stuff your sorries
in a sack, mister.

30
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,425
I don't know what that means.

31
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,358
Nina, you have to decide right now.
Jerry or me.

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,828
All right. Neither.

33
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,523
What?

34
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,328
- What are you doing here?
- A free trip to India.

35
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:49,305
And by the way, you can take off those
boots. Everyone knows you're 5'6".

36
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,639
- 5'8". 5'7".
- See?

37
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:56,373
See the way they are?
We're still best friends, right?

38
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,814
No. And take that stupid thing
out of your nose.

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,349
That's got to hurt.
I don't care where you're from.

40
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,483
When is our flight back?
I gotta go to the bathroom.

41
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,363
Hi.

42
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,999
What happened last night?

43
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,005
- Well, you were pretty loaded.
- I know.

44
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,167
I woke up with this.

45
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,506
Oh, hello, tetanus.

46
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,944
George, I've used the bathroom.
It's fine.

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,179
No, no, no. I can walk it off.

48
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,450
It's 120 degrees in here.
I'll sweat it out.

49
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,195
Hey.

50
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,194
Are those Timberlands...

51
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,855
...painted black?

52
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,864
Is your nose pierced?

53
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,503
- I should-
- Yeah. Sit down.

54
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:58,234
Hello, Jerry.
I believe you know Nina.

55
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,003
George, we need to talk.

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,774
You've done a lot more than talk.
You betrayed me.

57
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,043
All right, I admit it.
I slept with Nina, but that's all.

58
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,619
That's all? That's everything.

59
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,086
I don't know what the rest of it
is for, anyway.

60
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,554
I'm really sorry.

61
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,784
You can stuff your sorries in a sack,
mister.

62
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,088
- Where'd you get that one?
- It's an expression.

63
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,890
Hey.

64
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,931
Look, we are gonna settle this
right now.

65
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,835
I demand reparations.
I should get to sleep with Elaine.

66
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,566
It's the only way to punish you.

67
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:36,238
That doesn't punish me. It punishes
Elaine. And cruelly, I might add.

68
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,482
Funny guy.

69
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,952
Hey, monkeys. Knock it off.

70
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,249
My best friend is trying
to get married here.

71
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,724
Elaine, you have to sleep with me.

72
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,226
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

73
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,523
Reparations.

74
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,764
Would you grow up, George?
What is the difference?

75
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,631
Nina slept with him, he slept with me,
I slept with Pinter.

76
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,171
Nobody cares.
It's all ancient history.

77
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,309
You slept with the groom?

78
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:26,094
Thank you, FDR.

79
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,463
- All right, now we're even, huh?
- I stuck a rock in there too.

80
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,503
- I felt that.
- All right. Okay.

81
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,699
All right, FDR.

82
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,399
This wish is for all the marbles.

83
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,772
You win, you get your wish,
I drop dead.

84
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,645
I win, I don't drop dead and I get
100 percent anti-drop-dead protection.

85
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:45,806
Forever.

86
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,815
All right.

87
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,024
Man.

88
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,292
Come on. There's gotta be something
that'll change your mind.

89
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,487
Something.

90
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,628
What, you want my kidney?

91
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:19,475
George knows that you slept with Nina.
That's why he was acting so weird.

92
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,210
How did he find out?

93
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,685
He schnapped me.

94
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,588
You know you're not supposed to drink
while you're keeping a secret.

95
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,760
- Is there anything else?
- I can't tell you.

96
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,365
Here, drink this.

97
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,058
Okay.

98
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,406
I slept with the groom.

99
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,169
- Pinter?
- He used to be called Peter.

100
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,541
So who cares about that?

101
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,616
Sue Ellen.

102
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:55,220
If she knew, she'd call off
the whole wedding.

103
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,186
Oh, nobody's calling off
any weddings.

104
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,792
All right, it's time to go.

105
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,056
Come on. Up.

106
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,899
- You know what Jerry is in Indian?
- No. What?

107
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,058
Jugdish.

108
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,500
- Yes, Jugdish.
- Hey.

109
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,205
What if I got my nose pierced?

110
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,211
That would be pretty freaky.

111
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,008
Yes. I think it's a fine idea.

112
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,177
Well, good night.

113
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,722
Good night, Jugdish.

114
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,793
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

115
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,070
Hello, FDR.

116
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,975
Yeah, I'll have a hot one.

117
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,308
Everything on it.

118
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,509
These things will kill you.
But so what?

119
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,313
You're already gonna drop dead.

120
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,512
Well, guess what, FDR?

121
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,149
I made a wish on a shooting star last
night and I wished against your wish.

122
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,488
That's funny. As it happens...

123
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:14,622
...I saw the same shooting star
and I double-wished you to drop dead.

124
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,790
Here's your change.

125
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,005
All right, I'm triple-wishing.

126
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:25,910
Yeah, fair enough.
I'm quadruple-wishing.

127
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,011
All right. How do you like this?

128
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,214
I like it a lot.

129
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,853
Go.

130
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,929
Oh, God, it's so hot.

131
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,659
And what is that smell?

132
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,999
I think it's the stench of death.

133
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,742
George, you've been wearing
those boots since I met you.

134
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,276
You're not gonna wear them
to the wedding, are you?

135
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,811
No.

136
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,411
I'm gonna wear black shoes.

137
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,250
Oh, boy, there's Sue Ellen.

138
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,355
She didn't want me at this wedding.

139
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,754
But here I am with a bunch
of my idiot friends.

140
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,689
This is gonna be great.

141
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,387
Elaine? Oh.

142
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,124
Oh, I am so happy to see you.

143
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,098
- You are?
- Well, of course.

144
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,568
No one else was even willing
to come to India.

145
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,038
I mean, not even Pinter's parents
and they're Indian.

146
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,677
Come on, Sue Ellen,
you don't wear a bra...

147
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,904
...you're tall. We hate each other.

148
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,517
Elaine, I know.
I know we've had our problems.

149
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,019
But I want you to be my maid of honor
and my best friend.

150
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,419
All right, I guess.

151
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:52,260
Oh, this is my fiancé.
Pinter, say hello.

152
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,796
Hello.

153
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,958
- Peter.
- Oh, no. It's Pinter.

154
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,570
Does anyone wanna use
the bathroom?

155
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,264
Oh, no, no. We're good.
Let's get going, all right.

156
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,432
Watch it, funny man.

157
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,578
Elaine, do you notice George
was acting strange the whole flight?

158
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,707
No, what? Like what? Strange? No.

159
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,883
Hey, look what they had
on the plane.

160
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,579
Schnapps.

161
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,928
Come on, come on.

162
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,087
Yes. There's one.

163
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,359
I wish I don't drop dead.

164
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,230
Hey, shut up up there.

165
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,840
- You shut up.
- Drop dead.

166
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,839
Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?

167
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,448
Coach to India. The only way to go.

168
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,711
Good one. Very funny.

169
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,115
You're very funny, Jerry.

170
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,812
That's what I always tell people.

171
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,356
Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy.

172
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,753
- Are you all right?
- Of course I'm all right.

173
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,329
I'm here with my girl. Nina.

174
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,300
And what better way to pass the time
than gabbing with my best friend.

175
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,701
With whom there are no secrets.

176
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,363
Like this...

177
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,443
- ...since fourth grade.
- Didn't I beat you up in fourth grade?

178
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,046
Funny guy.

179
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,442
Right here.

180
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,243
By the way...

181
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,443
...you never said anything to George
about Jerry and me, did you?

182
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,146
Oh, please, it's in the vault.

183
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,522
Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy.

184
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,327
Hey, what time is it?

185
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,230
You just asked me two minutes ago.

186
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,500
- Hey, what time is it?
- I'm not wearing a watch.

187
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,968
Is this tooth chipped?

188
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,636
Yeah. How'd you do that?

189
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,679
I have no idea.

190
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,007
Watch this.

191
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,926
Oh, God.

192
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,358
So Jerry and Nina, huh?

193
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:14,171
I'm not gonna tell you
any more things.

194
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,375
You already told me everything.

195
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,238
Okey-dokey.

196
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,473
We had a deal, Newman.

197
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,211
You were supposed to give me your
birthday wish. Now you've wasted it.

198
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,116
Did I?

199
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,725
Newman, I'm bored.

200
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,919
- Does your girlfriend have to be here?
- Does yours?

201
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,791
I'm just hanging out in this hellhole
because of George.

202
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,559
Come on, Newman.
You gotta help me.

203
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,533
What am I gonna do about FDR?

204
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,866
Why don't you just make
another wish?

205
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,065
And how am I gonna do that,
toots?

206
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,910
What about a shooting star?

207
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,540
- That's perfect.
- Beauty and brains.

208
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,411
Oh, come on.

209
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,281
You know he's a postman,
don't you?

210
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,785
- Here's your plane ticket.
- What?

211
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:14,024
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation
one week before her wedding in India.

212
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,258
I'll show her.

213
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,801
- By flying half way around the world?
- Spite never sleeps.

214
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,270
Especially when you got a layover
in Sarajevo.

215
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,133
- Hey.
- Here.

216
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,800
You're going to India tomorrow.

217
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,172
- For how long?
- Three days.

218
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:31,510
Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had
the best time with that Nina last night.

219
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,120
I think I'm in love with her already.
You are a great friend.

220
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,847
A great, great friend.

221
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,753
Kramer. You wanna borrow
something? You wanna eat?

222
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,157
- Wanna go to India?
- I can't.

223
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,957
I'm gonna drop dead.

224
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,531
Great. Nina could go, huh?

225
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,133
Jerry, this is great.

226
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,565
You and Elaine. Me and Nina.

227
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,102
Kramer, I'll go with you.

228
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,298
- I'm going to Newman's.
- Great, I love Newman.

229
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,670
Jerry seem a little weird
when I mentioned Nina?

230
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,177
Nina? Nina? Nope. Not weird.
No. Nina.

231
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,146
- Why do you keep saying Nina?
- I don't know. Nina.

232
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,251
Nina.

233
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,978
I'm gonna go grab a bite.

234
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,091
I'll meet you down there.

235
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,561
Cereal. Cereal.

236
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,857
Peach schnapps.

237
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,234
Come on, Lomez.
We're gonna be late for the movie.

238
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,968
You see, my dear,
all certified mail is registered...

239
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:35,512
...but registered mail
is not necessarily certified.

240
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,775
I could listen to you
talk about mail all day.

241
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,578
Anything you wish.

242
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,950
I'll tell you a little secret
about zip codes.

243
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,057
They're meaningless.

244
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,225
Newman.

245
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,296
Lomez, I'm leaving.

246
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:11,548
Make a wish, Newman. We've gotta
get back to work in three hours.

247
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,776
Newman. Wait.

248
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,012
Kramer. I'm with people.

249
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,850
Yeah, yeah.
And thanks for inviting me.

250
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:24,656
I did invite you. Your invitation
must have gotten lost in the mail.

251
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,297
Look, Newman, I need your wish
to protect me from FDR.

252
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,167
No. I'm on an unbelievable
birthday-wish hot streak.

253
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,104
My last five birthday wishes
came true.

254
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,767
Come on. Look, I'll give you
my next birthday wish.

255
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,607
Your next 50 wishes.

256
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,941
Forty-eight.

257
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,447
- Forty-nine.
- Done.

258
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,607
- Sucker.
- Sucker.

259
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,717
All right, I'm back, savages, back.

260
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,722
I haven't made my wish yet.

261
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,301
Well, this Mischke mishmash
is just getting worse.

262
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,170
I talked to the groom's parents and it is
obvious that they don't want me to go.

263
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,141
The reason she sent me an
invitation is so I'd send a gift.

264
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,577
- Jerry.
- You know, coffee grinder's nice...

265
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,583
...or a coffee maker. Everyone likes
coffee. Maybe you should go get-

266
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,948
Oh, hi.

267
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,645
Hi.

268
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,347
- I should-
- Sure.

269
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,051
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

270
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,990
Who else you got back there?

271
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,363
There was an awkward moment
in the conversation.

272
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,526
Never happened before.

273
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,572
You slept with Nina.
What are you gonna tell George?

274
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,174
Nothing. And neither will you.

275
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,141
George can never know about this.
It'll crush him.

276
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,338
All right, I'll put it in the vault.

277
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,608
No good. Too many people
know the combination.

278
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,876
What combination?

279
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,288
Don't be ridiculous.

280
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,324
Oh, my God, this drawer
is filled with Froot Loops.

281
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,687
So what?

282
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,556
And milk.

283
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,224
Oh, jeez.

284
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,926
Hello?

285
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,683
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat.

286
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,340
Please.

287
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,247
Call us Usha and Zubin.

288
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,082
- Well, Usha.
- I'm Zubin.

289
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,282
Anyway, your son is marrying
my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke-

290
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,655
You're not going to the wedding,
are you?

291
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,558
- Well.
- Don't go.

292
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,723
India is a dreadful, dreadful place.

293
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,097
You know, it's the only country
that still has the plague.

294
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,000
I mean, the plague. Please.

295
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,766
Here's the registry.

296
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,538
Send her a gift and be glad
you did not have to go.

297
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,682
Right. Don't go. Send a gift?

298
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,784
I think I understand.

299
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:04,252
If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go
to the bathroom the entire trip.

300
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,220
That's fantastic.

301
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,952
And I'm not so crazy
about Manhattan either.

302
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,431
You were gonna tell me
all about George.

303
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,867
When you see him tomorrow night
tell him that the waiter liked him.

304
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,267
Really?

305
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,998
Believe me.

306
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,439
I forgot how much fun it is
hanging out with you.

307
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,603
I know. You know,
we never had a bad conversation.

308
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,273
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably
the reason we never fooled around.

309
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,885
Yeah.

310
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:38,951
Probably the reason.

311
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,229
Are you dense?

312
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,736
I said, I wanted you to drop dead.

313
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,299
Now, drop dead.

314
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,838
I knew it. Stupid Jerry.

315
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,115
I know what I'm saying.
No way FDR wants you to drop dead.

316
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,815
- But you have-
- Just go back and ask him again.

317
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,188
That's right. My birthday wish
was that you drop dead.

318
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,351
Well, why?

319
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,997
I have my reasons.

320
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,991
Wait, if you make a birthday wish
out loud, it doesn't come true.

321
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,627
That's just a silly superstition.

322
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,542
Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.

323
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,410
- FDR?
- Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski.

324
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,915
I go to his birthday party...

325
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,350
...and just before he blew out
his candles, he gives me this look.

326
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,989
- Stink eye?
- Crook eye?

327
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,648
Evil eye.

328
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,186
Everybody's a little cranky
on their birthday.

329
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,351
Oh, it's a bad day.

330
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,124
Everyone's over. You're thinking:
"These are my friends?"

331
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,789
Everyday is my birthday.

332
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,606
Well, I can't have this hanging
over my head. It's bad mojo.

333
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,536
Hi.

334
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,871
You're not gonna believe
what I got in the mail.

335
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,345
Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's
wedding.

336
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,111
At least the wedding gown
will give her some support.

337
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,514
Not the point.

338
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,589
The wedding is in one week.
I got this today.

339
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,158
- So you think it's a non-vite.
- It's an un-vitation.

340
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,360
- Hey, are you getting taller?
- Timberlands.

341
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,633
Hey, look at this. Pinter Ranawat?

342
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,396
Wonder if he's related to the guy
I dated Peter Ranawat.

343
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,040
It's probably like Smith over there.

344
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,066
- Jerry, would you make the call?
- What call?

345
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,439
He wants me to set him up
with Nina Stengle.

346
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:45,743
Oh, the great conversation girl.
The one you think can replace me.

347
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,681
I was kidding when I said that.

348
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,945
Told me the same thing.

349
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,284
- Nina, hi, it's Jerry.
- You're sure you never slept with her?

350
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,218
- Perfect.
- Hey, how about my friend George...

351
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,225
...quite a guy, huh?

352
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,597
Something's not sitting right.

353
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,924
- I'll have the clams casino.
- Get out.

354
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,090
Chef recommends.

355
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,605
- Do you think she likes me?
- Sure.

356
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,071
How come nothing ever happened
with you and Nina?

357
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,142
Is there a problem with her?
Is she a man?

358
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,302
Are you?

359
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,741
Then what's the reason?

360
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,315
We were too compatible. Our
conversations were so engrossing.

361
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,884
- How engrossing?
- If we had a problem with Elaine...

362
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,614
...we could bring in Nina
and not lose a step.

363
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:30,261
You don't have a replacement
lined up for me, do you?

364
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,487
Like I was saying...

365
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,362
...I couldn't make the transition
from conversation to sex.

366
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,970
There were no awkward pauses.
I need an awkward pause.

367
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,629
I'm all awkward pauses.
Fix me up with her.

368
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,402
Well, wait a minute.
Nina just saw me in my Timberlands.

369
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,512
I have to wear them
every time I see her.

370
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,148
- Why?
- In any other shoe, I lose 2 inches.

371
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,410
I can't have a drop-down.
We're eye to eye. I can't go eye to chin.

372
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,645
So you're gonna wear them
no matter what?

373
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:00,053
In every situation.
No matter how silly I look.

374
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,352
- Tastes a little funky.
- I'm sure it's fine.

375
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,328
Go on, make a wish,
make a wish.

376
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,746
This is the kind of day that almost
makes you feel good to be alive.

377
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,745
- New Timberlands?
- Yeah, and a whole new me.

378
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,856
- I'm up 2 inches on these babies.
- Really?

379
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,186
5'8". 5'7".

380
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,290
- Jerry.
- Nina.

381
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,622
- Hi.
- It's been years.

382
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,264
- Yeah.
- George, this is Nina.

383
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,798
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

384
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,503
India?

385
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:53,933
Yeah, right.

386
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,239
I'm going to India.

387
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,915
And they call it the World Wide Web.

388
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,424
You can e-mail anyone.

389
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,222
What are you, a scientist?

390
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,696
Gotta go.

391
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,033
- It was great talking.
- Great talking to you.

392
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,261
What the hell is e-mail?

393
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,467
- How was the date?
- Pretty good.

394
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,040
I think she might be the one.

395
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,939
- Oh, French fries.
- George.

396
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,174
Baked potato. Sorry.

397
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,115
Yeah, you stuff your sorries
in a sack, mister.

398
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,619
Oh, hey, hey. Yeah. Check it out.

399
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,951
Man, it's packing tight.

400
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,460
Why are you bringing
snowballs in here?

401
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,028
I need some water.
Ice it up, nice and hard.

402
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,665
Then when you throw it:

403
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,801
Oh, look, there's my friend FDR.

404
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,163
I'm gonna nail him
in the back of the head.

405
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,237
It's gonna be great.

406
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,113
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hey.

407
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,044
Let's go some place else.
Okay, Peter?

408
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,282
Hey, how you doing?

409
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,929
Oh, hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I'm moving in.

410
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,361
Saw your name on the buzzer.
You must be Kessler.

411
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,626
No, actually, it's Kramer.

412
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,994
- You need any help or-?
- No, thanks.

413
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,695
I ordered a pizza, you want some?

414
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,467
No, no, no. I couldn't impose.

415
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,666
Why not?

416
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,277
We're neighbors.
What's mine is yours.

417
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,515
Really?

418
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,676
<i>Good night, Jugdish.</i>
