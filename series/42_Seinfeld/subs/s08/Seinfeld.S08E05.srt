1
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,507
Boy, I really miss
the Bermuda Triangle.

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,905
I guess there's not much action
there these days.

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,339
Oh, there's action.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,740
There's plenty of action.

5
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,541
It's that damn alien autopsy
stealing all the headlines.

6
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:17,944
Yeah, tell me about it.

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,485
See, what they gotta do is lose
a plane or a Greenpeace boat.

8
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,781
See, that would get
the Triangle going again.

9
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,051
What keeps the water in there?
I mean, why doesn't that disappear?

10
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,858
Now, what would be the point
of taking the water?

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,097
It's gorgeous water.

12
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,866
Do we own Bermuda?

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,266
No, it belongs to the British.

14
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,539
Lucky Krauts.

15
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,037
What do you think
of that alien autopsy?

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,678
-Oh, that's real.
-I think so too.

17
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,917
The doctor will be
with you in a moment.

18
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,758
"Difficult"?

19
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,901
Elaine, you shouldn't
be reading that.

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,095
Now, tell me
about this rash of yours.

21
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,669
Well, it's-- It's....

22
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,208
You know, I notice
that someone wrote in my chart...

23
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,974
...that I was difficult
in January of '92.

24
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,879
And I have to tell you,
I remember that appointment exactly.

25
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:29,488
You see, this nurse
had asked me to put a gown on...

26
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,988
...but it was a mole on my shoulder...

27
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,649
...and actually I had specifically
worn a tank top...

28
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,626
...so that I wouldn't
have to put a gown on.

29
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,764
You know, they're made of paper.

30
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,898
Well, that was a long time ago.

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,631
How about if I just erase it?

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,938
Now, about that rash?

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,009
But it was in pen.

34
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,376
You fake erased.

35
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,150
All right, Miss Benes.
This doesn't look too serious.

36
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,053
You should be fine.

37
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,818
What are you writing?

38
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,292
Doctor?

39
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,563
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

40
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,498
I hope you got that
mustard stain out of your shirt.

41
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,036
Jerry, what's the matter
with your stereo?

42
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,842
I don't know.
What's the matter with your stereo?

43
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,383
I traded it to Lomez for some steaks.

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,448
-Hey.
-Hey.

45
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,647
-Now, see, this is busted.
-No, it works.

46
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,655
-It's busted.
-Watch out. Let me show you.

47
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,227
All you gotta do is-- You gotta
jiggle it with this screwdriver.

48
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,761
Smile.

49
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,058
-What are you doing?
-I met this woman Sheila.

50
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,531
She works down at the one-hour
photo place.

51
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,865
She's got this incredible smile.
It's like she's got too many teeth.

52
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,438
Extra teeth. I love that look.

53
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,701
And check this out. I go to pick up
my pictures and she says:

54
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,244
"l hope you got that mustard stain
out of your shirt."

55
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,746
-What mustard stain?
-Don't you see?

56
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,385
She's looking at my pictures.

57
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,714
Why did you take a picture
of a mustard stain?

58
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,016
-It's got nothing to do with this.
-I see, she's looking.

59
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,319
Yes.

60
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,427
You gotta get this thing fixed.

61
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,757
They've tried.
It keeps coming back the same.

62
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,400
-You interested in a refund?
-I can't get a refund.

63
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,731
-The warranty expired two years ago.
-Would you be interested?

64
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,394
-How you gonna--?
-Would you?

65
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,972
-I guess I would.
-Yeah, yeah.

66
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,873
You are not gonna believe...

67
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,604
...what happened to me
at the doctor's office today.

68
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,475
Not the gown again?

69
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,113
No. No. I was looking at my chart,
and it said that I was difficult.

70
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,811
Why would they write that?

71
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,251
They've gotten to know you.

72
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,121
And then the doctor
writes more stuff down there...

73
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,386
...and he doesn't
even look at my rash.

74
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,553
Find one that doesn't
know you're difficult.

75
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,666
Come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.

76
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,462
Why? Because you dress casual
and sleep with a lot of guys?

77
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,299
-Listen to me, you little sh--
-Smile.

78
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,142
Elaine, you really
didn't have to put on the gown.

79
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,170
It's my pleasure. I love these.

80
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,077
You know, in fact,
I've got one at home.

81
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,684
It's perfect when you
just wanna throw something on.

82
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,278
-Hi.
-Thank you.

83
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,316
All right.

84
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,323
Let me just review your history
before we begin.

85
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,155
Oh, where did you get my chart?

86
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,196
From your last doctor.
It's standard procedure.

87
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,426
You know, I can tell you my
whole history. Let's just--

88
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,199
Okay. Let's take a look.

89
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,076
Well, that doesn't look too serious.
You'll be fine.

90
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,376
Please, please. It--
But it's really, really itchy.

91
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,684
Oh, no.

92
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,091
-Seinfeld?
-Yeah.

93
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,722
Got a package for you. Sign here.

94
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,491
-Oh, who's it from?
-No return address.

95
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,895
What if I don't want it?

96
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,960
Are you refusing delivery?

97
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,832
-Maybe I am.
-Why would you do that?

98
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,700
-Never done it before.
-Why start now?

99
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,341
Why not?

100
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,872
All right.

101
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,749
Why'd you refuse that?
Everybody loves a package.

102
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,147
I don't know. It was weird.

103
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,050
Crazy printing.
I don't know who from.

104
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,879
What do you think? It's a bomb?

105
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,055
It's not totally impossible.

106
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,526
The ego on you.

107
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,098
-Why can't I be bomb-able?
-Who's gonna bomb you?

108
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,703
An airline for all the stupid
little peanut jokes?

109
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,566
Oh, I suppose you think
you're bomb-able?

110
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,072
Couple people wouldn't mind
having me out of the way.

111
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,267
There's more than a couple.

112
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,403
Check these out.
I just picked them up from Sheila.

113
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,572
She must have loved these.

114
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,275
-You don't have a Mercedes.
-I know. Just leaned on it...

115
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,011
...so it'd look like it was mine.

116
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,746
The driver seems a little put out.

117
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,356
No, he was fine with it.

118
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,219
Check this out.

119
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,255
Is that Burt Reynolds?

120
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,524
Wax Museum.

121
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,135
-What is this?
-That is a lot of skin.

122
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,697
This must be Sheila
from the photo place.

123
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,808
-You can barely see her face.
-She must have slipped it in here.

124
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:26,075
-Photo-store Sheila.
-Well, hello, photo-store Sheila.

125
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,846
All right. I will see you boys later.

126
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,182
-Where are you going?
-To ask her out.

127
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,952
-No, no. You're not playing the game.
-What game?

128
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,289
She goes to these lengths
to entice you...

129
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,261
...and your only response is,
"Gee, I really like your picture.

130
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,300
Would you like to go out
on a date with me, please?"

131
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,972
-No good?
-It's the timeless art of seduction.

132
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,703
You gotta join in the dance.
She sends you an enticing photo...

133
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,144
-...you send her one right back.
-Oh, I don't know.

134
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,807
Well, as you know, I've always
been something of a photog.

135
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,955
Oh, yeah, I like this idea.

136
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,248
Hey, Danny.

137
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,485
-Hello. How are you?
-Hey, Leo.

138
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,459
Hey, what's with your nephew?
He wouldn't accept the package.

139
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,656
Oh, he wants it.
He's just trying to be funny.

140
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,698
Yeah, I'll sign for it.

141
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,031
And then he started
writing on my chart.

142
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,268
Just get ahold of it
and change what you don't like.

143
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,638
You can't change your chart.
It's your chart.

144
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,837
I'm in my personnel file
at work all the time.

145
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,745
-You are?
-I've kept the same job over two years.

146
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,647
It's not luck.

147
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,214
Elaine, have you ever sent a racy
photograph of yourself to anyone?

148
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,719
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know.

149
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,452
You remember my Christmas card?

150
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,223
Oh, right.

151
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,391
The nipple.

152
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,033
But aside from that,
how did you feel about Kramer's work?

153
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,200
Actually, I thought
he was very professional.

154
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,038
-lt was a good experience?
-Oh, yeah.

155
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,647
I liked the picture so much
I cropped out the nipple...

156
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,715
...and I'm using it
for my health-club lD.

157
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,717
-Nice.
-Yeah, it is nice actually.

158
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,720
Please, I've gotta see
Dr. Berg right away.

159
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,882
-This rash is spreading.
-He can't see you. He's busy.

160
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,891
Oh, come on.
Have some compassion.

161
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,429
Well, I hope it's contagious then.

162
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,212
Come on. Move.

163
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,892
Oh, hi, Dr. Berg.

164
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,756
-I didn't know if--
-The chart, Miss Benes.

165
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,531
Oh, please, no more.

166
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,270
-Hey.
-Where's Kramer?

167
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,434
He went to get
some steak sauce. Why?

168
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,544
Personal matter.

169
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,412
-Hello.
-Jerry, it's your Uncle Leo. Hello.

170
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,318
Hello, Leo. You don't have to yell.

171
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,318
I got your package.

172
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,223
-How did you get my package?
-Leo's got your package?

173
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,058
-What should I do with it?
-I don't know what you should do.

174
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,824
Tell him to open it.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,231
I'm not gonna treat my uncle
like a bomb-defusing robot.

176
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,672
Jerry, your cousin Jeffrey...

177
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,899
...is in a Parks Department
production of The Mikado.

178
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,237
I want you to come see it with me.

179
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,973
-Open the package, Leo.
-Okay.

180
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,044
Opening.

181
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,423
So it wasn't a bomb?

182
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,622
No. No bomb.

183
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,465
-Well, then, what?
-Oh, stupid Leo.

184
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,695
He was using those oven cleaners.
He left the canister in there.

185
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,339
The pilot light was on.
The whole thing blew up.

186
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,471
-But he's okay?
-Yeah.

187
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,544
But the explosion singed off
his eyebrows, mustache, everything.

188
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,307
He's all smooth now.
Looks like a seal.

189
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,547
Yes. Hi, yeah, I'm still holding.

190
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,277
Is this my stereo?

191
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,851
Oh, hey, you got it.

192
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,685
Hey, what happened to my stereo?
It's all smashed up.

193
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,022
That's right. Now it looks
like it was broken during shipping...

194
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,187
...and I insured it for $400.

195
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,230
But you were supposed to
get me a refund.

196
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,494
You can't get a refund.
Your warranty expired two years ago.

197
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,064
So we're gonna make the post office
pay for my new stereo now?

198
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,971
-It's a write-off for them.
-How is it a write-off?

199
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,668
They just write it off.

200
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,712
Write it off what?

201
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,907
Jerry, all these big companies,
they write off everything.

202
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,246
You don't even know
what a write-off is.

203
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,382
-Do you?
-No, I don't.

204
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,023
But they do.

205
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,060
And they're the ones writing it off.

206
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,432
I wish I had the last 20 seconds
of my life back.

207
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:15,734
What? What? He doesn't have
one appointment this whole month?

208
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,435
Oh, come on. I'm dying here, man.

209
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,672
Hello? Hello?

210
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,913
Still no luck?

211
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,078
Jerry, that was Dr. Zimmerman.
I'm at the end of the alphabet.

212
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,554
There's no Zorn or Zutroff?

213
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,252
They're on vacation. Every doctor
in this city seems to know who I am.

214
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,289
Hey, what about Dr. Resnick?

215
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,261
My Uncle Leo's
gonna see him tomorrow.

216
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,095
Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.

217
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,032
He's not that good.

218
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,729
Elaine said you were
pretty good at this stuff.

219
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,240
Oh, yeah. Elaine was a fun project.
I enjoyed working with her.

220
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,077
-You don't have your own camera?
-No.

221
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,540
Oh, boy, look at this.

222
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,912
Yeah. Okay.

223
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,519
This looks good.

224
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,177
Very, very, good.

225
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,947
And I like what you're wearing.

226
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,848
-I feel fat.
-No, no. You're stout.

227
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,756
The camera loves stoutness.

228
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,593
Look, we're not gonna do anything
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

229
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,030
The key word is "tasteful."

230
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,763
Now, I want to you relax and have fun
because you're a fun guy.

231
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,137
All right. Let's do it, huh?

232
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,676
Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,443
Okay. Come on. Feel the beat.

234
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,642
Feel the beat. All right.

235
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,687
You know, you got real strong pecs,
but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.

236
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,156
-You want me to take it off?
-Well, I don't know. It's up to you.

237
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,091
-lt would be better if I did?
-Might be. Whatever you want.

238
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,198
-All right. Come on.
-Yeah.

239
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,392
That's it. Come on, George.
That's it. Come on. Give it to me.

240
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,003
Come on. Work it.
Work it. Oh, yeah.

241
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,972
Hold it. Hold it.
Yeah, be a man. Be a man.

242
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,010
Lover boy. You are a lover boy.

243
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,647
Oh, yeah. This can't miss.

244
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,686
Hello?

245
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,191
Is this Elaine Marie Benes?

246
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,092
Yeah. Who's this?

247
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:23,133
We're with the American Medical
Association, the AMA.

248
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,169
Can you confirm the correct spelling
of your last name?

249
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,533
Is it B-E-N-E-S?

250
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,539
Yeah. What is this about?

251
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,178
Goodbye.

252
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,739
Hello?

253
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,781
-Hello?
-What?

254
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,617
Get off the line.
We're trying to make another call.

255
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,915
Oh, sorry.

256
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,130
Elaine. Hello.
What are you doing here?

257
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,730
-Leo, has the doctor been in yet?
-No, I'll ask him about my eyebrows.

258
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,030
Okay. Listen, Leo.
You're hairless, you're scared.

259
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,074
When the doctor comes in, you just
let me do the talking, okay? Okay.

260
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,240
Leo. I understand
you had a little mishap.

261
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,210
It was a fireball.

262
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,043
I never should have left him alone.

263
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:17,588
-And who are you?
-I'm his nurse. Paloma.

264
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,247
You're not my nurse.

265
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,858
He has good days and bad.

266
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,587
Well, what seems to be the problem?

267
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:30,064
-Are my eyebrows gonna grow back?
-And he seems to have a bit of a rash.

268
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,028
-Really?
-Yeah.

269
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,338
Well, there's been a bit of that
going around lately.

270
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,702
Will you excuse me
a minute, Paloma?

271
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,540
I'm just going to get some ointment.

272
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,914
I don't like this. This is too easy.

273
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,214
-Elaine--
-Shut up. I think he's onto us.

274
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,657
Elaine, what about my eyebrows?

275
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,259
Here. Here.

276
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,624
I don't like this, Kramer.

277
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,159
Will it be much longer?

278
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,030
I'm sorry. It looks like the claim
has been red-flagged.

279
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,796
You're under investigation.

280
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,566
-lnvestigation?
-Hello, Jerry.

281
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,239
Hello, Newman.

282
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,542
Kramer, you might as well
run along.

283
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,411
Jerry may be a while.

284
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,349
Suspicion of mail fraud.

285
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,852
Mail fraud?

286
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,389
You're in a lot of trouble, buddy.

287
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,196
Okay, I've got your ointment.
Where's your--

288
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,992
-Where's your nurse?
-She left.

289
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,898
Whoa, whoa, no need to get angry.

290
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,699
-Calm down.
-I am calm.

291
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,705
Leo, I don't care for your demeanor.

292
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,434
Demeanor?

293
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,506
Well, now you're just being difficult.

294
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,744
What are you writing?

295
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:56,377
So I really liked the pictures
I picked up here yesterday.

296
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,150
I'm glad, George.

297
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,690
And here's a little roll...

298
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,327
...that I think you may enjoy.

299
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,790
Great.

300
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,057
Shall we say an hour?

301
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,696
Ron, I gotta go to lunch.
Could you do a roll?

302
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,801
No problem.

303
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,570
By the way, you know that model
who's always in here?

304
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,838
She's missing
one of her lingerie shots.

305
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,710
-Have you seen it?
-No.

306
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,680
All right. All right.

307
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,019
Then let me ask you this:

308
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,087
Don't you find it interesting
that your friend had the foresight...

309
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,321
...to purchase postal insurance
for your stereo? Huh?

310
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,558
I mean, parcels are rarely
damaged during shipping.

311
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,232
-Define "rarely."
-Frequently.

312
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,931
Are we about
through here, Newman?

313
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:55,043
It's pretty hot
under these lights, huh, Seinfeld?

314
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,508
Pretty hot.

315
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,586
Actually, I'm quite comfortable.

316
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,592
-Can I have a sip?
-No.

317
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,225
Not gonna play ball, huh?

318
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,097
All right. Admit it.

319
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,431
That stereo was already busted.

320
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,369
You can't prove anything.

321
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,203
Is this or is this not your signature?

322
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,609
No, as a matter of fact, it isn't.

323
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,512
"Uncle Leo"?

324
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,114
This case is closed
pending further evidence.

325
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,057
Jerry!

326
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,393
Get in there, get the chart,
and get out. You got it?

327
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,627
No problem.
Listen, let me borrow your scarf.

328
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,499
-What? This?
-Yeah. It's nice. Yeah.

329
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,735
-Here.
-Yeah. All right.

330
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,308
-One chart coming up.
-Okay.

331
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,968
It's Bennett, right?

332
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,977
It's Benes, you jackass.

333
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,139
My last name is Benes.

334
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,585
Yeah.

335
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,117
Jerry. Jerry.

336
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,021
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

337
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,187
Jerry. Jerry?

338
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,066
Jerry.

339
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,301
So I like what you've done there.

340
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,032
-May I help you?
-Yes, yes.

341
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,941
I'm Dr. Van Nostrund
from the clinic.

342
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,139
I'm gonna need Elaine Benes' chart.

343
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,285
She's a patient of mine...

344
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,277
...and I don't think
she's gonna make it. It's very bad.

345
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,015
Very, very messy.

346
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,125
I see. And what clinic is that again?

347
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,222
That's correct.

348
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,493
- Excuse me?
-From the Hoffermandorf Neo Clinic...

349
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,896
-...in Belgium.
-Oh, really?

350
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,630
The Netherlands?

351
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,339
-Where's my chart? Did you get it?
-No.

352
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,068
-What? What happened?
-I don't know.

353
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,473
Now they got a chart on me.

354
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,645
I don't know where they could be.

355
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,306
You can't find them.

356
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,712
That's marvelous.

357
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,013
The dance continues.

358
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,151
Well, if I find them I'll call you.

359
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,884
Great. And maybe we could
go out and do something.

360
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,527
Sure.

361
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,264
Hello.

362
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,161
Hi.

363
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,174
-So the little guy finally asked me out.
-Really?

364
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,510
Hey, I can't find
his photos anywhere.

365
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,449
You know what? Some guy from
the post office confiscated them.

366
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,849
He left his card.

367
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,621
I don't know what Newman
wanted to see me for.

368
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,564
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

369
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:04,429
I'm so happy to see you both.

370
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,731
There's just some inconsistencies
I'd like to straighten out.

371
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,967
-I'm clean, Newman, and you know it.
-Clean? Hardly.

372
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,904
This doesn't look like a man...

373
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,744
...who's happy with his stereo
performance, now, does it?

374
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,943
-Where did you get that?
-That's one of mine.

375
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,886
Looks like you're breaking into it
like an otter cracks open a clam.

376
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,789
I don't know about that,
but there's an explanation.

377
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,658
Yes. It's called "mail fraud."

378
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,099
How I've longed
for this moment, Seinfeld.

379
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,395
The day when I would have
the proof I needed...

380
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,970
...to haul you out of your cushy lair...

381
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:45,371
...and expose you to the light of justice
as the monster that you are.

382
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,479
-A monster so vile--
-Newman!

383
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,344
There'll be a small fine.

384
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,146
Okay.

385
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,815
-Can we go now?
-Not so fast, pretty boy.

386
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,429
There's more to this
sordid little affair.

387
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,130
Oh, my God.

388
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,866
This photo clearly indicates
your involvement...

389
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:21,706
...in some ill-conceived
mail-order pornography ring.

390
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,750
As does this one,
found in the same disturbing packet.

391
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,882
Oh, my God!

392
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:37,058
We have a few questions
we'd like you to answer.

393
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,198
I have a few questions of my own.

394
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,199
Hi. One of your mailmen--

395
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,067
Oh, my God. George.

396
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,672
Well, Sheila, it's not what you think.

397
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,705
I put my trust in the wrong person.

398
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,845
He said the key word was "tasteful."

399
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,644
The timeless art of seduction.

400
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,156
Oh, gee.

401
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,829
That wasn't such a long drive.

402
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,761
The dirt road really hurt my back.

403
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,336
Okay, please,
everybody just stop complaining.

404
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,700
Smile. We're good patients.

405
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,502
Okay, Miss Benes,
you wanna come on back?

406
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,009
-Oh, I'd love to.
-Oh, just a second.

407
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,909
-Okay.
-Hello.

408
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,738
Yes.

409
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,715
Well, as a matter of fact,
they're here right now.

410
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,611
I understand.
