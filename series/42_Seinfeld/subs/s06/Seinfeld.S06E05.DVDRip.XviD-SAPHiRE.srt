1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,471
Love seat is interesting.
Some guy thought:

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,665
"If they won't sit closer to us
why not just shorten the furniture?"

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,971
My favorite furniture brand
is the La-Z-Boy.

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,309
This is very flattering
to the prospective customer, isn't it?

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,109
Why not call it the half-conscious-
deadbeat-with-no-job-home-all-day...

6
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,950
...eating-Cheetos
and-watching-TV recliner?

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,923
And it goes back so far, that thing.

8
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:32,224
I mean, go to bed already.
It's over. You're wiped.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,063
So she got you to join a book club?

10
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,300
I got a feeling I'm gonna be
much smarter than you pretty soon.

11
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:48,379
Well, I think that statement alone
reflects your burgeoning intelligence.

12
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,880
- What about this one?
- No, I don't like that one.

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,511
<i>- So, what's your first book?
- Breakfast at Tiffany's. Ninety pages.</i>

14
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,222
- It's kind of old, isn't it?
- They wanted a Truman Capote book.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,227
Oh, sure, Truman Capote.

16
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,885
- He's a great writer.
- Oh, yeah.

17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,827
- Ever read anything by him?
- No. You?

18
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,058
No.

19
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,464
What about this one?

20
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,468
Look at this. This is it.

21
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,267
This is what I'm looking for.

22
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,932
Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,442
- Hey, what's going on?
- New couch, baby.

24
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,604
New couch? Why?

25
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,546
I love this couch. The best part is
it doesn't fold out...

26
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,084
...so no one can sleep over.

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,753
Hello.

28
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,356
Hello.

29
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,757
Oh, let me get the door for you.

30
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,060
Be careful.

31
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,498
Wait till you see it. It's perfect.

32
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,434
The guy told me it's one of a kind.
They stopped making it.

33
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,130
What are you doing
with your old couch?

34
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,333
The moving guys are taking it.
You want it?

35
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,841
Yeah, I'll take it.

36
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,842
I'm sure they can deliver it to you.

37
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,376
Yes, they can.

38
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,013
- Hey, couch is coming.
- It's here.

39
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,120
All right. Yeah. You know,
I'm excited about this, Jerry.

40
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,279
In a way, I feel like I'm getting
a new couch.

41
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,981
Yeah, so do I.

42
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,454
You remember Poppie?

43
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,055
- You mean from Poppie's restaurant?
- Yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,631
Anyway, we're going
into business together.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,427
Remember my idea
about the place...

46
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,298
- ...where you make your own pizza?
- What was that again?

47
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,769
It's a pizza place
where you make your own pie.

48
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,204
We give you the dough,
the sauce, the cheese.

49
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:27,676
You pound it, slap it,
you flip it up into the air...

50
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,681
...put your toppings on,
and you slide it into the oven.

51
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,580
That sounds good, huh?

52
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,416
I can't wait to get me a fella
and make my own pie.

53
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,919
What made you resurrect
that old idea?

54
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,084
Well, I happened to be
eating at Poppie's...

55
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,890
...when I told him the old idea
and his eyes:

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,860
Just lit up.

57
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,332
- You know, he wants to back it.
- I heard Poppie's was good. Let's go.

58
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,495
I'm not going. Didn't he get busted
by the board of health?

59
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,368
No, that was in the past, Jerry.

60
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,773
<i>As it happens, New York magazine
just judged his kitchen...</i>

61
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,776
...to be one of the cleanest
in the city.

62
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:04,246
They got a duck there, you think
you died and went to heaven.

63
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,246
I love duck. Come on, come on.

64
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,149
You gotta order it
two days in advance.

65
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,256
I'll call them,
I'll order the duck for you.

66
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,358
Kramer, I-

67
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,561
Right there, guys. That's perfect.

68
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,969
What do you think, Lainey?

69
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,469
Well, I don't know.
I'll have to sit on it.

70
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,664
Oh, no, I don't want anyone
sitting on it.

71
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,933
Sign here.

72
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,210
Excuse me. I was wondering
if it would be possible...

73
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,008
...if you could you deliver
the old couch to my apartment?

74
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,810
- It's not very far.
- Sure.

75
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,113
Okay. You got room in the truck
for me?

76
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,422
I think we can squeeze you in.

77
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,460
Oh, goody. Okay. Well...

78
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,496
...I'll see you chumps later.

79
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,663
Did you offer those guys a drink?

80
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,666
No. Should I have?

81
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,603
- What kind of a person are you?
- I don't know.

82
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,003
<i>Okay, Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

83
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,288
So he puts the couch down...

84
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,864
...and just as he's about to leave,
he says, "Do you date moving men?"

85
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,835
- You wanna know what I said?
- I can't wait.

86
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,234
"I do now."

87
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,632
- Clever.
- Is that something?

88
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,675
- Is that something?
- Yes, you're something.

89
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,344
So anyway, when they
were in my house before...

90
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,211
...I didn't offer them
anything to drink.

91
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,115
Well, they're real men, Jerry.
They get sweaty.

92
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,984
So anyone sweaty in your house
has to be offered a drink?

93
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,624
Yes.

94
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,624
Would you apologize for me?

95
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,561
Hello. Jerry, so good
to see you again.

96
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,894
Hello...

97
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,433
...Poppie.

98
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,935
- This is Elaine.
- Nice to meet you, Poppie.

99
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,801
- Let me show you to your table.
- Okay.

100
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,876
Your duck is cooking
as we speak.

101
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,742
It is so succulent, so succulent.

102
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,078
So Kramer told us all about
your business venture together.

103
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,551
Your friend and I are gonna make
a lot of money.

104
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,253
Of course,
I already have a lot of money.

105
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,792
Poppie does very well.

106
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,895
Very well.

107
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,991
Well, your mother must be
very proud of you.

108
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,234
My mother
was taken from my house...

109
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,840
...by the communists
in the middle of the night...

110
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,569
...when I was 10 years old.

111
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,680
She was sent
to a slave-labor camp...

112
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,715
...where she labored for 12 years.

113
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,853
Finally, they released her...

114
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,855
...and she was on a boat to America
to reunite with us.

115
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:05,521
But she was served some bad fish,
and she died on the high seas.

116
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,963
So, what's good tonight?

117
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,876
Boy, I'm really looking forward
to this duck.

118
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,954
I've never had food
ordered in advance before.

119
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,614
Could have stayed home
and ordered pizza from Pokeno's.

120
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,820
Pokeno's? Oh, no. You should never
order pizza from Pokeno's.

121
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,022
- Why not?
- The owner contributes money...

122
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,224
...to those fanatical
anti-abortion groups.

123
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,597
- So you won't eat the pizza?
- No way.

124
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,068
- Really?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,366
Well, what if...

126
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,600
...Poppie felt the same way?

127
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,610
Well, I guess I wouldn't
eat here then.

128
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,247
Really?

129
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,746
Yeah, that's right.

130
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,941
Well, perhaps we should inquire.

131
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,316
Poppie? Oh, Poppie?

132
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,647
- Could I have a word?
- Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck.

133
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,522
It is more succulent
than even I had hoped.

134
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,358
Poppie, I was just curious.
Where do you stand on abortion?

135
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,502
When my mother was abducted
by the communists...

136
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,694
- ...she was with a child.
- Oh, boy.

137
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,101
But the communists,
they put an end to that.

138
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,708
So on this issue,
there is no debate...

139
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,868
...and no intelligent person
can think differently.

140
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,446
Well, Poppie, I think differently.

141
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,380
And what gives you
the right to do that?

142
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,020
The Supreme Court gives me the right
to do that!

143
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,488
Let's go, Jerry. Come on.

144
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,952
I heard that. Let's go, Henry.

145
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,995
- We just got here.
- I'm with you, Poppie.

146
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,292
- Let's go.
- And I am not coming back!

147
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,299
You're not welcome!

148
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,536
Well, I'm certainly glad
I brought it up.

149
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,407
Well, you should've seen it.
It was quite a scene over there.

150
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,245
- I'm sorry I missed it.
- Oh, you really missed something.

151
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,444
And I have to say...

152
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,021
...it was pretty much all my fault.

153
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,051
So how's the book coming?

154
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,156
- I say how's the book coming?
- Oh, pretty good.

155
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,990
So, what's it about?

156
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,270
- Well, it's about Holly Golightly.
- Holly Golightly.

157
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,272
- Yeah, she's quite a character.
- Haven't read a page, have you?

158
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,036
- No.
- Big surprise.

159
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:36,705
I couldn't. If it's not about sports,
I find it very hard to concentrate.

160
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,717
You're not very bright, are you?

161
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,281
No, I'm not.

162
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,980
I would like to be, but I'm not.

163
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,891
What am I gonna do?
The book club meets in a few days.

164
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,091
Why don't you rent the movie?

165
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,192
Why don't I rent the movie?

166
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,856
You see? This is when I like you.

167
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,524
Now I'm relieved.

168
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,465
So...

169
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,202
...how was the dinner last night?

170
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,043
Oh, well...

171
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,374
Did you enjoy the duck?

172
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,074
Oh, Elaine, I was just asking
how dinner went last night.

173
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,412
- Oh, well-
- All right, what did you do to Poppie?

174
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,654
- Nothing.
- Well, he's in the hospital.

175
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,791
And the cook says
you put him there.

176
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,892
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

177
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,893
I'm gonna go and visit him later.

178
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,898
It would be nice
if you got him something.

179
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,636
We should get him something.

180
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,104
Yeah, you're right.

181
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,977
Do you know I've been using the same
bottle of shampoo for a year?

182
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,341
And I shampoo every day.

183
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,916
So, what do you think
of my conversation?

184
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,851
Not much.

185
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,489
I would've invited you up...

186
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,426
...but I don't have any furniture.

187
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:04,099
- You don't have any furniture?
- No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it.

188
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,732
Oh, I can understand that.

189
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,803
- A pretty good date, huh?
- Yeah, no heavy lifting.

190
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,623
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt bad
about what happened to you...

191
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,352
...and wanted you to have this.

192
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,524
What's this?

193
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,034
A bottle of wine
and a five-alarm chili?

194
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,638
They're trying to kill Poppie?

195
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,907
- Why?
- Don't they know I have...

196
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,804
...a gastrointestinal disorder?

197
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,203
If I would have any of this,
I would die.

198
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,576
Then Poppie's no good to anyone.

199
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,844
This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie.

200
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,746
How could you be friends
with those two?

201
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,891
Well, we're not very close.

202
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,088
- They owe me for those ducks.
- Yeah.

203
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,322
- They're flown in from Newfoundland.
- They got good ducks there, huh?

204
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,660
Very good ducks.

205
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,764
I'm in love!

206
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,971
This is it, Jerry! This is it!

207
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,839
He is such an incredible person.

208
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,981
He's real. He's honest.
He's unpretentious.

209
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,844
Oh, I'm really lucky.

210
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,178
Did you tell him I was sorry
about the drink?

211
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,946
No. I forgot.

212
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,182
The best part is,
he doesn't play games.

213
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,054
You know? There are no games.

214
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,355
No games? What is the point
of dating without games?

215
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,795
How do you know
if you're winning or losing?

216
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,194
Well, all I know is...

217
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,666
...he doesn't like games,
and he doesn't play games.

218
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,237
You know, he has too much character
and integrity.

219
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,208
And what is his stand on abortion?

220
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,044
What?

221
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,816
What is his stand...

222
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,887
...on abortion?

223
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,119
Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.

224
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,127
How do you know?

225
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,130
Because he...

226
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,893
Well...

227
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,196
He's just so good-looking.

228
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,100
Well, you should probably ask.

229
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:26,802
Because if he's gonna be coming over
with those Pokeno's pizzas...

230
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,674
...could be trouble.

231
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,613
<i>I'd like to rent
Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

232
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,152
This is out. Someone has it.

233
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,812
Out? Oh, no, I've-

234
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,458
I've been to four places.
You're the only ones with it.

235
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,026
Well, I could put it
on reserve for you if you'd like.

236
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,824
Maybe we could call them
and ask them to return it.

237
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,128
Sorry, we can't do that.

238
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,203
Well, maybe they're done with it.
I could go pick it up.

239
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,705
I don't think so.
It doesn't work that way.

240
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,182
<i>Yes?</i>

241
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,364
Excuse me, are you Joe Temple?

242
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,023
<i>Yes.</i>

243
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,868
Yes, you don't know me.

244
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,404
My name is George Costanza.

245
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,702
<i>Did you happen to rent
Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

246
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,177
- Hey.
- What's happening?

247
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,179
Well, you know,
Poppie's over at my place.

248
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,649
Tonight's the big night. I'll make
the first test pizza at the restaurant.

249
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,348
You got a regular Manhattan Project
going on over there.

250
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,890
Anyway, he's about to leave.
He wants the duck money.

251
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,120
- Oh, okay. Hi, Poppie.
- Hello.

252
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,822
Sorry about the gift.
I didn't know about your condition.

253
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,227
That's fine.

254
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,767
If you just give me my duck money,
I'll be on my way.

255
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,837
Okay, I'll get it.

256
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,901
Why don't you sit down, Poppie,
you're still recuperating.

257
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,051
Are you tired, Poppie?

258
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,678
- No.
- Poppie, you really think people...

259
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,256
...wanna make their own pizza?

260
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:23,156
Kramer, did I ever tell you
about my mother?

261
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,064
- My mother-
- Here you go.

262
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,896
Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...

263
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,435
- The...
- The what?

264
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,232
The...

265
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,232
- The- The...
- Okay, Poppie. So long, huh?

266
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,602
I'll see you tonight.

267
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,779
Kramer, what is this?

268
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,009
- What is what?
- This puddle on my sofa!

269
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,552
- What puddle?
- That puddle!

270
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,257
I don't know.

271
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,652
Is it...?

272
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,953
Could it...?

273
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,130
Could he have...?

274
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,962
It is!

275
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,764
Poppie peed on my sofa!

276
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,072
- Are you sure?
- Well, what is it, then?

277
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,643
My new sofa!
Poppie peed on my new sofa!

278
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,341
I'm sure it'll come out.

279
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,647
I don't care if it comes out.
I can't sit on that anymore.

280
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,518
- You're making too much of it.
- Yeah, you're right.

281
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:30,423
Just a natural human function.
Happens to be on my sofa...

282
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,656
...instead of in the toilet,
where it would normally be.

283
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,188
Right.

284
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,830
Well, anyway, the book club
meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.

285
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:43,373
Well, I was gonna watch it
with my daughter.

286
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,339
She likes Audrey Hepburn
very much.

287
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,706
Yeah, she was a delicate flower.

288
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,883
Why didn't you just
read the book?

289
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,684
Well, as I say, the pinkeye
made my vision quite blurry.

290
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,415
Remy.

291
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,493
This is George.

292
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,490
<i>Would you mind if he watched
Breakfast at Tiffany's with us?</i>

293
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,140
- Hi.
- Hi.

294
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,841
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you.

295
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,103
I don't remember the last time
I felt this way.

296
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,507
Me either.

297
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,841
- I think about you all the time.
- You do?

298
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,450
- Do you think about me?
- Oh, yeah, all the time.

299
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,983
All the time.

300
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,643
Although...

301
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,757
...recently I've been thinking about
this friend of mine.

302
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,520
- What friend?
- Oh, just this woman.

303
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:40,563
She got impregnated
by her troglodytic half-brother...

304
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,724
...and decided to have an abortion.

305
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,496
You know, someday...

306
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,110
...we're gonna get enough people on
the Supreme Court to change that law.

307
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,882
So anything to nosh?

308
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,385
What did you want?

309
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,187
Popcorn?

310
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,627
Popcorn? Where do you
think you are?

311
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,767
A lot of people keep popcorn
in the house.

312
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,061
Well, we don't.

313
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,164
You might wanna try it.

314
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,374
Makes the movie more enjoyable,
that's all.

315
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,206
- Here's some nuts.
- Oh, nuts! Excellent!

316
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,212
You know what I love? How there's
two nuts named after people:

317
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,580
Hazel and Filbert.

318
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,016
Can we watch
the movie now, Daddy?

319
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,424
Hey, let's turn off the lights,
get some real movie atmosphere.

320
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,030
The lights are fine.

321
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,763
See? Everybody can do this.
Yeah.

322
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,237
No, no. Use your wrist.
It's all in the wrist.

323
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,706
- Oh, yeah.
- Not too high!

324
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,970
Very good. That's very good.

325
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,876
All right,
put a little sauce on here.

326
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,655
- Now some cheese.
- Not too much.

327
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,985
And cucumbers.

328
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,627
Hey, wait a second.
What is that?

329
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,460
- It's cucumbers.
- No, no.

330
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,257
You can't put cucumbers
on a pizza.

331
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,990
Why not? I like cucumbers.

332
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,601
That's not a pizza.
It will taste terrible.

333
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,829
But that's the idea.
Make your own pie.

334
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,974
Yes, but we cannot give the people
the right...

335
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,133
...to choose any topping they want.

336
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,836
Now, on this issue,
there can be no debate.

337
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,345
What gives you the right
to tell me how I make my pie?

338
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,813
Because it's a pizza.

339
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,282
It's not a pizza
till it comes out of the oven.

340
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,354
It's a pizza the moment
you put your fists in the dough.

341
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,184
- No, it isn't!
- Yes, it is!

342
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,929
- I'm home.
- Hey, honey.

343
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,332
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, baby.

344
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,836
Hello.

345
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,300
<i>- Breakfast at Tiffany's?
- Yeah.</i>

346
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,709
I just came back from Angela's.
It's not looking very good for Duncan.

347
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,509
Oh, that's too bad.

348
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,675
The doctor thinks it's just
a matter of time.

349
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,920
Joe. Could you...?

350
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,527
Poor guy. I hate to see him
suffer like this.

351
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,925
- Yeah.
- You know, I'm sorry.

352
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,656
I hate to be one of those people...

353
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,324
...but we're right in the middle
of this thing.

354
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,901
I can't hear.

355
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,100
Who are you?

356
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,503
This is George Costanza.

357
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,508
It's just very hard to follow,
with all the talking.

358
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,013
I'll pause it, okay?

359
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,619
Any more grape juice?

360
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,513
So who is this guy?

361
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,626
- He's in some book club.
- And what's he doing here?

362
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,762
Cheating on his test.

363
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,091
So we watching the movie
or are we still talking?

364
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,563
Okay, come on, let's go.

365
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,034
What?

366
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,437
Come on, you took my seat.

367
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,134
It's not your seat.

368
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,278
- I was sitting there. Come on.
- You didn't save it.

369
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,478
I had the arm. Joe.

370
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:22,950
What's the difference?

371
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,612
I was very comfortable.
I've got my nuts here.

372
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,315
It's my couch.

373
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,628
All right, come on.
Come on, scootch over.

374
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,596
- Wait, it's my seat!
- Stop being like a 2-year-old.

375
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,995
Look! Look what you did!

376
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,867
You got grape juice
all over our couch.

377
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,702
You ruined our couch!

378
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,571
Joe.

379
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,016
- Oh, my God.
- You see?

380
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,477
So are you gonna get a new couch?

381
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,350
Well, I guess I have no choice.

382
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,751
- What, do you want your old couch?
- I was hoping you'd offer.

383
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,820
- Yeah?
- It's the movers.

384
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,761
- Okay.
- Who's that?

385
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,061
- Your boyfriend. He's taking it out.
- No, he's not my boyfriend.

386
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,726
Why?

387
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,132
Take a guess.

388
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,342
Oh, really.

389
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,976
- Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,205
Hey, Carl, I also need you
to go to Elaine's...

391
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,213
- ...and bring my old couch back.
- Today?

392
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,976
- Could you?
- Sure.

393
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,949
Well, what are you doing
with this couch?

394
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,782
George is taking it.

395
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,187
Did you tell him it was peed on?

396
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,260
He said he doesn't care.
He'll just turn the cushion over.

397
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,629
- I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
- Yeah, me too.

398
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,668
- It's just too bad.
- Yeah, it is.

399
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:49,398
Well, I better get this couch
back to Jerry's.

400
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:53,066
- Can I offer you anything to drink?
- Yeah, sure.

401
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,310
- All I've got is grape juice.
- Throw it.

402
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,479
The couch!

403
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,527
She didn't want the constraints
of any relationship.

404
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,428
That's why she got rid of the cat.

405
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,627
The most important thing in Holly's life
was her independence.

406
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,864
Well, not really.

407
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,338
After all, she did get together
with George Peppard.

408
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,713
I mean, Fred.

409
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,009
George, Fred's gay.
