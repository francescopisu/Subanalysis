1
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,955
Oh, hi.

2
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,293
A hundred episodes.

3
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:38,602
That's a lot. During the course of
which George, Elaine, Kramer and I...

4
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,902
...have had many experiences,
both positive and negative.

5
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,839
Well, mostly negative.

6
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,605
There've been some relationships
that haven't worked out...

7
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,578
...ambitions that were unfulfilled...

8
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,808
...hopes dashed...

9
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,180
...some property damage,
hurt feelings...

10
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,345
I know one guy got deported.

11
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,218
Physical injury and...

12
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,689
All right, maybe even
a death or two.

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,327
But we've persevered.

14
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,486
Because we're people.

15
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,461
Real TV people.

16
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,533
And for 30 minutes a week...

17
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,601
...that's pretty important to us.

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,397
So if you're joining us late...

19
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,336
...here's some highlights
from what's happened so far.

20
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,337
Why don't they have salsa
on the table?

21
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,768
What do you need salsa for?

22
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,915
Salsa is now the number-one
condiment in America.

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,482
Do you know why?

24
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,346
Because people like to say " salsa."

25
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,749
Do you have any salsa?

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,687
We need more salsa.
Where is the salsa? No salsa?

27
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,054
You know, it must be impossible
for a Spanish person...

28
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,254
...to order seltzer and not get salsa.

29
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,260
I wanted seltzer, not salsa.

30
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,526
Don't you know the difference
between them?

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,104
You have the seltzer after the salsa.

32
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,738
This should be the show.
This is the show.

33
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,836
- What?
- This.

34
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,843
Just talking.

35
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,948
Yeah. Right.

36
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,782
No, I'm really serious.
I think that's a good idea.

37
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,386
Just talking?
Well, what's the show about?

38
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,880
It's about nothing.

39
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,720
What's that red dot
on your sweater?

40
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,988
Hey, didn't we come in over there?

41
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,529
I thought we came in over there.

42
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,963
I'm out.

43
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,071
- What?
- Yeah, I'm out.

44
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,239
I'm out of the contest.

45
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,083
- No story?
- No, forget the story.

46
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,018
- You gotta have a story.
- Who says you gotta have a story?

47
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,999
Four. Seinfeld.

48
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,400
Four.

49
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,507
That'll be five, 10 minutes.

50
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,972
What, do you smell something?

51
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,737
Do I smell something?
What am I, hard of smelling?

52
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,278
What is it?

53
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,438
I think its BO.

54
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,176
And who's on the show?
Who are the characters?

55
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,853
I could be a character.

56
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,418
- You?
- Yeah. You base a character on me.

57
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,659
It's come to my attention
that you and the cleaning woman...

58
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,728
...have engaged in sexual intercourse
on the desk in your office.

59
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,231
- Who said that?
- She did.

60
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,467
Was that wrong?

61
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,436
Should I not have done that?

62
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,441
I got to plead ignorance
on this thing...

63
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,807
...because if anyone
had said anything to me...

64
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,917
...when I first started here that that
sort of thing was frowned upon...

65
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,180
And who else is on the show?

66
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,819
Elaine could be a character.

67
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,416
I wonder what happened
to my fiancé.

68
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,327
I know he's here somewhere.

69
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:53,955
I have lost my fiancé,
the poor baby.

70
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,629
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

71
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,697
What?

72
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,934
The dingo ate your baby.

73
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,008
- Kramer.
- Now, he's a character.

74
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,412
The bus is out of control.

75
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,420
So I grab him by the collar,
take him out of the seat...

76
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,284
...get behind the wheel.
Now I'm driving the bus.

77
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,787
- You're Batman.
- Yeah. I am Batman.

78
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,931
Then the mugger, he comes to,
and he starts choking me.

79
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,930
So I'm fighting him off
with one hand...

80
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,899
...and I kept driving the bus
with the other, you know?

81
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,937
Then I managed to open the door
and kicked him out the door...

82
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,598
...with my foot, you know,
at the next stop.

83
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,971
You kept making all the stops?

84
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,479
Well, people kept ringing the bell!

85
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,049
So everybody I know...

86
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,209
- ...is a character on the show.
- Right.

87
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,356
My wallet's gone! My wallet's gone!

88
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,582
- Jerry.
- Uncle Leo.

89
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,021
Hello.

90
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,421
How could you?

91
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,563
- How could I what?
- You were making out...

92
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,891
<i>...during Schindler's List?</i>

93
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,491
How long does it take to find a bra?

94
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,494
What's going on in there?

95
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,038
You ask me to get a pair of
underwear, I'm back in two seconds.

96
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,970
You know about the cup sizes
and all?

97
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,378
- They have different cups.
- Yeah, I know about the cups.

98
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,316
You got the A...

99
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,815
...the B...

100
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,923
...the C...

101
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,559
...the D. That's the biggest.

102
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,388
I go out for a quart of milk.

103
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,156
I come home and find
my son treating his body...

104
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,994
...like it was an amusement park.

105
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,035
I'm a United States postal worker.

106
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,264
Aren't those the guys
that always go crazy...

107
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,740
...and come back with a gun
and shoot everybody?

108
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,109
Sometimes.

109
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,040
- Why is that?
- Because the mail never stops.

110
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,015
Every day it piles up more and more
and you gotta get it out...

111
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,620
...but more keeps coming in!

112
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,053
Then the bar code reader breaks,
and it's Publishers Clearing House day!

113
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,783
All right, all right, all right.

114
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,190
So you're saying I go into NBC
and tell them...

115
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,695
...I got this idea
for a show about nothing.

116
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,389
We go into NBC.

117
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,864
We? Since when are you a writer?

118
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,765
What writer?
We're talking about a sitcom.

119
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,731
You wanna go with me to NBC?

120
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,467
Yeah, we really got something here.

121
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,872
- What do we got?
- An idea.

122
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,071
- What idea?
- An idea for the show.

123
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,911
- I still don't know what the idea is.
- It's about nothing.

124
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,083
- Right.
- Everybody's doing something.

125
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,051
We'll do nothing.

126
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,056
Come on. Let's go do something.
I don't want to just sit around here.

127
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,124
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Where?

128
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,921
I don't care. I'm not hungry.

129
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,689
We could go to one of those
cappuccino places.

130
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,528
They let you just sit there.

131
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,169
What are we gonna do there, talk?

132
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,966
We can talk.

133
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,799
I'll go if I don't have to talk.

134
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,772
Then we'll just sit there.

135
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,779
Oh, that's the astronaut pen. I heard
about that. Where did you get it?

136
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,342
- It was a gift.
- Because a lot of times I write in bed...

137
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,648
...and I have to turn and lean on
my elbow to make the pen work.

138
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,282
- Take the pen.
- Oh, no.

139
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,517
- Go ahead.
- I couldn't.

140
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,025
- Take it.
- I can't take it.

141
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,187
- Do me a personal favor.
- I'm not comfortable.

142
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,333
- I cannot take it.
- Take the pen.

143
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,663
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive. Take the pen.

144
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,173
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you. Gee, boy.

145
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,933
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Stop it.

146
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,203
Jack, we should go.

147
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,575
It was nice meeting you.

148
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,308
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks again.

149
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,541
Come on!

150
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,757
- This?
- Yeah.

151
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,723
- I agreed to wear this?
- Yeah, yeah.

152
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,395
Well, when did I do that?

153
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,796
When we went to dinner
the other night.

154
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,902
What, are you crazy?

155
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,702
What were you talking about
when I went to the bathroom?

156
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,171
I don't know.
I couldn't understand a word she said.

157
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,708
- I was just nodding.
- There you go.

158
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,673
Where I go?

159
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,509
You mean she was asking me
to wear this ridiculous shirt...

160
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:07,210
- ...on national TV, and I said yes?
- Yes, yes. You said it.

161
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,150
I didn't know what she was
talking about. I couldn't hear her.

162
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:15,454
- Well, she asked you.
- I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV.

163
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,895
I mean, look at it. It looks ridiculous.

164
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,925
Well, you gotta wear it now.

165
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,226
This pirate trend
she's come up with, Jerry...

166
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,301
This is gonna be
the new look for the '90s.

167
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,370
You're gonna be the first pirate.

168
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,871
But I don't wanna be a pirate.

169
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,202
I made a reservation.
Do you have my reservation?

170
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,244
Yes, we do.
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

171
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,378
But the reservation
keeps the car here.

172
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,711
That's why you have
the reservation.

173
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:44,013
- I know why we have reservations.
- I don't think you do.

174
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,158
If you did, I'd have a car.

175
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,263
See, you know how to take
the reservation.

176
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,867
You just don't know how to hold
the reservation.

177
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:01,200
And that's really the most important
part of the reservation, the holding.

178
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,604
Anybody can just take them.

179
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,447
I think I can sum up the show
for you with one word:

180
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,014
Nothing.

181
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,819
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

182
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,017
What does that mean?

183
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,855
What did you do today?

184
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,624
- I got up and came to work.
- There's a show. That's a show.

185
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,961
How is that a show?

186
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,661
Well, maybe something happens
to you on the way to work.

187
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,966
No. No! No! Nothing happens!

188
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,167
Well, something happens.

189
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,472
- Well, why am I watching it?
- Because it's on TV.

190
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,872
Not yet.

191
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,757
I'm telling you, she's good-looking.

192
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,167
- What about the body?
- Good body. Nice body.

193
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,466
- How nice?
- Nice. Pretty nice.

194
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,543
- Really good?
- Really, very nice and good.

195
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,174
- What about personality?
- Good personality.

196
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,523
Funny. Bright.

197
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,681
I don't want anyone
smarter than me.

198
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,794
How could she
be smarter than you?

199
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,164
He's a really, really funny guy.

200
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,862
What does he look like?

201
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,232
- Pardon?
- What does he look like?

202
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,636
Well, he's got a lot of character
in his face.

203
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,869
He's short. He's stocky.

204
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,308
He's fat.

205
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,312
Is that what you're saying,
that he's fat?

206
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,982
Powerful.

207
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:57,987
He is so powerful. He can lift
100 pounds right up over his head.

208
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,352
And, what else? What else?

209
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:03,495
Oh, right, well...

210
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,827
He's, he's kind of-
Just kind of- Losing his hair.

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,491
- He's bald?
- No.

212
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,138
No, no, no. He's not bald.

213
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,297
He's balding.

214
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,171
- So he will be bald?
- Yeah.

215
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,005
Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me.

216
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,088
"Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me."

217
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,690
- Is that what you said?
- Right.

218
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,382
Just clarifying.

219
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,552
Let me ask you this.

220
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,432
Do you want to get it out?

221
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,204
Or do you want to not be able
to get it out?

222
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,774
- I'd like to be able to get it out.
- I think you'll get it out.

223
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,083
What about the skin?

224
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,083
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.

225
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,451
She's got a fine cheek.

226
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,953
Is there a pinkish hue?

227
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,991
- A pinkish hue?
- Yes, a rosy glow.

228
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,828
There's a hue.

229
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,106
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.

230
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,205
Who cares about eyebrows?

231
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,779
Look at you.

232
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,711
Why don't you do something
with your life?

233
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,979
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!

234
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,612
The alarm didn't go off.
You're gonna miss the plane, it's 9:15.

235
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,192
- 9:15?
- Yeah. It's 9:15!

236
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,192
We'll never make it.
I'll leave tomorrow.

237
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,230
Tomorrow? Are you crazy?
No. Now, now, let's go.

238
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,299
Let's go. You get dressed,
you get dressed.

239
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,699
I mean, how can I be
with someone like you?

240
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,002
Wouldn't respect myself.

241
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,403
Put your pants on.

242
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,874
- I'll go tomorrow or the next day.
- You have your ticket.

243
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,706
- You have to go now.
- We'll never make it.

244
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,476
- Don't say that.
- Well, it takes 45 minutes to get-

245
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,121
It takes 45 minutes to get there.
That only leaves me five minutes...

246
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,483
- ...to get to the plane.
- Shut up and pack!

247
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,716
I take it all back!
Every word!

248
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,884
I love you!

249
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,120
I love you!

250
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,357
It's not you. It's me.

251
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,001
You're giving me
the "it's not you, it's me" routine?

252
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:31,135
I invented "it's not you, it's me."
Nobody tells me it's them, not me.

253
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,006
- If it's anybody, it's me.
- All right.

254
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,479
- George, it's you.
- You are damn right it's me.

255
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,781
Elaine, you don't know the first thing
about first base.

256
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,484
Well, I know something
about getting to first base...

257
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,093
...and I know you'll never be there.

258
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,821
The way I figure it,
I've already been there.

259
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,023
And I plan on rounding second
tonight at around 11:00.

260
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,436
Well, I'd watch the third-base coach
if I were you...

261
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,598
...because I don't think
he's waving you in.

262
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,670
I guess things changed for me
on Tuesday night.

263
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,509
Tuesday night?
What happened Tuesday night?

264
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,509
I saw your act.

265
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,853
My act? What does that
have to do with anything?

266
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,887
Well, to be honest...

267
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,151
...it just didn't make it for me.

268
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,887
It's just so much fluff.

269
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,126
What are you saying?
You didn't like my act?

270
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,527
So that's it?

271
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,102
I can't be with someone
if I don't respect what they do.

272
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,102
You're a cashier.

273
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,138
You don't know my name, do you?

274
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,341
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

275
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,747
It rhymes with a female body part.

276
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,850
What is it?

277
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,311
Mulva?

278
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,090
- I think you're really sick.
- I'm not sick.

279
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,285
You said much sicker things
than me.

280
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,157
I'm leaving.

281
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,558
So where were we?

282
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,860
- I was just leaving.
- Right. You were leaving.

283
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,868
I can't believe you sent a woman
into the sauna to do that?

284
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,006
That was an accident.

285
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,733
I think you're both mentally ill.

286
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,185
And by the way, they're real
and they're spectacular.

287
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,286
Why shouldn't we
be able to do that...

288
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,517
- ...once in a while if we want to?
- I know.

289
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,128
I mean, really, what is the big deal?

290
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,594
We go in there...

291
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,462
...we're in there for a while,
then we come back out here.

292
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,931
That's not complicated.

293
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,333
It's almost stupid if we didn't.

294
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,566
- It's moronic.
- Absurd.

295
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,439
Course...

296
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,448
...I guess maybe some little
problems could arise.

297
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,210
There are always a few.

298
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,217
I mean, if anything happened...

299
00:15:56,388 --> 00:16:00,848
...and we couldn't be friends the way
we are now, that would really be bad.

300
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:05,258
- Devastating.
- Because this is very good.

301
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,333
And that would be good.

302
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,696
That would be good too.

303
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,339
The idea is to combine the this...

304
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,532
...and the that.

305
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,311
But this cannot be disturbed.

306
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,243
Yeah, we just want to take this...

307
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,612
...and add that.

308
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,149
But of course, we'd have
to figure out a way...

309
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,225
...to avoid the things that
cause the little problems.

310
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:38,591
Maybe some rules or something.

311
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,595
For example:

312
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,764
Now I call you whenever
I'm inclined, and vice versa.

313
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,373
But if we did that, we might feel...

314
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,064
...a certain obligation to call.

315
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,935
Well, why should that be?

316
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,772
I have an idea.

317
00:16:55,948 --> 00:17:00,078
No calls the day after that.

318
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,549
Beautiful.

319
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,948
Let's make it a rule.

320
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,817
All right, sir.

321
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,493
- Now, here's another little rule.
- Yeah.

322
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,330
When we see each other now...

323
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,591
...we retire to our separate quarters.

324
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,100
But sometimes when people
get involved with that...

325
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,500
...they feel pressure...

326
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,436
...to sleep over.

327
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,372
When that...

328
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,239
...is not really sleep.

329
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,843
Sleep is separate from that,
and I don't see...

330
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,787
...why sleep got all tied up
and connected...

331
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,448
...with that.

332
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,565
Okay, okay, rule number two:
Spending the night is optional.

333
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,102
Well, now we're getting somewhere.

334
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,738
I slept with Elaine last night.

335
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:01,970
- Oxygen. I need some oxygen.
- I thought you'd like that.

336
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,478
Oh, this is huge!

337
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,244
- I know.
- All right, okay. Let's go. Details.

338
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,944
- No, I can't give details.
- No details?

339
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,986
I'm not in the mood.

340
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,986
You ask me here to have lunch...

341
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,153
...tell me you slept with Elaine...

342
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,494
...and then say you're not
in the mood for details.

343
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,193
Now, you listen to me.

344
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,237
I want details,
and I want them right now.

345
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,840
I don't have a job,
I have no place to go.

346
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,445
You're not in the mood?
Well, you get in the mood!

347
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,311
I was at the unemployment office.

348
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,716
I told them I was very close to getting
a job with Vandelay Industries...

349
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,857
...and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings...

350
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,515
...you have to answer,
"Vandelay Industries."

351
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,924
- I'm Vandelay Industries?
- Right.

352
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,326
- What is that?
- You're in latex.

353
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,126
- Latex.
- Right.

354
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,131
- What do I do with latex?
- I don't know! You manufacture it!

355
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,399
- Right here in this little apartment?
- And what do I say about you?

356
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,974
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

357
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,038
- I'll hire you as my latex salesman?
- Right.

358
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,875
I don't think so.

359
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,216
Man, I'm telling you this pizza idea
is really gonna happen.

360
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,523
This is the thing where you go and
you have to make your own pizza?

361
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,748
We give you the dough.

362
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,326
You smash it. You pound it.
You fling it up in the air.

363
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,293
And then you get to put your sauce
and sprinkle your cheese.

364
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,730
And then,
you slide it into the oven.

365
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,126
You have to know how to do that.

366
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:36,104
You can't have people shoving
their arms into a 600-degree oven!

367
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,039
- It's all supervised.
- Oh, well...

368
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,873
Tolstoy used to write
in the village square.

369
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,708
The faces inspired him.

370
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,283
<i>Although, one wonders
if War and Peace would have been...</i>

371
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:51,252
...as highly acclaimed, had it been
published under it's original title...

372
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,914
<i>...War-What Is It Good For?</i>

373
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,958
- What?
- Yeah.

374
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,619
Mr. Lippman, it was his mistress
who insisted...

375
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,459
<i>- ... that he call it War and Peace.
- Elaine, Elaine.</i>

376
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,998
<i>War-What Is It Good For?</i>

377
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,432
<i>Absolutely nothing</i>

378
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,469
If I see her, what do I say
I'm doing here?

379
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,470
To see me. I work in the building.

380
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,404
What do you do?

381
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,110
I'm an architect.

382
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,778
You're an architect?

383
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,609
I'm not?

384
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,017
I don't see architecture
coming from you.

385
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,988
We'll make our choice in a few days
and we'll let you know.

386
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,256
- I have no chance, do I?
- No.

387
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,227
You know I always wanted
to pretend I was an architect.

388
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,127
- What do you do?
- I'm an architect.

389
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,428
Have you designed
any buildings in New York?

390
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,464
Have you seen the new addition
to the Guggenheim?

391
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,170
- You did that?
- Yep, yep.

392
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,438
Really didn't take very long either.

393
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,773
The beauty of my book is,
if you don't have a coffee table...

394
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,851
...it turns into a coffee table.

395
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,589
- Is that fabulous?
- Look at this.

396
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,758
What-delay Industries?

397
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,326
- No.
- Vandelay!

398
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,757
Say Vandelay!

399
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,157
No, you're way, way, way off!

400
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,199
- No, say-
- Vandelay! Say-

401
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,836
Vandelay Industries!

402
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,068
No problem, no problem.

403
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,778
And you want to be
my latex salesman.

404
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,459
I think Superman probably has
a very good sense of humor.

405
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,325
I never heard him say anything funny.

406
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,657
He's got super strength, super speed.

407
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,628
I'm sure he's got super humor.

408
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,698
Either you're born with humor,
or you're not. It's not gonna change.

409
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,862
Even if you go
from the red sun of Krypton...

410
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,201
...all the way to the yellow sun
of the Earth.

411
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,112
Why? Why would that one area
of his mind...

412
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,715
...not be affected
by the yellow sun of the Earth?

413
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,975
I don't know. But he ain't funny.
