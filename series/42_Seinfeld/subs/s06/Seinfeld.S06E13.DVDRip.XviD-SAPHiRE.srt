1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:04,164
The big new accessory
with eyeglasses...

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,531
...seems to be that strap that connects
so you can take them on and off...

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,871
...which I don't get because if you
have glasses, isn't that because...

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,570
...you need to wear glasses?

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,739
"You need glasses."
Isn't that what they say?

6
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,349
An eye doctor doesn't say:

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,009
"Would you care for some glasses?"

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,782
People with crutches don't
have a chain attached to their belt...

9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,588
...so they can just let go
of them every now and then.

10
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,357
Why not get a toupee with a
rubber band for water-skiing?

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,432
The thing could just...

12
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:43,772
Hey, George.

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,571
Gary?

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,445
Where the hell have you been?

15
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,378
I've been leaving
messages for months.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,711
- I know, I've been busy.
- Don't give me busy.

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:57,152
Who's not busy? I'm busy.
We're all busy. Everybody's busy.

18
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,951
All right. Tell me.
What's kept you so busy?

19
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,855
Mostly chemotherapy.

20
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,791
Hey, I'll see you.

21
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,326
Hey, pig!

22
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,499
Hey, hey, hey!

23
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,006
So you called the cop a pig?

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,171
I was yelling at the litterbug.

25
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,713
I mean, this is my town.

26
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,011
You don't throw trash
on the streets of my town.

27
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,087
So, didn't you explain that
to the cop?

28
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,587
No, I fled the scene.

29
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,393
- Hey.
- Hey.

30
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,529
Kramer, I need to talk
to Jerry privately.

31
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,129
What about?

32
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,664
- Kramer.
- Oh, come on, George...

33
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,240
...you can share it with me.

34
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,934
- You're hurting me.
- You gonna share with me next time?

35
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,549
- Sure. I swear.
- All right. I'm looking forward to it.

36
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,723
All right, I got news. You ready?

37
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,496
- Gary Fogel had cancer.
- Oh, yeah, I knew.

38
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,659
- You knew? How did you know?
- He told me a few months ago.

39
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,236
Why did he tell you and not me?

40
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,966
- I don't know.
- How are you closer to him than me?

41
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,175
- So is he okay?
- Oh, yeah, he's fine.

42
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,280
He was in bad shape
for a while, though.

43
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,313
Really? How bad?
Was he on his deathbed?

44
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,747
No, he was on his regular bed.

45
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,584
So why didn't you tell me?

46
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,245
- He swore me to secrecy.
- So?

47
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,754
It's not like you're my wife.

48
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,756
I still think you should've told me.

49
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,360
You were better off not knowing.

50
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,191
It's not easy to deal with
someone in a situation like this.

51
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,163
I was so nice to him I
almost made myself sick.

52
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,926
I'm gonna talk to him about this.

53
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,764
That's right. You let him have it.

54
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,406
Who is he not to tell you
about his life-threatening illness?

55
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,838
- That's what I'm saying.
- His illness is your business.

56
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,002
- If not mine, whose?
- If not now, when?

57
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,079
Were you just talking about me?

58
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,183
No, an old friend of ours, Gary.

59
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,114
Oh, the guy with cancer?

60
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,947
You told her? She's not your wife.

61
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,182
If I told you, you would've
given it away.

62
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,794
- You don't think I can keep a secret?
- No, but he would have read your face.

63
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:20,093
- You don't trust my poker face?
- Do you ever win at poker?

64
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,959
No.

65
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,297
Hey. Oh, I just saw your
old boyfriend on TV.

66
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,100
- Jake Jarmel?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,903
I like those glasses he was wearing.
Where'd he get those?

68
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,943
- Why? You don't wear glasses.
- I know.

69
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,876
But I need a new look.
I'm stagnating.

70
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,079
I have to say, as a glasses-wearer,
I take exception to that.

71
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,620
That's like me buying a wheelchair
to cruise around in.

72
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,224
Yeah, I've considered that.

73
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,327
Look, how do I get in touch
with this guy?

74
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,393
He's having a two-day book signing
at Walden's.

75
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,294
You know, we had
a really bad breakup.

76
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,332
The Jujyfruits?

77
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,102
Yeah, the Jujyfruits.

78
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,207
Okay, K-Man.

79
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,936
- Enjoy the book.
- Thank you. Listen, Jake...

80
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,012
...where did you get
those eyeglass frames?

81
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,342
- I can't tell you.
- You don't know where?

82
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,349
Yes, I do, but I don't want
anyone else to have them.

83
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,420
Well, that's peculiar.

84
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,527
Oh, there's that woman that
never talks to anybody.

85
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:23,985
Really?

86
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,188
Every day she comes in and reads.

87
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,663
Never talks to anybody.

88
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,598
Oh, I spoke to Debby Biblow.
She said to say hi.

89
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,263
Really?

90
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,506
Gary, I really have to say
I'm a little bit hurt...

91
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,802
...that you didn't decide
to confide in me.

92
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,946
Well, frankly, you can't
keep a secret.

93
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,709
You know, you'd get two pair,
the whole table knows.

94
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,374
Well, I still think it was wrong.

95
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,214
I'm sorry. All right?
I guess I was just thinking of myself.

96
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,084
Yes.

97
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,350
So I called the litterbug a pig.
Not you.

98
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,190
I like policemen.
I wanted to be a policeman.

99
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,298
Yeah, so why didn't you?

100
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,559
I'm scared of being shot.

101
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,664
Mr. Kramer, let me tell you a story.

102
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:10,832
In 1979, I ticketed a brown Dodge
Diplomat for parking in a church zone.

103
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,841
That fine was never paid.

104
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,038
And since then, that scofflaw has
piled up more parking tickets...

105
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,046
...than anyone in New York City.

106
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,913
For 16 years I pursued him...

107
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,181
...only to see him give me
the slip time and time again.

108
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,655
I've never got
a clean look at his face...

109
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,886
...but he's become my white whale.

110
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,396
Mr. Kramer, that day was yesterday.

111
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:37,764
But thanks to you, I don't know if
I'll every get that chance again.

112
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,836
I like that eye patch.

113
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,636
All right. I'm gonna move my car.
My meter's up.

114
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,376
- You can't park in this city.
- Hey.

115
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,414
George, you know that
company I work for?

116
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,449
They own the parking lot
around the corner.

117
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,783
- Oh, that's a Kinney lot?
- Yeah. There's a space opening and...

118
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,152
...I could get it for you.
You'd just pay tax.

119
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,021
It'd be, like, 50 a month.

120
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,522
Fifty bucks a month?
That's incredible.

121
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,028
Okay. Thanks.

122
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,928
I got lunch, all right?

123
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,391
Still owe me a secret.

124
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,004
All right, there is something
I haven't told you.

125
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,371
- Yeah?
- But you can't tell Jerry.

126
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,941
What do you think, I tell Jerry
everything? It's not like he's my wife.

127
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,373
Okay. Well...

128
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,210
...the thing is I've been living a lie.

129
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,315
Just one? I'm living, like, 20.

130
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,487
What's yours?

131
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,389
Well, I...

132
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,564
I never actually had cancer.

133
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,427
I'll see you.

134
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,202
So he refused to tell you
where he got the glasses?

135
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,896
Flat out refused.

136
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,338
Yeah, isn't that just like him?

137
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,944
You know, he has to be
the only one who has them.

138
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,603
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister.

139
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,183
- Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
- What?

140
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,318
- You told Jake I said hi?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,252
I can't believe you did that.
Why did you tell him I said hi?

142
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,757
I never said hi. When did I say hi?

143
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,054
- I never heard her say hi.
- It's common courtesy.

144
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,563
No, no, Kramer. You don't understand.
He made the last contact between us.

145
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:18,636
I had the upper hand in the
post-breakup relationship.

146
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,596
If he thinks that I said hi,
then I lose the upper hand.

147
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,538
It's like a game of tag.

148
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,942
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

149
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,013
You're going to the bookstore
to see Jake.

150
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,479
- So what if I do?
- Listen...

151
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,177
...if you're going, you can get him to
tell you where he got those glasses.

152
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,116
Elaine!

153
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,089
Hey.

154
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,693
- How'd it go with Gary?
- Fine. Fine.

155
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,193
- Really?
- Yeah.

156
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:53,670
- Looks like something's on your mind.
- No, nothing. I'm fine.

157
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,534
So that's your poker face.

158
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,848
- A regular face.
- No, it isn't.

159
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,279
I've seen your regular face.
That is not it.

160
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,120
What are you saying?

161
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,756
All right, George, come on.
What do you got?

162
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,390
- I got nothing.
- What do got? A pair of bullets?

163
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,728
What are you talking about?

164
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,330
Two pair? Three of a kind?

165
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,196
- Will you stop it?
- Oh, my God. You got a flush.

166
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,003
- You're holding a flush.
- I don't have a flush.

167
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,902
A full house?
You got a full house?

168
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:33,177
Turn them over, George. I wanna
see them. Come on. I'm calling.

169
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,043
- What do you got?
- Gary Fogel never had cancer!

170
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,580
So you see, Kramer took it upon
himself to say hi to you for me...

171
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,522
...when in fact, it was
an unauthorized hi.

172
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,855
- You didn't say hi?
- That's what I'm saying.

173
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,021
- That's what you came to tell me?
- Correct.

174
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,860
- You never said hi.
- Correct.

175
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,025
- You still like me, don't you?
- Correct. What?

176
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,763
Hey, I have been trying to get
this book signed all day.

177
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:04,103
How can you say that I still like you
when I didn't even say hi to you?

178
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,268
Coming down to say
that you didn't say hi...

179
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,709
...is more of a gesture
than if you did say hi.

180
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,039
Jake...

181
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,113
The doctors thought
he had cancer...

182
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,779
...but the surgery revealed
he never actually had it.

183
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,016
- So, what was wrong with him?
- Nothing.

184
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,784
He's been lying to me
for two months?

185
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,930
- That's right.
- What kind of person is this?

186
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:28,533
There's one other person who might
do something like this, and that's you.

187
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,231
- Well...
- I don't even think you could do it.

188
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,338
No, I could do it.

189
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,339
- Yeah, I guess you could.
- Come on.

190
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,337
He was so worried about losing
more hair with chemo treatments...

191
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,313
...I bought him an unlimited gift
certificate at the Hair Team For Men...

192
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,075
...just to put his mind at ease?

193
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:47,749
- You did that?
- Yeah!

194
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,651
- Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy.
- Wait! You can't say anything.

195
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,088
- Why not?
- Because he'll know I told you.

196
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,661
Besides, he's giving me a parking spot
around the corner for nothing.

197
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,889
So because you're
getting free parking...

198
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,897
...I gotta pretend
this guy had cancer?

199
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,797
Yeah.

200
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,260
Well, I don't like it.

201
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,374
I don't like it one bit. And
I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.

202
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,237
Maintain the same disposition.

203
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,708
You can't act any differently.
You have to be nice.

204
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,609
- Why didn't he tell me?
- Because you were being so nice.

205
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,444
- I don't think I could be that nice.
- You be nice!

206
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,734
Gary?

207
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,336
What do you think?

208
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,200
Check it out.

209
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,213
- Is that from my gift certificate?
- Yeah, buddy.

210
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,315
You came through.
You've been so nice.

211
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,213
Yeah, well, I'm glad you could
take advantage.

212
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,753
Yeah. Hey, know what
I'm thinking of doing?

213
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:00,358
I'm getting rid of all my fillings
because that mercury's toxic.

214
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,994
- Hey, let me see your fillings.
- I don't think so.

215
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,859
Oh, come on. Open up.
Let me take a look.

216
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,366
<i>You be nice.
He's giving me a parking space.</i>

217
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,027
<i>Parking space. Parking space.</i>

218
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,867
Well, what do you know.

219
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:23,573
- Hey, lookie there. You're loaded.
- Okay.

220
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,344
Hey, look who's over there.

221
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,409
Miss Cool Toes.

222
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,187
Check this out, Jack.

223
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,225
Hey, buddy.

224
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,882
Hey.

225
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,689
Look at you. What's this?

226
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,094
- It's an eye patch.
- You look like a pirate.

227
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,558
I wanna be a pirate.

228
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,837
- This is Gary.
- How are you doing?

229
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,238
Well, I tell you, there's
only one problem.

230
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,449
Can't see on your right side?

231
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,253
No. It's itchy.

232
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,052
- Nice car.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,758
Once belonged to Jon Voight.

234
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,367
- Really?
- Sure did.

235
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,566
So, what made you just call
me out of the blue like that?

236
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:28,612
Oh, well, Gary told me you said hi.

237
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,942
- I didn't say hi.
- You didn't?

238
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,488
No, I told him to send you my regards.
I didn't say hi.

239
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,417
- Regards?
- Yeah, regards.

240
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,332
Anyway, I admit I was dumb
to go to the bookstore...

241
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,901
...to tell him I didn't say hi,
but he didn't have to act so smug.

242
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,470
Oh, I hate smugness.
Don't you hate smugness?

243
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,608
Smugness is not a good quality.

244
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,174
Oh, my God, that man over there.

245
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:04,146
I think he's wearing glasses that look
like Jake's. Pull over. Stop the car.

246
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,619
Here. I think I've got a way
of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.

247
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,813
Good. Revenge is very good.

248
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,252
Excuse me.

249
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,826
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir, sir?
- Yeah.

250
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,296
If you don't mind my asking, could you
tell me where you got your glasses?

251
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,934
- Malaysia.
- Malaysia?

252
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,694
Yeah.

253
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,306
Look, I know this'll sound odd,
but can I buy them from you?

254
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:33,509
Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.
But I can barely see without these.

255
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,311
- Come on.
- Well, these were expensive.

256
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,508
Let's start the bidding.

257
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,713
So you didn't think this was a date?

258
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,551
No, not really. Why? Is it a date?

259
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,124
I thought it was a date.

260
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,489
No, it's not a date.

261
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,131
- What about the regards?
- Regards don't mean anything.

262
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,790
I mean, it's not like I said hi.

263
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,992
I mean, the fact is...

264
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,773
- ...I shouldn't say anything.
- No, tell me.

265
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,501
- Can you keep a secret?
- Me? Oh, yeah.

266
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,171
I never had feelings for Gary
until he got sick.

267
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:16,185
But he was so brave and gained
such a wonderful perspective on life.

268
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,284
I fell in love with him.

269
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,755
Yeah, he's got some
perspective there.

270
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,890
- Hey, you know what the whip does?
- What whip?

271
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,623
The whip in the Senate
and the House.

272
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,324
Well, in the old days when
the senators didn't vote...

273
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:33,130
...the way that the party leaders
wanted them to, they whipped them.

274
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:40,307
"You better vote the way we want you
to, or there's gonna be big trouble."

275
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,415
She won't talk to anyone, huh?

276
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,280
Oh, no, she won't say a word
to anybody.

277
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:53,357
Well, she's talking
a blue streak now, Jack.

278
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,661
Well, well, the white whale.

279
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,627
Oh, look at this. There's no
place to park around here.

280
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,669
I don't know why
they even sell cars here.

281
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,070
Don't complain.
At least you have your health.

282
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,006
George, watch out for that man!

283
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,390
Hey, hey, get back here.

284
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,258
Newman? The white whale.

285
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,824
Can you believe he sold
his glasses on the street?

286
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:37,526
Can you believe someone would lie
about chemotherapy to get a wig?

287
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,197
- Would you do that?
- No, definitely not.

288
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,341
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.

289
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,239
Know what else? He picked
up that woman in the coffee shop.

290
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,137
- The one who sits by herself?
- Yeah.

291
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,975
- How?
- Because he was brimming...

292
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,380
- ...with confidence from the toupee.
- Really?

293
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:57,682
Debby told me she fell in love with
him because he has perspective.

294
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,017
She thinks a guy who lies
about an illness...

295
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,490
...so he can get some phony hair
has perspective?

296
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,400
- He picked her up?
- Walked right over to her table.

297
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,659
Wow.

298
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,202
Jake. Jake, take a look.

299
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,848
See? You're not the only one who
has them. I have them too.

300
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,851
- Where did you get those?
- Malaysia. I was in the area.

301
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,686
- Kramer.
- Just drive.

302
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,989
All right. Now you listen,
and you listen good.

303
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,064
I know who you are.

304
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,463
You're the scofflaw.

305
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:48,303
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.

306
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,532
All right, so it's me. So what?

307
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,509
You don't think I know how you're
feeling every second of the day?

308
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,581
Looking over your shoulder to see
if someone's coming up...

309
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,378
...sitting alone at night knowing
they could be closing in.

310
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:04,852
- I can't sleep, I tell you. I can't sleep.
- Of course you can't, you poor sap.

311
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,788
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.

312
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,053
So you've been living this secret
by yourself?

313
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,595
- It's been awful.
- Yeah.

314
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,497
I wanted to tell somebody.

315
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,296
- Help me, Kramer. Help me.
- All right, I'm gonna help you.

316
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,702
I'll try some on, we'll see
how they look. It's just hair.

317
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,809
Ever see what that
looks like in the back?

318
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,740
You got natural curls
on the bottom...

319
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,642
...and that big phony mat
coming down on top of it.

320
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,579
Some look good. The ones that
look good, you don't know about.

321
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,345
What if you got involved with a
woman? How do you tell her?

322
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,853
The way they make them,
I'll never have to tell her.

323
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,116
So you keep it a secret
your whole life?

324
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,125
Then at your funeral, the mortician
comes out, "Mrs. Costanza...

325
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,559
...I thought you might want this."

326
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:52,095
It's no secret that it's my dream
to have my own publishing house.

327
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,502
If this Jake Jarmel book does, you
know, what I think it's gonna do...

328
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,302
...if I can get this whole thing off
the ground, then...

329
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,777
- ...I think I'll have something for you.
- Oh, Mr. Lippman.

330
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,450
That is so exciting. I mean,
you have no idea...

331
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:10,145
...how sick I am of running
around town looking for socks.

332
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,580
By the way, those are great glasses.

333
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,420
- Oh, really, you like them?
- Very unusual.

334
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,255
- Well, you know what?
- What?

335
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,862
- You can have them.
- No, no.

336
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,828
No, no. Go to that
place on the corner.

337
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,399
They'll change the prescription
in an hour. Take them.

338
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,036
- Really?
- I have no use for them.

339
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,466
- Honestly.
- I could use...

340
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,471
- ...a new pair of reading glasses.
- They're from Malaysia.

341
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,508
- Oh, yeah?
- Fabulous.

342
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,570
Well, Mr. Newman, in all
my years on the bench...

343
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:40,809
...I have never come across
anything quite like this.

344
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,817
I have given this matter some serious
consideration, and I've decided that...

345
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:51,929
...what's best for the city and possibly
yourself, is for you to keep your car...

346
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,193
...in a garage that is conveniently
located next to your home.

347
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,960
I can't afford that.

348
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,137
Afford it you will, Mr. Newman...

349
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:05,675
...or this court will see that your car
is impounded and sold at auction.

350
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,904
Well, don't you worry, Your Honor.
He's in my custody.

351
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,480
Well, what do you think?

352
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,250
I really can't say.

353
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,253
- No, say. I want you to say.
- It's not good, okay?

354
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,227
It's not good.

355
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,696
You look...

356
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,266
...stupid.

357
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,766
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,434
You have to realize this has not
been custom-fitted to his scalp.

359
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,768
I really think this looks pretty good.

360
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,002
Why not get white shoes,
move to Miami Beach...

361
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,170
...and get the whole thing over with?

362
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,052
Maybe you could
show me something else.

363
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,156
As I said, it'll be different once we
design something specifically for you.

364
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,849
But I don't think your friend
here is being very helpful.

365
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,326
Oh, hey. I'm being helpful.
I am the only one being helpful.

366
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,159
I don't think you're being helpful!
You're being disruptive.

367
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,893
You make it difficult for your friend
to improve his life.

368
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,594
I'm preventing him from
becoming one of those guys...

369
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,673
...people snicker at
because they look ridiculous.

370
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,036
No offense to you personally.

371
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,270
You people with hair think
you're so superior.

372
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,936
You have no idea what it's like.

373
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,514
You ever look in the tub
and see a fistful of hair?

374
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,912
Start your day with that!

375
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,576
All right. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

376
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,312
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,250
Please.

378
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,663
Hey, Jerry.

379
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,262
George, you decided to get a rug.

380
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,958
Good for you, Jack.

381
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,366
Well, I'm just looking, really.

382
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,908
Tommy, I'm gonna
need a little adjustment.

383
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,712
I'll be right with you.

384
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,383
Listen, George,
I got some bad news.

385
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,919
I'm not gonna be able
to give you that parking space.

386
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,182
- What?
- What?

387
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,690
This judge has to use it
for some scofflaw.

388
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,522
And you know,
you can't fight city hall.

389
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,431
You know, Gary...

390
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,834
...I had a little chat with
George the other day.

391
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,673
- You didn't!
- I did.

392
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,744
And he told me that-

393
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,540
- I'm not 100 percent recovered yet.
- Give me that thing.

394
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,159
How's your life? All right?

395
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,895
Yeah, not bad at all.

396
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,511
And now, ladies and
gentlemen of the press...

397
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,923
...it is my pleasure to introduce
you to Mr. Jake Jarmel.

398
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,460
So, Jake, what's your
percentage on this book?

399
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,760
Actually, I have some very
interesting information on that.

400
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,768
- You know, this is a co-venture-
- Where did you get those?

401
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,599
- And as such it-
- Those glasses.

402
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,105
- Where did you get those glasses?
- Where?

403
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,109
Is this supposed to be
some kind of a joke on me?

404
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,339
Because it's not very funny.
Give me those.

405
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,881
- I want the glasses. Give me those.
- Wait. Calm down.

406
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,985
- Give me those.
- Don't touch me!

407
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,781
I'm gonna go look for some socks.
