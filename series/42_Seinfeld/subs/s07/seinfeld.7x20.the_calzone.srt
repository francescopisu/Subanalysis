1
00:00:04,487 --> 00:00:07,559
Have you noticed that every place
has that tip jar on the counter?

2
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:10,195
What is the service that
this tip is for, anyway?

3
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:13,723
I mean, isn't the man basically
just turning around?

4
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,798
Isn't that really all it is?

5
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:20,438
I think we're tipping people now just
for the absence of outright hostility.

6
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:23,003
"Thanks very much,
and here's something extra...

7
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,361
...for not taking my head...

8
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:26,882
...and smashing my face
through the glass countertop.

9
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:29,561
Really good service here."

10
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:37,641
Well, currently the doors on the
bathroom stalls here at the stadium...

11
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:40,037
...don't offer much by way of privacy.

12
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,324
I was thinking, if we extend the doors
all the way down to the floor...

13
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:45,682
Are you out of your mind?
You'd suffocate in there.

14
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:48,156
You're lucky to have doors.
When I was in the Army...

15
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:50,841
Costanza, what is that you're eating?
Looks pretty tasty.

16
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,804
- It's a calzone, sir.
- Calzone, huh?

17
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,003
Let's see it. Pass that down.
Let's get a look.

18
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,885
Big Stein wants a little taste.
Come on.

19
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:58,446
Pass it down. That's a good boy.

20
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:00,916
Okay, let's...
Hey, what's in this thing?

21
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:03,324
Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.

22
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,125
Eggplant, huh?
That's a hell of a thing.

23
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:07,084
All right. Back to business.
Here you go.

24
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:08,600
Very good. Very good. Excellent.

25
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,997
Excellent little calzone you got there,
Costanza.

26
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,237
Okay. A little jealous.
All right. Here we go.

27
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,556
Like I told you last week...

28
00:01:14,727 --> 00:01:17,241
...the renovation of the press box
is taking too long.

29
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:18,920
That eggplant was very good.

30
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,123
Everybody out.
I've got eggplant on my mind.

31
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:23,482
Costanza, go get me a couple
of calzones right now.

32
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:24,875
Pronto. Move it out.

33
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,686
Big Stein wants an eggplant calzone.
He must have one.

34
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:29,565
Everybody out. Hurry up, hurry up.

35
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:31,961
Who are you having dinner with?

36
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:36,036
Oh, one of these fabric wholesalers,
this guy Todd Gack.

37
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,523
- I won a bet from him.
- Yeah, what bet?

38
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:43,966
He bet me that Dustin Hoffman
was in Star Wars.

39
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:47,402
- Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
- Yeah.

40
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:51,082
Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader?
I don't think so.

41
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:52,926
Yeah, that's what I said.

42
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:55,362
So the bet was the loser
has to buy dinner?

43
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,085
Yeah.

44
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,756
- What?
- No, nothing.

45
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,166
- What's with you?
- Feel this.

46
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,960
- Wow, that's hot.
- Yes, piping hot.

47
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,526
It's fresh out of the dryer.

48
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,918
Hey, Elaine, you gotta
feel my pants.

49
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,161
I'll see you later.

50
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,117
All right. You don't know
what you're missing.

51
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:19,481
I'm loving this.

52
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,718
I'll never put on another
piece of clothing...

53
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:23,559
...unless it's straight from the dryer.

54
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,321
Every time you get dressed,
you'll use the basement dryer?

55
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:29,160
Oh, yeah. It's a warm
and wonderful feeling, Jerry.

56
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:31,761
- So, what are you doing later?
- I got a date with Nicki.

57
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:35,397
- Oh, yeah, she's a beauty.
- Oh, yeah. She's also quite bold.

58
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,037
Bold and beautiful.

59
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:39,756
This calzone is fantastic.

60
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,316
And look, the pita pocket
prevents it from dripping.

61
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:43,476
The pita pocket.

62
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:46,846
Yeah, what is it, Watson?

63
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:49,396
A lost and found, huh?
No, I don't think we need that.

64
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,717
If people can't hold onto things,
tough luck.

65
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,878
You got a little junk on your lip,
by the way.

66
00:02:54,047 --> 00:02:56,117
You know, a lost and found
could be a good idea.

67
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,481
Hold it, Watson.

68
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,763
- You like the lost and found, George?
- Definitely.

69
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:01,635
All right. A lost and found.

70
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,277
But there's gotta be a time limit.
We're not running a pawnshop here.

71
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:11,005
- Hey, Elaine.
- Jerry, hi.

72
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,316
- This is Nicki.
- Hi.

73
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:14,205
Hello. This is Todd Gack.

74
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:16,244
Oh, of course, Todd Gack.

75
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:18,523
Who did you bet was in Star Wars?
Sammy Davis Jr?

76
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:23,079
So, what movie are you guys
gonna see?

77
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:24,885
Means to an End.

78
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:27,402
We were gonna see that too,
but it's sold out.

79
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,876
So we're going to see
Blame It On The Rain.

80
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:33,002
- Why don't you see what you can do.
- Okay.

81
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,441
What 's she gonna do?
They don't have any more tickets.

82
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:37,916
We'll see.

83
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,640
Hey, Jerry, you like cigars?

84
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:42,037
- Yeah, why?
- I'm going to Montreal tomorrow.

85
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:43,879
They sell Cubans there dirt cheap.

86
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:45,878
That's a nice idea
for George's wedding.

87
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:48,436
- Should I get you a box?
- Lf they're cheap, why not?

88
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,916
All right, I'll buy them
and get them to Elaine.

89
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,281
Okay. Two tickets.

90
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,165
- Means to an End.
- Told you.

91
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:57,799
- How did you do that?
- I just talked to the manager.

92
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:02,757
- All right, enjoy Blame It On The Rain.
- Nice meeting you.

93
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,686
So they're putting in
a lost and found because of me.

94
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,281
I mean, there's a time limit, but still.

95
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:16,637
They're really building
a Utopian society up there.

96
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:19,955
- And you attribute this to the calzone?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,197
I'm like a drug dealer.
I got the guy hooked.

98
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm having lunch at his desk every day
this week, just him and me.

99
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,756
He doesn't make a move without me.
It's very exciting.

100
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:31,806
Boy, with you two guys at the helm,
the last piece of the puzzle is in place.

101
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,241
Yeah.

102
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,157
So let me ask you a question
about the tip cup...

103
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:39,285
...because I had a little thing with
the calzone guy there this week.

104
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,923
I go to drop a buck in the tip jar...

105
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:45,124
...and just as I'm about to drop it in,
he looks the other way.

106
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:47,960
So then, as I'm leaving,
he gives me a look lik e:

107
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:49,685
"Thanks for nothing."

108
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:51,405
- You got no credit.
- Exactly.

109
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,080
It's like I'm throwing a buck away.

110
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:55,715
I mean, if they don't notice it,
what's the point?

111
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,284
So you don't make a habit of
giving to the blind?

112
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,797
Not bills.

113
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,877
Remember I was telling you how Nicki
always gets whatever she wants?

114
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,083
We're at the movies last night,
it's sold out...

115
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:13,477
...Nicki goes and talks
to the manager... right in.

116
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:16,727
Beautiful women.
You know, they get away with murder.

117
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,845
You never see one of them
lift anything over three pounds.

118
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:21,645
They do what they want,
when they want.

119
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:25,402
- Nobody can stop them.
- She's like a beautiful Godzilla.

120
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,924
And I'm thousands of
fleeing Japanese.

121
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,285
Hey.

122
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,075
What the hell is all this?

123
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:39,319
It's my change.

124
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:42,202
I need quarters for the dryer.

125
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:46,756
Why can't you do this on your table?

126
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,237
Because I don't have a table.

127
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:53,317
- Hey.
- Hey.

128
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:56,400
Hey, so how was
Blame It On The Rain?

129
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:58,959
Hey, thanks for getting
us tickets too.

130
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:04,197
Elaine, let me ask you a question.

131
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:07,165
Was the movie part of the bet?

132
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,716
No, we were both
in the mood for one.

133
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,765
You know, Elaine...

134
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:17,077
...it's not my way to intrude on
the personal lives of close friends...

135
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:18,521
- Oh, is that so?
- Absolutely.

136
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:21,724
- But I feel I must inform you
that what happened last night...

137
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,479
...was more than a simple bet.

138
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,399
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

139
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:26,841
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?

140
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,759
He made a bet he knew
he was gonna lose...

141
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:30,360
...just to take you to dinner.

142
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,326
Oh, that doesn't make any sense.

143
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:35,285
I mean, if he wanted to ask me out,
why didn't he just ask me?

144
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,597
If he doesn't ask you out,
he doesn't get rejected.

145
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:40,281
He's found a dating loophole.

146
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:43,481
I don't buy it.

147
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:49,561
What happened after the movie?

148
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:51,805
Nothing. He walked me home.

149
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,798
- To the door?
- Yeah.

150
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:56,083
- That's a date.
- No, it's not.

151
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:57,566
But I never walk you home.

152
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:00,287
That's just because
you're a jackass.

153
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,039
I found a quarter. Okay.

154
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:05,721
- Anybody want their clothes heated up?
- No, no, no, thanks.

155
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:09,602
How'd you leave it?

156
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,803
I'm supposed to meet him
to pick up your cigars.

157
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,005
That's another loophole.

158
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,237
That's two dates
without asking you out.

159
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:19,484
- You're crazy.
- Crazy like a man.

160
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:25,399
- Number 49.
- You know, my last name is Costanza.

161
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:26,556
That's Italian.

162
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:30,197
So you and I are kind of like
countrymen. Paisanos.

163
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,119
- Six fifty your change.
- Yes.

164
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:35,563
And I always take care of my paisanos,
so here's a little something...

165
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:37,001
Antonio!

166
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,276
Hey, hey, you steal my money?

167
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,483
No, you don't understand.
I wasn't taking it out.

168
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:48,558
I know what you tried to do.
Get out of here.

169
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,046
Don't come back again, ever.

170
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:53,199
- Or I break your head open like a...!
- Oh, my God.

171
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,599
I got the calzones, Mr. Steinbrenner.

172
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,405
Oh, beautiful. I'm starving, George.

173
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:01,003
So I thought tomorrow
maybe we'd try a little corned beef.

174
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:02,998
Corned beef?

175
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,886
I don't think so.
It's a little fatty, don't you think?

176
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:07,639
- How about Chinese?
- Chinese?

177
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,401
No, too many containers.
Big mess. Big mess, very sloppy.

178
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:13,161
We're gonna stick with
the calzones from Paisano's.

179
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,362
That's the ticket.

180
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:17,765
I just thought it'd be nice,
a little variety.

181
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:19,201
No, no, no.

182
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,597
When I find something I like,
I stick with it.

183
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,122
From 1973 to 1982,
I ate the exact same lunch every day.

184
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:26,039
Turkey chilli in a bowl
made out of bread.

185
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,437
Bread bowl. You eat the chilli,
then you eat the bowl.

186
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:30,996
Nothing more satisfying than
looking down after lunch...

187
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,316
...and seeing just a table.

188
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:35,881
Thanks for dinner.

189
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:39,005
I had to give you these cigars.
And since we were both hungry...

190
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,965
Hey, Todd,
let me ask you a question.

191
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:48,279
Was this whole bet thing
just a way of asking me out?

192
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:54,317
- What?
- I mean, Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?

193
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:56,284
Come on.

194
00:08:57,247 --> 00:09:00,045
Elaine, that was a legitimate bet.
I lost, so I bought you dinner.

195
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:04,364
- All right. Well, good night.
- Yeah.

196
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:07,724
If you're not doing anything Saturday
night, you wanna meet somewhere?

197
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:10,526
Now, what is that?

198
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:11,881
Is that a date?

199
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:14,717
Why? Why can't two people
just go and do something...

200
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,684
...without it being a date?

201
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,485
All right, all right. I'm sorry.

202
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,444
- It's not a date.
- No way.

203
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,121
- So I'll see you Saturday?
- All right.

204
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:25,085
Pick you up at 8.

205
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,363
Know what the posted speed limit
is on this road?

206
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:41,725
- Gotta be 55.
- That's right, it is.

207
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,562
- You know how fast you were going?
- A lot faster than that.

208
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:48,282
- Step out of the car, sir.
- Okey-doke.

209
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,319
Can I have your license
and registration?

210
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:55,398
Absolutely.

211
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:56,841
- Nicki?
- Yeah?

212
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:58,963
Would you mind bringing
the registration?

213
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:01,004
Not at all.

214
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,923
I got you on the radar
at 93 miles per hour.

215
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,762
Must have been when
I slowed down to take that curve...

216
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:11,964
...because for a while there,
I was doing well over 100.

217
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:13,561
Officer.

218
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,561
Hi.

219
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:18,002
Do you really
have to give us a ticket?

220
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,564
All right, Nick. Let's hit it.

221
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,358
Hey, buddy.

222
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:32,678
- I'm waiting for my shirt.
- You got your shirt in my oven?

223
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,758
I didn't have enough
quarters for the dryer...

224
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,724
...but this is better
and more convenient.

225
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,162
- Oh, for both of us.
- And I've got a lot more control.

226
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:43,115
I got a shirt going
for 10 minutes at 325.

227
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,075
What's wrong with your oven?

228
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:47,317
I'm baking a pie.

229
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:51,676
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

230
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,246
- Come on up.
- You got cigars?

231
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,045
I got some Cubans
for George's wedding.

232
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:57,516
It was more than I wanted to spend,
but what the hell.

233
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:59,439
Oh, baby, yeah.

234
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:03,125
What are these?

235
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,881
"Producto de Peru."

236
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:08,277
Jerry, you think those are Cubans?

237
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:09,766
Peru?

238
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:11,519
I paid 300 bucks for these.

239
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:14,326
I could have got a house in Peru
for 300 bucks.

240
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,119
You got rooked, buddy.

241
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:17,879
I gotta pay Todd Gack 300 bucks...

242
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:21,403
...just so he has some excuse to see
Elaine again without asking her out?

243
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:24,240
That's a nice name, Todd Gack.

244
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,564
What is that, Dutch?

245
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,241
Oh, baby, here we go.

246
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,162
Oh, mama.

247
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:40,006
Be right back.
Hey, George, hey.

248
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,677
Well, this is really bad now.
I really am in a bad situation now.

249
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:48,315
What's Steinbrenner gonna do
if he doesn't get his calzone?

250
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,682
What's he gonna do?
That's exactly the point.

251
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:52,678
Nobody knows what this guy
is capable of.

252
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:55,805
He fires people like
it's a bodily function.

253
00:11:57,647 --> 00:12:00,525
Why don't you get somebody else
from the office to go to Paisano's?

254
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,678
Before you know it,
he's having lunch with him.

255
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,599
You know how
interoffice politics work.

256
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,758
No, I never had a job.

257
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,322
I decided to go with the brown ones.

258
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:12,959
What the hell is this?

259
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:15,357
Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.

260
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:18,641
There's gotta be some way
to get back into Paisano's.

261
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:21,605
Oh, Paisano's. That's that place
by the stadium, isn't it?

262
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:24,243
- Yeah, you've heard of it?
- Newman raves about it.

263
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:26,682
It's on his mail route.
He stops by there every day.

264
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,086
I'll see you guys later.

265
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,486
- What kind of pie you cooking?
- Huckleberry.

266
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:39,560
Well, you certainly are in a bind.

267
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:43,041
Yeah, and I thought since
you go by there every day...

268
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:46,358
...maybe we could
help each other out.

269
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,595
Let me be perfectly blunt.

270
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:53,406
I don't care for you, Costanza.

271
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,765
You hang out on the west side
of the building with Seinfeld all day...

272
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:59,521
...just laughing it up,
wasting your lives.

273
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:02,082
- You gonna help me or not?
- All right. I'll help you.

274
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,760
I will help you...

275
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:07,886
...but I will expect
something in return.

276
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:09,685
- What?
- Well, for starters...

277
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,724
...I want a calzone of my own.

278
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:13,835
All right.

279
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:16,680
And a slice of pepperoni pizza.

280
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,678
And a large soda.

281
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,885
And three times a week,
I shall require a cannoli.

282
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:23,765
A bit steep, don't you think?

283
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:26,805
You know, I hear that
Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic.

284
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,923
I'd hate to see him
when he's hungry.

285
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:31,555
- All right! All right!
- Do we have a deal?

286
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,479
Just make sure you get them
to me by 1:00.

287
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,003
- He's regimented about his meals.
- I know exactly how he feels.

288
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:41,399
Well, nice doing business with you.
Do come again.

289
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:54,961
- Oh, this is nice.
- Hi.

290
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,924
Gack, party of four.

291
00:13:57,407 --> 00:13:59,398
Party of four? Who are we meeting?

292
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:02,127
Mom, Dad.

293
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:04,363
- This is Elaine.
- Hello.

294
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:08,159
Hello.

295
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,644
It was nice meeting you.

296
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,405
Bye, Ma.

297
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:19,639
She's wonderful.

298
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,399
- What the hell was that?
- What?

299
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,603
Why did you
introduce me to your parents?

300
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,361
They're nice people.
I thought you'd like them.

301
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:35,361
Come on, Todd.
Admit it. This is a date.

302
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:37,200
Why is this a date?

303
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,961
Saturday night with your parents?

304
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,324
I mean, unless I'm your sister,
this is a date.

305
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:46,195
I don't understand why
you can't meet someone's parents...

306
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,959
...without classifying it as a date.

307
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:51,483
- Well, if it's not a date, then what is it?
- It's a lovely evening together.

308
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:54,646
I don't believe this.

309
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:56,126
I'm gonna get a cab. Join me?

310
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,198
No, that's okay. I'll just walk home.

311
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,881
All right. Well, good night.

312
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:04,041
Now, what is that?

313
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:19,366
Hello.

314
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,320
What's this?

315
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:25,082
Well, I was dropping off
the calzone money for the week.

316
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:28,036
- Shouldn't you be at work by now?
- Work?

317
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:29,845
It's raining.

318
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,604
So?

319
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:36,397
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.

320
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:38,843
You don't work in the rain?

321
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,326
You're a mailman.

322
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:44,196
Neither rain nor sleet nor...
It's the first one!

323
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,316
I was never that big on creeds.

324
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:50,116
You're supposed to deliver
my calzones. We had a deal.

325
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:54,758
I believe the deal was that
I get your calzones on my route.

326
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:58,886
Well, today I won't be going
on my route, will I?

327
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,526
Perhaps tomorrow.

328
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,521
- But I'm paying you.
- Yes, thank you.

329
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:08,599
Newman!

330
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,002
Peru?

331
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,078
I thought you wanted cigars
from Cuba.

332
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,396
I did.

333
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,637
If these aren't what you wanted,
why pay him?

334
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,001
Well, what could I do?

335
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:20,119
Unless...

336
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,446
...you paid him a visit.

337
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:24,800
Okay.

338
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,920
Kramer?

339
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:31,356
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

340
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:34,200
I need you to do me a favour.
Get me lunch at Paisano's.

341
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:37,040
- Wait, what happened to Newman?
- He called in sick.

342
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:39,955
Oh, right. Yeah, it's raining.

343
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:41,835
Listen, can you do it?

344
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,441
- Well, what time you want it?
- 1:00. You need some money?

345
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:47,485
No, no, I got eight tons of change.
I gotta unload it.

346
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:49,160
All right.

347
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,006
Hey, hold that bus!

348
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,280
Hey!

349
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,119
Hey, buddy.

350
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:15,120
- It's really wet out there, huh?
- What can I get you?

351
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:18,484
- I hear you make a mean "calazon."
- Calzone.

352
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:20,319
- Yeah, calzone, yeah.
- The best.

353
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:23,001
All right. Well, lay them on me.
I'll have three of them.

354
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:25,563
- Three calzone.
- Yeah, yeah.

355
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:34,877
Boy, that's a... That's a big oven.

356
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:44,076
Hey, listen, I wonder if
you could do me a favour?

357
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:51,598
- Hey, Todd.
- Hi, Elaine.

358
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:53,519
- Hi.
- You know Nicki, right?

359
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:56,201
- Hi, yeah, sure.
- Wait, Elaine will settle this.

360
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,439
Elaine, what does the M stand for
in Richard M. Nixon?

361
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:03,236
- Milhous.
- I told you so. He said it was Moe.

362
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:07,043
You owe me a dinner.

363
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:15,321
All right. Your order is ready.

364
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:17,240
Three calzones...

365
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:20,521
...and one hot shirt and jacket.
- Oh, yeah.

366
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,596
This is all burned up. Look at this.

367
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,122
What the hell do I know about
cooking a shirt?

368
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:29,800
Seven fifty for calzones.

369
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:32,324
Burned up. I don't know.

370
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,401
- What the hell is this? Pennies?
- Yeah.

371
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,717
- You're paying in change?
- That's all I got.

372
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,196
No, you've got to have bills,
paper money.

373
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,323
- You can't pay with this.
- That's all I got.

374
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,921
- Then you got no calzones.
- Wait a minute! Wait!

375
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:06,042
What happened to you?
Where are the calzones?

376
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,926
He wouldn't give them to me
because I wanted to pay in change.

377
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:12,636
- What the hell happened to your shirt?
- He overcooked it.

378
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,598
It's all ruined.

379
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,484
Your clothes smell
just like Paisano's.

380
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:24,161
There's another Italian place
on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.

381
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,483
You want me to say it again?
I'll say it again.

382
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:35,639
I haven't had a pimple since I was 18.
I don't care if you believe me.

383
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,877
And how's this? You're fired.

384
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:40,767
Okay, you're not.
I'm just a little hungry. I'm sorry.

385
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,679
This Costanza. Where's my calzone?

386
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:44,280
It's 1: 15. He's late.

387
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,924
Wait a second. I gotta call you back.

388
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,317
That smell. I know that smell.

389
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,955
He's in the building.
Costanza is in the building.

390
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,480
And he's not in this office.

391
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,763
He's got the calzone! Costanza!

392
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:00,043
I catch you, I'm killing you,
Costanza!

393
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:06,315
Stupid cigars.

394
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:08,523
If I didn't send Nicki
over to Todd with these...

395
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:10,564
...they never would have
gotten together.

396
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:11,921
These are terrible.

397
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:14,721
It's like trying to smoke
a chicken bone.

398
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:21,043
What kind of a name is
Todd Gack anyway?

399
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:23,398
I think it's Dutch.

400
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,319
I gotta get going.

401
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:30,840
Where are you going?

402
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:34,477
I promised Nicki
I'd walk her dog for her.

403
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:36,763
- But she dumped you.
- I know, I know.

404
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:40,078
But somehow she explained it to me,
I couldn't say no.

405
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:42,203
- Smells like a rubber fire.
- What's that?

406
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,597
I said "rubber fire."

407
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:50,844
Did you end up paying Todd
for these things?

408
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,918
Actually, it's being taken care of
right now.

409
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,399
- Hey, you Gack?
- Yeah.

410
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,558
Yeah, here's your money.

411
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:14,004
What did he do with it?
It's gotta be here.

412
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,442
I'm not crazy. I can smell it.

413
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,555
These clothes.

414
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:22,036
Costanza, how come these
clothes smell like calzones?

415
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:25,361
My friend put them
in the pizza oven.

416
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,916
Put them in a pizza oven?
What for?

417
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,800
To heat them up.

418
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:33,597
That is not a bad idea.
What about this?

419
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:36,235
We'll put all the uniforms in
pizza ovens before the game.

420
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:38,602
That's fantastic.
Keep those muscles loosey-goosey.

421
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,883
This could be big.
Clean up this mess, will you?

422
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:42,366
Big Stein's onto something.

423
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:45,724
I smell a pennant!
