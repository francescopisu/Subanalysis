1
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,402
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:15,957
Big news. The dog problem
has been solved.

3
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:17,116
Really? What happened?

4
00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:19,198
Well, there's this rabbi
in my building...

5
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,244
You've met him.
He's a very nice man.

6
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:24,285
- Is he the one with the show on cable?
- Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

7
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:27,678
So I spoke to him about the dog,
he went down, talked to the owner...

8
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:30,315
...and she agreed to keep the dog
inside from now on.

9
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:32,921
- That's great.
- I know.

10
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:51,239
- That looks pretty good.
- He's in.

11
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:56,287
Hey, so, you know, we haven't
discussed George's engagement.

12
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:59,484
- What's to discuss?
- Come on. George is getting married.

13
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:00,841
Is he happy?

14
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:04,156
I will never understand
the bathrooms in this country.

15
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:07,956
Why is it that the stall doors do not
come all the way down to the floor?

16
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:10,846
Maybe it's so you can see
if there's someone in there.

17
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:12,879
Isn't that why we have locks
on the doors?

18
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:15,800
Well, as a backup system,
in case the lock is broken...

19
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,719
...you can see if it's taken.

20
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,957
A backup system?

21
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:22,836
We're designing bathroom doors
with our legs exposed...

22
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:25,919
...in anticipation
of the locks not working?

23
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:30,163
That's not a system. That's
a complete breakdown of the system.

24
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:32,204
Can we change the subject, please?

25
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:34,597
Why, what's wrong with it?
This is a bad subject?

26
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:37,839
No, fine. If you wanna keep
talking about it, we'll talk about it.

27
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:40,238
It's not that I wanna keep
talking about it.

28
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:43,604
I just think the subject should resolve
itself based on its own momentum.

29
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:46,520
Well, I didn't think
that it had any momentum.

30
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:49,879
How am I gonna do this?

31
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:53,403
I'm engaged to this woman?
She doesn't even lik e me.

32
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,525
Change the subject?
Toilets were the subject.

33
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:59,281
We don't even share
the same interests.

34
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:07,480
- Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
- Well, that's all that counts, I guess.

35
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:10,686
What's the matter?

36
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,838
What? Nothing.

37
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:16,241
You don't seem too enthused
about the whole thing.

38
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,079
Well, what do you want me to do?

39
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:21,715
I thought you'd have
some reaction to it.

40
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:25,879
Well, I don't.

41
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,319
I think maybe you're a little jealous.

42
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:32,285
Oh, what, you think
I wanna marry George?

43
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:35,598
No, but maybe you wish it was you
who was getting married, not him.

44
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:38,759
Oh, please.
That is the last thing that I want.

45
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,918
Oh, yeah. Right.

46
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:42,520
Yeah, right.

47
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:45,963
- Laney.
- Jerry.

48
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:48,243
- You don't wanna get married?
- Yeah, that's right.

49
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:50,159
- I don't wanna get married.
- Oh, come on.

50
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,919
- Oh, you come on.
- It's such...

51
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:53,076
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

52
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:56,523
Hey, Elaine, listen, I was talking
to a friend about this dog business.

53
00:02:56,687 --> 00:03:00,362
Do you realize this is going to be
on our permanent records?

54
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:01,880
Are you aware of this?

55
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:04,437
- Oh, dear.
- It can never be erased.

56
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:07,644
It'll follow us wherever we go
for the rest of our lives.

57
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:11,766
I'll never be able to get a job.
I mean, doesn't that concern you?

58
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:14,806
Everything I've worked for,
down the drain...

59
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,605
...because of one stupid mistake.

60
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:19,565
I mean, aren't we entitled
to make one mistake in our lives?

61
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:21,445
- We gotta change the system.
- Yes!

62
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:23,563
I could care less.

63
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:27,004
I hope it is on our record.
I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.

64
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:39,877
- Oh, hello, Rabbi Kursham.
- Elaine.

65
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:41,799
Always a pleasure to see you.

66
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,881
Thanks again for taking care
of that dog for us.

67
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:48,881
Elaine, oftentimes in life
there are problems...

68
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:51,925
...and just as often
there are solutions.

69
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,120
Yeah, yeah, I suppose.

70
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:59,486
Elaine, you don't seem yourself today.
You seem, if I may say, troubled.

71
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:02,278
No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.

72
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:06,157
Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.

73
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:09,515
Hey.

74
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,484
I want your honest opinion
about something.

75
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:14,525
- Have I ever been less than forthright?
- No, you haven't.

76
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,042
Well, maybe you have.
What do I know?

77
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,880
I probably have. Of course I have.
What am I talking about?

78
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:23,164
Okay, tell me what you think
about this idea:

79
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:27,115
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium...

80
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:28,436
...all the way to the floor.

81
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:34,160
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium to the floor?

82
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:36,522
Door comes down,
hides your feet.

83
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:40,236
- Yes, I like it. I like it a lot.
- It's good, right?

84
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:43,160
I think it's fantastic.
I think it's a fantastic idea.

85
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:44,601
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

86
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:48,043
Well, I told it to Susan before
and she didn't like it.

87
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:50,922
Yeah. Not only that,
this is what she said to me:

88
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,406
"Can we change the subject?"

89
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,398
- See, now, that I don't care for.
- Right.

90
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,081
I mean, we're on a subject.
Why does it have to be changed?

91
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,158
It should resolve of its own volition.

92
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:01,841
That's exactly what I said,
but I used the word "momentum."

93
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:04,726
- "Momentum," same thing.
- Same thing.

94
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:08,035
My God, I'm getting married
in December. Do you know that?

95
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:09,966
Yeah, I know.

96
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,561
How am I gonna make December?
I need a little more time.

97
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:14,126
Look at me,
I'm a nervous wreck.

98
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:16,596
My stomach aches.
My neck is killing me. I can't turn.

99
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,837
Look, look.

100
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:22,044
- You're turning.
- No, that's not a good turn.

101
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,277
December! December!

102
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:27,644
Don't you think we should have a little
more time to get to know each other?

103
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,363
If you need more time,
you should have more time.

104
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,565
- What, you think I could postpone it?
- Sure you can. Why not?

105
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:36,605
- You're allowed to postpone?
- I don't see why not.

106
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,637
- So I could do that?
- Sure, go ahead.

107
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,837
All right. All right.

108
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,157
I'll tell you what, how about this?
I got the date.

109
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,602
March 21 st, the first day of spring.

110
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,235
- Spring, of course.
- You know, spring.

111
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:56,285
Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything's blooming.

112
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,244
All that crap.

113
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:00,920
Beautiful.

114
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,244
- She's not gonna like it.
- No, she's not.

115
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,967
You know, I think
I'm a little bit scared of her.

116
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:11,637
She's 5'3", like 100 pounds,
I'm frightened to death of her.

117
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,796
Well, she's a women.
They don't like to be disappointed.

118
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:17,685
Especially her.

119
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:20,315
She does not like disappointment.

120
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:22,836
Well, I have to do it.

121
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,077
I can't make December.
No way I can make December.

122
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:27,158
You can see that, right?
I mean, look at me.

123
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,002
Can I make December? I can't
make December, right? Look! Look!

124
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,761
- Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
- March 21 st.

125
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,043
Hey. So you're gonna
back me on this, right?

126
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:39,005
- Oh, all the way.
- You are a good friend.

127
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,045
You know what, even if you killed
somebody, I wouldn't turn you in.

128
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:46,038
Is that so?

129
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:49,483
Hey, Kramer, if I killed somebody,
would you turn me in?

130
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:52,004
Definitely.

131
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,315
- You're kidding.
- No, no, I would turn you in.

132
00:06:56,647 --> 00:07:00,435
- You would turn me in?
- I wouldn't even think about it.

133
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,123
You're supposed to be
a friend of mine.

134
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:06,120
Well, what kind of person are you,
going around killing people?

135
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:08,118
Well, I'm sure I had a good reason.

136
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,165
Well, if you killed this person,
who's to say I wouldn't be next?

137
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:14,364
- But you know me.
- I thought I did.

138
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:21,801
I really appreciate your taking time
to talk with me, Rabbi.

139
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:25,562
You know, I'm not of your faith.
In fact, I'm not a very religious person.

140
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:30,198
But I do feel as if I'm in need
of some guidance here.

141
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,359
Would you care for a snack
of some kind?

142
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:36,924
I have the SnackWells,
which are very popular...

143
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:40,841
...although I think sometimes
with the so-called fat-free cookies...

144
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:46,001
...people may overindulge, forgetting
that they may be high in calories.

145
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:49,876
No. No, thank you.
I'm not very hungry.

146
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:52,038
Anyway...

147
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:56,597
...this friend of mine, George,
got engaged.

148
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,598
- How wonderful.
- Yeah, yeah.

149
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:03,045
Well, for some reason...

150
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:07,165
...well, I find myself
just overcome...

151
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:10,285
...with feelings of jealousy
and resentment.

152
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:13,837
Doesn't it give you any joy
to see your friend...

153
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:16,885
...enter into this holiest of unions?

154
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,242
No, no. No, it doesn't.

155
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:23,561
No joy. No joy whatsoever. It just...
The whole thing makes me...

156
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:25,365
...sick.

157
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,166
You know, Elaine...

158
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:31,922
...very often we cannot see
the forest for the trees.

159
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:34,043
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

160
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:37,726
Well, for example,
say there's a forest...

161
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,039
Yeah, see, the thing is, Rabbi,
it should've been me.

162
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:46,041
You know? I'm smart.
I'm attractive.

163
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:49,722
You know, my temple
has many single functions.

164
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:51,286
Oh, no, that's okay.

165
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:56,157
My nephew Alex is someone who's
also looking. Perhaps I could?

166
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:57,886
No, I don't think so.

167
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:02,598
He owns a flower store.
Very successful.

168
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,359
So you're nothing but a stoolie.
Admit it.

169
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:09,405
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

170
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:12,121
- Another caffe latte?
- Yeah, you better believe it.

171
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:15,723
- Since when are you so trendy?
- Hey, baby, I set the trends.

172
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:17,923
Who do you think
started this caffe latte thing?

173
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,043
I don't recall you
drinking caffe lattes.

174
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:22,562
I've been drinking caffe lattes
since the fifth grade...

175
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:23,876
...and haven't looked back.

176
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,402
Look, Plan 9 from Outer Space
is playing tomorrow night.

177
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,478
- One show only.
- I've always wanted to see it.

178
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:30,444
I was supposed to see this
five years ago.

179
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,837
I was in a Chinese restaurant
with George and Elaine.

180
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,440
We got screwed up
and missed it.

181
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,120
- Well, let's do it, huh?
- All right.

182
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:39,484
Look at this, Jerry.
Dropping paper on the ground.

183
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,239
See, that's littering.

184
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:43,637
Maybe you ought to call the cops
and turn me in.

185
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:45,879
Maybe I will.

186
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:53,558
- Hi.
- Hey, how was your day?

187
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,319
Good. Good day.

188
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,206
- How was...? How was your day?
- Oh, it was okay.

189
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,367
- So, what's going on?
- Oh, nothing much.

190
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:04,837
You know, went over to Jerry's,
talked to Jerry.

191
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:08,204
Oh, the Lauers wanna get together
with us on Friday night.

192
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,846
The Lauers? Really?

193
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:12,919
- Do you not wanna go?
- No, no. I wanna go.

194
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,442
So, what did Jerry have to say?

195
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:19,236
Oh, nothing much.
You know, we were talking.

196
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,119
I had an unbelievable idea
today.

197
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,357
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.

198
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,961
Yeah. No, it's not the toilets.
It's something else.

199
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:34,401
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,795
- Okay, how about this?
- What?

201
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,036
- All right.
- Okay.

202
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:39,483
We get married...

203
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:42,115
...March 21 st,
the first day of spring.

204
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:44,836
What do you mean?
You wanna postpone the wedding?

205
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:47,157
No, no, this has got nothing
to do with postponing.

206
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:50,364
I just think the first day of spring
is the perfect day to get married.

207
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:54,202
Spring! Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything is blooming. All that...

208
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:59,807
If you don't wanna marry me, George,
just say so. Just say so!

209
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,366
No, no, still marry. Still marry.

210
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:05,645
- No, you don't love me.
- No, no, still love. Still love.

211
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,163
My friends told me
that you were too neurotic...

212
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:11,603
...and that I was making a mistake.
- No, no, no. No mistake. No mistake.

213
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:13,723
Listen, we're gonna get married
over Christmas.

214
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:16,845
Really, it doesn't make
any difference to me. It's fine, really.

215
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:19,396
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Christmas.

216
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:23,799
Snow, Santa, all that stuff.

217
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:26,362
Let me take a guess.

218
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,721
She cried and you caved.

219
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:34,477
- How did you know that?
- I live and breathe, my friend.

220
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:37,719
I live and breathe.

221
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:41,004
I felt terrible. I thought she was
gonna collapse and kill herself.

222
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,364
Yes, it's very difficult.
Few men have the constitution for it.

223
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,358
That's why breakups
take two or three tries.

224
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:47,960
You gotta build up your immunity.

225
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:50,357
You see those tears,
you don't know what to do.

226
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:53,325
It's like she was on fire.
I was just trying to put her out.

227
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:59,120
Well, at least you probably had some
pretty good make-up sex afterwards.

228
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,162
I didn't have any sex.

229
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:05,837
You didn't have make-up sex?
How could you not have make-up sex?

230
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:08,362
That's the best feature
of the heavy relationship.

231
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,845
I missed out on the make-up sex.

232
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:14,196
In your situation...

233
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,927
...the only sex you're gonna have
better than make-up sex...

234
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:19,999
...is if you're sent to prison
and you have a conjugal visit.

235
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,282
Yeah, conjugal-visit sex.
That is happening.

236
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:34,282
Look, I can tell you're very upset,
but I'm sorry, I'm not going.

237
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:38,360
Did you hear that?

238
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:43,085
I can't believe this. Look at this guy.
He's eating a sandwich.

239
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:45,556
Are you gonna eat those fries?

240
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,761
This is amazing.

241
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,006
Thank you. Thank you very much.

242
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,395
I'm going back in.

243
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:02,206
Feel better.

244
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,044
Poor bastard.

245
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:14,006
Good evening, Rabbi.

246
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,601
Good evening. And how does
this evening find you?

247
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,359
Well, Rabbi. Well.

248
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:21,041
I trust you're here
to see your friend, Elaine?

249
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:24,517
- Yeah, that's right.
- I hope she's feeling better.

250
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:25,921
What do you mean?

251
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:27,884
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

252
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:31,240
Well, it seems the engagement
of her friend George...

253
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:33,716
...has left her feeling
bitter and hostile.

254
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,476
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.

255
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:39,558
In fact, she told me
that she wishes...

256
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,957
...she was the one
who was getting married.

257
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,086
Really?

258
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:47,796
- She came off as pretty desperate.
- I didn't know any of this.

259
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:51,960
Apparently, she doesn't think much
of this George fellow either.

260
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:56,723
I recall the word "loser" peppered
throughout our conversation.

261
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,798
Well, this all comes as news to me.

262
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,558
- Hi.
- Hi, how was your day?

263
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:07,160
Good. Good day.

264
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:10,080
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was okay.

265
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:14,479
- So, what's going on?
- Oh, nothing much, you know.

266
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,923
I went over to Jerry's.
You know, talked to Jerry.

267
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,835
Could l...?
Could I talk to you for a minute?

268
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:26,486
Yeah, sure.

269
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:28,120
All right.

270
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:31,479
You see, this is the thing.

271
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:41,396
I just feel like I can't do this
in December.

272
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:45,685
I just feel like I need a little more time
because I feel like I'm not ready yet.

273
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:48,441
I'm frightened and I'm scared.

274
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:53,806
And I just feel we need a little
more time to get to know each other.

275
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,959
But I could do it in March.
I promise. I promise.

276
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:02,517
No more postponements. I just
need three more months, please.

277
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:05,247
Oh, George, George.

278
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:06,681
Of course.

279
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:10,157
Of course it can wait till March
if that's what you want.

280
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,716
- Yeah?
- Oh, don't worry.

281
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:16,846
Yes, of course, of course.

282
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,639
I have that magazine article for you.

283
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,956
You know, I had a little talk
with the rabbi outside.

284
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,197
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:32,040
Understand you had
a little talk with him too.

286
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:33,925
Yeah, we talked earlier.

287
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:36,681
Yes, I know, I know.

288
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:43,163
- What does that mean?
- Nothing. Nothing.

289
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:50,962
- He didn't mention?
- Yes, he did.

290
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:54,961
- He told you about the conversation?
- Oh, we had quite a little chat.

291
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:58,642
- He told you about...?
- Yes, how you are jealous of George.

292
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:01,162
How you wish you were
getting married instead of him.

293
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,840
He told you that? How could he?

294
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,646
And it didn't take much
prodding either, I have to say.

295
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:08,685
- Can he do that?
- He did.

296
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:12,442
But he's a rabbi. How can a rabbi
have such a big mouth?

297
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:14,359
That's what's so fascinating.

298
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:18,363
You better finish your
little caffe latte there.

299
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:20,563
- They'll never let you in with it.
- Why not?

300
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:23,639
Because they don't allow
outside drinks into the movie.

301
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:26,640
- Well, that's stupid.
- That's the rule.

302
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:29,719
Yeah, well, we'll just see if
we can't get around that.

303
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:38,117
Oh, Elaine, come in, come in.

304
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,797
- So nice to see you again.
- Yeah.

305
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:44,198
Can I offer you some
kasha varnishkes?

306
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,643
No, no. Listen, Rabbi,
I'd like to ask you a question.

307
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,720
Why? Why did you tell my friend
Jerry what I talked to you about?

308
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:56,517
- Was that a problem for you?
- Of course it was problem for me!

309
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:59,964
You didn't...? You didn't tell
anyone else about this, did you?

310
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,038
Well, let's see...

311
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:07,562
I seem to recall a conversation
with Mrs. Winston in 1 F.

312
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,716
Mrs. Winston?

313
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,317
Yes, we were waiting
for our mail to arrive...

314
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,842
...and I happened to mention
to her...

315
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:16,760
...how you felt it was never
going to "happen" for you.

316
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:22,443
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't
mention anything to him, did you?

317
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:23,756
Don Ramsey?

318
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:26,964
You know, that tall good-looking guy,
he lives on the fifth floor?

319
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:28,765
Oh, him.

320
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:32,237
Well, this morning I happened
to find myself in the elevator with him.

321
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:34,363
Oh, my God, you didn't.

322
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:38,400
Excuse me.

323
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:40,564
Pardon me. Excuse us.

324
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:45,360
My coffee!

325
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,915
Hey, hey, what's going on?
What just happened here?

326
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,202
Nothing. Nothing.

327
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:01,086
What do you got? One of those
caffe lattes in your shirt?

328
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,239
I don't have anything. What?
Ask him.

329
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,879
All right. Come on, coffee boy.

330
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:10,481
- What?
- Come on, now. Here we go.

331
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:17,326
I mean, the whole thing is a mess.
He told everyone in the building.

332
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:19,398
I ran into that cute guy
on the fifth floor...

333
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,922
...I mean, he could barely
bring himself to nod.

334
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:26,802
Elaine, if I could say a word here
about the Jewish people.

335
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,401
That man in no way
represents our ability...

336
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,355
...to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip
and keep it to ourselves.

337
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,279
You didn't say anything
to George, did you?

338
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:37,641
No.

339
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:40,765
About how you wish it was you who
was getting married instead of him.

340
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:44,886
- Feelings of resentment, hostility.
- Yeah, yeah. So what?

341
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:50,681
- Hey.
- Georgie, congratulations!

342
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:54,601
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you
since it happened.

343
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,201
I couldn't be happier for you.

344
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:58,995
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

345
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:03,638
Oh, come on. Come on.
You really, really deserve it.

346
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:05,959
Deserve?
I don't know about deserve.

347
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:07,116
Are you kidding?

348
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:10,085
I have seen the changes in you
the past couple of years.

349
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:14,035
Man, you have grown.
You've matured.

350
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,124
Yeah, I guess I'm getting older.

351
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:20,082
Well, I just think it's wonderful.
Honestly.

352
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:24,684
I've gotta run, but please,
please give my best to Susan.

353
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:26,075
My most just...

354
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:28,602
...heartfelt congratulations.
- Yeah, thanks.

355
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,200
Listen, if you ever get a date...

356
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,881
...maybe the four of us
could go out together sometime.

357
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,525
Yes. Yes, yes. Sure.

358
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:39,360
Wasn't there some guy in your
building that you said you liked?

359
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,722
He lived up on the fifth floor
or something?

360
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:43,923
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.

361
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:48,246
- Boy, she is something, isn't she?
- Yeah, she's something else.

362
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,796
Hey, so, what happened?
Did you hold your ground or?

363
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:55,165
- Nope. I wept like a baby.
- What?

364
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,444
Well, I started to tell her, and then
all of a sudden, for some reason...

365
00:19:58,607 --> 00:20:00,359
...I just burst into tears.

366
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:02,961
- You cried?
- I bawled uncontrollably.

367
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:06,642
I just poured my guts out. And
I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible.

368
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:09,316
I never realized how powerful
these tears are.

369
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:12,763
I could have postponed it
another five years if I wanted to.

370
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:14,322
- Hey.
- Hey.

371
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:16,876
Sorry about that movie thing.
I was joking around.

372
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:18,480
Sorry? Are you kidding?

373
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,285
You did me the biggest favour
of my life.

374
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:24,156
I spoke to a lawyer.
We're suing for millions.

375
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:28,286
- Suing? What for?
- The coffee was too hot.

376
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:32,364
- It's supposed to be hot.
- Not that hot.

377
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:43,765
The prophet Isaiah tells us
that without friends...

378
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:46,839
...our lives are empty
and meaningless.

379
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:50,283
Wait a minute. That's the rabbi
from Elaine's building.

380
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:52,642
I just met this guy the other day.

381
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,402
A young lady I know,
let's call her Elaine...

382
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:03,246
...happened to find herself
overwhelmed...

383
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:07,366
...with feelings of resentment
and hostility for her friend...

384
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,165
...let's call him George.

385
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:14,325
She felt that George
was somewhat of a loser...

386
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:19,324
...and that she was the one
who deserved to be married first.

387
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:24,357
She also happened to mention to me
that her friend had wondered...

388
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:29,396
...if going to a prostitute while you're
engaged is considered cheating.

389
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:34,639
His feeling was...

390
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,843
...they're never going
to see each other again...

391
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:39,202
...so, what's the difference?

392
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:43,276
But that is a subject
for another sermon.

393
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:47,156
And now I'd lik e to close
with a psalm.
