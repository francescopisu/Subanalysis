1
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:04,405
The pilot comes on
with his announcements:

2
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:07,479
"I'm going over this.
I'm going over that.

3
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:10,115
I'm taking a left. I'm bringing it up.
I'm taking it down.

4
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:12,562
I'm going right. I'm going this way.
Going that way."

5
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,924
And we're back there,
"Yeah, that's all fine.

6
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:21,279
Just do whatever the hell you gotta do.
I don't know what the hell is going on."

7
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:24,276
Do I bother him? Do I go knocking
on the cockpit door?

8
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:26,563
"I'm having the peanuts now.

9
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:32,484
Just thought you might
like to know what we're doing."

10
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:38,758
Thank you. Good night.

11
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:42,847
- Jerry!
- Hey, hey.

12
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:46,238
Sally Weaver. Susan Ross' roommate
from college?

13
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:49,126
- Hello?
- Right. Oh, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:52,359
- Oh, so you saw the show?
- Saw it? I loved it.

15
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:54,757
And thank you for the free tickets.
You are so funny.

16
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:56,485
- Oh, thanks.
- No, no, I mean it.

17
00:00:56,647 --> 00:00:59,002
- You're very funny.
- I believe you.

18
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,759
Well, anyway, let me
show you Memphis.

19
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,395
- I am taking you out to dinner.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I can't...

20
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:06,161
...l'm going straight to the airport.
- Oh, that's too bad.

21
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:09,956
Susan thought we'd really get along.
I guess because we're both wacko.

22
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:13,358
You know what, you have to
give this to them for me. Okay?

23
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:15,119
Here, it's a wedding present.

24
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:18,040
Oh, and Jerry, be careful with it,
okay? Be very careful.

25
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,681
George, as you may be aware...

26
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:25,203
...your mother and I are not
moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.

27
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,279
- I am aware.
- I was wondering, would it be okay...

28
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:30,915
...if I turned your room
into a billiard parlor?

29
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:32,681
A billiard parlor?

30
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:36,483
Regulation table with a hi-fi,
maybe even a bar.

31
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,161
Give it some real authenticity.

32
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,642
- Well, that's... Elaine.
- Oh, hi, Frank.

33
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:48,437
- Sit down. Join us, please.
- Actually, I've gotta get to the thing.

34
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:50,279
The thing's canceled. Sit down.

35
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:53,285
Okay.

36
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:58,996
So, Frank, did George
ever show you that photo?

37
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,362
What photo?

38
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:03,166
The photo I took in Tuscany
of the man in front of the sign...

39
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,887
...that said Costanza.
- There's a Costanza in Tuscany?

40
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:08,722
Did he look like me?
Did you talk to him?

41
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,640
I didn't talk to anyone. I was just
walking by and saw the sign.

42
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:13,638
I thought George
might get a kick out of it.

43
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,997
I gotta get that picture.

44
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,840
- It could be my cousin, Carlo.
- Who is that?

45
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:22,602
When the Costanzas came here,
one brother stayed behind.

46
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,042
I played with his son every day
until the age of 4...

47
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:28,279
...when we were separated.
- So you weren't born here?

48
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:31,519
No. That's why
I could never be president.

49
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:33,166
It always hurt me.

50
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:36,956
That's why, even at an early age,
I had no interest in politics.

51
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:40,085
I refuse to vote. They don't want me,
I don't want them!

52
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,965
I don't know why
you're getting riled up.

53
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:43,765
There's probably
a million Costanzas...

54
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:45,645
Don't bring me down.

55
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:50,523
- You have another copy of that photo?
- No, I don't.

56
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:53,406
- But, well, the Maestro might.
- The Maestro? What Maestro?

57
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,637
He's this guy
that I went to Tuscany with.

58
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:59,436
He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't
feel comfortable calling him.

59
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:00,835
Really? Why?

60
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,805
Because he hasn't called me
since we got back.

61
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:08,836
I spilled wine on this 8-by-10 photo of
one of his favorite Italian opera stars.

62
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:10,406
Who?

63
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:14,037
- You know the Three Tenors?
- Yeah, Pavarotti, Domingo...

64
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:16,596
...and the other guy.
- The other guy.

65
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:23,078
Can I take that box for you?

66
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,801
Well, you better not.
I'm supposed to be careful with it.

67
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,037
Then I'll have to put your bag
in the overhead.

68
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,118
Oh, okay.

69
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:39,565
There we go.

70
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:44,436
- Oh, look at this.
- What?

71
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,643
I bought a bottle
of barbecue sauce in Memphis.

72
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:48,286
I think the stewardess broke it...

73
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:51,439
...when she jammed it in the overhead
because of this stupid thing.

74
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,325
Don't press the panic button.

75
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:55,763
I'm sure that we can
still salvage some sauce.

76
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:57,565
I don't care about the sauce.

77
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:00,480
It came in this funny bottle
and there was a guy on the label...

78
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:02,922
...looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
- I see.

79
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,885
No, you don't see. Because I'm going
on the show this week...

80
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:07,878
...and this was gonna be
my bit on the show.

81
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,878
- Why don't you do your material?
- I'm out.

82
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,126
Boy, you better get to work.

83
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:15,718
Thanks for the tip.

84
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:19,160
- Hey, buddies.
- Hey. Hey, this is for you.

85
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,397
It's from Susan's roommate, Sally.

86
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,205
Oh, yeah, Sally called Susan.

87
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:26,643
- Said you guys really hit it off.
- Nobody hit anything off.

88
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,877
She just gave me the box.

89
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:35,163
- What the hell are you doing?
- Well, I'm salvaging the sauce.

90
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:36,521
What's the matter with you?

91
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,445
Hey, hey, hey, come on. Come on.

92
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,837
Jerry, why don't you do a bit
on Styrofoam?

93
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:45,238
- Like what?
- You know, "What is all this stuff?

94
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:47,602
Why do we need this stuff?

95
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:51,476
And why do they make them
so small?"

96
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,919
Where's the punch line?

97
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,478
It's all attitude.

98
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,438
This is certainly a crappy gift.

99
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:03,960
A doormat?

100
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,958
That's what she had me lug up
from Memphis?

101
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:09,085
Pretty chintzy, huh?
Considering the money she makes.

102
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,283
She's a big executive
for Federal Express.

103
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:13,245
Federal Express?

104
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:15,637
Is she out of her mind?
Why didn't she just ship it?

105
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:19,322
Look, it's personalized.
"The Costanzas."

106
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,206
No. No, forget it. I don't want it.
Let's just get rid of it.

107
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,278
Maybe your father
would be interested in that.

108
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:27,007
I doubt it.
You know what he's doing now?

109
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,556
He's putting a pool table
in my old bedroom.

110
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:34,005
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'll go out there and
knock a few balls around with him.

111
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,284
You know, show him a thing or two.

112
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,846
So, what's your game?
What do you like to play?

113
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:45,398
- Eight ball.
- No, nothing doing.

114
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:48,604
Let's you and me
play a game of straight pool.

115
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,838
You like to gamble, Cosmo?

116
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:54,795
Yeah, now and then.
You know how it is.

117
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,720
- Five dollars a game, huh?
- I'll break.

118
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,525
Okay.

119
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:40,447
That's it. That's it. Seven.

120
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,525
What's...? What's all this?

121
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,878
Oh, I'm just moving in
some more of my stuff.

122
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:54,242
More of her stuff.

123
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,405
Oh, I put up my doll collection.

124
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,318
Oh, my God.

125
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,718
- What is that?
- What? What is it?

126
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:07,245
This doll looks like my mother.

127
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:10,681
- George, it's a doll.
- I know it's a doll.

128
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,917
But it looks like my mother.

129
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,647
Oh, get out of here.

130
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:22,278
- Seven, low.
- What's going on in here?

131
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:28,045
Are you two still playing?
You've been up here three hours.

132
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:30,926
- We haven't finished the first game.
- First game?

133
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:34,318
Well, we're still learning
the subtleties of the table.

134
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,842
He knows the Maestro.
He could have the picture.

135
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:40,204
Oh, forget about it.
It's not your cousin.

136
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:42,039
You don't know that!

137
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,843
- We gonna go see him, huh?
- As soon as the game is over.

138
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:50,522
- Oh, boy.
- Eleven, the corner pocket.

139
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,239
What is this thing doing here?

140
00:07:57,407 --> 00:08:01,082
Oh, I used to love to sleep
with my dolls when I was a little girl.

141
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,317
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

142
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:06,047
- Why?
- I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.

143
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:07,959
Stop it.

144
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:20,757
Hey, Elaine, you have to buy this
new electric toothbrush I just got.

145
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:22,360
- The Oro-Dent.
- Oh, yeah?

146
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,519
Every time you use it, you feel like
you just came from the dentist.

147
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:26,676
That's dynamite.

148
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:29,315
Wanna come see me on
The Charles Grodin Show tomorrow?

149
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:31,955
- Who else is on the show?
- One of the Three Tenors.

150
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:36,518
- The Three Tenors? Which one?
- It's not Pavarotti, it's not Domingo...

151
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:38,439
- The other guy?
- Yeah, the other guy.

152
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:42,643
My God, I can't believe the other guy
is gonna be on the show.

153
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:45,037
- Why?
- I ruined this autographed picture...

154
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:47,880
...of him that belonged to the Maestro.
You think I could go?

155
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:50,003
- I could get his autograph?
- Why not?

156
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:53,562
The other guy.

157
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,597
Hey, you look awful.

158
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,758
I'm on no sleep, bro.

159
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,920
- Problem in the bedroom?
- Susan has this doll collection.

160
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:08,124
One of the dolls looks
exactly like my mother.

161
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:12,040
She likes to sleep with it.

162
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:15,321
You were in bed with your mother
last night?

163
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,405
It felt like it.

164
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,404
I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky.

165
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:23,283
It's really freaking me out, man.

166
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:27,005
And now I gotta go back out there
and pick up this doormat.

167
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,727
- I thought you didn't want the doormat.
- I don't.

168
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:32,321
Susan wants to have it out
when Sally comes tomorrow.

169
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,366
- Sally?
- Yeah.

170
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:36,199
Wait a minute.
She's coming to New York?

171
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,881
- Yeah, Susan said you'd be excited.
- Excited?

172
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:41,242
I'm gonna kill her.
She knew she was coming here...

173
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:43,875
...and she made me carry that box?
- Who is Sally?

174
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:46,720
- Susan's college roommate.
- It's her fault that bottle broke...

175
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,957
...that I was gonna give
to Charles Grodin.

176
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,163
Call her and tell her
to bring you another one.

177
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,966
- She'll be delighted to talk to you.
- Oh, I will. Don't worry.

178
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,163
I'll have her bring up
a whole case of the stuff.

179
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:59,319
It'll be really heavy. Let's see
if she likes sitting on a plane...

180
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:02,957
...with a big box on her lap.
- That sounds pretty juvenile.

181
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,522
Hey, a dinosaur!

182
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,958
His name was Carlo Costanza.

183
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:10,924
We played together
every day until I was 4.

184
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:13,396
If I could look at your photos,
maybe I can recognize him.

185
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:16,287
Unfortunately, those photographs
are at home.

186
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,598
If you bring them by, maybe we
could interest you in a game of pool.

187
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,764
Frank here,
he's got his own billiard room.

188
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:25,317
Yes, it's... It's...
What do you call it, Kramer?

189
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:27,876
- It's a billiard room.
- No.

190
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,480
- The name?
- The billiard...

191
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:32,286
Not billiard... Not the billiards...
It was...

192
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:33,800
Come on, already. Come on.

193
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,685
- We call it the...
- The place to be.

194
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:37,644
The place to be!
Yes, it's the place to be.

195
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:39,525
Then I shall be there.

196
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:44,079
Now, gentlemen, if you will excuse me,
I must prepare for the symphony.

197
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,442
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

198
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,082
My pants.

199
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:56,284
It's an old conductor's trick
I learned from Leonard Bernstein.

200
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,915
- Really?
- You keep a perfect crease...

201
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:01,476
...by not sitting in them
before the performance.

202
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,565
That is...

203
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,883
That's good thinking.

204
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,641
You see?

205
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,042
You see?

206
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:17,159
It doesn't look exactly like her.

207
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,241
Jerry, come on.
If my mother keeps shrinking...

208
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:22,921
...this is exactly what she's
gonna look like in 10 years.

209
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:25,123
- Why don't you just get rid of it?
- I tried.

210
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:27,881
I almost threw it down the incinerator.
But I couldn't do it.

211
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:30,845
The guilt was too overwhelming.
Susan's so attached to it.

212
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:34,044
Well, where you going?
Don't take your dolly and go home.

213
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:36,359
Hi, Elaine.

214
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:42,441
- Did you see that?
- I'm just glad it's out of here.

215
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:47,798
- What's that?
- Oh, it's a poster of the Three Tenors.

216
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:50,758
- Yeah.
- It's Sally.

217
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,599
Did you bring
the barbecue sauce?

218
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,997
- A whole case.
- Excellent.

219
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:57,676
Did you buy that electric toothbrush
I told you about?

220
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,202
- No.
- How come? I told you, it's fantastic.

221
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:03,086
- Yeah, I like mine.
- I've had yours.

222
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:06,478
I'm telling you, this one is 10 times
better. Don't you believe me?

223
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,079
- I don't want it.
- I don't understand.

224
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:12,637
Why not get something that's better
if I'm telling you it's better?

225
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:15,526
And it's not a little better.
It's much better.

226
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:17,761
It doesn't matter to me.

227
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,001
Come in.

228
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,160
Well, here I am.

229
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,716
- Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
- Hi.

230
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,924
- How was your flight? Uncomfortable?
- The seat next to me was empty...

231
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,282
...so there was no problem at all.

232
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:36,197
Wait. This isn't the sauce
that I asked for.

233
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,835
That's right.
It's a special gourmet sauce.

234
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,201
The pride of Memphis.

235
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:44,280
No, I wanted the one with the guy on it
that looks like Charles Grodin.

236
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:46,961
This is much better.
And frankly, in Memphis...

237
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:50,278
...we think that other sauce
is kind of a joke.

238
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:53,007
I know it's a joke.
It's supposed to be a joke.

239
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,840
Now I'm going on The Charles
Grodin Show with nothing.

240
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:58,123
- Nothing!
- You could just do your material.

241
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:01,359
- I don't have any material!
- He's got nothing!

242
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:12,602
Georgie, don't eat with your hands.

243
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:17,405
Why do you eat so fast?
You can't even taste it!

244
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,762
Don't tell me how to eat.

245
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:25,442
Still wearing that shirt?
You've had it for five years already.

246
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:27,916
Why don't you buy a new shirt?

247
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,802
Because I like this one.

248
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,365
Come on, let's go.

249
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,165
Let's go.

250
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:39,240
Oh, hi, Deena.

251
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:48,922
That man should really be
in a sanitarium.

252
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,117
Oh, this is remarkable.
I'm lounging...

253
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:54,357
...and yet my pants remain
perfectly creased.

254
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:57,599
It's him. It's Carlo Costanza.

255
00:13:57,767 --> 00:14:00,565
- Come on. Are you sure?
- I'd know him anywhere.

256
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:03,560
I've seen that man in Tuscany.
Eccentric fellow.

257
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,719
Reputation of being
kind of a village idiot.

258
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,206
I still say we're related.

259
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:11,040
Oh, I love this piece.

260
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:12,720
Come on, Frank, it's your shot.

261
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,003
- I can't make anything.
- Because you don't know...

262
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,317
...how to follow through correct.
- Follow through?

263
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:19,682
Here, let me show you.
Take hold of your stick.

264
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:24,477
- Yeah, I got it.
- Get down. Bring it back slowly.

265
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:28,765
It's a little unnatural,
but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

266
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:31,083
Oh, my God.

267
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:35,204
I'm such an idiot. I was gonna do
this whole bit on that bottle.

268
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:38,996
- Now I got nothing to talk about.
- Have you ever considered writing...

269
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,725
...new material?

270
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,478
Maybe if I didn't have so many people
in my apartment all the time...

271
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:46,205
...l'd be able
to get some work done.

272
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:50,765
- Me? Are you talking about me?
- No, you're never here.

273
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:55,804
- That doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
- Yeah, really.

274
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:58,117
Hey, maybe I could talk about that
on the show.

275
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,279
- What?
- Show the doll. Show a picture...

276
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:04,235
...of George's mother. It's pretty funny.
I'm gonna call him.

277
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,684
- Hello?
- Hello, Susan, it's Jerry.

278
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,121
Hi, Jerry, it's Sally.

279
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:12,361
Is George there?

280
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,677
- No, but he should be home soon.
- This is important.

281
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,805
Tell him to meet me at the TV studio
with a picture of his mother...

282
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,084
...and that doll that looks like her.
- Is this for your comedy routine?

283
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:24,125
- Yes.
- Don't worry, I'm on the case.

284
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:31,999
I think I'll get some air.

285
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:33,441
Yeah.

286
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:37,918
This is no good.

287
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,360
Hey, the baton.

288
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:46,916
Yeah, I've got a hunch, fat man,
I can't miss. Thirteen, in the side.

289
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:48,761
Giddyup.

290
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,758
Six, in the corner.

291
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:54,285
This table's mine.

292
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:02,962
You know where it's going.

293
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,156
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:13,158
- Is George here?
- Not yet.

295
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:14,840
The other guy.

296
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:18,119
It's...

297
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,359
...you. It's really you.

298
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:26,759
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

299
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:29,522
Would you mind
signing this poster for me?

300
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:32,247
- My pleasure.
- Oh, thank you so much.

301
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,045
Here you go.

302
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:39,996
Thank you so much, Mr. Camaro.

303
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,883
Mr. Casea.

304
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,566
Well, whatever.

305
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,606
I'm gonna take this to the Maestro.

306
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,837
He's playing at
the Queens Convalescent Center.

307
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:54,602
Yeah, that's a hell of a gig.
Hey, look, I got something for you.

308
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:55,882
The Oro-Dent.

309
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,082
Thank you.

310
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,925
What...? Why does a toothbrush
come in such a big box?

311
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,681
Well, it's a delicate mechanism,
it needs a lot of packing.

312
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:08,678
How am I supposed to carry
this thing?

313
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,723
- What are you doing?
- Well, I wanna sit down.

314
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:18,481
- So?
- It's a trick I just learned from Kramer.

315
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:20,922
Keeps a crease in the pants.

316
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:38,079
Madam, you have been
an extremely gracious hostess.

317
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,399
Thank you, Maestro.

318
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:44,679
- Here, take a look at this.
- Yeah, what is it?

319
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:47,407
It's Carlo. I found him.

320
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,206
You've been cooped up
in this room too long.

321
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:53,643
You never support me! Let's see
what George says about this.

322
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,525
Where are my pants?

323
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,444
Oh, beautiful.

324
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,156
- Hey there, Mr. Hairy Legs.
- Where's George?

325
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:09,399
Don't worry, I brought your doll.

326
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:12,678
No, that's the wrong doll.

327
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:16,157
Jerry, I saw the doll you were
talking about. Not funny.

328
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,763
This doll is much funnier. Look,
it has a bow tie and a cute little hat.

329
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:21,679
I think it's a riot.

330
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,080
This is a nightmare.

331
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:28,123
Well, I'll be watching.
Don't screw up.

332
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,759
Too much sauce.

333
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:39,596
- My pants!
- Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.

334
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,595
Elaine. What a surprise.

335
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:15,885
I know you're very busy, but I just
wanted to come by and give you this.

336
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:19,244
Oh, Oro-Dent, that electric toothbrush.
I've heard so much about it.

337
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:22,683
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.
This.

338
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,157
What a sweet gesture.
An autographed poster...

339
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:37,160
...of my favorite tenor
with those two other guys.

340
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:41,084
Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico.

341
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,875
I just felt so bad
about what happened in Tuscany...

342
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,163
Maestro, you're on.

343
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:49,680
Elaine, wait for me
after the concert.

344
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:52,998
- We'll celebrate.
- Oh, okay.

345
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,639
I wanna know why you took
my doll out of the house.

346
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:33,877
I just wanted a second opinion.

347
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,886
Take a look at this. Does that
look like my flesh and blood?

348
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:45,084
- Of course, your mother...
- Oh, stop bothering everybody...

349
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:47,636
...with that picture. It's ridiculous.

350
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:52,119
Ridiculous? I'll show you ridiculous!
Come here!

351
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:54,676
No, Mr. Costanza... No!

352
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:56,596
There.

353
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:59,600
Now what have you got
to say for yourself?

354
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,879
I told you it looked like her.

355
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,083
Carlo. It's me, Frank.

356
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:30,124
I'm your cousin, Frank.
Aren't you Carlo?

357
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:32,881
Carlo? No.

358
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,765
What do you know?

359
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:41,159
All right. I guess I was wrong.
