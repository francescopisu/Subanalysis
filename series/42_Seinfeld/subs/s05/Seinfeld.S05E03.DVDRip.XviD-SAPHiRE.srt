1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,763
There's no way
that moving in with your parents...

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,001
...is a sign that your life
is right on track.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,405
There's no way
that you could fake this even.

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:14,376
"Things are great.
I met a terrific girl, I got a great job...

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,913
...and if everything goes
according to plan...

6
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:20,644
...I'm gonna be moving back in
with my parents soon."

7
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,082
It's like getting busted
on a parole violation...

8
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,122
...and thrown back
into the slammer.

9
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,092
"In the opinion of the board, you
need further rehabilitation, I'm afraid."

10
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,262
And you go back into that little room
of yours, you feel so huge.

11
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,460
It's like you could take your bed
and just crush it in your hands.

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,798
You can hold your parents
between your fingers.

13
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,533
"Why was I so afraid of you people
when I was growing up?"

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,344
- I can't believe this.
- It won't be for that long.

15
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,350
How can I do this? How can I
move back in with those people?

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,715
Please, tell me.
They're insane, you know that.

17
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,050
Hey, my parents are
as crazy as your parents.

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,158
How can you compare
your parents to mine?

19
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:04,387
My father has never
thrown anything out ever.

20
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:10,128
My father wears his sneakers
in the pool. Sneakers.

21
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:14,239
My mother has never set foot
in a natural body of water.

22
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,168
Listen carefully.

23
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,577
My mother has never laughed.

24
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:28,016
Ever. Not a giggle,
not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.

25
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,748
Never went, "Ha."

26
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,085
- A smirk?
- Maybe.

27
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,456
- And I'm moving back in there.
- I'll lend you the money for the rent.

28
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,655
No, no, no. Borrowing money
from a friend is like having sex.

29
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,824
It just completely changes
the relationship.

30
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,834
- Hey.
- Hey.

31
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,438
All right, I'm ready.

32
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,270
I still don't understand. Why do you
want to move back with your parents?

33
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,642
I don't want to. I'm out of money.
I got $714 in the bank.

34
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,807
- Well, move in here.
- What's that?

35
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,449
Why doesn't he just move in here?

36
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,613
Yeah, I'll move in with him.
He doesn't let you use the toilet.

37
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,123
You can move in with me
if you want.

38
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,727
Thank you. I...

39
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,093
That might not work out.

40
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,765
Careful. Careful with the suitcases.
We just painted.

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,033
- Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
- Hello, Kramer.

42
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,234
- Close the door.
- I gotta bring in more stuff.

43
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,505
- More stuff? How much is there?
- There's more.

44
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,407
- So how are you, Jerry?
- Fine, Mrs. Costanza.

45
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,578
- Hey, I got a terrific joke for you.
- I'm not interested.

46
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,954
No, no. It's really funny.

47
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,061
- There's these two guy-
- Tell it to the audience.

48
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,590
Here, I made some
bologna sandwiches.

49
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,791
Bologna? Nobody eats
bologna anymore.

50
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,436
What are you talking about?
Have a sandwich.

51
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,902
- No, thanks.
- Oh, stop it.

52
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,940
- You don't want one, Kramer?
- No, thanks.

53
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,442
I think you're all
a little touched in the head.

54
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,513
You're so worried about your health?
You're young men.

55
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,174
- I really don't eat it.
- What will I do with these sandwiches?

56
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,446
Will you take them home, give them
to someone in your building?

57
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:15,255
I don't feel comfortable handing out
bologna sandwiches in the building.

58
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:19,091
- All right. That's it. Anything else?
- No, that's it.

59
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,063
- I gotta go move the car.
- Well, I guess we'll be going.

60
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,135
- What, you're going?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,705
Well, what are you doing later?

62
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,278
Elaine and I are having dinner
with Kramer and his new girlfriend.

63
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,472
- Really?
- Yeah. You can't believe this woman.

64
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,243
She's one of these low-talkers.
You can't hear a word.

65
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,081
You're always going,
"Excuse me? What was that?"

66
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,246
- Maybe I'll meet you.
- No, George.

67
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,723
We're going out to eat tonight
with your father.

68
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,328
Okay.

69
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,899
- I'll talk to you later.
- Yeah, take it easy.

70
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,474
Oh, my God.

71
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,845
- Yeah?
- I had this idea for a pizza place...

72
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,650
- ...where you make your own pie.
- Right.

73
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,452
- You remember?
- That was a good one.

74
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,151
Well...

75
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,360
- What's that?
- Excuse me?

76
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,169
- Yeah? Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,602
You know that Leslie's
in the clothing business?

78
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,042
She's a designer.

79
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,912
She's come up with a new one that'll
be the big new look in men's fashions.

80
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,747
It's, like, a puffy shirt.

81
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,583
Well, yeah, it's all puffy.

82
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,123
Like the pirates used to wear.

83
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,093
- Oh, a puffy shirt.
- Puffy.

84
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:00,028
Yeah. See, I think people
wanna look like pirates.

85
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,530
It's the right time for it.

86
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,535
To be all puffy
and devil-may-care, you know.

87
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,669
Yeah.

88
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,809
That's true.

89
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,048
I'll be right back.

90
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,389
<i>Jerry's gonna be
on the Today show on Friday.</i>

91
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:34,226
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yep. He's promoting...

92
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,924
...a benefit for Goodwill.

93
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,503
You know, they clothe the poor
and the homeless.

94
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,537
- And the indigent.
- And the indigent, yeah.

95
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,008
I do volunteer work for them. I set the
whole thing up and got Jerry to do it.

96
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,312
- Sure. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

97
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,181
Yeah. Yep.

98
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,882
Yep.

99
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,560
Yep, yep.

100
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,925
Maybe you should take
a civil-service test.

101
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:12,367
- I'm not taking a civil-service test.
- Look at this, George.

102
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,062
You ever seen a silver dollar?

103
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,804
Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.

104
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,967
Why don't you wanna take
a civil-service test?

105
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,239
To do what? Work in the post office?
Is that what you want me to do?

106
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:27,876
Would you believe when I was 18
I had a silver-dollar collection?

107
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,784
I don't understand.
You get job security.

108
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,155
- You get a paycheck every week.
- I'm a college graduate.

109
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,727
You want me to be a mailman?

110
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,093
You know, I couldn't bring myself
to spend one of these.

111
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,700
I got some kind of a...

112
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,268
...phobia.

113
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,797
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

114
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,343
I do know that I have some kind
of a talent, something to offer.

115
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,242
I just don't know what it is yet.

116
00:06:55,415 --> 00:07:00,751
I bet that collection would be worth
a lot of money today.

117
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,185
Oh, my God.

118
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,859
I don't like this waiter.

119
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,864
Look at him.

120
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,294
He sees us.

121
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,665
Doesn't wanna come over.

122
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,168
I need some air.

123
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,874
- George, where you going?
- I got a lot of thinking to do.

124
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,510
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

125
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,916
Look what you've done.
You've spilled my bag.

126
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,283
- Here, let me help you.
- No, no. It's all right.

127
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,949
It's just that I'm here
with my parents...

128
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,652
...and my mother wants me to take
a civil-service test...

129
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,856
...and to tell you the truth,
I don't even think I'd pass it.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,558
What?

131
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,868
- Your hands.
- What about them?

132
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,206
They're quite exquisite.

133
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,707
They are?

134
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,213
Extraordinary.

135
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,476
Have you ever done
any hand modeling?

136
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,246
Hand modeling? No.

137
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,780
Here's my card.

138
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,550
Why don't you...

139
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,717
...give me a call?

140
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,198
I don't get it.

141
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,000
Me neither.

142
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,540
- What is it?
- I don't know.

143
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,338
- They're hands.
- This woman set me up for a job.

144
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,844
Well, what about my hands?

145
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,744
I don't see how your hands
are any better than my hands.

146
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,407
What, are you kidding?

147
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,985
The knuckles
are all out of proportion.

148
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,521
You got hair there. Where do you
get off comparing your hands to mine?

149
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,689
This is a one-in-a-million hand.

150
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:53,024
That's what comes from avoiding
manual labor your whole life.

151
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,899
This is it.
It's happened to me, Jerry.

152
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,836
I was sitting in the restaurant,
the two nutjobs were talking.

153
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,339
I couldn't take it anymore.

154
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,034
I get up from the table,
and... I bop into this woman.

155
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,873
It's just like in the movies.

156
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,281
- Hey.
- Hey.

157
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,479
- Hey, George.
- Hey.

158
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,385
- Are you crazy?! Are you crazy?!
- What? What?

159
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,755
- You could've damaged my hands!
- What? It's just a toy.

160
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,896
George has become a hand model.

161
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,894
- A hand model?
- Yes.

162
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,556
Really? Let me see your hands.

163
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,726
You can look at them,
but do not touch them.

164
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,303
Let's see.

165
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,976
Oh, those are nice.

166
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,340
You know,
I never noticed this before.

167
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,072
They're smooth.

168
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,739
Creamy.

169
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,080
Delicate yet masculine.

170
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,586
All right. I gotta get going.

171
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,921
Oven mitts?

172
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,956
It's all I could find.

173
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,029
- Would you mind getting the door?
- All right.

174
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,996
- Thank you very much.
- Yep.

175
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,611
You won't believe
what's up with Leslie.

176
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,339
<i>Since you agreed to wear
the puffy shirt on Today...</i>

177
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:20,144
...she's getting all these orders
from boutiques and department stores.

178
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,452
Since I what?

179
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,655
- Agreed to wear the puffy shirt.
- What are you talking about?

180
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,061
<i>You said that you would agree to wear
the puffy shirt on the Today show.</i>

181
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,533
- This?
- Yeah.

182
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,738
- I agreed to wear this?
- Yeah, yeah.

183
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,011
Well, when did I do that?

184
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,378
When we went to dinner
the other night.

185
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,714
What, are you crazy?

186
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,657
What were you talking about
when I went to the bathroom?

187
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,157
I don't know.
I couldn't understand a word she said.

188
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,319
- I was just nodding.
- There you go.

189
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,462
Where I go?

190
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,362
You mean she was asking me
to wear this ridiculous shirt...

191
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,062
- ...on national TV, and I said yes?
- Yes, yes. You said it.

192
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,003
I didn't know what she was
talking about. I couldn't hear her.

193
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:21,010
- Well, she asked you.
- I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV.

194
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,512
I mean, look at it. It looks ridiculous.

195
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,506
Well, you gotta wear it now.

196
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,243
All those stores are stocking it...

197
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,854
...based on the condition
you'll wear this on the show.

198
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,684
The factory in New Jersey
is already making them.

199
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,292
They're making these?

200
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,951
Yes, yes.

201
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,222
This pirate trend
she's come up with, Jerry...

202
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,298
This is gonna be
the new look for the '90s.

203
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,298
You're gonna be the first pirate.

204
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,903
But I don't wanna be a pirate.

205
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:55,212
I knew it. I knew it. I always knew
you had beautiful hands.

206
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,609
I used to tell people-

207
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,410
Frank, didn't I use to
talk about his hands?

208
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,076
Who the hell did you ever
mention his hands to?

209
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,119
I mentioned his hands
to plenty of people.

210
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,655
You never mentioned them to me.

211
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,359
Hand me an emery board.

212
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,629
I always talk about your hands,
how they're so soft and milky white.

213
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:19,794
- No, you never said milky white.
- I said milky white!

214
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,809
Scissor.

215
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,446
Don't hand them to me
with the point facing out!

216
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,311
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

217
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,454
I'll try to be more careful.

218
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,420
I hope so.

219
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,925
Georgie-

220
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,657
Georgie, would you like
some Jell-O?

221
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,268
Why'd you put
the bananas in there?

222
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,964
- George likes the bananas!
- So let him have bananas on the side!

223
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,737
All right, please. Please,
I cannot have this constant bickering.

224
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,375
Stress is very damaging
to the epidermis.

225
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,912
I have an important
photo session in the morning.

226
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,214
My hands have got to be
in tiptop shape.

227
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,847
So, please, keep the television down
and the conversation to a minimum.

228
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,160
But, Georgie,
what about the Jell-O?

229
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,459
I'll take it in my room.

230
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,303
Yeah, come in.

231
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,465
Wanted to let you know
he's got five minutes.

232
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,372
Yep, yep.

233
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,737
Jerry, five minutes.

234
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,920
Now, that's a great-looking shirt.

235
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,221
Aye, captain. Yeah.

236
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,991
See, I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect.

237
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,067
Look at it. It's fantastic.

238
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,000
Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?
I can't wear this.

239
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,902
Hey, this looks better
than anything you own.

240
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:07,671
In two months' time, everybody's
gonna be wearing the pirate look.

241
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,510
- Yeah.
- Hi, Kramer. I just saw Bryant Gumbel.

242
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,621
- He said he might help at the benefit.
- Great.

243
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,655
- What is that?
- It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, huh?

244
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,767
What do you think?
Is it cool or what?

245
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,233
- Why are you wearing this now?
- Why am I wearing it now?

246
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,567
I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now.

247
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,267
Because the low-talker
asked me to, that's why.

248
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:44,144
And I said yes. Do you know why?
Because I couldn't hear her.

249
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,950
When did she-?
When did she ask you this?

250
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,213
At dinner,
when Kramer went to the bathroom.

251
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,380
- I didn't hear anything.
- Of course not!

252
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,220
Nobody hears anything
when this woman speaks.

253
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,057
Well, you can't wear that
on the show.

254
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,788
- Elaine, you wanna stop it?
- What-?

255
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,257
What? No, Jerry,
you are promoting a benefit...

256
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:07,565
...to clothe homeless people.

257
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,802
You can't come out
dressed like that.

258
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,207
You're all puffed up.

259
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,412
You look like
the Count of Monte Cristo.

260
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,308
I have to wear it.
The woman has orders for this shirt...

261
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,477
- ...based on me wearing it on TV.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,418
They're producing them
as we speak.

263
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,582
Yeah, but you're supposed to be
a compassionate person...

264
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,591
...that cares about poor people.

265
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,925
You look like you're gonna swing in
on a chandelier.

266
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,901
Okay, let's go.

267
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,497
Is that what you're wearing?

268
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,172
I've never seen
hands like these before.

269
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,871
They're so soft and milky white.

270
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,540
You know whose hands
they remind me of?

271
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,983
Ray McKigney.

272
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,952
- Ray.
- He was it.

273
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,752
Who was he?

274
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,984
The most exquisite hands
you've ever seen.

275
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,526
Oh, he had it all.

276
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,629
What happened to him?

277
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,897
Tragic story, I'm afraid.

278
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,667
He could've had
any woman in the world...

279
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,539
...but none could match the beauty
of his own hand.

280
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,444
And that became his one true love.

281
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,348
- You mean...
- Yes.

282
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,620
He was not master of his domain.

283
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,290
- But how...?
- The muscles...

284
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,062
...became so strained
with overuse...

285
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,400
...that eventually the hand locked
into a deformed position...

286
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,542
...and he was left
with nothing but a claw.

287
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,004
He traveled the world
seeking a cure.

288
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,310
Acupuncturists, herbalists, swamis.

289
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,747
Nothing helped.

290
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,185
Towards the end,
his hands became so frozen...

291
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,291
...he was unable
to manipulate utensils...

292
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,691
...and was dependent
on Cub Scouts to feed him.

293
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:16,434
I hadn't seen another pair of hands
like Ray McKigney's until today.

294
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,797
You are his successor.

295
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,930
I only hope you have
a little more self-control.

296
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,837
You don't have to worry about me.

297
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,581
I won a contest.

298
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,290
Okay, let's get to work.

299
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:48,132
Back now, 7:46. On Tuesday
the 19th, here in New York...

300
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,564
...there'll be a benefit
for Goodwill Industries...

301
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,864
...a used-clothing organization
that provides services to the needy.

302
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,166
One of the performers
will be Jerry Seinfeld.

303
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,673
- Jerry, good morning.
- Thank you, Bryant.

304
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,712
Speaking of clothing, that is a very,
very unusual shirt you have on.

305
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,413
Yeah.

306
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,247
You're all kind of-
Kind of puffed up.

307
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,584
- Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
- You look kind of like a pirate.

308
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,724
Like a pirate.

309
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,386
Anyway, you know, we're hoping
to raise enough money-

310
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,296
Do you know-? You know- Look,
I'm sorry, it is just a very unusual shirt.

311
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,666
It could be a whole new look for you.
You could put a patch over an eye.

312
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,673
- You could be the pirate comedian.
- Yeah.

313
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,808
- Will you wear the puffy shirt at the-?
- Look, it's not my shirt.

314
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,005
- Whose shirt is it?
- What's the difference?

315
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,547
I agreed to wear it.

316
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,914
It's a puffy shirt.
I feel ridiculous in it.

317
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,682
I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever
seen, to be perfectly honest with you.

318
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,122
You bastard!

319
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,357
- Did you hear that?
- That I heard.

320
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,434
All right, a little to the left.

321
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,263
Little higher. Good, perfect.

322
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,564
- Like that?
- Just like that. Hold it. Good.

323
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,038
Okay, let me get one more.
One more. Good.

324
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,109
That's it. You're done.

325
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,007
- That's it?
- That's it.

326
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,410
And here's your check.

327
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,948
Thank you very much.
It was an honor.

328
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,779
Thank you.

329
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,484
It was great working with you.
Your hands are beautiful.

330
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,064
Thank you very much.

331
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,893
You know, I was wondering...

332
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,434
...if you're not doing anything later,
maybe you'd like to get together.

333
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,751
You ruined me!
You ruined my career!

334
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,410
Oh, just keep your voice down,
everyone can hear you.

335
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,987
Well, I don't give a damn!

336
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,182
If you talked this loud to begin with,
I wouldn't be in this costume.

337
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,853
Hey, hey. You can't believe this.
Look at this check.

338
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,555
They said I had the most
beautiful hands they ever saw...

339
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:04,725
...except for this McKigney guy. This
girl gave me her number. I got it all.

340
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,632
I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting.

341
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,000
I've never noticed your hands before,
let me see.

342
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,039
All right.

343
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,379
Yeah. Real nice.

344
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,311
Nice shirt.

345
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,517
What is this? Is this what
you wore on the show?

346
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,818
- Yeah.
- Have you completely lost your mind?

347
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,722
- Hey.
- Who's dressing you?

348
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,125
You look like a complete idiot.

349
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,662
I wouldn't wipe my-

350
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,941
- You ready?
- Yeah.

351
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,978
Hot, hot.

352
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,116
- I'm sorry.
- McKigney had a few good years.

353
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,316
How do you forget
to turn off an iron?

354
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,050
I was excited Jerry was putting on
the puffy shirt.

355
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,717
My whole life is ruined
because of the puffy shirt.

356
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,797
It didn't do me any good either. That
benefit was the worst show I ever did.

357
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,457
Some of those heckles
were really uncalled for.

358
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:14,128
"Avast ye, matey"?
What the hell does that mean?

359
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,103
"Twenty degrees
off the starboard side.

360
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,176
It's a Spanish galleon."
There's no comeback for that.

361
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,836
Well, it got me fired
from the benefit committee.

362
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,848
You know, all those stores
canceled out on her.

363
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,508
She's finished.

364
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,916
- We're finished.
- Really? What happened?

365
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:34,422
I just can't be with someone
whose life is in complete disarray.

366
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,428
- What happened to all the shirts?
- They gave them to Goodwill.

367
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,700
Puffy shirt. Puffy shirt.

368
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,269
Can you spare a little change
for an old buccaneer?

369
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,213
You know, it's really not
a bad-looking shirt.

370
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:11,693
Why do we always have to say,
"Excuse me"...

371
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,797
...when we can't hear
what someone's saying?

372
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,661
Why are we so guilty and so-?
"Excuse me.

373
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,327
Pardon me. I'm sorry."
Why can't, just once, I go:

374
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,030
"Nope. Not loud enough"?

375
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,199
Why can't I do that?

376
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,939
Just once I would
like to have the guts...

377
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,907
...you know, to make that judgment.

378
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,349
Someone mumbles something,
and you go, "Your fault.

379
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,012
I'm not sorry,
because it's your fault."
