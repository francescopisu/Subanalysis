1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,262
You can tell the best year
of your father's life.

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,006
Because they freeze that clothing style
and just ride it out to the end.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,166
It's not like they don't
continue shopping.

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,006
It's just they somehow manage
to find new old clothes.

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,043
Every father is like
this fashion time capsule.

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,276
It's like they should be
on a pedestal...

7
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:22,853
...with someone next to them going,
"This was 1965."

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,414
To me, the worst thing
is shopping for pants.

9
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,184
I hate undressing
in the little room.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,056
What men need is a place
to shop where you go in...

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,825
...check your pants at the door
and walk around in your underwear.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,969
That would be best. Then you'd
really have to lie to the salesman.

13
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,503
"Need some help?"
"No, just getting some air."

14
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,212
How would you describe
the smell in this house?

15
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,612
Dandruff?

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,984
Yeah, that's part of it. Kasha?

17
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,848
- There's some kasha.
- Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs...

18
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,959
...cheap carpeting.
It's potpourri, really.

19
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,358
- All right, let's go. Come on.
- You're going?

20
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:08,058
Yeah. We shouldn't have bowled
that last game. I'm gonna be late.

21
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,902
These aren't candies, are they?

22
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,097
Did you use those?
These are guest soaps.

23
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,003
Well, I'm a guest.

24
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,640
Now my parents are gonna know
I had people over.

25
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,006
You're not allowed?

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,081
I can't have any parties
while they're out of town.

27
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,046
This is a party?

28
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,676
Not anymore. Come on, get your ball.
We're leaving. Let's go.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,223
- Who put this cup on the new table?
- I was having coffee.

30
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,089
- I put it on the coffee table.
- But you didn't use a coaster!

31
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,025
You left a stain!

32
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,563
Whoa, boy, there's always one
at every party, huh?

33
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,827
Come on.

34
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,437
- What's the big rush?
- I'm having people over.

35
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,801
- Who?
- The girls, for poker night.

36
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,466
You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona-

37
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,111
Winona's gonna be there?

38
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,708
Yeah. And she broke up
with the vitamin guy.

39
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,646
- Really?
- I'll put in a good word for you.

40
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,877
Thanks. Because
I would really like-

41
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:04,181
- All right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- This not coming out.

42
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,884
- Just put a coffee-table book over it.
- My parents don't read.

43
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,188
They'll wonder what a book
is doing on the table.

44
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,730
Hey. You know what would make
a great coffee-table book?

45
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,994
A coffee-table book
about coffee tables.

46
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,270
Get it?

47
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,498
- Got it. Come on, let's go.
- Wait. Not so fast.

48
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,075
Jerry, you gotta take me
to get this thing refinished.

49
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,236
- Now?
- Yes, now. It'll take a few days...

50
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,075
...and my parents will be back.
I gotta have it before then.

51
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,613
Jerry, you promised
you'd get me home by 7.

52
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,219
- We'll take the subway.
- That'll get you home in time.

53
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,856
- The subway? From Queens?
- Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.

54
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,049
I'm sorry, Elaine,
I'll make it up to you.

55
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,592
I need something to read
on the subway.

56
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,492
<i>- Here, read this.
- TV Guide?</i>

57
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,970
Like a history of coffee tables.
Celebrities and their coffee tables.

58
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:57,007
It's a natural. This is a story
that must be told.

59
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,704
So you're gonna talk to your boss
about it, huh?

60
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,347
- First thing in the morning.
- Yes indeed.

61
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,848
<i>- Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.
- Queensborough Plaza.</i>

62
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,483
This stop is famous for its gyros.
You want one?

63
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,518
How will you get something
and get back on the train in time?

64
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,058
Well, they got a stand right out
on the platform.

65
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,219
The gyros are cooked, wrapped
and ready to go.

66
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,456
Three dollars, no change.

67
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,259
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

68
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,664
All right. But no bites.

69
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,939
Highlighter?

70
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,204
- Excuse me?
- To highlight the programs...

71
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,348
...you plan to watch.

72
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,284
- Look, really, I'm just trying to read.
- Fine, okay.

73
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,150
It's just I've never seen...

74
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,384
<i>...a beautiful lady
reading the Guide...</i>

75
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,955
...so far away from a TV.

76
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,399
You must really like television.

77
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,828
Elaine!

78
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,778
Guess your boyfriend
will have to catch the next train.

79
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,777
- He's not my boyfriend.
- He's not?

80
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,417
Interesting.

81
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,857
Maybe I should get
Elaine something.

82
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,026
- Why?
- Well, I didn't drive her home.

83
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,185
Plus, I give her a gift
in front of Winona...

84
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,957
- ...how does that hurt me?
- Can't hurt you.

85
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,391
What about this thing?

86
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,570
The Indian?

87
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,797
Yeah, you know,
kind of a peace offering.

88
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,702
It's cute.

89
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,675
Well, I can have the table ready
for you on Monday.

90
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,007
All right, but no later.
My parents are coming back.

91
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,477
They left you home alone, huh?

92
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,255
Okay, see,
on this particular Tuesday...

93
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,358
...you could have watched
six hours of Lucy.

94
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,398
<i>There's I Love Lucy...</i>

95
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,299
<i>...The Lucy Show...</i>

96
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,406
<i>...Here's Lucy.</i>

97
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,312
It's my stop.

98
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,679
Bye-bye.

99
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,610
Hey, miss, you forgot this.

100
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,194
They don't make these anymore.
The work is all done by hand.

101
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,926
It takes years and years. Sylvia.

102
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,332
For crying out loud,
you're 45 minutes late.

103
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,199
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,671
Is that your car out there?

105
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,301
- No, it's his.
- Oh, nice.

106
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,674
You guys are obviously
from Manhattan.

107
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,884
Well, he is. I live around the corner.

108
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,417
Really?

109
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,748
I didn't think any cool guys
lived in this neighborhood.

110
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,457
Well, they do now.

111
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,422
The neighborhood's changing.

112
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,896
- All right, I'll take it.
- Smart choice.

113
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,731
You bought the Indian?
Oh, you guys have great taste.

114
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,872
Well, we're collectors.

115
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,905
We see objects of great beauty...

116
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,740
...and we must have them.

117
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,321
Bluffed you out, jack. Pair of deuces.

118
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,894
- Who is it?
- It's Jerry.

119
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,965
- Jerry.
- Surprise!

120
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,893
What is this?

121
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,302
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon,
so I got you something.

122
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,238
Oh, you did?
Do you guys all know Jerry?

123
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,604
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi. Hi, Winona.

124
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,005
Nice to see you again.

125
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,409
- Elaine, is it your birthday?
- No.

126
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,519
I don't need a reason to give gifts.

127
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,713
It's my nature.
I love to make people happy.

128
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,325
Oh, that is so sweet.

129
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,960
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,767
It's a cigar-store Indian.

131
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,133
Read the card.

132
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,438
That's very nice.
Thank you very much.

133
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,378
- Read it out loud.
- I don't think so.

134
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,108
We had a little fight this afternoon.

135
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,223
"Let's bury the hatchet.
We smokem peace pipe."

136
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,450
You know, it's late.
I really should go.

137
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,254
I don't blame you, Winona. I-

138
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,605
Are you out of your mind?

139
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,273
It's kitschy.

140
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,069
Winona is a Native American.

141
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,472
She is?

142
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,085
You've got very unusual taste.

143
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,655
I hope prune juice is all right.

144
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:19,155
- It's the only thing that was chilled.
- Oh, that's fine.

145
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,495
I'm sorry about that lock
on the liquor cabinet.

146
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,160
The combination must have
just flown out of my head.

147
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a mental block.

148
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,268
Is this your son
in the bubble bath?

149
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,903
No, that's me.

150
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,449
You don't see too many guys
your age...

151
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,552
...who keep baby pictures
of themselves around.

152
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,210
I like it.

153
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,482
It's consistent with the rest
of the house.

154
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,591
Yes, it is consistent.

155
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,160
I've tried to maintain a consistent feel
throughout the house.

156
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,130
- What is this we're listening to?
- The Ray Conniff Singers.

157
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,506
What's that smell? Kasha?

158
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,945
It's a potpourri. May I...?

159
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,041
May I show you
the master bedroom?

160
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,048
<i>- Who is it?
- Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

161
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,690
Yeah?

162
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,421
<i>Listen, I really felt bad
about what happened.</i>

163
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,961
I'd really like to apologize.
Could I come up?

164
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,990
I'll come down.

165
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,036
- I came by to get my ball.
- It's right over there.

166
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,535
Yeah, thanks.

167
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,469
Yeah, it's got the magic grip.

168
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,075
How do you think
I bowled that 220 today, huh?

169
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,843
Yo.

170
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,548
- Where did this come from?
- Do you want it?

171
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,544
- I can have this?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,484
- You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
- Oh, I'll lug.

173
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,254
It's just that it's
a very sensitive issue for me.

174
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,623
And well it should be. I think
if you spent any time with me at all...

175
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,594
...you'd see I'm very sensitive
to these matters as well.

176
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,926
You wouldn't be hungry
by any chance, would you?

177
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,261
I could go for a bite.

178
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,303
Do you like Chinese food?
I went to a Szechwan restaurant...

179
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,032
...in this neighborhood.
I don't remember the address.

180
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,768
Excuse me, you must know
where the Chinese restaurant is.

181
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,844
Why must I know?
Because I'm Chinese?

182
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,607
You think I know where
all the Chinese restaurants are?

183
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,945
Oh, ask honorable Chinaman
for location of restaurant.

184
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,213
I thought because you're the mailman
you would know the neighborhood.

185
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:28,452
<i>Oh, hello, American Joe, which way
to hamburger/hot-dog stand?</i>

186
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,886
- I didn't know-
- You know what, it's late.

187
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,624
- I should probably just go home.
- I had no idea-

188
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,836
Hey, Jerry, look what I got.

189
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,906
He-

190
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,818
- Looks pretty good.
- Yeah, did a good job.

191
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,186
- I don't think they'll be able to tell.
- You know, I don't get it.

192
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,920
I'm not allowed to ask a Chinese
person where a Chinese restaurant is?

193
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,690
I mean, aren't we all getting
a little too sensitive?

194
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,358
Somebody asks me which way
is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.

195
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,940
- Anyway, what's the status with...?
- Well, she kind of calmed down.

196
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,601
I'm gonna see her tonight.

197
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,975
- Oh, great.
- Yeah. But I'm a little uncomfortable.

198
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,174
- I'm afraid to make another mistake.
- Come on.

199
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,613
Hello, hello.

200
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,247
- Hey, you're home.
- Hello, Georgie.

201
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,259
- The house looks very nice.
- Yeah, huh?

202
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,952
- Where's the mail?
- Hello, Jerry.

203
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,892
- Hello.
- So how was the trip?

204
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,532
Oh, your father.

205
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,069
Is there anything wrong with
getting a receipt at a tollbooth?

206
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,607
I'm going upstairs.

207
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,902
<i>This stack should be bigger.
Where's the TV Guide?</i>

208
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,647
<i>- What TV Guide?
- I'm missing TV Guide.</i>

209
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,479
Volume 41, number 31.

210
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,618
Elaine took it to read
on the subway.

211
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,020
- Elaine took it?
- I didn't know she took it.

212
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,455
Well, it's two weeks old.

213
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,595
<i>How could you let her take
the TV Guide?!</i>

214
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,828
He collects them.

215
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,261
<i>You collect TV Guide?</i>

216
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,698
The nerve of that woman.

217
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,738
Walking into my house,
stealing my collectibles.

218
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,966
Oh, my God!

219
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,577
This was in our bed.

220
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,112
What is this?

221
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,976
A prophylactic rubber?

222
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,081
What is this doing on my bed?

223
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,691
I don't know.

224
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,464
I'll see you later.

225
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,441
You were having sex on our bed?

226
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,212
Yes.

227
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,543
Who told you you could have sex
in our bed?

228
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,120
- Well, my bed is too small.
- Your bed is too small?

229
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,019
I'm gone two weeks,
and you turn our house...

230
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,319
...into Bourbon Street?

231
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,094
Where am I going to sleep?

232
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,691
- What are you talking about?
- I can't sleep in there.

233
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,959
- Of course you can.
- I can't.

234
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,966
I can't!

235
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,406
That's it.

236
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,304
You're grounded.

237
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,415
You can't ground me.
I'm a grown man.

238
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,079
You wanna live here...

239
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,983
...you respect the rules of our house.
You're grounded!

240
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,755
So where are we gonna go eat?

241
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,725
I thought we'd eat
at the Gentle Harvest.

242
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,955
I love that place,
but it's usually so crowded.

243
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,930
- Can we get a table?
- Oh, don't worry. I made reser-

244
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,338
- You made what?
- I...

245
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,239
I arranged for the appropriate
accommodations.

246
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,477
And then...

247
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,207
...Knick tickets. Floor seats.

248
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,047
- How did you get these?
- Got them on the street from a scal-

249
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,756
From who?

250
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,992
One of those guys.

251
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,364
- What guys?
- You know, the guys...

252
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,126
...that they sell the tickets
to the sold-out events.

253
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,327
<i>Wait a second. You've got
the Mark McEwen TV Guide.</i>

254
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,207
- That's Al Roker.
- They're both chubby weathermen.

255
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,538
I get Dom DeLuise
and Paul Prudhomme mixed up too.

256
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,441
- Could I have this?
- Sure, take it.

257
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,876
Thanks.

258
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,779
<i>So Winona had the TV Guide.
Told you I'd make it up to you.</i>

259
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,250
- Mr. Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
- Yeah.

260
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,913
You almost ruined his life's work.

261
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,520
- He collects these?
- Yeah.

262
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,597
All right, well, I will personally
go out to Queens...

263
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,034
<i>...and deliver his Al Roker
TV Guide to him.</i>

264
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,071
What did you do
with the one you took?

265
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,965
I don't know.

266
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,851
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

267
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,988
Yeah. Elaine, what did-?
What did he say, huh?

268
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,783
- What did who say?
- Your boss.

269
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,586
Didn't you tell him
about the coffee-table book?

270
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:36,264
- Yeah, you didn't tell him, did you?
- Kramer, it is such a dumb idea.

271
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,528
- I'd be totally embarrassed-
- Wait a minute-

272
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,140
- I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
- I thought it was a pretty good idea.

273
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,435
It's about coffee tables,
it's on a coffee table.

274
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,706
Yeah, right. And on the cover
is a built-in coaster.

275
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,176
- All right, I'm gonna go.
- Where are you going?

276
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,789
I'm gonna go to the cigar stores.
I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.

277
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,118
- My Indian?
- I think it's worth something.

278
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,919
It's kitschy.

279
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,535
<i>How do you just walk into a house
and take a TV Guide?</i>

280
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,208
How does she expect you
to watch TV?

281
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,843
Am I just supposed to turn it on...

282
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,571

around the dial?

00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,818
Hello. Is Elaine home?

Elaine Benes?

285
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,555
Oh, she's my son's friend.

286
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,987
And she's not welcome
in this house.

287
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,787
Because I made her
this very special gift, okay?

288
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,695
<i>It's a bouquet of paper
from her TV Guide.</i>

289

<i>That's my TV Guide,
ripped to shreds!</i>

290
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,266

I like your place.
It's very unassuming.

296
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,169
Well, why would I assume?
I never assume.

297
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,332
It leads to assumptions.

298
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,977
<i>Oh, by the way, that TV Guide
I gave you, I need it back.</i>

299
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,042
- Why?
- I'm doing a report...

300
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,514
...on minorities in the media, and I
wanted to use the Al Roker interview.

301
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,711
It's too late. I gave it to Elaine
to give to George's father.

302
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,881
Jerry, I really need it back.
It is mine.

303
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,859
You can't give something and then
take it back. I mean, what are you, a-?

304
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,894
What?

305
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,595
- A person that...
- A person that what?

306
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,796
Well, a person that gives something
and then they're dissatisfied...

307
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:58,067
...and they wish they had never
given it to the person...

308
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:02,509
- ...that they originally gave it to.
- You mean, like an Indian giver?

309
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,080
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar
with that term.

310
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,501
I like the special fall preview issues
the best.

311
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,305
Those. I've been saving those
from the beginning.

312
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,873
These are worth, like,
a lot of money.

313
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,441
- Oh, hello, Elaine.
- Hello.

314
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,449
Elaine. Hello.

315
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,118
You look scrumptious.

316
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,515
<i>Why'd you take my TV Guide?</i>

317
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,322
I'm so sorry about that,
Mr. Costanza. But look, look.

318
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,796
- I brought you another one.
- I made this for you.

319
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,958
Thank you.

320
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,002

You got stains all over it.

321
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,764
What the hell did you do?

322
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,841
- Hey, you can't talk to her like that.
- I'll talk to her any way I want.

323
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,672
Come on, Elaine. Let's go.

324
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,240
My coffee table!

325
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,785
I don't understand. How can you have
a cigar store without an Indian?

326
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,547
It's unseemly.

327
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,522
- I'll give you a box of coronas for it.
- Forget it.

328
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,185
Excuse me, are you selling
this Indian?

329
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,527
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- I'm just redecorating my office...

330
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,396
...in a southwestern motif,
and this would be perfect.

- Giddyup.

00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,607
Yeah? Could you help me
bring it up to my office?

00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,382
Mr. Lippman, I'm sorry.
I was in Queens-

336
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,556
- Kramer.
- Yeah. Hi, Elaine.

337
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,587
What are you doing
in here with that?

338
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,195
Well, it's a business transaction.

339
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,025
Listen, petty cash
just had 10s and 20s.

340
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,031
- Go ahead. Count it.
- Yeah.

341
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,193
I'm sure it's all here.

342
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,998
I was just admiring
your coffee table out in the hall.

343
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,640
You like that, huh?

344
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,708
I had that custom-made
for me in Santa Fe.

345
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,971
- You mind if I use it in my book?
- What book?

346
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,207
Well, I'm doing a coffee-table book
on coffee tables.

347
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,249
About coffee tables?

348
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,320
That's fantastic.

349
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,421
- Who's your publisher?
- I'm still shopping it around.

350
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,419
Yeah? You see?

351
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,257
This is the kind of idea
you should be coming in with.

352
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,764
What the hell do you do
around here all day anyway?

353
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:41,668
- Well, I read manuscripts-
- The Indian really completes the room.

354
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,569
Don't you think?

355
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,643
I know this coffee table.
It's George Costanza's.

356
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,579
It's mine. I'm his mother.

357
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,478
Oh, I haven't seen George for a while.
He must be working very hard.

358
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,486
George doesn't work.

359
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,386
He's a bum.

360
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,254
That's why he lives at home with us.

361
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,086
He does?

362
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,867
<i>I don't know why we think of this.
We just could call TV Guide.</i>

363
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,434
I don't know.

364
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,037
Well, it's going to make
Mr. Costanza very happy.

365
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,740
I guess.

366
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,501
- What's the matter?
- What do you think is the matter?

367
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:22,636
I've been assigned to work
on Kramer's coffee-table book.

368
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,112
It is a good idea, Elaine.

369
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,718
<i>Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.</i>

370
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,150
- Do you want a gyro?
- I don't think so.

371
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,286
Elaine!

372
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:42,462
Well, I guess your boyfriend's
gonna have to catch the next train.

373
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,895
- He's not my boyfriend.
- He's not?

374
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,595
Interesting.

375
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,588
<i>I was always excited as a kid when
that new TV Guide would come.</i>

376
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,587
When that front cover
is nice and flat...

377
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,454
...it seems like there's
good, fresh TV shows.

378
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,096
Then as the week goes by,
you start to hate the TV.

379
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,824
All the shows stink.
Everything's getting all crumpled...

380
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,560
...and ripped from being sat on,
thrown across the room.

381
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,296
<i>TV Guide's always thrown,
never handed to another person.</i>

382
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,201
It's the world's most thrown
reading material.

383
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,344
<i>"Where's the TV Guide?"
"There it is."</i>

384
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,912
<i>In the back of the TV Guide,
they have a phone number.</i>

385
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,676
Ninety-five cents a minute,
they'll give you the answers...

386
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,581
<i>...to the TV Guide
crossword puzzle.</i>

387
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,322
<i>My question is if you can't do
the TV Guide crossword puzzle...</i>

388
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,585
...where are you coming
across 95 cents?
