1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,664
As humans, we need training
in social skills...

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,068
...conversational distance.

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,709
Don't you hate these people
that talk into your mouth...

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,072
...like you're a clown
at a drive-through?

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,543
And handshakes is the worst.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,239
There's absolutely no guidelines
for handshakes.

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,544
You know how many people-?
Too strong, too weak.

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,947
Sometimes they give you...

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,248
...the three-quarter handshake,
just the fingers.

10
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,981
Early release, late release.

11
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,718
Sometimes people
will dispute your release.

12
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,385
You've let go. They're hanging on.

13
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:34,294
I have actually said to people,
"Hey, the handshake is over."

14
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,136
Too many pumps,
coming in too high...

15
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,705
...too sweaty, from too far away.

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,810
Sometimes a guy will give you
a strong grip, late release...

17
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,310
...and pull you in for the
too-close conversation.

18
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,246
To him I say,
"That's three strikes. You're out."

19
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,088
You know, the timing
couldn't be worse.

20
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,817
Is there a good time to have
your parents stay with you?

21
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,896
I haven't been together
with Rachel for three weeks.

22
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,861
First I was on the road,
then my parents show up.

23
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,161
I'm getting a little backed up.

24
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,763
- When are they leaving for Paris?
- Not for three days.

25
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,466
- What about her place?
- She lives with her parents.

26
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,941
Really?

27
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,673
Maybe this will become, like,
a cool thing, living with your parents.

28
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,646
Then maybe baldness
will catch on.

29
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,446
Things will all be turning your way.

30
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,284
Hey, believe me,
baldness will catch on.

31
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,655
When the aliens come, who do
you think they're gonna relate to?

32
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,195
Who do you think's gonna be
getting tour of the ship?

33
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,059
The baldies.

34
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,667
My parents want your parents
over for dinner.

35
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,134
Good. I get the apartment
for at least one night.

36
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,297
I'm paying for this Paris trip.
It's their anniversary present.

37
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,034
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Alec.

38
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,701
- Hey, Alec.
- This is Joey.

39
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,211
- Hey, Joey, how are you doing?
- Hey, listen...

40
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,214
...I was wondering if you'd be
interested in doing some work...

41
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,683
...for the Big Brother program.
I'm kind of running the local chapter.

42
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,580
What do you say, George?

43
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,849
- Well...
- Wouldn't you...

44
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,257
...like to be a Big Brother
to someone like me?

45
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,398
Please?

46
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,226
Well...

47
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,935
...sure, Joey, sure.

48
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,570
I would be thrilled.

49
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,037
That's great. Thanks.
I'll get in touch with you.

50
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,005
Wouldn't you like to be
a Big Brother-?

51
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,644
All right, Joey. That's enough.

52
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,211
Let's go. See you.

53
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,282
- What happened?
- What could I do?

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,475
Did you see the mug on that kid?

55
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,954
Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup
to someone like me?

56
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,157
Please?

57
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,990
Have you noticed they moved...

58
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,958
<i>...where they do the interview
on Jeopardy?</i>

59
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,188
Yeah. It was in the middle
of Single Jeopardy.

60
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,357
- Now it's after Single Jeopardy.
- Yeah. It's much better, isn't it?

61
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,832
Oh, no comparison.

62
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,904
I gotta get my parents one
of those French-English dictionaries.

63
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,373
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

64
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,738
Your parents are going
to Paris, right?

65
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,244
- Yeah.
- So I tell Alec...

66
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,440
...that I have to go to Paris
for an undetermined amount of time.

67
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,585
Then all I have to do
is buy postcards...

68
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,278
...and have your parents
mail them from Paris.

69
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,923
- What about little Joey?
- Who?

70
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,926
- He's probably better off.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,224
I'm trying to get out
of this Big Brother program.

72
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,128
When you get to Paris,
drop them in any mailbox.

73
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:25,260
- But there are no stamps on these.
- You gotta buy French stamps.

74
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,837
I'll reimburse you, of course.

75
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,372
Why are you doing this?

76
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,339
He wants this guy
to think he's in Paris.

77
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,739
- Why?
- Because George...

78
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,743
...is a deeply disturbed individual.

79
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,352
Oh, hey, Helen. Could I use
some more of your hand lotion?

80
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,479
I told you it was good. It's from
the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami.

81
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,419
I'll remember that
if I'm ever in Florida.

82
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,119
Yeah, or if ever on Fifth Avenue
here in New York City.

83
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,991
- You can get some there.
- Yeah?

84
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,259
Say, those are nice pants.
I got a pair just like them at home.

85
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,699
That doesn't surprise me.
I bought these at Rudy's.

86
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,601
It's a used clothing store.
See, when people like you die...

87
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,208
...the widows,
they bring in their wardrobes.

88
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,470
- They make a bundle.
- Really?

89
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,683
My father's got a ton of old clothes
just sitting up in the attic.

90
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,318
- You think they're worth something?
- If they're vintage.

91
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,919
And you're a widow.

92
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,919
What happens if the husband dies
after the wife?

93
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,527
- Who brings the clothing in then?
- I suppose the children do.

94
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,963
Yes, I suppose they do.

95
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,791
All right. I got a 10:00.
I'll see everybody later.

96
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,375
Hey, I just remembered...

97
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,515
...my parents wanna have you
over for dinner before you leave.

98
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,674
- What about tonight?
- Tonight?

99
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,649
Yeah. They're making paella.

100
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,881
I don't think we can make it tonight.
We have plans.

101
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,617
- What plans?
- We have plans.

102
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,787
- Where did you get plans?
- We have plans.

103
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,825
- Well, what about tomorrow night?
- Maybe.

104
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,769
Okay...

105
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,666
- ...I guess I'll tell them that.
- Okay.

106
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,174
- Hey, give them our best, though.
- Yeah.

107
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,310
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah.

108
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,344
- So, what plans do you have?
- None.

109
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,884
So how come you're not
going over there for dinner?

110
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,148
Jerry, we don't care much
for the Costanzas.

111
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,588
We can't stand them.

112
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,793
- Really? Since when?
- Since always.

113
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,226
- We've never liked them.
- Why?

114
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,457
Well, they're so loud.
They're always fighting.

115
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,295
It's uncomfortable.
You never noticed?

116
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,334
I noticed. But they're
from your age group.

117
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,028
I didn't think you could detect...

118
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,106
...abnormal behavior
among your own kind.

119
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,606
Well, we do.

120
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,443
<i>- Yeah?
- It's us.</i>

121
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,412
Oh, come on up.

122
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,521
- It's Elaine. You have any problem?
- We adore Elaine.

123
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,054
- She's with her new boyfriend.
- What's he like?

124
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,784
- He's nice. A bit of a close talker.
- A what?

125
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,224
You'll see.

126
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,456
I really had no idea that you felt
this way about the Costanzas.

127
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,795
They're exhausting.
It's like being in an asylum.

128
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,433
- Hi.
- Hi.

129
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,129
- There she is.
- Hello, Elaine.

130
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,639
Hi, Mrs. Seinfeld.

131
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,640
Oh, this is Aaron.

132
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,472
- Hello, Aaron.
- Hello.

133
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,443
How long are you folks in town?

134
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:28,144
Three more days. Three more days,
and then we're off to Paris.

135
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,619
We're going with a select
charter group.

136
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,315
I love France.
I was just there last year.

137
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,858
In fact...

138
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,393
...you know, I still have
an envelope full of French francs.

139
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,190
I'll give them to you.

140
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,999
We can't take money.

141
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,069
No. It's a gift. From us.

142
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,730
Oh, that is so nice, Aaron.

143
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,341
Isn't he nice?

144
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,569
Has Jerry been
showing you a good time?

145
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,474
No, I haven't.

146
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,672
You know, I have a friend...

147
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,182
...who works at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

148
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,217
How'd you like
a behind-the-scenes tour?

149
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,687
- Really? You could do that?
- Easily.

150
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,792
- It wouldn't be any trouble?
- Of course not.

151
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,360
- When could we go?
- How about right now?

152
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,293
- I'm ready.
- Are you sure?

153
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,695
- Yes!
- Okay, let me get my coat.

154
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,028
Elaine, what do you say?

155
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,433
Well, I don't think so, Aaron.

156
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,065
I have plans.

157
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,271
How about you, Jerry?

158
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,106
I'm swamped.

159
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,772
You sure? You can examine
the artwork up close.

160
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,711
Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.

161
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,384
Yeah, that will happen.

162
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,019
All right. We're off.

163
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,452
- Okay. Bye.
- Let's go.

164
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,353
Okay. Bye-bye.
Have a good time.

165
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,754
- Bye.
- See everybody later.

166
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,862
- Okay.
- Bye.

167
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,692
Why would he ask your parents
to go to a museum?

168
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,458
- I don't know.
- What is that?

169
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,534
Maybe he was just trying
to be nice.

170
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,365
Have you ever heard of anyone
doing anything like this?

171
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,599
Wait a second.
He just did me a big favor.

172
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,006
- What?
- He got them out of the house.

173
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,169
- What?
- I can call Rachel.

174
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,510
Oh, no. I got the machine.

175
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,616
Rachel are you there? I got
the place to myself for a few hours.

176
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,913
Rachel, where are you?

177
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,055
Rachel!

178
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,893
Sorry, pal. Wish I could
help you out.

179
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,198
- They're not coming?
- No. They had plans.

180
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,595
How could they have plans?

181
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,326
What difference does it make?

182
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,732
They wouldn't lie to us.

183
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,339
- They're our dear friends.
- What am I supposed to do...

184
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,840
- ...with all this paella?
- They said tomorrow, maybe.

185
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,035
- Maybe?
- Maybe they don't like us.

186
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,146
Why wouldn't they like us?

187
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,552
Again with the pepper? What do
you gotta use all that pepper for?

188
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,917
- Keep quiet.
- You trying to set my mouth on fire?

189
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,084
I don't know what
the reason could be.

190
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,760
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

191
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,264
What a day.

192
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,403
Jerry, you would not believe
the time we had.

193
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,198
Aaron is quite the tour guide.

194
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,739
Have you ever seen
those Impressionist paintings?

195
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,969
- Oh, sure, like Monet.
- Don't you think he had to be...

196
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,943
...nearsighted? Nobody would
paint like that if they could see.

197
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,605
It's all out of focus.

198
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,842
He's from the Impressionist school,
you know...

199
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,988
...like Monet, Manet,
Tippy-tippy-day-day.

200
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,885
I say that guy was painting
without his glasses.

201
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,857
Hello. Rachel.

202
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,961
Yeah.

203
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,291
No. They're back.

204
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,133
Jerry if you have something to do,
we can just sit right here and read.

205
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,434
Yes. Well...

206
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,941
...I'm sorry too.
Listen, I'll call you later.

207
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,903
Okay. Bye.

208
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,604
Well, I should be going.

209
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,579
Oh, thanks again.

210
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,047
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

211
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,016
- Hey.
- Oh, you must be Kramer.

212
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,122
I've heard about you.

213
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,853
Hey, you must be Aaron.
I've heard about you.

214
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,690
- Well, see you later.
- Yeah.

215
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,196
- Bye.
- Okay.

216
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,702
So, what are you guys
doing for dinner?

217
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,341
- We have no plans.
- Look at that, Helen.

218
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,103
Do you see what he's wearing?
That's the Executive.

219
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,611
- What is the Executive?
- The beltless trench coat.

220
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,715
- My father invented it.
- I sure did.

221
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,977
Raincoats were my business.
The Executive was a classic.

222
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,144
These haven't been made
in 20 years.

223
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,290
Why would they?
Nobody bought them then.

224
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,186
- He's wearing one.
- These are a hot item at Rudy's.

225
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,852
You don't say.

226
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,430
You know, I have boxes of those
sitting in my garage in Florida.

227
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,862
Get them up here.

228
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,730
You give me 25 percent,
I'll take care of everything.

229
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,134
- You got a deal.
- Yeah.

230
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,037
This is like the meeting
of Smith and Wesson.

231
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,674
I'll call Jack Klompus.
He's got a key to the garage.

232
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,579
- He can send them overnight delivery.
- You're gonna start shipping boxes?

233
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,085
- We're leaving for Paris in three days.
- He'll send them express.

234
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,985
- You're crazy.
- I'll tell you how crazy I am.

235
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,023
I'm paying for this trip
with these coats.

236
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,753
- I'm paying for the trip.
- So much the better.

237
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,465
Anyway, it's kind of a fluke thing...

238
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:12,627
...but I'll be leaving for Paris
in two days.

239
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,934
I will send you a postcard
when I get there.

240
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,941
- Paris, huh?
- Yeah.

241
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,138
You know, I feel terrible about Joey,
but it's a great business opportunity.

242
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,545
I don't even know how long
I'm gonna be away.

243
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,885
Where will you stay?

244
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,213
An apartment complex. The...

245
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,556
The Eiffel Towers.

246
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,660
Like I said, you'll be getting
a postcard in a few days...

247
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,525
...and again, I'm sorry.

248
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,269
George, you have no idea
how fantastic this is.

249
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,227
- Fantastic?
- Yeah.

250
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,164
We've been trying to reunite
Joey with his father...

251
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,603
...who lives in Paris.

252
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,005
But he's afraid to fly alone.
You know, he's kind of withdrawn...

253
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,944
...but he seems to take to you.

254
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:02,617
- So it's a perfect solution.
- Gee, what a coincidence.

255
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,147
And you'll send me a postcard.

256
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,792
Helen really seemed
to respond to Renoir.

257
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,665
I think she really connected
with the way he painted children.

258
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,397
And that Morty.

259
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,705
I'll tell you, that old guy's full of life.

260
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,542
He was convinced
Monet was nearsighted.

261
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,373
- I kept telling him-
- Aaron?

262
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,814
Yes?

263
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,611
Let me ask you a question.

264
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,215
How come you asked
Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld...

265
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,822
...to go to the museum with you?

266
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:43,527
Well, they were in from out of town.
I thought they'd enjoy it.

267
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,623
You didn't feel uncomfortable...

268
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,167
...spending the whole
day at the museum...

269
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,170
...with two complete strangers
who are more than twice your age?

270
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,830
No.

271
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,338
It was fun.

272
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,538
You had fun
with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld?

273
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,046
Yeah.

274
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,075
They bought me a Coke.

275
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,557
How'd you get the idea
for the beltless trench coat?

276
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,253
I came home one night,
and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys.

277
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,299
So I took out my belt,
just to threaten him...

278
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,492
...and I got a glimpse
of myself in the mirror.

279
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,398
- How serendipitous.
- So that night, I cut off the loops...

280
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,207
...and the Executive was born.

281
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,279
He also had an idea
for a brimless rain hat...

282
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,381
...but that never materialized.

283
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,074
All right, come on. Let's play.

284
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,015
- Did you call Jack Klompus?
- I haven't been able to reach him.

285
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,416
I'll call him right now.

286
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,113
- Oh, come on.
- Just a second.

287
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,485
<i>Jerry, have you seen
Schindler's List?</i>

288
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,594
- No, I haven't seen it yet.
- You have to go.

289
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,059
- I'm going.
- You have to.

290
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,527
Okay.

291
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,328
<i>- Hello, Jack?
- Yeah?</i>

292
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,435
- Jack, it's Morty.
- Who died?

293
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,507
Nobody died. Jack, I want you
to do me a big favor.

294
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,168
- In my garage are a couple of boxes.
- What boxes?

295
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:10,041
- I'm gonna explain what boxes.
- All right. How the hell do I know?

296
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,183
Anyway, there are
these three big boxes...

297
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,252
...you can't miss them, I want you
to ship them here to New York.

298
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,048
I thought you were going to Paris.

299
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,713
I'm still going to Paris.

300
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,688
I got a big deal cooking here.

301
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,393
- What's in the boxes?
- Raincoats.

302
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,824
Raincoats?

303
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,023
You think you're gonna sell
those old crappy raincoats?

304
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,428
That's garbage.

305
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,765
I guarantee you, Doris won't let him
mail those boxes.

306
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,304
- When do you want these?
- Send them tomorrow.

307
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,508
So you think
they're coming tonight?

308
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,612
I don't know. They said maybe.

309
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,941
Of course they're coming.
They're leaving soon.

310
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,051
- If they don't come, they won't see us.
- Well, they better come.

311
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,811
I got all this paella.

312
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,715
I admire Morty and Helen
going to France.

313
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,655
We should take a trip.

314
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,492
Maybe a cruise.

315
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,627
Yes, a cruise.

316
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,629
A long cruise.

317
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,062
Just the two of you.

318
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,898
Georgie, what were you doing
poking around the attic last night?

319
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,938
- I wasn't in the attic.
- I heard noise.

320
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,478
- Maybe it was a mouse.
- Okay, that's it! We're moving!

321
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,642
- What?
- I will not tolerate infestation.

322
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,846
You haven't even seen one.

323
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,049
Don't you understand?
The very thought, the very idea.

324
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,955
I'll never be comfortable again.

325
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,857
All right, Frank. That's enough.

326
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,696
I guess I've been hanging
onto them for so long...

327
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,337
...because I couldn't accept the fact
that Dad was really gone forever.

328
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,073
They will get a good home,
won't they?

329
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,717
I gotta be honest, there's nothing
here too spectacular.

330
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,648
Oh, I beg to differ.

331
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,715
My father took great pride
in his appearance.

332
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,119
He was a very handsome man,
a Casanova, really.

333
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,659
I'll give you $200
for the three boxes.

334
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,229
Could you make it 225?
That was his high game in bowling.

335
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,532
Yeah, I'm in a good mood. Here.

336
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,337
Thank you.

337
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,564
Hey, George.
What are you doing here?

338
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,413
I'm just selling some of Dad's things.
That's what he would have wanted.

339
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,480
Oh, I got you.

340
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,241
- That'll do.
- Hey, guess what.

341
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,717
Morty Seinfeld and I are going into
business together, selling raincoats.

342
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,652
- That's swell.
- We worked it out...

343
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,554
- ...all over dinner last night.
- Dinner?

344
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,522
- You had dinner with the Seinfelds?
- Yeah, last night.

345
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,594
Was this something
you had planned?

346
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,563
No, it was spur of the moment.

347
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,895
Well, you know Morty. He likes to fly
by the seat of his vintage pants.

348
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,071
They had plans, huh?
They had plans!

349
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,269
Boy, I've never seen these before.
They just came in.

350
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,971
Part of my springtime
cruise collection.

351
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,483
- Two for $25.
- Oh, I'll take these. Yeah.

352
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,451
Hey, remember this raincoat
that you sold me?

353
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,021
Sure. That's the Executive.

354
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,091
- Do you have any others?
- I wish. They don't make it anymore.

355
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,420
Suppose I told you I have 50
in mint condition. You interested?

356
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,792
- Very interested.
- They're coming in from Florida.

357
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,558
- Bring them in.
- So you'll buy them?

358
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,793
I don't see what would
possibly stop me?

359
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,278
They had plans, huh?
They were busy.

360
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,115
They were busy
with their big plans, huh?

361
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,655
- What are you talking about?
- Mom and Pop Seinfeld.

362
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,316
- Look, I don't know.
- I know what they did last night.

363
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,258
- They had dinner with Kramer.
- It was a last-minute thing.

364
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,126
They won't have dinner
with my parents?

365
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,096
- Right.
- Something wrong with my parents?

366
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,600
- Absolutely.
- My parents are wonderful people.

367
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,102
- These the same people you live with?
- Yes.

368
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,011
- Are they coming tonight or not?
- I don't know what their plans are.

369
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,647
Okay. Fine.

370
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,338
It's gonna be very interesting...

371
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,617
...very interesting
if they don't show up tonight.

372
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,448
You know, my mother
made all this paella.

373
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,522
What is that, anyway?

374
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,624
It's a Spanish dish.

375
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,556
It's a mélange of fish
and meat with rice.

376
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,787
- Very tasty.
- I'll tell them.

377
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,263
- Could you do one other thing for me?
- Name it.

378
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,626
Would your parents
have any objections...

379
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,033
...to taking a little kid
to Paris with them?

380
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,541
It turns out that the kid's father
lives in Paris.

381
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,306
Is that a coincidence?

382
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,043
You know, Alec wants me
to take him over there...

383
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,380
...so I figure as long
as they're going-

384
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,648
You thought as long as
they're mailing postcards...

385
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,089
...it wouldn't be too much
to ask my parents to drag a child...

386
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,355
...who they've never seen
through the streets of Paris?

387
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,601
If you think it's too much,
they don't have to mail the postcards.

388
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,371
So where's he taking you?

389
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,601
Well, first we're going to a matinee.
I'm taking the afternoon off.

390
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,438
<i>We're gonna go see My Fair Lady.</i>

391
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,908
And then we're gonna
go to dinner.

392
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,881
- He knows all these fantastic places.
- You are one lucky girl.

393
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,318
Wish I could find a nice guy.

394
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,522
- Hi, Aaron.
- Hey, Joanne.

395
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,488
- Hey.
- Hi.

396
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,565
- Hello, hello.
- Hello, Elaine.

397
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,367
<i>I was able to finagle
two more tickets to My Fair Lady...</i>

398
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,534
...and I thought, why not ask
Morty and Helen?

399
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,046
- Great.
- This is some office.

400
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,875
What's the square footage?

401
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:49,118
- You don't mind, do you, Elaine?
- Mind? Oh, of course not.

402
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,586
We can make a whole day of it.

403
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,247
This is some building.

404
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,620
Harry Fleming used to have
an office here.

405
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,285
There was a deli on the first floor.

406
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,931
You don't get corned beef
like that anymore.

407
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,095
What happened to that deli?

408
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,928
I really don't know, Mr. Seinfeld.

409
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,614
We better not.

410
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,847
They're gonna be here
any second.
