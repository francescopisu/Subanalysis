1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,467
Of all the places you go...

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,772
...the dry cleaning relationship's
the most bizarre.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,033
You keep giving each other
the same thing...

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,268
...back and forth over and over again.

5
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,470
He gives it to you, you give it to him,
he gives it back to you.

6
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,740
It's like it's half his shirt, in a way.

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,406
He has it as much as you do.

8
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,577
You ought to go shopping with him.
"What do you think of this shirt?"

9
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,189
"That would look good
with a light starch."

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,889
The only warning label people
respect is " dry-clean only."

11
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,553
Speed limits, lung cancer,
cigarette warnings...

12
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,791
...your very life is at stake.
People go, " Ah, the hell with it."

13
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,334
But dry-clean only?
"Don't put that in the wash.

14
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,665
It's dry-clean only. Are you crazy?"

15
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,712
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,872
- How did you sleep?
- You're on the couch tonight.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,575
- You were all over my side.
- I was not.

18
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,720
I was sleeping
with one cheek off the bed.

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,048
By the way, you're falling way behind
on the "I love you's."

20
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,092
- No, no, 12-8.
- No, it's 15-8.

21
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,255
I know I can't beat you.
I'm trying to stay competitive.

22
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,060
- Let's get some breakfast.
- Let me get a coat.

23
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,768
I think I'll try a sports jacket
and scarf thing.

24
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,167
You know,
like an unemployed actor.

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,710
I haven't worn this one
in a long time.

26
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,813
- Cashmere?
- No, Gore-Tex.

27
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,714
It's new.

28
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,283
Look at this locket.
What the hell's this?

29
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,216
There's a picture in here.
Look at that.

30
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,549
This is really old.
You don't know whose it is?

31
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,248
I haven't worn this jacket
since I had it dry-cleaned.

32
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,451
- Maybe we should ask.
- We'll stop over there.

33
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,119
- What do you wanna get for breakfast?
- Pancakes.

34
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,027
Come on, you know
I'm getting pancakes.

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,691
- I don't know that.
- We can't both get pancakes.

36
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,771
It's embarrassing. That's one step
from the couples that dress alike.

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,932
- I'll get the short stack.
- That's why I love you.

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,509
15-9.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,080
- How you doing?
- We just got back from breakfast.

40
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,343
- Pancakes were dynamite.
- Is that my maple syrup?

41
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:02,778
Yeah.

42
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,651
- You bring your own syrup?
- You got to.

43
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,792
You got a lot to learn
about pancakes.

44
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,554
This is my wife.
She died eight years ago.

45
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,632
I've been looking all over for this.

46
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,861
It's lucky that I put the jacket on.
How did it get in the pocket?

47
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,632
The chain is broken. It must have
slipped in when I was...

48
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,172
I turned my house
upside down looking for this.

49
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,680
- It's all I have left of her.
- That's so touching.

50
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,146
You know what
I'm gonna do?

51
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,885
I'm gonna give you and your family
25 percent off your dry cleaning.

52
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:38,182
- Oh, come on. It's silly.
- Forget it.

53
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,586
- Get out of here.
- It's done.

54
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,021
All right.

55
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,755
I guess I get it too,
because I'm his wife.

56
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,698
I didn't know you were married.

57
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,698
Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,232
You never met my wife, Meryl.
Meryl Seinfeld.

59
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,101
Yeah, sure.
You get the discount too.

60
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,178
You might regret that.
The money my wife...

61
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,906
- ...spends on clothes-
- I'm taking him to the cleaners.

62
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,413
See her sense of humor?

63
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,781
I'm so nuts about you.
I tell you, it was fun being single.

64
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,720
But when you meet a woman like this,
you don't walk to get married. You run.

65
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,490
Oh. Hi, Greg.

66
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,256
- Haven't seen you in a while.
- Yeah.

67
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,423
Today was the first day
I've worked out...

68
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,432
...since the Central Park
mini-marathon.

69
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,699
- You ran the mini-marathon?
- No, but I exercised that day.

70
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,443
I gotta take off.

71
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,512
As an airline pilot, you're one
of the few people who can...

72
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,706
...say that and mean it.

73
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,945
- Do you have the time?
- Eleven-thirty.

74
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,455
- Eleven-thirty?
- Wait, wait, 10:30. Sorry.

75
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,920
- You have to be somewhere?
- No.

76
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,653
- What are you doing?
- Just waiting for my friend George.

77
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,628
We worked out together.

78
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,732
- Well, it's good seeing you.
- Nice to see you too.

79
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,434
Bye.

80
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,701
Would you...?

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,672
- Can I-?
- Pardon?

82
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,640
The syrup.
Would you pass the syrup?

83
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:14,751
Oh, you want to try the syrup.

84
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,350
Can I get you anything else?

85
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,625
Yeah. My wife and I
will have a little more coffee.

86
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,285
- Okay.
- And the check for my husband.

87
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,998
To my beautiful wife.

88
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,599
To my adoring husband.

89
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,773
- Adoring? What about handsome?
- I like adoring.

90
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,775
Yeah, sure. Adoring's good for you.
What's it do for me?

91
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,747
Excuse me.

92
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,945
Where did you get that?

93
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,710
I- Well-

94
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:51,346
We don't allow
any outside syrups...

95
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,524
...jams, or condiments
in the restaurant.

96
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,356
And if I catch you in here
with that again...

97
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,625
...I will confiscate it.

98
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,634
Well, I told my wife not to bring it.

99
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,306
Really? Twenty-five percent off?

100
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,238
- Do I get that too?
- No. Just Meryl.

101
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,574
- Why does she get it?
- Because she's my wife.

102
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,378
Yeah?

103
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,588
I tell you, I'm really enjoying
this marriage thing.

104
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,224
You think about each other.
You care about each other.

105
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,257
It's wonderful.
I love saying "My wife."

106
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,225
Once I started saying it,
I can't stop.

107
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,455
"My wife" this, " my wife" that.

108
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,396
It's an amazing way
to begin a sentence.

109
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,533
"My wife has an inner ear infection."

110
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,167
- See?
- I like that.

111
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,835
Will you do me a favor? Will you
take my quilt into the cleaners...

112
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,605
...so I can get the discount too?

113
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,908
We'll start doing this now?
I can't be taking...

114
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,180
- ...all your dry cleaning in.
- Just this one time. It's expensive.

115
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,582
Hey, Elaine.

116
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,624
What do you say, if neither of us
is married in 10 years...

117
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,727
- ...we get hitched?
- Let's make it 50.

118
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,988
We're engaged.
All right, I'm gonna get my quilt.

119
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,033
All right. Listen to this.

120
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,101
Remember that guy
at the health club?

121
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,704
The flyboy. Where's George?

122
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,137
- I thought he was with you.
- He didn't show up.

123
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,335
Anyway, this guy gave me...

124
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,707
...an open-lip kiss.

125
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,580
- So?
- So?

126
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,445
We've always just kind of pecked.

127
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,211
This one had a different dynamic.

128
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,980
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean...

129
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,522
His upper lip landed flush
on my upper lip...

130
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,992
...but his lower lip landed
well below my rim.

131
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,256
- Moisture?
- Yeah. Definite moisture.

132
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,400
- That's an open-lip kiss, all right.
- Yeah.

133
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,464
I think he's giving me a big signal.

134
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,831
Maybe he wants
to change our relationship.

135
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,073
Yeah.

136
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,644
<i>- It's George.
- Hey, what happened to you?</i>

137
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,915
<i>Nothing. A little problem.</i>

138
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,816
What was it? I mean, I was waiting.

139
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,718
<i>Can I come upstairs, please?</i>

140
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,416
Maybe he wants to ask me out.

141
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,754
Why are you interested?
He's a jerk.

142
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,155
Because he doesn't pay any
attention to me, and he ignores me.

143
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,460
- Yeah, so?
- I respect that.

144
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,630
What happened?

145
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,971
Nothing, I said it was
a little problem.

146
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,873
Yeah, what was it?

147
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,540
I was in the locker room
showering, and I...

148
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,981
- ...I had to go, so-
- Here we go.

149
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,656
Anyway, I think the guy
in the shower opposite saw me.

150
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,588
He even gave me a dirty look.

151
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,064
You went...

152
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,929
...in the shower?

153
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,402
Yeah, so what?

154
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,336
I'm not the only one.

155
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,169
- Do you go in the shower?
- No, never.

156
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,073
- Do you?
- I take baths.

157
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,477
What was I supposed to do?

158
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,619
Get out of the shower,
put on my bathrobe...

159
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,221
...go to the other end,
come all the way back?

160
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,682
Did you ever hear of holding it in?

161
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,721
Oh, no. That's very bad
for the kidneys.

162
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,658
- How do you know?
- Medical journals.

163
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,531
Do the medical journals
mention anything...

164
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,227
...about standing in a pool
of someone else's urine?

165
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,504
Hello.

166
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,544
- Oh, hi, honey.
- What are you doing here?

167
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,114
I just thought
I'd drop off a few things.

168
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,279
I must have been in
the incinerator room when you left.

169
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,921
Here you go, Marty.

170
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,579
Another quilt?

171
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,555
- Jerry.
- Uncle Leo.

172
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,695
- Hello.
- Hello.

173
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,457
If you or your wife
want to drop by on Wednesday-

174
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,000
Your wife?

175
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,499
Yeah.

176
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,428
My wife.

177
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,539
What are you talking about?

178
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,208
I got married.

179
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,577
You got married?

180
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,841
I wasn't invited?

181
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,611
Nobody sends me an invitation?

182
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,649
Well, it was sudden.

183
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,279
Are you ashamed of your uncle?
Do I embarrass you?

184
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,653
No, no. It was a small ceremony.

185
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,954
Haven't I always been
the good uncle?

186
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,529
Yes, yes, you have.

187
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,667
Who told you when you went
to school that you print well?

188
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,495
You did.

189
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,662
When he was younger, he had
a beautiful penmanship.

190
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,568
I used to encourage him to print.

191
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,733
- I'm a good printer.
- I remember your "V."

192
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,277
It was like a perfect triangle.

193
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,911
- Oh, there's my bus.
- There you go.

194
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,413
- Hello! Wait!
- Uncle Leo. Uncle-

195
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,486
I'm glad you're here.
This can get really boring.

196
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,618
You know where I can get
some good olives?

197
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,921
- I can find out.
- Would you?

198
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,291
Sure.

199
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,663
<i>Oh, a project.
That's a definite signal.</i>

200
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,537
By the way, you look
really great in that leotard.

201
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,498
Thanks.

202
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,142
<i>That's no signal.
Who wouldn't like me in this leotard?</i>

203
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,143
<i>I look amazing in this leotard.</i>

204
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,613
It's weird. I think I had a dream
about you last night.

205
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,149
<i>Okay, he open-lips me,
he dreams about me...</i>

206
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,948
<i>...we have an olive project, that's it.
I'm asking this guy out.</i>

207
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,517
- You know, Greg-
- Can I have a sip of water?

208
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,683
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

209
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,592
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

210
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,631
- I'm sorry. What were you saying?
- It was nothing. Forget it.

211
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,906
See that guy right there?

212
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,973
- Yeah. You mean him?
- Yeah.

213
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,772
I caught him urinating
in the shower.

214
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,040
I'm thinking about
turning him in too.

215
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,985
Honey, could you get me
something to drink?

216
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,394
- You're right there.
- Come on, I'm sitting.

217
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,139
Honey, what did you do
with the can opener?

218
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,208
- I didn't do anything with it.
- It's not here. It was here yesterday.

219
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,107
- It's in the first drawer.
- I'm looking in the first drawer.

220
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,510
- It's not here.
- Yes, it is.

221
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,310
Hey, I'm not stupid.

222
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,850
I'm looking in that drawer.
There's no can opener.

223
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,347
- Did I say you were stupid?
- Well, wouldn't I have to be?

224
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,087
You tell me there's a can opener
in the drawer...

225
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,230
...I'm looking,
there's no can opener.

226
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,797
What other conclusion
could one reach?

227
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,163
- You want me to go find it?
- Yes, I do.

228
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,128
You show me where there's
a can opener in that drawer.

229
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,467
Hello. I'm sorry.
I'm just fighting with my wife.

230
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,734
Jerry, we just heard.
What's going on?

231
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,139
Why didn't you tell us?

232
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,780
- Listen, Mom-
- It was in here yesterday.

233
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,075
Yeah. That's what I said.

234
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,652
Who is she?
When did this happened?

235
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,287
I told her you'd get married.

236
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,218
She thought you'd never do it.

237
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,654
- Morty, you're talking too loud.
- I'm not.

238
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,727
- You're hurting my eardrum.
- You must've done something with it.

239
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,328
I'm on the phone.

240
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,988
Is she there? Can we talk to her?
What's her name?

241
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,656
Mom, I'm not married.

242
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,962
<i>- What?
- I'm not married.</i>

243
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,002
I knew it. I told you.

244
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,434
Uncle Leo said.

245
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,236
I'm just pretending I'm married
to get a discount on dry cleaning.

246
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,935
A discount on dry cleaning?

247
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,408
Could you make a little more noise?

248
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,078
I'll have to call you later.

249
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,613
Well, I give up.

250
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,846
Well, whoopee-woo.

251
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,355
- You got any coffee?
- Yeah.

252
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,150
Oh, boy.

253
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,394
I'll get it, I'll get it.

254
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,296
Take it easy. Why are you so tired?

255
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,167
My quilt is still at the cleaners.

256
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,206
Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt.

257
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,037
The other night I was cold,
so last night...

258
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:03,011
...I turned up the heat, it's too hot.
I opened up a window, it's too cold.

259
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,878
I can't get into the zone.

260
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,681
What is that? That.

261
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,148
I forgot.

262
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,295
I'm sorry about all that
can opener stuff.

263
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,523
Yeah. Me too.

264
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,826
- I love you.
- I love you.

265
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,302
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

266
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,373
They could kick me out
if he tells them.

267
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,485
What do you want me to do?

268
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,848
- Talk to him.
- How can I do that?

269
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,013
You said the guy gave you
an open-lipped kiss.

270
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,251
But then he wiped his hand
on the top of the bottle...

271
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,021
...when I offered him water.

272
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,895
That doesn't mean anything.

273
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,896
Are you kidding?
That's very significant.

274
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,160
If he was interested in me,
he'd want my germs.

275
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,133
He'd just crave my germs.

276
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,636
She's right, George.
Bottle-wipe is big.

277
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,832
What about the open-lip kiss?

278
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,534
Bottle-wipe supersedes it.

279
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,812
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

280
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,178
Maybe he's not interested,
but you still know him.

281
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,650
- Can't you just ask him?
- George.

282
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,288
But if I ask him now...

283
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,356
...I will have no chance
of going out with him.

284
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,693
Why?

285
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,191
I don't know.

286
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,967
Could it be because
you don't want him to know...

287
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,003
...that your friend
pees in the shower?

288
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,107
- That's not it.
- I think it is.

289
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,801
- That's exactly what it is.
- Why couldn't you wait?

290
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,106
I was there. I saw a drain.

291
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,341
- Since when is a drain a toilet?
- It's all pipes.

292
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,452
- What's the difference?
- Different pipes go to different places.

293
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,715
- You're gonna mix them up.
- I'll call a plumber right now.

294
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,349
- Can we just drop the pee-pipes stuff?
- Okay.

295
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,654
Okay, okay, I will talk to him.

296
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,459
- Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
- All right.

297
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,693
- You gotta pick it up.
- I'll pick it up.

298
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,736
- But it's the last time I'm doing it.
- I'm so tired.

299
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,204
- You don't look good.
- Huh? I don't?

300
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,434
- No. You look pale.
- Pale?

301
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,408
Oh, my God.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today.

302
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,880
Hello? Hi, honey.

303
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,515
Yes, I told him.

304
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,157
I'll get it.

305
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,389
Whenever.

306
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,594
Okay.

307
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,795
Okay, I'm sorry.

308
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,000
- I'm sorry. It's not ready yet.
- Not ready?

309
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,875
It has to be ready. What kind
of a business are you running here?

310
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,378
Who the hell are you?
It's not your quilt.

311
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,745
He's a good friend of mine.
He's like an older brother to me.

312
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,785
When things don't go right,
he takes it personally.

313
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,290
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Maybe.

314
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,049
It's okay. It'll be okay.

315
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,886
- I'll see you later.
- Where you going?

316
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,155
I gotta meet Anna's parents,
remember? I look terrible.

317
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,231
I'm gonna hit
the tanning machines.

318
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,127
I can't believe you still do that.
It's bad for you.

319
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,133
That's how I maintain my glow.

320
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,496
- I'm going home.
- Yeah.

321
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,678
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

322
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,005
How much would it cost
to clean this?

323
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,174
- Oh, about $13.
- Thirteen?

324
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,583
Well, I can't afford that.

325
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,046
Well, I'm sorry.

326
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,328
- Hi, Greg.
- Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second.

327
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,902
Okay.

328
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,129
I got the machine next, buddy.

329
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,804
It's all yours.

330
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,349
What happened?
Did he bring it up?

331
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,821
Never mind that.
Look at the signal I just got.

332
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,482
Signal? What signal?

333
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,128
He knew I'd use it next.
He didn't wipe his sweat off.

334
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,161
That's a gesture of intimacy.

335
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,199
I'll tell you what that is.

336
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,301
That's a violation of club rules.

337
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:21,337
- Now I got him. You're my witness.
- Wait a second, George. Listen.

338
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,941
He knew what he was doing.
This was a signal.

339
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,875
- A guy leaves sweat, that's a signal?
- Yes. It's a social thing.

340
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,982
If he left a used Kleenex,
what's that, a valentine?

341
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,211
You tell him if he's thinking
of turning me in...

342
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,378
- ...that I got the goods on him.
- No. I won't be a party to this.

343
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,185
So you're gonna let me get suspended
for shower urination?

344
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,622
Okay, I'll talk to him...

345
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,730
...but you're putting me
in very a difficult position.

346
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,198
- I can't let you do this.
- I want to.

347
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,406
- But it isn't right. I can't.
- Give me the clothes.

348
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,234
Jerry, please.

349
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,076
- What about her?
- Oh, the hell with her.

350
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,510
I can't.

351
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,790
No, Jerry, please.

352
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,552
I'm not gonna let you
walk out of my life.

353
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,158
I can't fight you.

354
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,802
Do you want box or hanger?

355
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,536
You decide.

356
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,720
You're really working up
quite a sweat today.

357
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:50,953
Yeah.

358
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,495
Oh, there's the manager.

359
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,098
Good. I think I'm gonna
talk to her about that guy.

360
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,894
We can't have people like that here.

361
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,630
- Are you sure you wanna do that?
- Yeah. He's disgusting.

362
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,297
Besides, I'll take
any chance I can to talk to her.

363
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,775
- You're interested in her?
- Very.

364
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,815
You know, I'm engaged.

365
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,616
Yep, I'm getting married in 50 years.

366
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,357
Oh, good, there he is.

367
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,364
I wanna be able to point him out.

368
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,826
You know, Greg,
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

369
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,472
- Why?
- Well, correct me if I'm wrong...

370
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,541
...but isn't it a violation of club policy...

371
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,872
...to not wipe down a machine
after using it?

372
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,741
Oh, I see.

373
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,444
You're friends with the urinator,
aren't you?

374
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,883
Yeah, well...

375
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,456
...at least he had a drain.

376
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,127
There you go, Mrs. Seinfeld.

377
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:06,067
With your 25 percent discount,
it comes to $17.80.

378
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,629
Here you go.

379
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,113
Excuse me, this isn't mine.

380
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,848
Oh, yes, it is.

381
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,109
Your husband brought it in himself.

382
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,943
Really?

383
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,289
Thank you.

384
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,885
That's him.

385
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,294
Hi.

386
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,508
You son of a bitch.

387
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,472
- I'm sorry.
- Who is she?

388
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,311
- I want to know who she is.
- It doesn't matter.

389
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,446
I want a divorce.

390
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,821
A divorce?

391
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,824
So you can marry her
and give her the discount?

392
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,926
Yes, that's right.

393
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,190
- What happened to us, Jerry?
- I'll tell you what happened.

394
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,163
We got married.

395
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,760
I'm sorry. This is my fault.
I pushed it on you.

396
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,135
No. I guess I just wasn't ready
for the responsibilities...

397
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,276
...of a pretend marriage.

398
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,445
Goodbye, Jerry.

399
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,614
I forgot.

400
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,915
This is your maple syrup.

401
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,380
It's all right, I want you to have it.

402
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,583
Okay, thanks.

403
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,290
We'll always have pancakes.

404
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,690
Goodbye, Jerry.

405
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,132
I thought you said
you was bringing a white boy home.

406
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,329
I don't see a white boy.

407
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,474
I see a damn fool.

408
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,620
To me, the thing about marriage is...

409
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,120
...I can't believe
how often it happens.

410
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,018
I like the idea of it, but I can't believe
that many people...

411
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:13,221
...are meeting people that they want
to see every single day...

412
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,731
...every day, every day,
every day, every day.

413
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,063
That should happen,
like, three or four times...

414
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,330
...you know, in the whole century.

415
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,031
Like any major investment,
you sign a marriage contract.

416
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,803
Here's your person.
If you're a man, the bride's family...

417
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,242
...pays for the wedding,
like getting cash back.

418
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:32,406
"Till death do us part" that's
the extended warranty program.

419
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,848
You give her the ring,
that's the keys.

420
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,683
You slide it on, start him up,
but you've got to make it work.

421
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,759
Your value drops 20 percent when
you drive each other off the lot.
