2
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:33,720
By the time I left Miami,

3
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:37,182
Americans were doing a couple hundred tons
of cocaine every year.

4
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:42,812
To satisfy American noses,
the narcos ramped up their operations.

5
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,317
- Here, honey.
- Ah, thank you.

6
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,405
- Hey, is that the Bahamas?
- Hm?

7
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,451
Oh... Yeah.

8
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,411
That's beautiful.

9
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:00,830
They were flying so many planes,

10
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:04,251
they needed a refueling stop
between Colombia and Miami.

11
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,337
So Carlos Lehder
bought an island in the Bahamas

12
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:10,090
as a transshipment point
for the drugs and money.

13
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,928
Turns out...
it was a damn good place to party.

14
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:21,518
It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah,
with the three things Carlos liked most:

15
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:26,106
- sex, drugs, and Nazi sympathizers.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

16
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,066
Let's get down!

17
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:36,032
The problem was
no longer demand... it was supply.

18
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,625
We should be over the Amazon by now.

19
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:52,424
From 10,000 feet, Colombia
was a paradise of untouched rainforest.

20
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,969
But things were different
on the ground.

21
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:01,766
Pablo and his partners built superlabs
the size of small cities.

22
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:10,066
From leaf to paste to powder,
they produced 10,000 kilos a week.

23
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:15,197
At 50 grand a kilo,
that's five billion dollars a year.

24
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,533
These guys weren't fuckin' around.

25
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:26,458
Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in
from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.

26
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:31,463
They added it to liquor, to coffee,
and just to be funny...

27
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,089
they put it back in Coca-Cola.

28
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:34,466
¿Patrón?

29
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,551
Looks good?

30
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,053
Cocaine was no longer
hidden alongside products.

31
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,472
This is going
to sell better than the original.

32
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,015
It was the product.

33
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,352
It's time to take Pablo's money.

34
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:48,897
The narcos even
had their own drug-sniffing dogs.

35
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,859
Gacha bet Pablo that not even
a German scientist could fool his dog.

36
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,070
Search.

37
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:59,741
What's happening? Look at that.

38
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,869
Your prize dog didn't even stop.

39
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,163
There's no coke in that boat.

40
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:06,289
Come here.

41
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:12,295
It's blended
right into the fiberglass hull.

42
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:16,925
Give me the money...
the cash!

43
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,302
Looks like you got taken
with this dog, brother.

44
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:24,433
- Hold this a moment.
- Oh, Marquessa, my dear...

45
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:26,851
It's OK, it's OK.

46
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,359
- Are you fucking crazy?
- What?

47
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:35,860
It's my dog.

48
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,910
Son of a bitch.

49
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,454
What happened?

50
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:47,956
You want to know what happened? Go look.

51
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,626
Pablo?

52
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:55,380
- Pablo, we have a motherfucking problem.
- Bastard murderer.

53
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,007
- He killed the dog.
- I don't give a shit.

54
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:01,219
If we don't resolve this problem,
we're all dead. Come on.

55
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:06,391
- Come on, man.
- Son of a bitch.

56
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,020
Let's see...

57
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,484
This is the problem?

58
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,735
People are watching us, Pablo.

59
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,614
They're asking themselves
how two small businessmen

60
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:24,033
- suddenly came up with so much cash.
- Gustavo, brother...

61
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:26,911
just launder the money.

62
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:33,710
Make it look legitimate...
that's all.

63
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,838
Isn't that what Al Capone did?

64
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,384
- Al Capone?
- Al Capone.

65
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,513
You're a dumbass, Pablo.

66
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:47,015
- Al Capone is a terrible example.
- Why?

67
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,726
Because Al Capone
never had this much cash.

68
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,395
This is too much to launder.

69
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,731
Well, then...

70
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,527
let's buy a bigger washing machine.

71
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,154
And that's what they tried first.

72
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:07,202
On paper, Pablo had
the most profitable taxi company ever.

73
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:08,453
He only had three cars,

74
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:11,873
but he was pulling in
more than five million dollars a week.

75
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,419
And Gacha had the most successful
emerald mine of all time.

76
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,256
He would inject bad stones with oil
to make them shiny,

77
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,009
then have his friends in Miami
buy the emeralds with drug money

78
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,345
and give them as gifts
to hookers in town.

79
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,348
Everybody was happy.

80
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:34,771
But no matter what they did,
they couldn't hide all that money.

81
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,815
It just kept coming in.

82
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:41,194
You're spending too much cash, Pablo.

83
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:45,657
You have Picassos, Dalís, farms,

84
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:49,536
houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars...

85
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,373
I told you we have to fly low.

86
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,586
If you keep spending like that,
you're going to end up in Forbes Magazine.

87
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,004
And if that happens,
the government is going to have our asses.

88
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,257
Enough, Gustavo, enough.

89
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,426
What do you want me to say?

90
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,928
Bury it.

91
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,889
- How's that?
- Bury the cash.

92
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,058
And cut the bullshit.

93
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,229
Go on, pussy.

94
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:20,609
And that's what they did.

95
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,860
They buried it in fields...

96
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:28,408
they hid it in caletas,
hiding places in walls and ceilings.

97
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:33,413
They even stuck a million dollars
in Pablo's mother's couch.

98
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,501
Hey, Mom.

99
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:41,630
- I'm praying, Pablo.
- Just for a second.

100
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,593
Sit.

101
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,727
It isn't very comfortable, Pablito.

102
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:57,646
I'll buy you another sofa later.

103
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,898
Wouldn't it be better
if you put all this money in a bank, son?

104
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,692
No.

105
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,236
All bankers are bandits.

106
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,822
Really, honey?

107
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,035
Pablo called this accountant "Blackbeard,"

108
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,954
not because he looked like a pirate,

109
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,249
but because his job was to map out
where the treasure was hidden.

110
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,421
But not even the pirate did the trick.

111
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,674
The problem was Colombia itself.

112
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:28,802
It was too small a country
for a fortune that big.

113
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:33,973
It was inevitable... someone, somewhere
would try to snatch the narcos' treasure.

114
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,977
Forbes Magazine says...

115
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:41,189
that the narcos have more money

116
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:44,359
than the richest capitalist pig
in this country.

117
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,863
Let me see?

118
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,115
If we kidnap someone in their family,
what are they going to do?

119
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,242
Call the police?

120
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,160
Commander.

121
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:59,749
It says here that Gacha, "The Mexican,"
is the ninth richest man in the world.

122
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,751
I say we kidnap his son.

123
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,547
He's a psycho maniac, comrade.

124
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:09,718
Plus, he's bought off half the military.

125
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:13,471
Well, the Ochoa brothers
are number 14 on the list.

126
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:15,891
Their sister Marta
goes to the university.

127
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,183
How about her?

128
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,732
I like that more.
The Ochoas are soft.

129
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,275
Wait a second.

130
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:29,320
What about Pablo Escobar?

131
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:31,280
I know what you're thinking.

132
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:34,158
No one's crazy enough
to kidnap drug dealers, right?

133
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,872
But if you're thinking that, it's because
you're not familiar with M-19.

134
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,709
M-19 was a communist guerrilla group

135
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,086
made up of college students
and intellectuals

136
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,630
who read too much Karl Marx
for their own good.

137
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,552
Their leader was
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres...

138
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,346
a history professor
who knew nothing about guerilla warfare,

139
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,724
but understood the power of symbols.

140
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,894
He broke into
the Quinta de Bolívar Museum

141
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:04,981
with his buddy Alejandro
and Alejandro's girlfriend, Elisa,

142
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:09,444
and stole a national treasure...
the sword of Simón Bolívar,

143
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:13,406
the mythic general who led Colombia
to independence from the Spanish empire.

144
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,925
These jokers even left a note:

145
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:36,053
"Bolívar, your sword
returns to the battlefield."

146
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:42,393
It was a stroke of genius...
a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.

147
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:44,479
And it made them famous overnight.

148
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:48,817
And I guess it went to their heads.

149
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:53,446
What about Pablo Escobar?
He's the richest of them all.

150
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:56,574
Escobar gives money to the poor.

151
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:59,953
You're right.
Escobar is a man of the people.

152
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,370
He's all right with me.

153
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,080
OK, then.

154
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,542
Let's do the Ochoas.

155
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:35,571
March 13th, 1981,
the day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa,

156
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:39,200
was also the day the Lion
completed 100 trips to Miami.

157
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,956
Hola.

158
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,000
Good afternoon.

159
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:52,338
- Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.
- Sí.

160
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:55,591
Does the cat have any papers?

161
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,802
- Sí.
- Please.

162
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,473
Thank you.

163
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:07,854
Mm.

164
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,859
Excuse me a second, please.

165
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:27,957
Sir, this couple has no sanitary B-47 form

166
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,792
and no I-435
identifying papers, either.

167
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,920
Well, I guess he's talking about Puff.

168
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:34,881
Yes, sir.
They brought an American cat with them.

169
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:41,637
Sure, but without the I-435, I can't
officially state that it is indeed a cat.

170
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:47,643
I also can't guarantee
that it's American.

171
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:53,190
Sir, I'm not trying
to make your life more difficult.

172
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,111
OK, sir.

173
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,699
My boss is not having a good day.

174
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:03,785
I think his wife left him.

175
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:12,001
Yeah, well, he's a little bit cranky,
so... how important is this cat to you?

176
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,544
Excuse me?

177
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:15,337
OK.

178
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,422
Come with me, please.

179
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,862
So... wait here, please.

180
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:43,783
And my boss will ask you
for this paper later.

181
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,494
How long is it gonna be?

182
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,745
I don't know.

183
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,250
Pablo! Pablo!

184
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,419
While I was trying to get into Bogotá,

185
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,047
Pablo was trying to get into politics.

186
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:02,177
When he said he was going
to be president of Colombia, he meant it.

187
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,013
- Hello, Pablo.
- Hello, Valeria.

188
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:08,349
- This is my wife, Tata.
- Hello.

189
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,643
Don't worry.
Everything will be perfect.

190
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,562
I'm just not used
to these type of things.

191
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:15,064
Just be yourself.

192
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:18,275
Ma'am, it would be best
if you weren't here.

193
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,531
Look, Tata,
there are a lot of people here.

194
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,449
It might not be good for the baby.

195
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:28,577
Go to the house.

196
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,759
Where is this guy?
We've been waiting for hours now.

197
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,681
Maybe he's at "terapia de pareja."

198
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,225
What's that?

199
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,726
Couples counseling.

200
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,311
Right.

201
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:56,689
What're you doing?

202
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,774
Oh, I'm practicing my Spanish.

203
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:00,276
Welcome to Nuevos Tiempos.

204
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:04,780
I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the
man known as "the Robin Hood of the poor"

205
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:07,408
for his generosity
with the poor of Medellín.

206
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,618
Yeah, you heard that right.

207
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:13,455
She just compared Pablo Escobar
to fucking Robin Hood.

208
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,292
And in a way, she was right.

209
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,169
When you've run out of ways
to hide your money,

210
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,671
that's when you give it to the poor.

211
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,798
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.

212
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:26,552
Tell us about your program,
"Medellín Without Slums," Mr. Escobar.

213
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,638
I was born in Rionegro,
not too far from here.

214
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:34,435
And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people

215
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,313
can be so out of touch
with what they need.

216
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,066
Hospitals, social and athletic programs,

217
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,278
plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.

218
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,323
I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.

219
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,325
Do you have any political aspirations,
Mr. Escobar?

220
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:53,788
None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.

221
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,790
I will tell you one thing, Valeria.

222
00:15:55,873 --> 00:16:02,088
For decades, our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy

223
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,924
who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

224
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:09,304
They don't know what
common people dream of, but I do...

225
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,764
Connie, you know who that is?

226
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,350
Bet he could get our cat
into the country.

227
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,061
I can't believe it.

228
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,315
They don't even know
he's a fucking drug dealer.

229
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,776
- Thank you very much.
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

230
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,072
At the time,
Pablo was just a blip on my radar.

231
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:31,492
I didn't know
I was about to be a blip on his.

232
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,502
Well, we've been waiting
for hours. Thanks for coming out.

233
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:45,798
Uh, my wife's a little exhausted,
so here is the cat's vaccination--

234
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,383
Your passport.

235
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,344
I'm sorry?

236
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,221
Your passport, please.

237
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,688
Gracias.

238
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,994
What do you do at
the United States Embassy, Mr. Murphy?

239
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,330
I am in, uh,
janitorial services.

240
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,624
Janitorial services.

241
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,251
Another one.

242
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,838
Your embassy must be very clean.

243
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,675
Oh, yeah.
You bet your ass it is.

244
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:32,428
Your cat's cleared.

245
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,557
Enjoy Colombia.

246
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:46,692
And just like that, the narcos
had me on file the very first day.

247
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,339
As for Valeria Velez,

248
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:12,551
the journalist who first
interviewed Pablo... watch out.

249
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,054
She was as dangerous as M-19.

250
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,820
Does your wife do it standing up?

251
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:36,200
Aah!

252
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:40,121
Don't ever disrespect Tata.

253
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,332
Do you hear me?

254
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:49,671
I'm sorry, Pablo...
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,550
Forgive me.

256
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,182
It won't happen again.

257
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,434
I promise.

258
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:15,739
How can I apologize? Huh?

259
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,881
Want to put it in my ass? Hm?

260
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,220
You gotta give it to her.

261
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:41,390
She saw Pablo coming a mile away.

262
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:45,644
And she got herself in just the
right place to take full advantage of him.

263
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,690
Not unlike my partner Javier Peña,

264
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,568
who figured the best way
to get inside narco information

265
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,862
was to hang out
with the same women they did.

266
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,978
We get better every time we practice.

267
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:30,064
You're amazing, Javier.

268
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:33,942
Well...

269
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:39,156
don't go overboard.

270
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,914
It's the truth.

271
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,292
What can you offer me to drink?

272
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,628
Whiskey or tap water.

273
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,339
Water.

274
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,727
What you're missing
in this apartment is a woman.

275
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,687
It's fine the way it is.

276
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:14,942
Well, I wasn't offering.

277
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,619
Here.

278
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,875
If you were a client,
you would have paid me already.

279
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:38,340
- And you wouldn't know my real name.
- Don't take it the wrong way.

280
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:42,470
It's cash from Uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.

281
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,057
Take it.

282
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,145
And my visa?

283
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:55,316
Give me something I can use
and we'll talk about it.

284
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,365
What are you doing this weekend?

285
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:06,535
- I'm going to Medellín.
- Work or play?

286
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,330
I have to take care of my child.

287
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,915
I can pay, too.

288
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:17,963
Those guys are richer
than Uncle Sam, Javi.

289
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:22,759
Come here.

290
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,556
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

291
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,100
Give me a kiss.

292
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,614
I guess I'll have to find another girl.

293
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:47,451
Good luck with that.
We're all going to Medellín.

294
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,620
Some of us are even going by plane.

295
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,500
Helena?

296
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,001
Helena.

297
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,382
Whose party is it?

298
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,974
Oh, God! What was that?

299
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,184
That was like a .38.

300
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,228
- About four blocks away.
- Oh...

301
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:33,872
Welcome to Bogotá.

302
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,751
Should we do it under the bed?

303
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:04,861
Just one thing...
Who told you about this?

304
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,949
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

305
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:23,297
Pablo says they're
not going to pay a dime for Marta Ochoa.

306
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,632
Gustavo, too.

307
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:29,511
- And Jorge?
- No. Jorge doesn't agree.

308
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:33,014
- Then what?
- They're all going to a meeting.

309
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:35,100
At Las Margaritas.

310
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,853
- Everyone?
- Yeah, they'll all be there.

311
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:49,615
First day at the American Embassy.

312
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,242
- I met my partner...
- Javier?

313
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,536
...who introduced me to the DEA.

314
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,330
Murphy, this is Weaver and Wisnicki.

315
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,373
These guys are R.I.P.
"Retired in Place."

316
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,375
- Eat me, Peña.
- Paid vacation's over, fellas.

317
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,710
Murphy and I are going to Medellín.

318
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,797
We'll telex the T-3 reports.
They go straight to Washington.

319
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,342
We are going to Medellín?

320
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:12,554
- Then the Mil Group.
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.

321
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,014
Murphy, this is Mil Group.

322
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:17,601
They advise Colombian military
on communist threats in the countryside.

323
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,060
Hey, those are classified.

324
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:22,272
- Now they're declassified.
- That's the ambassador's call.

325
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,858
No problem.

326
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:30,823
And the last stop...
the ambassador's office.

327
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,199
Why do you need this intel?

328
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:36,244
There's an unusual number of prostitutes
headed to Medellín this weekend.

329
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,996
Every high-end girl in Bogotá.

330
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,248
First class airfare,
five-star hotels.

331
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,501
The narcos are having a meeting
and then a party.

332
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,961
What does the M-19
have to do with this?

333
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,923
Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa.
Intel suggests it was M-19.

334
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,926
I need access to the M-19 files
to confirm.

335
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:55,305
If I find out one single dollar
of American taxpayer money

336
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:58,809
went to any of those hookers,
it'll be your ass.

337
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,019
OK, thank you.
One last thing, Ambassador.

338
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,312
Yes, Agent Peña?

339
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:05,106
I'm filing a visa request
for my informant. I need your signature.

340
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,859
You're bothering me.

341
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,905
She sure likes you.

342
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,740
Is your informant really a prostitute?

343
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,616
Everybody works for somebody.

344
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,460
The very next day,
I was flying with Peña to Medellín,

345
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,295
Pablo's home turf.

346
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:39,683
First stop: Carlos Holguín School,
Colonel Carrillo's base of operations.

347
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,947
- Good day, Major.
- Good day.

348
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,952
Your intel was good. The traquetos
are gathering at Las Margaritas.

349
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:01,872
I want you
to meet our new DEA, Steve Murphy.

350
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,582
Fresh meat.

351
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:10,965
Then we went straight to a fancy
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.

352
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,679
The pictures I took that day
helped to ID guys for months to come.

353
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,143
There was Carlos Lehder...

354
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:28,774
...the Ochoa brothers...

355
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,740
Fernando Galeano,
"the Wolfman"...

356
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,962
Is that Gacha?

357
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,423
I've never seen him
with other traffickers.

358
00:27:55,634 --> 00:28:00,096
And last but not least...
Gustavo and Pablo.

359
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,018
Get pictures of that fucker.

360
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,776
They were all under one roof
and Peña got us there to document it all.

361
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,076
What we didn't know was
that we were witnessing the formation

362
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,244
of the famed Medellín cartel.

363
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:27,123
Pablo took advantage
of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa

364
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:30,585
to bring all the narcos together
for the very first time.

365
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,715
And then he proclaimed himself
their leader.

366
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:39,887
What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,

367
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,849
is that we form an organization.

368
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:50,939
Pool our resources to train soldiers,
trade knowledge and buy information.

369
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:57,071
And so the message is clear,
we're going to name our group

370
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,406
"Death to Kidnappers."

371
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,243
What I propose:

372
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,081
I will manage all operational aspects.

373
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,750
All you need to do
is cover my expenses.

374
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:15,797
What you gentlemen will receive in return:
two things.

375
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,926
One... I promise to end the kidnapping.

376
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:23,471
Two... and at this moment,
the most important...

377
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:28,769
I promise to return
Marta Ochoa to her family.

378
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,438
Salud.

379
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:35,025
Death to Kidnappers!

380
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,491
We knew the meeting was over
when the hookers came to play.

381
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,912
Peña had finally
gotten one of his informants

382
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,914
right into the heart of the action.

383
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,794
Come in! Enjoy! Ooh!

384
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,838
Don't forget La Quica!
Take care of him, too.

385
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,553
Sit down, my love.

386
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,850
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

387
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:10,894
I like your hat.

388
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,813
It looks good on you.

389
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,315
- Do you think so?
- Yes, it looks good.

390
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:16,650
Let's see.

391
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,403
Very cute.

392
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,829
She should be here by now.

393
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,331
You think she slipped?

394
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,500
Nah, she's no dummy.

395
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,923
Maybe she's getting pretty for you.

396
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,216
Yeah.

397
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:57,649
Aah...

398
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,153
Helena wanted a US visa so bad,

399
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,072
she was willing to do anything
to help our cause.

400
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,992
And that was a problem.

401
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:11,538
- You're tired.
- Hm?

402
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,582
Let me relax you a bit.

403
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,383
So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?

404
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,765
What did you hear?

405
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:33,143
Nothing.
Just making conversation.

406
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,652
They're
telling me the girl left a long time ago.

407
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:47,115
- She's already dead.
- No, they wouldn't kill her at the hotel.

408
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,909
Then they killed her somewhere else.

409
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,785
She knew the risks.

410
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,829
If we're going back,
we go back now.

411
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,667
I want you to find the girl.

412
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,421
I can pick up a sicario.
You OK with that?

413
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,506
- I'm going with you.
- What about Fresh Meat?

414
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,926
Gonna stick around here
and see if she shows up, OK?

415
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,845
- Yeah, and where are you going?
- We're gonna go look for her.

416
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:10,430
That's it, guys.

417
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,698
- Guys.
- Hey, what happened?

418
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,034
That little girl doesn't move.
Like a dead cow.

419
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,493
What, did you kill her?

420
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,463
It's my turn now.

421
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,984
Where's the girl?

422
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,987
- Where's the girl, asshole?
- I don't know.

423
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,614
I don't know.

424
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,159
Choke him.

425
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:25,088
Enough with the party.

426
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:29,384
I gotta rough this girl up.

427
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,594
Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.

428
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,181
Gacha's paranoid.

429
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:39,894
Wait a second...
I don't like them bruised.

430
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:42,356
Let me have a little more fun,
then I'll let her go.

431
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,899
It's all right, boys.

432
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:46,401
This one's for all of you!

433
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,863
Slap her around!

434
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:05,962
Any news on the radio?

435
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:09,590
- Should I tell him?
- No. Remember what Carrillo said.

436
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:11,634
Sorry, I don't speak English.

437
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:25,481
- How far is it?
- Come on, you piece of shit.

438
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:23,123
Helena?

439
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:31,631
I'm going to get you
out of here, OK? I promise.

440
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:51,234
All right. She's coming out.

441
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,532
Copy, Major.

442
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:58,699
Let's go, boys.

443
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,745
Hey, gringo.
Carrillo is calling. Come on.

444
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,541
No habla inglés, huh?

445
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,293
¡Vamos!

446
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,386
Where the fuck's Peña?
¿Dónde está Peña?

447
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,720
Over there.

448
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:39,657
- How is she?
- Sedated.

449
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:44,329
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Physically, yeah.

450
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:46,581
Mentally, I haven't got a fucking clue.

451
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,251
- You left me behind on purpose.
- Look, man--

452
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:52,628
If we're gonna be partners,
I don't get left behind.

453
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,299
I didn't come all the way down here, Peña,
to sit on the fucking sidelines.

454
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:05,141
Whatever's going on here...
I'm in all the way.

455
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:06,851
Is that understood?

456
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,191
Understood.

457
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,239
I hope you know what that means.

458
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:31,000
Pablo's message
to the kidnappers was simple.

459
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:36,047
He was going to kill them, one by one,
until he got Marta Ochoa back.

460
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,051
Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could
hide in the jungle and wait it out.

461
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:43,137
Sooner or later,
he figured the narcos would cave in.

462
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,681
Big mistake.

463
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:48,142
M-19 didn't stand a chance.

464
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:02,490
"Deliver Marta Ochoa
safe and sound... or your family is next."

465
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:05,535
Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."

466
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,918
Please! Please, let me go.

467
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,504
- Hurry up!
- Please, don't!

468
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:20,467
Needless to say,
Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.

469
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,393
And the killing didn't stop.

470
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:34,897
Pablo had tasted blood,
and he liked it.

471
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:38,568
Tell him to get a little closer.

472
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,321
A little closer. A little closer!

473
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,157
You know what, boss?
Go a little higher.

474
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,326
A little bit higher
and a little bit closer

475
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,328
so you can see the tree!

476
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:50,913
That's it.

477
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:57,086
Now a little bit higher
so you can see the little tree!

478
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,673
That...

479
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,257
That's it. Perfect.

480
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:02,509
DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS

481
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:04,177
A little more.

482
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,263
That's it! There you go.

483
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:11,934
- Much better.
- Yes, boss.

484
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:22,278
Didn't I tell you
not to let anyone into the park?

485
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,531
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you crazy or what?

486
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:26,574
Stupid asshole.

487
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:28,409
It's a woman with a baby.

488
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,206
Take a picture
so we can send it to the newspapers.

489
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:34,457
Do it.

490
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,501
Good day, ma'am.

491
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,796
- Good day.
- I'm sorry, but the park is closed today.

492
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,840
What do you mean the park is closed?

493
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:45,009
May I escort you out?

494
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,554
Why is it closed?
I come by here every day.

495
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:52,808
It's because there is a foul odor
and I don't want the child to get sick.

496
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:55,102
I thought I smelled something.

497
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:56,604
- Right?
- Yes.

498
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,398
Oh, look,
what a beautiful little baby.

499
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:00,941
Right, just like his dad.
Thank you very much.

500
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:04,070
- You must be proud.
- Yes, of course.

501
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:07,240
My wife and I
are having a baby very soon.

502
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,617
Oh, very good.
Congratulations!

503
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:12,579
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl,
but as long as it's healthy.

504
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:17,208
Yes, of course.
The most important thing is health.

505
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:22,296
Sending the photos
of the hanging M-19 to the newspapers

506
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,132
gave Pablo an image of invincibility.

507
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,428
If he could do this
to the feared communists,

508
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,137
he could do it to anyone.

509
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,308
Ivan "the Terrible"
was quick to realize...

510
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:36,477
there was only one thing he could do.

511
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:40,314
Hey, Don Pablo.

512
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,984
What do you want us to do
with this guy?

513
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,155
Should I kill him or what?

514
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:59,250
From what I can see,
you're not going to stop.

515
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:03,212
Here I am,
so you can finish what you started...

516
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,300
but with the sword of Bolívar.

517
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:37,330
It's a very beautiful gift.
Thank you very much.

518
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,210
Stand up.

519
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:53,053
I guarantee no harm
will come to you or your family.

520
00:41:57,684 --> 00:42:01,187
From now on,
we are going to work together.

521
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:10,363
Go in peace, brother.

522
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,714
Is that what I think it is?

523
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,383
You've gotta be kidding.

524
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,600
I want you
to run my day-to-day operations.

525
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:44,188
And you'll do what?

526
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,568
Liberate Colombia.

527
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:58,994
Welcome to the Medellín cartel.

528
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:19,891
The narcos had their army,
but me and Peña had ours, too.

529
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:22,685
Many Colombians
like Major Horacio Carrillo

530
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,772
were so invested
in the future of their country

531
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:28,858
that they were ready
to do whatever it took to fix it.

532
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:35,740
This was a war that would shake
an entire country to its foundations.

533
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:39,535
And in the carnage...
mine would be shaken as well.

534
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,957
Even my wife, Connie,
wanted to help.

535
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:47,460
She got a job as a nurse
in a local comuna.

536
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:50,212
She wanted to make a difference.

537
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:52,924
I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.

538
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:56,176
Look, our escolta will drive me
there and back every day.

539
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,763
- Yeah.
- He'll wait outside all day.

540
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:01,975
You know the last time you were in church
is when we got married.

541
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,226
Well, I'm letting the Lord
back into my life.

542
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,394
Hey, stop right here.

543
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:16,071
Praise God.

544
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,624
Perdón.

545
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:33,464
I want that escolta watching
every inch of you at that comuna now.

546
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,884
Hey, did we leave the door open?

547
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,555
Oh, my God, Steve!

548
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,641
Get back.

549
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:55,319
You stay right there
and don't move.

550
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:11,365
