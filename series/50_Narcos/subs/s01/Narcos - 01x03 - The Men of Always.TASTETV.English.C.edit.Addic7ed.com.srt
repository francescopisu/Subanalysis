1
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:07,385
I'm more of a dog man myself,
but no cat deserves this.

2
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:10,513
Did you tell anyone
about why you were down here?

3
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:12,557
Someone on the plane?
Someone you met at a restaurant?

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,724
'Course not.

5
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:17,728
Not to get personal,
but have you had any, uh... encounters?

6
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,522
- "Encounters"?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:21,815
I'm married.

8
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:24,235
Right.

9
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:27,655
Only people I've encountered
outside the DEA and my wife

10
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:29,240
are those Colombian cops in Medellín.

11
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:30,824
No, no, Carrillo's solid.

12
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:32,701
Did anyone have access
to your credentials?

13
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:35,204
Did you drop your wallet?

14
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:36,372
Passport.

15
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,416
How important is this cat to you?

16
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,000
Excuse me?

17
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:41,794
You gave someone your passport?

18
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,006
We were trying to get Puff
through Immigration.

19
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:47,383
"Puff"?

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,176
I didn't name it, dude.

21
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:52,012
Traffickers pay people
at the airports for intel.

22
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:55,224
A gringo coming in from Miami raises
suspicions. That's how you got made.

23
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:57,851
Don't let it rattle you.
That's what they want.

24
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,688
You probably got a price on your head,
but no one's gonna take the contract.

25
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:01,855
Fucking price on my head?

26
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:06,360
There's a standing bounty
of 350,000 US on any DEA down here,

27
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:09,238
but you're safe... because of Kiki.

28
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,450
The "Kiki" Peña was referring to

29
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:17,955
was Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent who went
after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico.

30
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,333
Kiki was captured and tortured.

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,419
They skinned his legs,
put a bullet in each limb,

32
00:01:23,503 --> 00:01:26,005
used an electric drill on his head
until he died.

33
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:29,049
What the fuck were they thinking?

34
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:33,471
They could kill an American
government agent and get away with it?

35
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:37,308
Uncle Sam doesn't fuck around.
The cocksuckers paid in blood.

36
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,687
They went after them so hard,
every single narco in the world

37
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:44,649
got the message
that the DEA is off-limits.

38
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:47,234
Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.

39
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:48,569
He died to save us all.

40
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:51,864
Do not tell Connie that story.

41
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:53,240
I won't.

42
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,743
- But you shouldn't forget it either.
- Why?

43
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,871
This cat is DEA.

44
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,081
Mark my words, it will get justice.

45

46
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:47,187
My name is everywhere.

47
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:52,318
Newspapers...

48
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,113
magazines...

49
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:04,705
Everyone is talking about
the "Paisa Robin Hood."

50
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:06,582
Pablito, I'm sorry.
If I had known that--

51
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,959
You're going to have
to pay for that, my love.

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,962
Anything you want, Pablito.

53
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,006
Anything I want?

54
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,467
Yes, my love,
whatever you want.

55
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,093
You sure?

56
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:20,847
Uh-huh.

57
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,571
Then...

58
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,993
you're going to help me
get into Congress.

59
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,331
Yes, Pablo.

60
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,958
Yes.

61
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:05,474
Those shitty oligarchs.

62
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,020
Those people,
all of their lives...

63
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:15,025
don't know what it's like to wonder
where their next meal is coming from.

64
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:20,489
I come from nothing, Valeria...

65
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,702
and I have more money
than any of those sons of bitches.

66
00:05:24,785 --> 00:05:28,664
If you run for Congress, you put yourself
in the public eye, you become a target.

67
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:34,086
"I made my money from taxis" isn't going
to work when you face the press.

68
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,966
Pablo, you need a party that supports you.

69
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:42,219
You need a proper political campaign.

70
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,556
I buy the press, my love.

71
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,392
And as far as a political party,

72
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:51,478
I am quite sure
that I can buy one of those as well.

73
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:54,273
I don't want to be good.

74
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:59,361
I am going to be great.

75
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:00,362
A PAISA ROBIN HOOD

76
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,991
A drug dealer running
for president. It was crazy, right?

77
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:07,202
Well, not in Colombia.
Not in the mid-'80s.

78
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:10,581
As far as Colombians go,
Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all.

79
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:12,750
He was a fucking winner.

80
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,502
The living embodiment
of the Colombian dream.

81
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:18,672
The guy who'd buy houses for the poor
in exchange for nothing.

82
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:23,010
As far as Pablo could tell, the doors
to political success were there...

83
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,179
and all he had to do was to get to them.

84
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:30,559
And in order to do that,

85
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:34,605
he asked Valeria Velez
to introduce him to Fernando Duque.

86
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,656
Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist
who represented the New Liberals,

87
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:46,450
a party who claimed
to represent the people.

88
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:53,332
Pablo!

89
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,584
I should've gotten into the taxi business.

90
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:57,878
- Valeria, how are you doing?
- Well, thank you.

91
00:06:57,962 --> 00:06:59,379
Mr. Duque.

92
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:02,800
It gives me great pleasure to invite you
to the Hacienda Nápoles.

93
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:04,426
- Nice to meet you.
- Please, come.

94
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,428
After you, Valeria.

95
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,557
Please.

96
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:17,523
Look, I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

97
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:19,775
And for that reason,
I think that...

98
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,111
Well, I think that
I understand the people

99
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:25,405
to whom the New Liberalism
wants to give a voice.

100
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:30,077
The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say, Mr. Escobar.

101
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:34,289
There is a great deal of talk
about how you have made your money.

102
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:38,210
I need guarantees
concerning the origins of your fortune.

103
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:43,215
And Valeria told you...
how much I am going to donate?

104
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,217
- No, no--
- Look, I am not a politician.

105
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,222
I am not a successful lawyer like you.
I come from the street... brother.

106
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:54,434
I want to reassure you
that you will receive your piece.

107
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:56,854
- It's not about that--
- Assuming your piece is ten percent,

108
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:58,397
your piece would be what?

109
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:00,941
$300,000 just for you.

110
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:08,281
Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee
for the Justice Minister or what?

111
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:10,784
- Most definitely.
- All right, then.

112
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:12,703
Let's go look at the hippos.
Come on.

113
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:17,499
Blackie.

114
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,834
Pablo?

115
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,047
- And what about me?
- What about you?

116
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:25,966
I don't get my piece?

117
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,886
No, my queen.
The thing is that you...

118
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:32,347
you're in this for love, right?

119
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,644
Look, Minister...

120
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:40,731
Escobar has founded schools, clinics.

121
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:43,150
He has created sources of employment
throughout Medellín.

122
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,819
The people love him,
and he loves the people.

123
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:48,614
And from a legal point of view,
his money is clean.

124
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:52,409
And according to Forbes Magazine,
he's a drug trafficker.

125
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:56,663
Are you going to believe all of that
American imperialist propaganda?

126
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:57,748
Take a look.

127
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:05,923
These are property holdings papers.

128
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:07,174
Look.

129
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:11,929
He's the owner of hundreds of properties
in Colombia and also the United States.

130
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:15,141
In addition,
this man has no criminal record.

131
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:18,602
If there was,
there would be proof of his background.

132
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,984
How much is he paying you?

133
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:28,862
I am thinking about our party, Minister.

134
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:33,492
Escobar is prepared
to contribute millions of dollars.

135
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,080
We already support Jairo Ortega
so that he can campaign in Antioquia.

136
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:40,791
Let's let Escobar be his alternate.

137
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:44,461
What do you prefer...
rumors and insinuations,

138
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:46,922
or fewer representatives in Congress?

139
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,219
And just like that...
an honest man blinked.

140
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,471
You're not going back to that comuna!

141
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:57,099
What, you want me to stay
in this apartment for the next two years?

142
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,268
Oh, my God, you do.

143
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:02,146
Honey, your cat was killed
as a warning to me.

144
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,355
Our cat.

145
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:04,606
OK, our cat.

146
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:09,361
What if you went back to Miami just for
a little while until things quiet down?

147
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:13,281
- Oh, you're gonna make them quiet down?
- You're that good, huh?

148
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:16,952
I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back
to Miami if you agree to go back, too.

149
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,663
- You prepared to do that?
- I'm not giving in on this one!

150
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:31,842
OK. I'll be waiting to take you home.

151
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,220
I already stick out like a sore thumb.

152
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,555
The bodyguards
are only gonna draw more attention.

153
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:38,265
Just humor me.

154
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:41,351
I can't do my job
if I'm worried about your safety.

155
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,270
Mm...

156
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,652
Hey, mind parking
down the street a little?

157
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,279
I'll scream if I need you.

158
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:02,998
- Buenos días, Father.
- Connie.

159
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:04,624
What, are you surprised to see me?

160
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,335
We've had American volunteers.
They come and go.

161
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,962
Well, this one will keep coming.

162
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:16,595
Surprised to see Elisa,
a communist M-19 guerrilla,

163
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,222
working in the comuna?

164
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:22,059
That's because you don't know
the liberation church in Colombia.

165
00:11:22,226 --> 00:11:25,104
And the priest... innocent, right?

166
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:28,023
Wrong.
He's more of a commie than she is.

167
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:29,900
Who is the gringa?

168
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:31,610
A child of God, just like you.

169
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,486
Hm. Got it.

170
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:43,538
Let's see, you are here for a cat?

171
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:47,126
This isn't just any cat.
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.

172
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:49,836
- What's he saying?
- I'm telling him about the cat.

173
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,506
And what you want
is for me to find a cat killer.

174
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:57,886
It was the narcos, Suárez.
We don't take this shit lightly.

175
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,056
Your friend is a little crazy.

176
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:03,475
No hablo español.
I don't know what you're saying.

177
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:04,935
I don't speak English.

178
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,439
Get me some information, Suárez.

179
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,317
Look, I don't have enough people

180
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,403
to go through hundreds of hours of chatter
over a fucking cat.

181
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,199
If this was information about the narcos,
yes, my people are interested.

182
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:20,993
But they won't give a fuck about the cat.

183
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,829
- What is he saying?
- They don't like cats in this country.

184
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:25,247
Tell me about it.

185
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:28,834
But if you want
to put all my people to work

186
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:33,630
to find out who killed the fucking cat,
that is going to cost you more.

187
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,759
They broke into the house to kill his cat.

188
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,429
I think they made him
when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.

189
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:42,722
Find out.

190
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,270
- Is that a D-103?
- Yup.

191
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,148
Let me get this straight.
Gotta pay this cop off for information,

192
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:54,776
- then you gotta get a receipt?
- I gotta get reimbursed.

193
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:59,781
This gentleman is an employee
of the American Embassy in our country,

194
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:03,952
and he assures me that you gave out his
personal information to certain criminals.

195
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:06,246
That's not true.

196
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:09,791
These guys killed his cat.

197
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,045
Maybe you don't know this,
but the mistreatment of animals

198
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,462
is a federal crime.

199
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:17,090
Is this funny to you?

200
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:22,470
They can bring formal charges against you,
and you could lose your job.

201
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:25,349
Do you not need your job, Santiago?

202
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:27,600
Yes, I need it.

203
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:40,906
Mr. Murphy,
do you recognize these men?

204
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,742
Yeah, you guys
stalled me at the airport

205
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:47,413
so you could take my passport
and copy and scan it, didn't you?

206
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,581
- What?
- May I?

207
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:54,044
You both are being accused
of conspiring against a federal agent

208
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:55,712
of the United States.

209
00:13:56,504 --> 00:14:00,508
The cat is under the jurisdiction
of the American government.

210
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:03,470
And to kill it is the same
as to kill a police dog.

211
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:08,141
This is absurd.

212
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:13,272
Look, I'm a Colombian citizen,
and I know exactly my--

213
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:16,524
You will not disrespect them!

214
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,319
Is that clear?

215
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:25,158
If I open my mouth, they kill me...
and they kill my wife.

216
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,660
He's having problems with his wife.

217
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:28,912
Shut up!

218
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:31,873
- Imbecile.
- OK, gentlemen.

219
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,376
This is quite simple.

220
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:41,800
I can get the phone number of the person
to whom you sent those documents,

221
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:46,554
and I can tell him that you accused him
of being the cat killer.

222
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:48,140
How does that sound?

223
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:56,356
I sent a copy of that passport...

224
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,692
to a man they call...

225
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:02,279
"Poison."

226
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:07,200
OK, Poison.

227
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:10,496
You're going to take this money
to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.

228
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:12,372
And this is the address.

229
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:14,791
If they stop you on the road,
just salute the official,

230
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:17,336
give them a little bribe
and continue forward.

231
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,379
No violence.

232
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:21,340
And you call me every two hours.

233
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,758
- Of course, boss. Whatever you say.
- OK, then. No showing off.

234
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:26,261
No showing off!

235
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:30,474
- Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.
- Got it.

236
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:34,144
What the fuck are you doing?

237
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:36,896
Getting ready, right?

238
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:40,650
You are meeting up with politicians,
not with gangsters.

239
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,779
Aren't they the same thing, boss?

240
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:48,825
Politicians scare easily.

241
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,827
You're fine with just a pistol.

242
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,455
Go to it, then.
Go to it, dumbass.

243
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,625
According to CNP wiretaps,
the sicario "Poison"

244
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,170
was recorded saying
he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.

245
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:01,838
For what purpose,
we don't know.

246
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:04,799
But if we don't respond
to the obvious threat to Agent Murphy,

247
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,385
we're sending the wrong message.

248
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:08,845
Police have the information,
then they should make the arrest.

249
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,097
No. No, if we leave it to them,
someone will sell us out.

250
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:13,808
The narcos have informants
in their department.

251
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:16,562
What Peña's driving at is that
Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.

252
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,397
- We can trust Carrillo.
- I don't have authority

253
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,690
- over the Colombian police.
- All due respect, Ambassador,

254
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,526
but you know where we are.

255
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,361
With enough money,
you can get anything done.

256
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:31,535
Excuse me for saying so...
but this isn't much of a roadblock, is it?

257
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,036
Well, if the roadblock is too obvious,

258
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:36,456
Pablo can be tipped off
by a cop or by a passerby, who knows.

259
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,126
Can anybody in this country
keep a secret?

260
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,088
I've got a spotter set up
about four kilometers away.

261
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:44,714
He's gonna let us know
when Poison passes.

262
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:47,050
You're gonna question them, right?
Because we need to--

263
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,594
Poison's killed three of my men already.

264
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,678
If I catch him alive,
you guys can question him here.

265
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:52,931
Then you guys gotta go.

266
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:03,442
Hey, hey, hey, hold on, 65?

267
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:04,984
Sixty-five.

268
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,195
Hey, brother, that's a lot.

269
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,905
You sure?

270
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,575
I counted every single son of a bitch.

271
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:13,201
All right!

272
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:15,870
Sure, but are you counting
what happened last night?

273
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:17,664
Of course,
that was number 65.

274
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:21,293
Don't bullshit.
I was the one who shot that faggot.

275
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:24,129
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit...

276
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:26,005
if I was the one
who killed that little man.

277
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,426
You only shot him
once he was already on the ground, dead.

278
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:31,303
I shot him first.

279
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,101
Come in.

280
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,521
Did you give information about Poison
to the DEA?

281
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:42,814
So?

282
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:45,275
I'm still listening
to their phone conversations,

283
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:47,235
and it's not a shipment of drugs.

284
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,029
They're carrying
three million dollars to Bogotá,

285
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:51,657
and if two guys from the DEA
stop that car,

286
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:53,450
Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.

287
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:02,167
- You don't have 65, Poi.
- Yes, I do.

288
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,543
Eh!

289
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,381
What are you doing, Gonorrhea?!

290
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:11,050
Look, 65, man!

291
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:16,889
Now we're going
to have to wash the car, man!

292
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,184
Son of a bitch.

293
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,311
Yes?

294
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,021
Hi, Pablo.
I have good news for you.

295
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,565
I'm going to help you
avoid an enormous loss.

296
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:27,817
And how much is it going to cost me?

297
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,237
Ten percent... $300,000.

298
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:38,328
- How did you find out?
- One of your men.

299
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:41,789
That Poison... he talks too much.

300
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:44,125
You should take his phone away.

301
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,460
Five percent.

302
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:54,093
Suspicious vehicle approaching.

303
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:57,305
OK. We have visual
confirmation. Four kilometers away.

304
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:09,150
- Hello?
- Poison?

305
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:12,111
You bring your fucking mouth
back here immediately!

306
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,740
- Yes. I'm sorry, boss.
- Now!

307
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:19,160
The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

308
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:23,665
- These fags.
- You have a very big mouth, Poison.

309
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,333
Pablo is really pissed off.

310
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,462
Shut that mug,
or you will never reach 66, you hear?

311
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:40,390
OK!

312
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:49,232
I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.

313
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,653
- What the fuck has happened here?
- Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.

314
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,321
Either that or Suárez sold you out.

315
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,824
Yeah, if he did,
he must've had a better offer,

316
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,743
and it wasn't a fucking cat.

317
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,124
He has been called the "Paisa Robin Hood,"

318
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:08,126
but he is much more than that.

319
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:11,879
He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal. All of us.

320
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,882
To avoid suspicion
and questioning about his fortune,

321
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,261
Pablo ran as an alternate
for Jairo Ortega,

322
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:20,680
a former congressman from Antioquia.

323
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,312
It was the first time an alternate was
more important than the main candidate.

324
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:38,030
I am tired... of the
people with power running this country.

325
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:44,245
This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people, weak people.

326
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:48,124
And this fight must begin here!

327
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:57,300
To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

328
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,677
If I am elected...

329
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:03,181
if my friend, Jairo, is elected...

330
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:07,310
those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

331
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:13,441
Those who are hungry will have food.

332
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,944
Those who want to learn will have schools.

333
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,656
And those who have dreams

334
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:23,951
will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

335
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:27,997
In me, you have a friend

336
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,916
whom you have always had,

337
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:33,628
the friend of today, the friend
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.

338
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,049
Thank you very much.

339
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:43,304
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!
- Thank you very much.

340
00:21:48,852 --> 00:21:51,855
My friend, Jairo Ortega!

341
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,657
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

342
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:03,950
Thank you very much.

343
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,418
- You were marvelous, my love.
- You sure?

344
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:16,379
- Yes.
- Very good, Pablo.

345
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:19,465
There are a few things we can improve,
but we'll work on them.

346
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:20,466
OK, whatever you say.

347
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,344
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much, Valeria.

348
00:22:23,428 --> 00:22:24,679
Congratulations, ma'am.

349
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,015
Excuse me.

350
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:43,155
To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

351
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,747
Tata, what's wrong?

352
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,378
Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

353
00:22:57,462 --> 00:22:59,213
What are you talking about?

354
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:03,551
- Valeria Velez.
- My love...

355
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:08,306
Tata, she's a newspaper woman,
a reporter who follows the news.

356
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:11,183
And right now, I'm the news.

357
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:16,856
When you win, don't disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

358
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,692
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

359
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:22,278
Slowly... come on.

360
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,947
Come on.

361
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,245
You are going to be the First Lady
of this country one of these days.

362
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:35,416
Therefore, you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

363
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,419
That woman is not on your level, Pablo.

364
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:39,712
She degrades you.

365
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:42,465
Please, don't worry about Valeria.

366
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:48,763
Pablo!

367
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:52,475
A car, please!

368
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,686
A car to the hospital, now!

369
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:06,113
You know what, Pablo?

370
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:10,535
To me, it looks like
you are handling things very badly.

371
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:17,542
You need to start thinking more
about your family... and about business.

372
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:20,753
Thing is,
you can't be a politician.

373
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:22,797
Says who?

374
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:28,053
You can't go strutting around
giving things to people

375
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,846
simply so they will love you.

376
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:34,767
We... are bandits.

377
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:44,151
If you run for Congress, find someone else
to manage the laboratories.

378
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,362
Señor Escobar?

379
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:50,075
Come meet your daughter.

380
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:58,583
God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo.

381
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:04,089
How beautiful.

382
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:10,261
Shh.

383
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,888
Shh.

384
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,037
Pablo is out of control.

385
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:42,501
Mother Mary, man.
What do you want us to do?

386
00:25:42,585 --> 00:25:46,965
You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking
as though he were some spoiled brat.

387
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:48,257
Oh, no?

388
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,259
And why not?

389
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:53,096
Careful with the threat
you cannot execute.

390
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,519
You know what he's doing, right?

391
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:05,608
According to Colombian law,
a congressman has total immunity.

392
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:09,904
Do you think he's protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?

393
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:13,240
I do. He thinks he's that fucking
"Paisa Robin Hood."

394
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:15,409
So what do we do?

395
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:20,790
Well... we fulfill our duties,
stuffing the ballot box,

396
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:25,920
and later we let Pablo receive
the applause, and take the risk.

397
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:32,051
We continue with our business...
in the shadows, like always.

398
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,513
Carlos, what are the guys saying?

399
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:39,350
I imagine that they're worried, right?

400
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,020
They are not politically conscious,
brother.

401
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:48,359
How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?

402
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,323
You do understand me, brother.

403
00:26:56,534 --> 00:27:00,329
Imagine... a state governed by us.

404
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:03,749
Immunity for everyone, brother.

405
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,711
We, Carlos, belong to the people.

406
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:10,131
I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.

407
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:12,258
If you win,
you don't need to explain anything.

408
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:16,137
And if you lose...
there's nothing to explain.

409
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:17,763
I like that.

410
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,142
- Hitler said it.
- Fuck off.

411
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:22,727
Yes.

412
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,478
He also said that no politician

413
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:27,899
should ever let his picture be taken
in a bathing suit.

414
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,504
Well, that's what he said.

415
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:55,176
And if I tell you, Carlos...

416
00:27:57,011 --> 00:28:00,723
that what I want, sincerely...

417
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,851
is to help the poor people
of this country...

418
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,938
do you believe me or what?

419
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:11,400
Pablo held most of his campaign rallies

420
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,153
in the poorest neighborhoods
of his electoral district.

421
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:17,949
He placed himself on the side
of the poor and the weak

422
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:21,493
in the fight against the oligarchs,
"The Men of Always."

423
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:26,999
And just like any politician,
he made plenty of promises.

424
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:31,420
Only difference was Pablo had the men
and the money to back them up.

425
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:36,425
It was becoming clear to everyone
that Pablo was gonna win.

426
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:37,927
Pablo! Pablo!

427
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,264
The only question remaining was...
what to do about that.

428
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,559
Gustavo made good on his promise
to quit the labs,

429
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:49,105
so Pablo put Carlos Lehder in charge.

430
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:53,818
With characteristic German efficiency,
he turned the labs into Nazilandia,

431
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:57,404
and production rose 12 percent
in just two short months.

432
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:03,369
Gacha and the Ochoas
adopted a wait-and-see attitude,

433
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,497
debating how and when
Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega,

434
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,624
his front man,
once the election was over.

435
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:13,545
As soon as the results
come out, Jairo Ortega will resign.

436
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,799
I say he's running toward his death.

437
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,640
As for us, we were kind of divided.

438
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,726
We cannot have Colombia
become a narco state.

439
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,729
We need to find someone
who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.

440
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:32,690
Let's stop his campaign before it starts.

441
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,483
No one will go on record.

442
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,111
I got a better idea.

443
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,697
We let him win.

444
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:41,949
If we put him in the spotlight
and prove he's a trafficker,

445
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,660
the embarrassment alone
might get this country off its ass.

446
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,664
But first, we had to get proof

447
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:51,250
that Pablo was the drug dealer
we knew he was.

448
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,502
So we went to Suárez,

449
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,921
and gave him a lot of money.

450
00:29:57,173 --> 00:30:01,427
First, he told us that Pablo
was arrested for trafficking back in '76,

451
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,181
and then he gave us the name
of a sergeant who could give us the files.

452
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:13,480
Problem was, Suárez was on both the DEA
and the narcos' payroll.

453
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,741
- Sixty-six.
- Bullshit. I shot him first.

454
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,039
Then Suárez gave us
the name of the journalist

455
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,417
who reported the arrest...

456
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,169
...and then the lawyer
who defended Pablo...

457
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:38,381
and finally, the judge
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.

458
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,801
We were like the Bermuda Triangle.

459
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,221
You get too close to us,
you disappear.

460
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:47,681
We gotta get something
on this motherfucker.

461
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,893
If he was arrested,
there's gotta be a mug shot.

462
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,937
Yeah, well, the file's gone.

463
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,481
If there was a mug shot,
then it's gone, too.

464
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,026
If there was a photo,
there's a negative.

465
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:02,029
Finally, it dawned on us.

466
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:05,574
We had to find someone
without Suárez's help,

467
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:10,121
and that was the photographer
who had taken Pablo's mug shot years ago.

468
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,504
We got his negatives, and for safekeeping,
we put him into witness protection.

469
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,718
- How long have you had this picture?
- That's classified.

470
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,638
And what am I doing here?

471
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,599
It's not America's role to get involved
in other countries' elections.

472
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,685
Once again, the hand
of the United States remains invisible.

473
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,604
Your party took money from Escobar.

474
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,440
I should think
you'd want to get ahead of this.

475
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:38,816
Everyone took money.

476
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:43,237
By the way, it's all American money,
so why don't you take this to the press?

477
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:46,198
It should come from you.
You're the Minister of Justice.

478
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:52,079
Come election day,
sure enough, it was a landslide.

479
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,540
The New Liberal party had the candidate

480
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,543
who got the most votes
in all of Antioquia...

481
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,753
and his name was Jairo Ortega.

482
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,713
Ladies and gentlemen,

483
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:04,883
with clear use of my
mental and physical faculties...

484
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:08,929
I wish to communicate to you my decision

485
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:12,766
to resign from my seat
in the Congress of the Republic...

486
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:16,479
...for reasons of family and health.

487
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:20,774
But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria

488
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:24,778
is going to continue
our social and political ideas,

489
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,698
because Pablo is the voice of the people.

490
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,741
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, Jairo.

491
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,618
I will give my best effort.

492
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:32,578
Thank you very much.

493
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,447
Imagine you were born in a poor family,

494
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:12,451
in a poor city, in a poor country,

495
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:14,828
and by the time you were 28 years old,

496
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,956
you have so much money
you can't even count it.

497
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,711
What do you do?

498
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:26,006
You make your dreams come true.

499
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,974
Problem is, nobody can control
the dreams they have.

500
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,065
Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.

501
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:47,653
Especially if you grew up in Colombia.

502
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,869
There's a reason magical realism
was born in Colombia.

503
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:00,999
It's a country where
dreams and reality are conflated...

504
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,880
where, in their heads,
people fly as high as Icarus.

505
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,678
But even magical realism has its limits.

506
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:16,265
Congressman Escobar... Sir!

507
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,933
Excuse me.

508
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,561
Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

509
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:22,896
You cannot enter the hall
if you don't have a tie.

510
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,109
All right.

511
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:29,570
- What is your name?
- Juan.

512
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:31,238
Look, Juan...

513
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,117
that is a really nice tie.

514
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,661
- My girlfriend gave it to me.
- Really?

515
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,078
Yes.

516
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:41,748
Well, she's in the history books now.

517
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,418
- Thank you very much, my son.
- Thank you, sir.

518
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:45,836
- Thank you.
- All right.

519
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,676
And when you get too close to the sun...

520
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:54,803
your dreams may melt away.

521
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:10,861
Good morning.

522
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:16,408
This is to inform you that we have
a quorum and may now begin our session.

523
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,790
The Minister of Justice,
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla,

524
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,711
is present here today
to address this honorable Congress.

525
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:30,381
I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister.

526
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:31,882
Thank you very much.

527
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:41,600
Much has been made
of the issue of drug money,

528
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:47,231
"hot money,"
in our national political process.

529
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:52,194
I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions

530
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:55,989
from the narcotics traffickers
who have bought influence in these halls.

531
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:03,581
To this charge, I plead guilty.

532
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,836
In my eyes,
the sin of turning a blind eye

533
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,256
is as great as the sin
of outright corruption.

534
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:16,051
We are a nation of the blind,
and in our blindness,

535
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:19,179
we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

536
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,602
It's time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

537
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,360
Congressman Escobar...

538
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:38,741
you stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.

539
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:45,080
This photograph
clearly contradicts your claim.

540
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:48,375
For this reason,
I demand your resignation.

541
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,628
You are not welcome in this chamber.

542
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,004
You don't belong here.

543
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:41,846
Thank you very much, Juan.
Very kind.

544
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:43,639
What interests the narcos

545
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:47,309
isn't just the fall
of the Minister of Justice,

546
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:51,313
but also to impede the strategy of
the government to combat his interests.

547
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:55,275
His two arms: silver or lead.

548
00:37:55,442 --> 00:38:01,573
I want to inform the people
that the Minister of Justice has 24 hours

549
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:05,452
within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

550
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:08,497
the day before yesterday
in the Hall of Representatives.

551
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,751
To the contrary,
I will proceed to denounce him legally

552
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,629
before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.

553
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,340
Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense,

554
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,718
trying to smear Lara with accusations.

555
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:23,804
I am not looking
for, nor do I long for a confrontation

556
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:25,013
before the Colombian people.

557
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,600
I look for peace,
I have always preached peace,

558
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:32,604
and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.

559
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:36,233
It's important to realize
that when members of Congress

560
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,361
can be threatened or bought at will,

561
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:43,908
we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.

562
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,659
But Lara wouldn't back down.

563
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:48,245
He denounced narcos at every opportunity,

564
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,248
going after the guys
that we hadn't been able to touch.

565
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,668
He revealed that six
of the country's nine soccer teams

566
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:56,503
were owned by drug traffickers.

567
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:02,008
Gacha the Mexican was forced
to give up ownership of his team,

568
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,595
aptly nicknamed "The Millionaires."

569
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:09,850
Lara denied flying permits
for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.

570
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,231
He even fined Pablo
for illegal importation

571
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,066
of elephants and camels from Africa.

572
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,696
And with the action of one brave man,

573
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,824
Pablo knew his dream
of presidency was over.

574
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,076
What are required are honest men,

575
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,831
men who are able to put themselves
up against drug traffickers,

576
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:39,797
who with complete tranquility buy or kill
any person or government institution

577
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,673
who is against their interests.

578
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:45,677
Rodrigo Lara became the most
important political figure in Colombia

579
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,805
with his stand against the narcos.

580
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,348
He just wouldn't stop going after them.

581
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:55,186
His bravery in the face of danger made him
the most wanted man in the country.

582
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,566
For his own safety, he was appointed
Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

583
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:04,195
He was slated to leave in two weeks,
but a lot could happen in two weeks.

584
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,074
I think it might be a good idea
for you to wear this until you leave.

585
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,078
You feel responsible, is that it?

586
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,040
Somewhat, yes, sir.

587
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:20,253
Are you so arrogant to think
you had any influence over my actions?

588
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:24,382
That I put my life
and the life of my family at risk

589
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,677
for American policy objectives?

590
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:31,473
Let me assure you, Agent Murphy,
outside of providing me with the picture,

591
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:33,224
you... did nothing.

592
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:37,604
The decision to speak out
was solely mine.

593
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:40,607
And I highly advise you
to wear this vest, sir.

594
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:56,707
I will accept this vest... out of respect
for your concern with my well-being.

595
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,960
But I would advise you one thing
while you remain in Colombia.

596
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:01,378
And what is that?

597
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:05,799
We accept your help,
but never your condescension.

598
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:10,929
When all this is over, Colombians
will be the heroes, and the victims.

599
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:15,350
John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.

600
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,728
Just wear the vest.

601
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:32,826
Oh, Pablito.

602
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,704
We knew they wouldn't
accept you in that circle.

603
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:40,625
Damned bastards.

604
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:49,426
You're too good for them, Pablito.

605
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,243
This is a fight
that you cannot win, cousin.

606
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:21,041
You need to think more
about your family and the business...

607
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:26,088
and abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

608
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,178
I will fix it.

609
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,401
Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

610
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:51,780
by Minister Lara and his cronies,

611
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:55,492
I've decided to announce my resignation
from Congress of the Republic.

612
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:01,165
I ran as a representative
for the common man,

613
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:04,126
a voice for those who had no voice,

614
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:07,587
but that has happened
through much of our history.

615
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:11,925
The powerful have conspired to silence me.

616
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,469
I dreamt of doing good.

617
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,973
Those dreams are over.

618
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:24,896
But make no mistake...
I will not go quietly.

619
00:43:25,897 --> 00:43:27,273
I will fight.

620
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:30,610
"The Men of Always" are mistaken

621
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:34,990
if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!

622
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:47,335
Thank you very much.

623
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:51,339
Thank you very much.

624
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:16,531
He didn't wear it.

625
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,327
Wouldn't have made a difference.

626
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:25,249
Our strategy had gotten a good man killed.

627
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,920
It was the first time
I'd felt guilty about my job.

628
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:36,676
- As for Suárez...
- Hey.

629
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,179
...he made so much money
playing both sides,

630
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:44,601
he decided to lift our spirits by giving
the DEA a token of his appreciation.

631
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:49,022
I brought this for your friend's wife.

632
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,817
- I hope she likes it.
- No, gracias.

633
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,819
You're fucking crazy, asshole.

634
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:05,026
