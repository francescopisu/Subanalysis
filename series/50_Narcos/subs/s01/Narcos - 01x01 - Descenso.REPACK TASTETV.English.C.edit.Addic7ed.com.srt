00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:24,576
_

2
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:28,572
_

3
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:32,096
_

4
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:40,723
Nowadays, the US
government can listen to anything you say.

5
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:44,143
They know where you are,
they know who you're talking to,

6
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:47,605
and trust me,
they know who you're fucking.

7
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:51,442
You turn on a cell phone or a computer,
and you're doomed.

8
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:56,656
But in Colombia in 1989,
it wasn't that easy.

9
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,950
First off,
there was no Internet.

10
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,451
No cells.

11
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,203
The best they had were satellite phones,

12
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:06,541
and in order to capture a satellite phone,
you had to fly directly over it.

13
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:10,920
On top of that, the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

14
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,381
the landowners, the politicians...

15
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:18,469
And lucky for us,
the narcos were richer than them all.

16
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:24,225
What's up, Lizard?

17
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,603
We're going out tonight.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,944
And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.

19
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,614
That's why back then, the US government
developed software that could identify

20
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,158
the voices of our targets.

21
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:45,371
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.

22
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,499
And you guessed it:
no GPS either.

23
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,960
Hammer, prepare to engage.

24
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:54,463
Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.

25
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,300
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

26
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:04,057
OK, he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,308
Hawkeye, how do you copy that?

28
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,938
Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

29
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:12,189
La Dispensaria.

30
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:14,859
I've got a table ready.

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,487
Show up around midnight.

32
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,616
- It's gonna be raining women.
- Poison didn't know it,

33
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,910
but he'd just made himself a date.

34
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,914
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

35
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,874
Hammer, disengage.

36
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,251
So who do we give this to? DEA?

37
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:35,838
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

38
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,007
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

39
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:42,470
By "the other guy," he meant me.

40
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,723
I'm Steve Murphy,
Drug Enforcement Agent.

41
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:50,352
And as you can see,
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

42
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,479
Hello?

43
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,023
Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

44
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:54,941
Got it.

45
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,652
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

46
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:59,070
OK.

47
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,739
I would've loved
to go after Poison myself,

48
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:05,160
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

49
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:09,246
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,498
Hola.

51
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:14,251
La Dispensaria?

52
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,377
All right.

53
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,381
Guess who that was.

54
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:21,717
Your partner.

55
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,512
He just gave me a great gift.

56
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,973
Poison.

57
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,063
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

58
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,315
Yeah, sure.

59
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,526
He's not a fool.

60
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,820
Gotta go.

61
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:44,907
Gonna stick me with the bill?

62
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,455
Cheap son of a bitch.

63
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,167
In case you're wondering,
this is the asshole.

64
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,128
Javier Peña, my partner.

65
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,715
And this is Colonel Carrillo,
the leader of the Search Bloc,

66
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:03,759
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

67
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,637
Boy, did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

68
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,436
Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,355
Especially the local hitmen.

70
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,191
Colombians call them sicarios.

71
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:21,027
- What's up, son?
- Hey, brother.

72
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:24,530
Let's go inside and have a good time.

73
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,615
Now, Poison, he was one of the best.

74
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:30,619
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.

75
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,163
Probably hundreds.

76
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,040
But don't get me wrong.

77
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:37,376
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.

78
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,963
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

79
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,430
It's on, boys!

80
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:52,767
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

81
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,895
Riano, Trujillo,
you're in the front with me.

82
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:58,189
- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.
- Yes, sir.

83
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:00,775
You got it, boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

84
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,652
We're gonna kill these fuckers,
all right?

85
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,154
Yes, sir!

86
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:20,253
I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.

87
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,676
Yeah, I pushed the buttons.

88
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,191
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.

89
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:10,748
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull

90
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,367
My fellow Americans...

91
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,785
Take Richard Nixon, for instance.

92
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,956
People forget,
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

93
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,959
We thought he was one of the good guys.

94
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:27,255
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

95
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,048
because he hated the commies.

96
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:31,717
So we helped Pinochet seize power.

97
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:39,934
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.

98
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:45,689
Maybe not such a good guy after all.

99
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:55,241
But sometimes,
bad guys do good things.

100
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,705
Nobody knows this, but back in '73,
Chile was on its way

101
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,709
to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

102
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:10,672
How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

103
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,302
They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

104
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,511
to ship the product north.

105
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:19,265
To be productive,
you can't waste money! Come on!

106
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:22,351
You're surrounded!

107
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,853
- Hands up!
- Everybody on your knees!

108
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,481
But Pinochet spoiled the party.

109
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,441
What the fuck is going on here?

110
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:29,525
On the ground!

111
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:33,862
He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.

112
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,994
And then, being Pinochet...

113
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:43,080
he had them all killed.

114
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:45,791
Attention!

115
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:48,419
Weapons ready!

116
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:49,920
Aim!

117
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:51,922
Ready ammunition!

118
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,883
Fire!

119
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:07,896
They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world,

120
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,900
only the cockroaches will survive.

121
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,694
I guess they were right.

122
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:20,951
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno,
aka Cockroach,

123
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,287
and he was smart enough to play dead.

124
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,501
He wasn't killed on that day.

125
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:33,922
Instead, he won the damn lottery.

126
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:41,013
Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

127
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:44,433
Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

128
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,020
A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

129
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:51,482
Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

130
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:54,443
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

131
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,990
- But you're not a communist.
- No, not a communist, something worse.

132
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:02,410
A drug trafficker.

133
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:05,746
- A drug trafficker?
- Yes, a drug trafficker.

134
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:12,253
Back then, we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine

135
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:15,172
on the human brain.

136
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:18,509
We didn't know much, but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.

137
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,928
...this will give us better results, OK?

138
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:24,223
Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.

139
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:27,518
A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

140
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:33,441
It would choose cocaine over sleep,
over sex... over life itself.

141
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:36,652
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

142
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:40,906
unless we're talking about cocaine.

143
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:49,373
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

144
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:52,709
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

145
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,169
Gracias.

146
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,924
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

147
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,134
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

148
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,348
Like Goldilocks,
he had three options.

149
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,685
And pay attention, because all three
are important to this story.

150
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,568
The Ochoa brothers:
Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse.

151
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:21,363
A typical Colombian smuggling family.

152
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,865
- They were smart and rich...
- Salud!

153
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,119
...but Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

154
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:31,957
Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha,

155
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,836
nicknamed "The Mexican,"
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

156
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,714
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

157
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:49,183
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,
even by Colombian standards.

158
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,767
If you make it to the top...

159
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,230
it means you've killed your enemies.

160
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,360
Hey, partner. What are you doing here?

161
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,195
And sometimes, your partners.

162
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,037
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

163
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,671
So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.

164
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,761
Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

165
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,180
The man who would
change my life forever.

166
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:33,394
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

167
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,937
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,
you name it.

168
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,817
At the time,
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.

169
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:45,406
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

170
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,701
They didn't play by the same rules.

171
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:51,579
Good day.

172
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,622
Pablo Escobar?

173
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,123
Where's Felipo?

174
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:57,251
Felipo's been arrested.

175
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,127
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

176
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,214
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

177
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:04,717
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

178
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,927
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.

179
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,596
Show some respect.

180
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,016
Now what's the problem,
Mr. Jose Luis?

181
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,104
How do you know my name?

182
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:19,356
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

183
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,069
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

184
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:31,118
There's Garcia, Lopez...

185
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,245
- Is that Pinilla?
- Yes, Pinilla.

186
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:34,455
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

187
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:36,039
Pinilla...

188
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,958
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

189
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,127
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

190
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,754
I don't have all day.

191
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,551
Open it.

192
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,604
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.

193
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:01,398
Who the fuck do you think you are?

194
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:04,901
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

195
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,779
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.

196
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,572
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

197
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:10,449
Where are your import papers?

198
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,786
You need papers for these TV sets.

199
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,287
Take them.

200
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:22,085
Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

201
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,505
- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

202
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,381
It's for Carlitos.

203
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,425
Your son.

204
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:33,305
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

205
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,809
Hey, Pinilla!

206
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,189
Your daughter just
got her driver's license, right?

207
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:48,195
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

208
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,492
That friend of yours, Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

209
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:56,995
- Right? She's a fox.
- Yeah.

210
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,873
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.

211
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,834
What's she doing with a guy like you?

212
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,676
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?

213
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:15,890
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

214
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,479
Colonel, how is your mom doing?

215
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,733
- She just got out of the hospital, right?
- Yes, she's feeling better.

216
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:28,985
- Good. That makes us happy, right?
- Yes.

217
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:31,530
Gentlemen...

218
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,783
I'm going to tell you who I am.

219
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:39,162
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

220
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,541
My eyes are everywhere.

221
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,587
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

222
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,755
without me knowing about it.

223
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:50,925
Do you understand? Not a finger.

224
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:57,765
One day, I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

225
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:02,895
So look, I make deals for a living.

226
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:06,523
Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

227
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,860
or accept the consequences.

228
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,865
Silver...

229
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,076
or lead.

230
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,121
You decide.

231
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,711
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- All right, then.

232
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,383
Yo, Pablo!

233
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,845
- This is Pablo.
- Hello.

234
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:19,888
- Nice to meet you.
- Mateo Moreno.

235
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,474
No, no, no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

236
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,476
All right,
yesterday we were talking,

237
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,023
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

238
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:30,482
Explain.

239
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:33,610
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

240
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,737
I will handle
the chemical part of production,

241
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,323
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

242
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,826
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

243
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:44,287
Now tell him how much it costs.

244
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:48,333
In Chile, this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

245
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:52,170
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes, it's very good. Look...

246
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:57,467
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.

247
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,053
Also...

248
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,472
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

249
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,100
It's very clean, this stuff.
Want some?

250
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,812
If this is really that good
and we can make some money,

251
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:10,814
we can find room on our trucks.

252
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:13,358
We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena...

253
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,819
We're going to be rich.

254
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:18,655
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

255
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,117
Well look, Cuca...

256
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:25,120
you don't have any vision,
my friend.

257
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:30,125
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

258
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,379
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

259
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,968
I love that song.

260
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,723
Rodrigo! One more.

261
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:10,582
Back then, Miami was a paradise.

262
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,543
I signed up for the sand,
surf and women.

263
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:18,465
In '79, the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

264
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,716
DEA! Stop!

265
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,929
I was a young DEA agent,
partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady.

266
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:27,182
Kevin was a little slow afoot.

267
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,728
Why you running, huh?

268
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,815
What you got?
What is this? Huh?

269
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:35,816
What is that?

270
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:39,027
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

271
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,196
Let's go celebrate.

272
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:42,864
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

273
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,828
Go! Go! Go!

274
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:50,371
How you like me now?

275
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,623
How much money you owe me?

276
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:53,458
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

277
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,169
That's right, that's right.

278
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,757
All right.
All right, who do we pick?

279
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,467
How 'bout her?

280
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,969
No, no, no,
we gotta fuck with him.

281
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,054
- Yeah, let's mess with his head.
- Um...

282
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,973
Oh, right there.
See her? At the bar?

283
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:10,184
- Which one?
- Blue top, blond hair. That's his type.

284
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:13,353
- Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

285
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:14,729
- All right.
- Whoo!

286
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,940
Murph! Sparrow, three o'clock.

287
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:20,861
Hey, while you were walking back,
she was checking your ass out.

288
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,487
Oh, she was checking out your ass.

289
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,989
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

290
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:27,951
Listen, she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

291
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,704
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

292
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:34,332
I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.

293
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,127
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

294
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,753
No, the other one.
Of course the blond one.

295
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,547
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

296
00:20:41,297 --> 00:20:44,592
You dicking me around?

297
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:48,930
Fuck it, I'm going in.

298
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,182
- Go get her.
- Mm!

299
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,059
- Yup.
- Hey, while you're up there,

300
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,643
get us another pitcher, will ya?

301
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,855
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

302
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,366
How you doing?

303
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,202
Busy.

304
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:15,331
I just said, "Look, if you don't
wanna be there, you don't have to be.

305
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:18,626
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So, I don't know...

306
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,674
Yeah, those bastards got me.

307
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:27,094
But I couldn't let it end like that.

308
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:30,013
Excuse me.
See those guys over there?

309
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:32,599
Uh, they're fucking with me.

310
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:36,144
Telling me you were checking out my ass,
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?

311
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,478
You're a cop?

312
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,898
Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.

313
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:41,149
Drug Enforcement?

314
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,235
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

315
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,613
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?

316
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,283
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you, uh...

317
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:51,076
give me your phone number?

318
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,494
How about a fake number?

319
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,580
That'll work.

320
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,125
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?

321
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:15,391
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

322
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,894
Have a good night.

323
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:23,275
Aah...

324
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:24,525
Shot down!

325
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:28,363
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh, I...

326
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:30,531
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

327
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,994
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

328
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:36,537
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

329
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,290
How much did that cost you?

330
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:40,500
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

331
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,592
I figured, what the hell.

332
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:53,096
Worst that could happen,
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

333
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:00,687
Hello?

334
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,648
So it wasn't a fake.

335
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:06,193
I thought you might figure it out.

336
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:08,695
After all, you're DEA.

337
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,157
And just like that... she had me.

338
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:18,621
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,

339
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,498
cocaine had him.

340
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,919
It's been a while.

341
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,588
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

342
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,092
Would you like a little coffee?

343
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,802
Yeah, a coffee?

344
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:33,887
Yes, a coffee.

345
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,055
- How about you, Pablo?
- No.

346
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:36,681
You sure?

347
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:40,894
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

348
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:45,857
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

349
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,610
Little magic leaves.

350
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,448
The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

351
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:59,495
Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

352
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,667
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

353
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:08,755
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

354
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,673
Let it dry, dry, dry.

355
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:12,508
You use ammonia to get the paste.

356
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:18,139
And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

357
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,475
Here is the prize.

358
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,977
It's like the kitchen in your house.

359
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,065
Like baking a cake.

360
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,069
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

361
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,365
Look, an old press, an antique.

362
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:42,956
Now we put it in the oven.

363
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,666
Here's one.
The other will follow.

364
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,836
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

365
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:51,089
Well...

366
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:55,635
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

367
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,930
- No.
- You said a kilo.

368
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:00,432
We'll take five.

369
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:04,436
How do we get five across the border?

370
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,396
That's Gustavo's department.

371
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,112
This one has got a good engine.

372
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,823
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

373
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,117
would be under the rear wheel well.

374
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,328
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

375
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:22,745
Is this easy to take off?

376
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,540
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

377
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:28,001
All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.

378
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:31,045
- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.

379
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:34,715
All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

380
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,968
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

381
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:42,223
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

382
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,518
For three cars, that's 60 kilos.

383
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,937
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram, what?

384
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,564
$9,000 per kilo.

385
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:52,192
$9,000 times 60...
The profit is $540,000.

386
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,486
That's it!

387
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,404
- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?
- Yeah.

388
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,198
OK, Pablo and I drive fast.

389
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:02,160
That's half a million dollars... per trip,

390
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:05,372
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

391
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,959
Easiest money he ever made.

392
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:18,218
Back in Medellín,
Pablo didn't waste any time.

393
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:19,969
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

394
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:25,099
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

395
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,935
How are you feeling, Gustavo?

396
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:31,523
All this smells like shit to me.

397
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:35,151
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

398
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:37,571
The stinkier, the better.

399
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:39,489
All right.

400
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,325
What about all these lights?

401
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,413
Is that to tip off the cops,
or what?

402
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:50,833
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

403
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:53,836
I'm the artist here, clear?

404
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,129
Clear.

405
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,257
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

406
00:26:57,424 --> 00:27:01,719
It was a mom-and-pop operation,
so small they called it The Kitchen.

407
00:27:01,802 --> 00:27:05,557
But make no mistake,
it would change Medellín forever.

408
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,101
You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

409
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:17,569
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

410
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,869
Let's build them a chimney.

411
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:33,167
There you go.

412
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,171
Gentlemen, the first three?

413
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,716
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

414
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,843
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

415
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,180
- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.

416
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,767
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

417
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,936
I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

418
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:58,985
Like her son, Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

419
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:03,197
Hey, Mom,
how much do you think we can fit in there?

420
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,701
- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

421
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,202
Trust me, Pablito.

422
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,246
I love it. Let's do it.

423
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,252
- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.

424
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,590
It's Gustavo.

425
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,800
Five kilos, right?

426
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:26,429
Pablo loved his young bride Tata,
and she loved him.

427
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:28,931
He was a family man till the end.

428
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:32,185
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

429
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:34,103
- Meet my friend.
- Hello, how are you doing?

430
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,313
Hey, Pablo, this is Lion.

431
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:38,525
He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

432
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:40,943
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich, right?

433
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:43,029
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

434
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:44,656
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.

435
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:45,990
Here's three.

436
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:48,702
We're going to need two more,
right, Mom?

437
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:50,578
- That's right.
- Pablito...

438
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,080
make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

439
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,417
Look, my love...
it won't fit me.

440
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,252
Try it on.

441
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,546
Come here.

442
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:01,422
That's it.

443
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,923
Good, right?

444
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:06,511
One...

445
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,889
- two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!

446
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:11,432
...three.

447
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:15,269
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

448
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,021
He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?

449
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:19,982
Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

450
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:23,653
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

451
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:25,238
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

452
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:27,407
He looks very handsome, son.

453
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,825
Like a fag model, isn't that right?

454
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,830
The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

455
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,252
Welcome to the United States.

456
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:42,004
Thank you.
Have a great day.

457
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:42,963
Next, please.

458
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,842
His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder,

459
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:51,806
half Colombian, half German,
and 100 percent playboy.

460
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:55,184
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

461
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:57,061
Go figure.

462
00:29:57,144 --> 00:30:01,065
Back in '79, this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

463
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:02,734
on a fleet of small planes.

464
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,736
- What's up?
- What's up, son?

465
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:06,862
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

466
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,448
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

467
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,157
Whoo! It's so hot.

468
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,118
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

469
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,578
You like my jacket, brother?

470
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,790
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

471
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,419
I was in jail for a while, remember?

472
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,548
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

473
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:28,426
What you got there
is the perfect product.

474
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,970
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

475
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:33,889
It's gonna fuck up their brains,
that's for sure.

476
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:35,015
Yes, sir.

477
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:39,895
Here you go.

478
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:43,483
Go on. There are five kilos.

479
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,318
Where are you going?

480
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:47,987
I'm gonna get another jacket,
brother.

481
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,406
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

482
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,288
The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.

483
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,666
Drugs in, cash out.

484
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:03,002
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

485
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:06,547
And in no time,
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

486
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:10,217
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes,

487
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,679
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

488
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,765
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

489
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,393
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

490
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,937
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

491
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:25,817
Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,
going back and forth every day...

492
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,987
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

493
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,448
Pretty soon,
the Lion had to come up with new ways

494
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:34,617
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

495
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:37,328
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

496
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:39,914
You guys are pilots,

497
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:43,376
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

498
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,298
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

499
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,343
We'll take four.

500
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:53,887
All right, much better.

501
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:58,683
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

502
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:01,811
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

503
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,437
- See you later.
- Later.

504
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,148
Come in, please.

505
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,031
Look, here are the packets.

506
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:17,702
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

507
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,078
Easy, right?

508
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:21,706
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

509
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:22,874
All right?

510
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:25,042
But with you two,
we have a problem.

511
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,044
You girls are pregnant, right?

512
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:31,758
That's good, because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

513
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:36,679
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

514
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:39,891
And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

515
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:42,435
All right? All right. Perfect.

516
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,355
During the early '80s,
most flights out of Bogotá

517
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:48,274
had several mules on them.

518
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,443
They didn't even know about each other.

519
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:52,111
And you know what?

520
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:56,323
Getting in was easy, because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

521
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,367
All we cared about was grass.

522
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:05,959
Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

523
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:10,087
Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...
anything.

524
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:29,148
But even that didn't do it.

525
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:34,487
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

526
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,700
Do you trust this guy?

527
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,369
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

528
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,539
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.

529
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,249
But he's got good routes.

530
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:52,964
- Amigos!
- Hello, Carlos.

531
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:54,423
Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.

532
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:55,758
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

533
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:57,677
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

534
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,763
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

535
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,348
Smooth.

536
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,683
Let's get down to business.

537
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:07,645
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

538
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:10,982
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

539
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:13,776
- How far?
- Miami.

540
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,240
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- 1000 kilos?

541
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,076
Counting the gasoline.

542
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:32,003
Carlos...

543
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,005
Yes?

544
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:41,428
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

545
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,307
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

546
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,142
We'll leave the engine, right?

547
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:49,937
How much more?

548
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,439
About... 300 more.

549
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,486
All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

550
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:01,908
Within months after meeting Cockroach,

551
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:07,080
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

552
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:11,751
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics, folks.

553
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:15,922
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

554
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:17,506
in the middle of the jungle.

555
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:22,553
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest,

556
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:27,641
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

557
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:33,940
We brought you a little present.

558
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,317
Brazilians.

559
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:42,197
Best asses in the world,
believe me.

560
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:44,784
No, I'm not feeling well.

561
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,410
- What's up, Cuca?
- Hello.

562
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:48,370
Hey, Gustavo.

563
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:51,832
What the fuck is up with you guys?

564
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,585
You're flying around in planes...

565
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:56,963
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look, Cuca--

566
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:59,715
Look, let us explain what we have to--

567
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,467
Wait.

568
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,845
From now on,
in all of my labs...

569
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:09,516
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning, with a pool...

570
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,019
- And whores from Brazil.
- ...and whores from Brazil.

571
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,521
- Just for you.
- One problem.

572
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,525
These are my labs. Mm?

573
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:28,619
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

574
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:31,122
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

575
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:34,458
Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

576
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:38,212
They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.

577
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:41,507
Guys used to getting what they want,
one way or another.

578
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,302
How something like this
can make so much money!

579
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:49,556
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

580
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,600
What do you think, Pablo?

581
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,061
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

582
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:55,813
I wouldn't get involved.

583
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:59,150
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

584
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:01,485
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

585
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,948
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

586
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:08,951
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

587
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,746
the Peruvians will raise the price.

588
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,750
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

589
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,254
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

590
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:25,092
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

591
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,555
You need a lot of creativity for that.

592
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:33,809
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

593
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:37,688
You deliver the product to me, labeled.

594
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:41,316
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

595
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,986
Better yet, Lehder will do it.

596
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,156
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,

597
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,744
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

598
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:53,662
The potato business is ours.
We don't need--

599
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,497
Deal?

600
00:37:58,751 --> 00:37:59,919
Deal.

601
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:02,213
Sounds good to me.

602
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:07,676
All right,
I will create my own routes

603
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,305
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

604
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:13,266
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.

605
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:15,726
Partners?

606
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:22,608
We know your policy toward partners.

607
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:25,861
Let's just call us...

608
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:27,696
"friendly associates."

609
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:30,991
To Miami.

610
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,160
To Miami!

611
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:47,841
When I started, a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

612
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:57,768
And before long,
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

613
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,316
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

614
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:12,325
Truth is,
we weren't even making a dent.

615
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,578
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

616
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,007
Pablo's coke flooded in.

617
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:31,551
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

618
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,095
And I mean that.

619
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:37,350
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

620
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,353
And with the money...

621
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:43,314
came the violence.

622
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,484
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians,

623
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:50,237
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

624
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,223
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

625
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:21,143
Use 'em once,
then throw 'em away.

626
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:26,648
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.

627
00:40:26,732 --> 00:40:29,609
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

628
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,653
to hold all the extra corpses.

629
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,699
That was the first person I ever shot.

630
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,161
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

631
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,975
Hey... it was self-defense.

632
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:05,145
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

633
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,148
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

634
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:10,776
He sells drugs, right?

635
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:14,071
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then fuck him.

636
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,371
What happened?

637
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:28,210
- Coming through!
- I was about to finish my shift

638
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,545
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

639
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:31,964
Stay with me.

640
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:33,632
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

641
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,719
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

642
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,265
By the time she got to us,
she was barely breathing.

643
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:45,102
- Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils, rapid pulse.

644
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,646
I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...

645
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:51,442
...but she had no residue on her nostrils,
no injection marks.

646
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,654
We did everything we could.

647
00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:58,365
She died in the ER.

648
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:02,536
We tried to save the baby...

649
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,085
The baby died in my hands.

650
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,340
I'm so sorry.

651
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,093
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

652
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:20,720
Two of the pellets split open.

653
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:26,268
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

654
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:30,272
No one survives that.

655
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:41,325
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

656
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:45,120
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

657
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:47,373
Tell me something, Cockroach.

658
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:50,083
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

659
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,670
Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

660
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:58,717
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

661
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,594
Let me give you a piece of advice.

662
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,056
Never say that to Pablo.

663
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:07,142
He's not as forgiving as I am.

664
00:43:13,148 --> 00:43:15,234
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.

665
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:18,695
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

666
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:22,616
Instead, he found another way
to get his fair share.

667
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:28,038
Stop!

668
00:43:38,424 --> 00:43:40,509
What do you have in the spare tires?

669
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:46,681
390 kilos, Pablo.
We lost it.

670
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:51,019
Gustavo, what do you mean
"we lost it"?

671
00:43:51,103 --> 00:43:52,979
Just what I said, we lost it.

672
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:59,194
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

673
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:02,322
Don't mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.

674
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,700
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

675
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:08,120
Look...

676
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:14,418
we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

677
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:18,422
So how did we lose a load, brother?

678
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:21,883
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

679
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:23,469
Know what I mean?

680
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:30,809
And how much is he asking?

681
00:44:32,018 --> 00:44:33,395
Too much.

682
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:40,944
What are you going to do?

683
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:43,656
Come back, Pablo.

684
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:48,076
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

685
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,828
Where are you going, Pablo?

686
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:51,788
Pablo?

687
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,923
What's going on, brother?

688
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,260
Mr. Escobar...

689
00:45:48,637 --> 00:45:51,640
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

690
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:59,272
Eat. Shit.

691
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,860
What if I shot you in the head?

692
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,961
Are you sure about this, Colonel?

693
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:27,426
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

694
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:31,846
We're DAS, Ibarra.

695
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,890
What's that faggot gonna do?

696
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:38,895
There we are.

697
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:40,773
No, lower, lower.

698
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:42,190
No that low.

699
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,361
Ready.

700
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:52,826
Another one, another one.
I'm ready.

701
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:59,499
Pablo didn't know it then...

702
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,336
...but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

703
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:09,301
Remove the handcuffs.

704
00:47:14,556 --> 00:47:16,141
You can go now, officer.

705
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,144
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.

706
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:28,278
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

707
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:35,201
That's a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.

708
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:38,371
And you only gave us $150,000.

709
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:42,501
Well, that's what we agreed upon.

710
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,545
You know something?

711
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,674
I make deals for a living.

712
00:47:48,757 --> 00:47:53,804
Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

713
00:47:57,516 --> 00:48:00,686
Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

714
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:03,313
and everyone goes home happy.

715
00:48:05,858 --> 00:48:06,983
Deal?

716
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,536
I'll give you one million dollars...

717
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:21,122
under one condition.

718
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,042
What is it?

719
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:30,006
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

720
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:33,385
Otherwise, how would you know?

721
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:39,307
Give me a name...

722
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,688
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

723
00:48:48,441 --> 00:48:51,820
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

724
00:48:51,904 --> 00:48:55,073
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities,

725
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:58,827
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami, too.

726
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:06,125
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata,
a Colombian with a plumbing business

727
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,921
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

728
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:14,843
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

729
00:49:18,137 --> 00:49:19,723
The plan was to trade vehicles,

730
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:22,893
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

731
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:27,105
1200 kilos.

732
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:30,024
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

733
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:33,612
OK, gringos.

734
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,697
How's the plumbing business?

735
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:37,115
Fine.

736
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,580
- How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

737
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,500
Come on, amigo.
I'll show you.

738
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:50,629
Everything was going perfect.

739
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:55,717
Like I said, amigo...
100 percent pure.

740
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:57,719
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

741
00:49:57,803 --> 00:50:00,472
Got a full load here, Murph--

742
00:50:08,062 --> 00:50:10,690
Don't move! Don't move.

743
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,902
Don't move! Don't move.

744
00:50:13,986 --> 00:50:15,278
Get down!

745
00:50:18,698 --> 00:50:21,034
Hands! Down!

746
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:22,201
Don't look at me.

747
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:26,915
Fucking...

748
00:50:46,518 --> 00:50:51,064
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz,

749
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:54,275
after taking into account
all due considerations,

750
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:59,572
bail has been set at two million dollars,
or a bond of $200,000.

751
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:04,243
I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

752
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,413
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

753
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,086
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars,

754
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:17,883
paid by a wire transfer from, well...
why don't you take a guess?

755
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:22,428
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.

756
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:31,563
From '79 to '84,
there were 3,245 murders in Miami.

757
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:34,858
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops,

758
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:37,360
no one much cared about that.

759
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:41,907
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

760
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:46,536
Billions of dollars a year,
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

761
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,623
And that... America couldn't take.

762
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:56,462
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

763
00:51:56,671 --> 00:52:00,717
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

764
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:06,098
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

765
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,601
Whatever it was, the businessmen
came at just the right time.

766
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:12,520
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

767
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:15,982
It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

768
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:19,235
Drugs are menacing our society.

769
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:22,864
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

770
00:52:22,948 --> 00:52:25,033
They're killing our children.

771
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:26,910
It was classic Reagan.

772
00:52:26,993 --> 00:52:29,913
Folksy, direct and tough.

773
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:33,249
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

774
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,668
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

775
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:39,965
So to my young friends out there,
life can be great.

776
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:42,175
But not when you can't see it.

777
00:52:42,258 --> 00:52:47,472
So open your eyes to life, to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

778
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:49,849
as a precious gift to His children.

779
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,935
Say yes to your life.

780
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:56,314
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

781
00:52:56,397 --> 00:52:58,858
No, no, no!
No, Pablo, no, no!

782
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,026
No, no!

783
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:08,034
They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world,

784
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,120
only the cockroaches will survive.

785
00:53:10,203 --> 00:53:12,330
Leave that piece of shit there.

786
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:14,290
I guess they were wrong.

787
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,337
During his career,
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

788
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:22,132
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

789
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,933
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

790
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,186
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

791
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,604
No way.

792
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:41,818
He was a West Virginia farm boy,
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

793
00:53:42,777 --> 00:53:45,613
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

794
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,158
It was his duty.

795
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,953
Cocaine in Miami?

796
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:53,955
Kilos from Colombia?

797
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,333
This was my war.

798
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:59,919
This was my duty.

799
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,796
And I was ready to fight it.

800
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,465
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me, too.

801
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:05,758
Your ticket, please.

802
00:54:07,135 --> 00:54:08,302
OK.

803
00:54:08,386 --> 00:54:11,389
We had no idea
what we were in for.

804
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:17,062
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

805
00:54:17,145 --> 00:54:18,813
OK, man, what do we got?

806
00:54:18,897 --> 00:54:22,025
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

807
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:23,442
We got Lizard.

808
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:26,320
Uh...

809
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:27,822
We got, we got...

810
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,536
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

811
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:36,289
- Thank you for the gift, agent.
- No problem.

812
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,975
If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world,

813
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,062
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

814
00:55:00,105 --> 00:55:03,775
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

815
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:08,947
In the world of drug dealers,
you do what you think is right...

816
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:11,908
and hope for the best.

817
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:15,620
Look at what happened, boss.

818
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,039
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

819
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,920
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

820
00:55:24,003 --> 00:55:27,132
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

821
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:33,888
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo, sir?

822
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:39,769
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

823
00:55:39,852 --> 00:55:41,313
Half a million?

824
00:55:41,395 --> 00:55:42,605
Do it.

825
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:44,190
As you wish, sir.

826
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,447
Fucking gringos.

827
