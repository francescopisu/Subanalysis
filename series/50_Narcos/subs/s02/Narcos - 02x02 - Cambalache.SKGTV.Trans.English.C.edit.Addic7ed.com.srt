00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,042
_

3
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:21,436
_

4
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:00,567
_

5
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:06,810
_

6
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:11,036

8
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:22,000
Imagine this,

9
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:25,420
President of Colombia goes
on TV and tells the whole world

10
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:27,339
he'll never make a deal with you.

11
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:30,884
Now a normal person
thinks, "I'm fucked."

12
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:34,763
But Pablo Escobar, he thinks that's
just your opening offer.

13
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,016
So the man finds a way to respond.

14
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:43,105
_

15
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:47,359
_

16
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:49,528
_

17
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:52,489
_

18
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:55,450
_

19
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:58,829
_

20
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,497
_

21
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:18,557
_

22
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,478
_

23
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:26,148
_

24
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,900
_

25
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:31,695
_

26
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:36,158
_

27
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:41,621
_

28
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:45,208
_

29
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:48,104
_

30
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:52,883
_

31
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,759
_

32
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:58,305
And how did Gaviria take Pablo's offer?

33
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:03,351
I think it's safe to say
that he didn't really care for it.

34
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:06,897
But it wasn't just Gaviria
Pablo was talking to.

35
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,484
In his mind, he was also negotiating
with the leader of the free world.

36
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:15,655
_

37
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:18,325
_

38
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:20,649
_

39
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:25,290
You see, the problem was, George Bush
had his own plans for Escobar.

40
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:26,875
We will, for the first time,

41
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:31,129
make available the appropriate resources
of America's armed forces.

42
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:34,925
And for the drug kingpins,
the death penalty.

43
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:39,387
And with a commander in chief who
used to be the head of the CIA,

44
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,056
well, you can use your imagination

45
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,601
as to what
"appropriate resources" might mean.

46
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:48,480
He started by
appointing a new ambassador.

47
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:52,484
Badass former Navy man, Arthur Crosby...

48
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:57,948
who specialized in Latin
American affairs and counterterrorism.

49
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:03,828
Next, he dug into his old CIA Rolodex,

50
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:07,332
where there was no shortage of guys
who knew how to fight dirty.

51
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,628
And he sent us one of those, too.

52
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,918
Lastly, and what Peña and I like to

53
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:19,660
call his own personal
"fuck you" to us...

54
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:25,016
he sent us something he thought
we must need: a boss.

55
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:30,605
Now just how long that person
would be my boss remained to be seen.

56
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:36,862
_

57
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:40,156
_

58
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,120
_

59
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:50,834
_

60
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,044
_

61
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:03,680
_

62
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:05,807
_

63
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:14,232
_

64
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:16,318
_

65
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:21,364
_

66
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:23,533
_

67
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:37,005
_

68
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:41,217
_

69
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:45,680
_

70
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:47,891
_

71
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,768
_

72
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:52,479
_

73
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:55,732
_

74
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:05,492
_

75
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,917
_

76
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:18,797
_

77
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,467
My title might be "ambassador,"

78
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,136
but that's some bullshit
politician's word.

79
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,514
I know what it means
to be on the front lines.

80
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:33,311
And everybody in this room wants
the same thing, to take down Escobar.

81
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:37,816
Now as a veteran of numerous
conflicts, I learned one immutable truth:

82
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:40,782
the only way to
succeed is by working together,

83
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:43,697
by communicating, by sharing intelligence
and collaborating.

84
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,323
Understood?

85
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:50,704
Uh, this is Claudia Messina.
She is the new DEA country attaché.

86
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:53,999
She'll be taking over all DEA
operations in-country. Messina?

87
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,875
Thank you, Ambassador.

88
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:01,715
The DEA will be opening field
offices in Cali, Cartagena and Barranquilla.

89
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:04,217
As far as the
Medellín team is concerned,

90
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,096
they will be housed out of CNP headquarters
until further notice.

91
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,807
But only after some
personnel changes have been made.

92
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,643
All right, now as far as
long-term intelligence is concerned,

93
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:17,731
that's under the purview of the CIA,
the station chief, Bill Stechner.

94
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:19,458
Bill, you have
anything you'd like to add?

95
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:20,859
I'm good.

96
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,350
All right, who's here from Centra Spike?

97
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,890
I am, sir. Edward Jacoby.

98
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:30,302
All right, let's get Centra Spike
back in the air immediately.

99
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:32,370
I want to know every word
these assholes say

100
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:35,334
and all information flows through me
and I will disseminate as I see fit.

101
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:36,499
Yes, sir.

102
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,724
When Escobar sticks
his fucking head out,

103
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:41,236
we're gonna nail that son of a bitch.

104
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:43,219
What about him?

105
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:45,115
Other than the fact that
he wasn't here today.

106
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,343
Well, I suggested that he stay home.

107
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:50,930
You mentioned making some changes.
What exactly does that mean?

108
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:53,433
It means I'm making some changes.

109
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:55,870
Murphy's a good agent. He's
done a lot of good work down here.

110
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:56,978
Yeah.

111
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:00,940
Looks like it.

112
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:08,114
Do you have any idea
the strings that were pulled

113
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:09,866
to get that guy not to press charges?

114
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,303
Sounds to me like the guy
would've had a dog sniffing up his ass

115
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:14,527
before he got on the plane.
Maybe Steve did him a favor.

116
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:16,456
Was that a thank you?

117
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:22,045
Be straight with me, Agent Peña,
and I'll be straight with you.

118
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,881
I don't need a guy like that
making my life more difficult.

119
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,966
- And making the DEA look bad.
- Ma'am...

120
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,136
Messina. Or boss.

121
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,805
We've been down here a long time.

122
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,890
You've been down here
all of what, two hours?

123
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:39,896
It may not make the front page, but...

124
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:42,941
a lot of the intel we have
is because of Steve.

125
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,903
He's a good man. He's going
through some shit right now.

126
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:48,881
You know, he was at the airport

127
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,230
to stop his wife from leaving the

128
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,929
country with their
kid. He didn't make it.

129
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:56,120
Add that to watching Escobar
build a five-star prison

130
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:57,997
and then walking out the back door.

131
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:03,545
We both deserve to see this through...

132
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,047
boss.

133
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,436
Have you, uh... had
anything to eat in the last 24 hours?

134
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,065
This new boss... Messina...

135
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,150
what do you know about her?

136
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,612
Only what I've heard.
She's out of New York.

137
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,867
Doesn't put up with any shit.

138
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,036
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

139
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,246
Am I out?

140
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,291
I don't know.

141
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:47,422
Well, I ain't ready to go
home yet, Javi. I'll tell ya that.

142
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:50,423
Damn it! She's fucking...

143
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:55,930
Take a shower. Sober up.

144
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:57,223
Talk to you.

145
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:06,316
_

146
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:09,402

00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:34,964
_

192
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:38,801
_

193
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:45,350
_

194
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:47,393
_

195
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:51,022
_

196
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:52,648
_

197
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:00,156
_

198
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,449
_

199
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:06,871
_

200
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:10,541
_

201
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,046
_

202
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:20,093
Now, Gaviria had made it clear

203
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:23,304
that the government was
not to negotiate with Escobar.

204
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:25,807
But Colombia Attorney General
Gustavo de Greiff

205
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,518
didn't give a shit
what the president wanted.

206
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:34,690
Unlike the US, where the attorney general
is appointed by the president,

207
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:38,694
in Colombia, the Supreme Court
chooses the attorney general,

208
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:41,197
whether the president likes it or not.

209
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:47,412
And in the case of Gustavo de Greiff,
you bet your ass Gaviria didn't.

210
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,039
_

211
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:55,586
_

212
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:02,051
_

213
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:08,141
_

214
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:11,227
_

215
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:14,605
_

216
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:20,695
_

217
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:24,782
_

218
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:29,078
_

219
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:33,040
_

220
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,126
Uh-huh.

221
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:37,462
_

222
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:42,925
_

223
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:46,846
_

224
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:50,433
_

225
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,477
_

226
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,861
_

227
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:06,491
_

228
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:11,621
_

229
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:13,664
_

230
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,085
_

231
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:22,256
_

232
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,425
_

233
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:29,222
_

234
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:31,474
_

235
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:35,186
_

236
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:44,403
_

237
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:48,616
_

238
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:57,500
Listen, thanks for talking
to Messina, man.

239
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,670
I mean it. You saved my ass.

240
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,009
One more fuck-up, Murphy...

241
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:09,345
Oh, I know.

242
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:12,390
Is it gonna happen again?

243
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:16,310
I don't know.

244
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:22,066
DEA politics weren't the only
thing we had to navigate.

245
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:24,777
The Pinzón plan was in full effect.

246
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:28,823
He was doubling down on police presence.

247
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:34,203
Medellín was under martial law
and the base of Carlos Holguín

248
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:35,955
would look like Fort Apache.

249
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:41,002
Me and Javi were
officially guests of the CNP.

250
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:43,212
With all the comforts and amenities

251
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:47,091
that a guest of the National
Colombian Police could expect.

252
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:49,010
Which was zero.

253
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:52,388
And we weren't alone.

254
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:59,020
The DEA, CIA, Centra Spike
and the army, all under one roof.

255
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:03,816
It was one-stop shopping
for all things Pablo Escobar.

256
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:13,284
After Gaviria announced a new $1.4
million reward for Pablo's capture,

257
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,454
Colonel Pinzón activated
a new tip line.

258
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:20,666
And apparently he thought Javi and
I were just the guys to oversee it.

259
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,836
Forget about the fact
that my Spanish was for shit.

260
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,632
He was sidelining us and there was
nothing we could do about it.

261
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:32,219
Pablo would even have his
men call in just to fuck with us.

262
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:35,824
_

263
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:42,521
I'm not sure what we expected.

264
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:45,066
To many people, Escobar was a hero.

265
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:49,445
It was like asking Chicago
to rat out Michael Jordan.

266
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:54,075
And those that didn't worship
Escobar, they were simply too scared to call.

267
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:55,868
But we had a system anyways.

268
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:58,954
One tip in a particular location
didn't mean shit.

269
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,446
A second call with the same

270
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:03,442
information still
might not be worth acting on.

271
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:06,462
But three calls on the same
location from three different sources?

272
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,130
- _
- Yeah?

273
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:12,551
Now, that had to be checked out.

274
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,359
Hey, I said it was a system.

275
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:30,861
I didn't say it worked.

276
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,322
Fuck me.

277
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:36,242
_

278
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,955
Our inability to catch
Escobar was frustrating.

279
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,417
But back in Bogotá, it
was becoming a real liability.

280
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:51,966
_

281
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:55,594
_

282
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:57,388
_

283
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:00,141
_

284
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:04,311
_

285
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:08,607
_

286
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,653
_

287
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:17,074
_

288
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:20,327
_

289
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:23,372
_

290
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:26,167
_

291
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,503

292

_

295
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,860
_

296
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:49,190

297

Get ready to get your balls snipped.

383
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,139
So... your wife left.

384
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:23,644
You're upset, knocked a
few back to numb the pain

385
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:27,356
and then decide to take it out
on some Wall Street scumbag.

386
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:30,525
Yeah, something like that.

387
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:34,279
Isolated incident?

388
00:30:35,364 --> 00:30:36,657
Yeah.

389
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:43,038
Look, I know I've been in Colombia
for all of about 20 seconds.

390
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,539
Mm.

391
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:50,754
Before that, you and Peña had
complete autonomy to call your own shots.

392
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:54,216
It's gonna take you a minute
to get used to the new order.

393
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,426
You don't trust me yet? That's fine.

394
00:30:57,219 --> 00:31:00,180
But if I'm gonna have your back,
I need to know that I can trust you.

395
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:03,517
Otherwise, I have no problem
sending you back to your wife in Miami.

396
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:06,603
Am I making myself clear?

397
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,480
Loud and clear.

398
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:09,648
Excellent.

399
00:31:11,358 --> 00:31:12,734
You're dismissed.

400
00:31:32,004 --> 00:31:35,590
_

401
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:39,094
_

402
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:42,848
I got "La Quica" and "toilet."

403
00:31:42,931 --> 00:31:45,017
_

404
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,270
_

405
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:50,731
All right, well, now, that I got.

406
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:54,276
We can't take that to Pinzón.
He'll laugh us out of the office.

407
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,069
_

408
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:59,364
_

409
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:01,658
_

410
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:06,038
Maybe we can get
Centra Spike to do a flyover,

411
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:07,414
see what they come up with.

412
00:32:07,497 --> 00:32:09,666
Be a lot better than
the fucking tip line.

413
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,127
I'll be right back.

414
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:18,425
- A toilet?
- It's a long story.

415
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,428
- Give me the CliffsNotes.
- Look, just do me a favor

416
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:24,556
and ask them to sweep over
that specific area.

417
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:28,226
We're looking for any chatter from
Escobar's sicarios. Anything at all.

418
00:32:29,102 --> 00:32:31,938
You recognize a voice, you come get me.

419
00:32:32,064 --> 00:32:36,818
Duvall 1-4-4-3-6, we heard
some chatter at 1600 megahertz.

420
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:37,778
Be advised.

421
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:39,738
_

422
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:41,281
_

423
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:43,825
_

424
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:45,994
_

425
00:32:46,078 --> 00:32:50,165
_

426
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:54,086
That is definitely Velasco.
No ID on the girl.

427
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:56,755
What's the deal with the other call?

428
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:03,178
The quality's too poor
for voice recognition.

429
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:11,561
All right... these were
taken about two hours ago.

430
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,148
What's here is fincas, fincas.

431
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:18,652
Everything else is just smaller houses
here, here and here, and the outskirts.

432
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:21,905
You can probably eliminate the smaller
ones, not Escobar's style.

433
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,493
Which of the fincas have
road access both east and west?

434
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:28,912
This one here.

435
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:31,706
It's rough terrain down the back
of the mountain, but it's drivable.

436
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,990
It's gotta be the one.

437
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,502
We'd have a good chance if
we came at him from both sides.

438
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:36,670
This is good.

439
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:38,505
Great. What about Pinzón?

440
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:41,716
We're gonna need vehicles,
we're gonna need men.

441
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:44,678
Leave Pinzón to me.

442
00:33:46,596 --> 00:33:48,932
_

443
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:54,312
_

444
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:58,692
_

445
00:34:00,444 --> 00:34:03,738
_

446
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:08,243
_

447
00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:12,539
_

448
00:34:12,622 --> 00:34:15,959
_

449
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:19,421
_

450
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:23,925
_

451
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:25,969
_

452
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:27,846
_

453
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:34,436
What did he say?

454
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:36,855
He said no.

455
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:44,613
Oh, she's not gonna last.
She gives up pretty fuckin' easy.

456
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:48,325
But Messina didn't give up easy.

457
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:49,701
She called Crosby...

458
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:53,205
Crosby called Gaviria...

459
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:55,373
and in less than 15 minutes...

460
00:34:55,457 --> 00:34:58,418
- I understand.
- ...Pinzón was gettin' a kick in the ass.

461
00:34:58,502 --> 00:35:01,838
_

462
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:03,173
_

463
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:09,971
I guess everybody works for somebody.

464
00:35:12,057 --> 00:35:13,642
_

465
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:17,145
Just because we could make Pinzón dance

466
00:35:17,229 --> 00:35:19,272
didn't mean we could call the tune.

467
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:25,028
We would've gone in stealth.
Surround the fucker, then grab him.

468
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:29,115
Pinzón didn't do shit that way.
He liked kicking down the front door,

469
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,909
waking up the whole damn neighborhood.

470
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:34,996
_

471
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,792
_

472
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,418
_

473
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:43,922
_

474
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:46,883
_

475
00:35:48,176 --> 00:35:49,386
_

476
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:52,430
_

477
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,978
_

478
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:04,192
_

479
00:36:04,276 --> 00:36:06,403
_

480
00:36:06,486 --> 00:36:08,572
_

481
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:10,031
_

482
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,242
_

483
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,035
_

484
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,203
_

485
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,831
_

486
00:36:30,051 --> 00:36:34,014
_

487
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,937
_

488
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:51,364
_

489
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:31,488
_

490
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:37,535
_

491
00:37:39,788 --> 00:37:41,164
_

492
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,708
_

493
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,297
Don't forget that Pablo made a career

494
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:51,007
of staying ahead of the cops.

495
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:56,054
A lot of the fincas he used had tunnels
built just for this purpose.

496
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:58,014
Even though he didn't like using them.

497
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:02,894
I guess you could say that
he was paranoid, but then again,

498
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:08,191
if people are actually after you,
that's not paranoid. That's just smart.

499
00:38:08,274 --> 00:38:11,236
Peña! Messina!

500
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,093
He was here.

501
00:38:43,268 --> 00:38:45,145
_

502
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:51,276
_

503
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:55,071
_

504
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,879
_

505
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:14,340
_

506
00:39:14,424 --> 00:39:17,844
_

507
00:39:17,927 --> 00:39:20,088
_

508
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,559
_

509
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:28,772
_

510
00:39:28,855 --> 00:39:30,774
_

511
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:33,193
_

512
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:35,320
_

513
00:39:36,946 --> 00:39:38,531
_

514
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:40,825
_

515
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:42,994
_

516
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:46,206
_

517
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,667
_

518
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:54,130
_

519
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,186
_

520
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:23,743
You know, in all the
years I chased Escobar,

521
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:26,955
I could count on one hand
the times we almost had him.

522
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:29,249
And each time, we forgot
the two most important things

523
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:31,125
we already knew about him:

524
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:33,002
Close doesn't count.

525
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:37,131
And Pablo is never more dangerous
than when you almost have him.

526
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:08,538
With all the cops on the street,
it was easy to forget...

527
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:12,584
this was still Escobar's town.

528
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:20,216
He tolerated it all in
the interest of negotiations.

529
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:24,262
Chasing a man and his family
out of their home

530
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:26,097
in the middle of the night?

531
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,224
That wasn't a negotiation.

532
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:29,267
To Escobar...

533
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:32,228
well, that was an act of war.

534
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:33,271
_

535
00:41:36,566 --> 00:41:39,611
_

536
00:41:40,486 --> 00:41:41,654
_

537
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:43,781
_

538
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,870
_

539
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:50,371
_

540
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:55,084
_

541
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:25,114
_

542
00:42:58,398 --> 00:43:00,858
_

543
00:43:52,952 --> 00:43:54,328
_

544
00:43:55,663 --> 00:43:57,623
_

545
00:43:57,707 --> 00:44:01,210
_

546
00:44:01,294 --> 00:44:02,503
_

547
00:45:19,372 --> 00:45:20,289
Peña!
