1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,300
WMD. Got that WMD.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,600
You got to move it on down.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,600
- It ain't pretty.
- Doesn't have to be.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,900
Just needs to pull them
from the places still worth salvaging.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,600
All right, I told the other shifts...

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,700
now I'm telling you.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,700
When I ride my district
at the end of this week...

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,200
I want to see empty corners.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
They bring it here,
or the other two free zones...

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,800
or you bang them senseless.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,200
Anything you need to do, you do.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,500
Up to a body that can't walk itself up
out of the emergency room...

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,300
I'll back up you and your men.
You understand me?

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,500
Now, I've detailed our I.I.D. Representative
to the range for the entire week.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,400
All citizen complaints will be handled
by Lieutenant Mello here.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,700
Whatever it takes.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Man, I ain't even dirty. I got rights and shit.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,400
Go with the one about staying silent.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,100
Shit like this don't happen in Hamsterdam.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm up for just standing somewhere?

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,100
Fuck y'all. We in America!

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,700
West Baltimore.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,100
I swear to God,
Officer Herc, you unhook Babycakes...

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,600
and my peoples be down
where you want us. Swear to God.

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,400
Fuck with a man's ride,
you're gonna get his attention.

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
- Babycakes?
- Yo, yo, yo, hold up!

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,900
Motherfuckers gonna hear
from my motherfucking lawyer.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,300
- This right here is some outrageous shit.
- You think?

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,400
Fuck y'all, lying motherfuckers!

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Gentlemen.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
That is outrageous.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
That's right.

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,200
Come on, sweetheart.

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Bust your ass out of there.

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,000
It's still Maryland.

36
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,100
But if you all don't take that shit down
to Hamsterdam tomorrow...

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
next time it's gonna be West Virginia.

38
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,300
That little star right there,
across from the Dipper? That's north.

39
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,800
You wanna go the other way.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,300
Assholes.

41
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,100
WMD. Got that WMD.

42
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,700
Landfill, got Landfill, yo.

43
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,500
WMD. Got that WMD.

44
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,600
They all here, man. Landfill.

45
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,900
We'll start the interior construction
within the week.

46
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,800
Which means we need
to readdress the budget.

47
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,100
Readdress how?

48
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,100
Well, for one,
the price of steel has doubled.

49
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,500
It'll triple if we don't buy it now.

50
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,900
- Ain't the steel bought already?
- Not the bulk of it, no.

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
Then there are the gutting costs.
They exceeded our original expectations.

52
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,000
You, know, he needs to wear that hat
when he's on site. Code, you know.

53
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,300
Gutting costs went up, huh?

54
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,800
Well, that was due to your modifications.

55
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,700
The changes you asked for
in those loft units.

56
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,500
- Necessitating new permits.
- Which means another delay.

57
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,200
Unless we expedite.
Bring the architect and his people back in...

58
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,400
over the weekend and get something
to the city on Monday.

59
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,800
- Whoa, ain't that part of his original fee?
- No, this was unanticipated.

60
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,900
Look, y'all fucked up.
So y'all supposed to take the hit, right?

61
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,100
Excuse me?

62
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,300
I mean, my man here don't know shit
about no gutting costs.

63
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,300
He don't know nothing
about no price of no steel.

64
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,800
He just trying to get some shit built.

65
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,200
And y'all supposed to have the expertise
behind this.

66
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,100
Only what I'm saying is, it seem like
the expertise ain't where it supposed to be.

67
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,800
Unfortunately, Mr. Barksdale, cost overruns
are the nature of the business.

68
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,700
And, well,
we should discuss this over lunch.

69
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,200
Hell no, man, I got elsewhere to be.

70
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,000
And this is the Marlo kid.
He's fresh blood for the organization.

71
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,100
Bell's given him the best real estate.

72
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,900
The Barksdale people
took what they needed...

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,900
when the Towers came down, no problem.

74
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Stringer hasn't missed a step.

75
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,400
- They're still selling drugs?
- Lot of drugs.

76
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,900
He's not dropping bodies.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,500
No, he doesn't need to.
He's got all the corners he needs.

78
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,100
And I'm supposed to give a shit?

79
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,500
Lieutenant, two weeks,
Bell looked insulated...

80
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,000
like he had enough legitimate front
to be able to be just the bank.

81
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,000
What Kima's found out is
he's still directly involved with the drugs.

82
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,300
Otherwise, why the face-to-face
with the Stanfield kid?

83
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,100
He's still connected to the day-to-day.

84
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,700
We come back six, eight months...

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,900
you won't even get him in a room
talking drugs, much less handling any.

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's now or never, Lieutenant.

87
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,400
Stringer Bell is quiet.

88
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,500
And if he's quiet, I don't give a fuck
if we come back a year from now...

89
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,100
and find out
he's on the Greater Baltimore Committee.

90
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,400
This unit is about the bodies.

91
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
<i>Major Foerster, call 2462. Major Foerster.</i>

92
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,400
What the fuck is this?

93
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,300
Ten-page report
on the heroic police work...

94
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,500
undertaken to retrieve
Officer Dozerman's service weapon.

95
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,100
Send that upstairs,
keep the bosses out of your ass for a while.

96
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
You actually did all this?

97
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,300
Would it matter if I had?

98
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,500
Jay, I'm a murder police...

99
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,600
I got a double on my plate.
I'm gonna work it.

100
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,300
We ain't got Fayette and Poppleton neither,
what the fuck?

101
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
I'm working on it, man.
The avenue corners, too.

102
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
What you mean you working on it, man?

103
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,700
Why we ain't at least got a shop set up
down the block?

104
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,800
- We did.
- There was a setback.

105
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,500
- Ran our boys off.
- Who?

106
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,500
- Just some player, man...
- Listen.

107
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,600
Let him tell me. We hired him for muscle.

108
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,200
- The boy, Marlo.
- Marlo. Who the fuck is Marlo?

109
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
He tied to one of the mobs?

110
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,500
Young boy. Running it on his own, too.

111
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,500
Got maybe 15 spots along here
and the avenue.

112
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,300
An independent with no fucking support...

113
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,800
got all the prime real estate
and we doing what exactly?

114
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,600
Young boy ran us off the corner?

115
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,300
I'm losing my motherfucking mind, man.

116
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,200
And I sincerely mean your girl
no disrespect...

117
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,200
but Tosha wasn't killed
because she just happened by that mess.

118
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,800
I think we all know that, right?

119
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
She was a player. We know that much.

120
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,500
Look, we got the science that says
she fired a gun when it all went down.

121
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,800
Gun wasn't there for us to find...

122
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
but that just means
somebody grabbed it up, right?

123
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,300
I mean, your girl,
she definitely had her say...

124
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,700
when everybody else
on that street was talking.

125
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,400
Am I wrong?

126
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Well, I got witnesses on the scene
that said she was there...

127
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,400
right in the middle of a drug robbery.

128
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,300
Boy by the name of Omar was in on it, too.

129
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,100
Nobody saying Tosha was an angel.

130
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,400
Nobody saying that.

131
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
But what are they saying?

132
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,700
The crew Tosha was running with...

133
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,500
maybe they didn't throw the shot
that killed her...

134
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,100
but, if they don't come to me early
and tell the true story...

135
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,800
I guarantee they won't breathe
a free breath...

136
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,000
until them cicadas come back.

137
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,600
You all get the word to the right people.

138
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,300
And you've spoken
to the medical examiner, correct?

139
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
What's he say?

140
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,500
- He says it's lumpy.
- Lumpy?

141
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He says that if an investigation
can come up with a credible scenario...

142
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,500
he's willing to change the cause of death
to homicide.

143
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,900
Do you even have a suspect here?

144
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,200
No.

145
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,400
Look, I don't know
how you city guys do it...

146
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,300
but down here in Annapolis
we try to duck a punch or two.

147
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,500
Not lean into every last one.

148
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,500
My county doesn't need another murder.

149
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,900
I'm glad you could come.

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,700
Ladies, Reverend Wright,
I'd like you to meet my husband...

151
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,000
- Cedric Daniels.
- Nice to meet you.

152
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,400
- Not that I've seen, no.
- She was invited, right?

153
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,400
Oh, of course. Eunetta doesn't
make it too much nowadays.

154
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,200
Not even Council meetings.

155
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,100
I think Eunetta's gonna have her hands full,
come the primary.

156
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Mayor will pull her through.

157
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,000
- He still have coattails?
- Shit, boy.

158
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,500
You look up "incumbent"
in the damn dictionary...

159
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,500
and you'll see Clarence Royce
smiling back at you.

160
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
He gets his whole ticket through.

161
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,800
The Mayor's got a new poll...

162
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,900
showing his negatives
have really jumped in the last year.

163
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,200
Not that he's gonna be putting
a press release out about that.

164
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,800
I hear you took a swipe at His Honor
the other day on that witness murder.

165
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
Well, not at the Mayor directly.

166
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,000
But we had the police brass
in front of the subcommittee...

167
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,900
and, I don't know,
there's just no excuse for what happened.

168
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,700
You keep on it, Councilman.

169
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,200
A little smack here and there
does this administration a world of good.

170
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
That's why we need new blood
on the Council.

171
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,400
Keep everybody honest.

172
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,200
Yeah.

173
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,800
Yeah. Give me a Coors Light.

174
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,600
Don't embarrass yourself.

175
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,800
So.

176
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Your murder's never gonna be a murder...

177
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,400
and Daniels' got his head all up
in another case.

178
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,600
I know.

179
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,000
You know what the hardest part
about being a police is?

180
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,100
Yeah. Explaining to your wife
why she has to take antibiotics...

181
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,100
for your kidney infection.

182
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
I was gonna say
trying to make the job actually matter.

183
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,800
That, too.

184
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,400
- Speaking of your ex-wife, what's up there?
- Nothing.

185
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,700
She got her hooks in some lawyer.
Money guy.

186
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,900
Fuck it and fuck her.

187
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,400
So what, you moving on?

188
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Yeah, I might have some fresh hope,
now that you mention it.

189
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,700
Yeah?

190
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,200
Yeah, there was this woman
at this thing for my kids.

191
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,500
She, like, raises money for the school
and all that, you know?

192
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,200
She's got a face, a body, and a brain
all working together.

193
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,300
And she looks like the kind
who might tell me when my shit stinks...

194
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,600
which is probably what I need.

195
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,700
She's kind of like Freamon with tits.

196
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,600
- So what, you get her number?
- No, not exactly.

197
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,300
Hey, what kind of detective would I be...

198
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,800
if I couldn't track a white woman
in Baltimore, right?

199
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,700
There you go.

200
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,700
See what she wants, okay?

201
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,400
You were so smooth tonight.

202
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,500
You had them
eating right out of your hand.

203
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,500
It's what you need from me, right?

204
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Anyway, it wasn't too bad.
I'm getting better at it, I guess.

205
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,900
You are.

206
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,000
Cedric, maybe we <i>could...</i>

207
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,900
I don't know.

208
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,200
Right now, you tell me
where you need me...

209
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,900
and whether you want the Class A
or the Class B uniform, and I'm there.

210
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,500
More than that, I just don't know.

211
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
So?

212
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So?

213
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
I'm saying, what the fuck?

214
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,900
Take a deep breath, man.

215
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,800
I mean, take a long deep breath.

216
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,400
Know that if you call the shot, we at war.
We at war.

217
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,900
I'm there like I always been.

218
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,400
Thing about turf, man, it ain't like it was.

219
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,500
I mean, you ain't gotta pay no price
of buying no corners.

220
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,700
Since when do we buy corners?

221
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,000
We take corners.

222
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,800
Man, you gonna buy one way or another.

223
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,500
Whether it's with the bodies we done lost
or you're gonna lose...

224
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,000
time in the joint
that's behind us or ahead of us...

225
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,700
I mean, you gonna get some shit
in this game, but it ain't shit for free.

226
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,600
I mean, how many corners do we need?

227
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,100
- How much money can a nigga make?
- More than a nigga can spend.

228
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,900
And then we ain't gonna be around
to spend what we done made already.

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,300
Shit, I didn't think
I was gonna be around this long.

230
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,900
Yeah. Well, we here now.

231
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,200
The fact is we got every mob in town,
East Side, West Side...

232
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,800
ready to pull together,
share territory on that good shit...

233
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,300
that Prop Joe putting out there.

234
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,800
We take that shit downtown
and we get in the money game and that...

235
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,800
niggas ain't going to jail.

236
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,400
I mean, we past
that run-and-gun shit, man...

237
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,600
like, we find us a package
and we ain't got to see nothing but bank.

238
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,300
Nothing but cash.
No corners, no territory, nothing.

239
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,400
We make so much
goddamn straight money, man...

240
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,800
the government come after us, man,
ain't shit they can say.

241
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,200
Businessmen, huh?

242
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,400
Let the young'uns worry
about how to retail...

243
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,500
where to wholesale.

244
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,100
I mean, who gives a fuck
who's standing on what corner...

245
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,000
if we're taking that shit off the top...

246
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,100
putting that shit to good use,
making that shit work for us.

247
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,700
We can run more than corners, B. Period.

248
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,300
We could do like Little Willie, man...

249
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,100
back in the day,
with all that number money...

250
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
and run this goddamn city.

251
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,300
Like businessmen.

252
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,000
Man, just let me talk to the boy, Marlo.
See if I can't smooth this shit out.

253
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,500
I mean, it ain't gonna be overnight...

254
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,500
'cause the nigga
only knows what he knows.

255
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,100
But I think I could talk some sense
in his head.

256
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Yeah, I ain't no suit-wearing
businessman like you.

257
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,300
You know, I'm just a gangster, I suppose.

258
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
And I want my corners.

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,100
<i>I gotta tell you, I'm having a tough time...</i>

260
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,100
<i>wrapping my head around</i>
<i>the reality of you being paroled.</i>

261
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
<i>Trust me, I won't fully comprehend it</i>
<i>until I'm sipping my first martini.</i>

262
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Homicide police went to Tosha people.

263
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,900
Talking about how they know
she was in the mix.

264
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Saying they got witnesses and shit.
They called your name on it, too.

265
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,300
- So what they say?
- They called me.

266
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,000
- Hey, yo, I know this cop, man.
- Yeah?

267
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,400
Maybe we should help him out.
Tell him who did what.

268
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,100
Man, stop wilding, Kimmy.

269
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,700
All right, now I said I got this.

270
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Tosha's people want to know from me...

271
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
exactly what happened that day.
That's all I'm saying.

272
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,300
Well, tell them she caught one
trying to take them boys down, man.

273
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,800
Ain't no need
to involve the police in none of this.

274
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,100
Sound to me like he involved already.

275
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,400
Kimmy, I told you, I got this.

276
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
My husband worked for Mr. Cooper
at the American Can.

277
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,100
He made good money.

278
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,700
We saved up and bought this house.

279
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,900
There were some white families
still living in the neighborhood then.

280
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,700
The neighborhood
has changed, Mrs. Hazel.

281
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,700
This is a picture of the house.

282
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Oh.

283
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,200
City-owned, taxes paid and all.

284
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,100
It is very nice.

285
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
But I can't afford that.

286
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,600
You don't have to worry about the money.
It's all taken care of.

287
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,600
It's a special program we have.

288
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,800
It's for people who are living...

289
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,300
in really bad situations...

290
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,700
you know,
with the drug trafficking you see outside.

291
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,800
And this is a good neighborhood.

292
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,900
It's safe and it's on the number 19 line.

293
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,100
And it's walking distance from your church.

294
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,500
Officer, this is the only home I know.

295
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,500
It's all I've got.

296
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,100
Now, you say you have a program
that can place me somewhere else.

297
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,700
But you ain't got no program
for what's outside my door?

298
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,000
You weren't lying.

299
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,700
Yeah, I told you. And I've been
all over these blocks like you said.

300
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,800
I haven't seen any cameras,
nobody peeking.

301
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,300
And Monk Man and his crew been here
for grinding for days...

302
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,200
and narcos ain't even blink.

303
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,000
I'll tell you what.

304
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,100
Put some of my people on it. Not too many.
Just them young'uns.

305
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,700
Make the package real small,
just in case this a trap.

306
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,600
- I wanna hear directly from you on this.
- I'm on it.

307
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,000
This shit is just bugged out, you know?

308
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
String called, said to tell you
he gonna be late.

309
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Behind something he need to see
down the way.

310
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,700
- So, what you telling me, we weak?
- Boss, I reached out to Black Donnie.

311
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,100
Okay, spit it out, man.
Listen, stop fucking double-talking me.

312
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,000
Black Donnie say he ain't having any of it.

313
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,900
Say Brother Mouzone put a hex on all of us.

314
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,100
What about Peacock?

315
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Peacock went
and hired out with some Dominicans.

316
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,300
What about Eggy Mule?

317
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,000
Eggy locked up.
Caught a nickel with the Feds for a pistol.

318
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,500
What about Shorty Boyd?

319
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Shorty Boyd went
and cleaned his whole act up.

320
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,600
Yeah, I know. Fucked us all up.

321
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,100
What we got?

322
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,100
The soldier you sent at us, Cutty,
he gonna work out...

323
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,000
but the rest of them dudes, I don't know.

324
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,800
All right, listen, big man, you about to earn
your fucking keep around here, right now.

325
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,700
You go out, you get Cutty
and get the best of the rest...

326
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,800
and you put a hurting on Marlo.
I want my corners.

327
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
What the fuck?

328
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,200
- What now?
- Problems, Mr. Bell.

329
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,700
No, this ain't the time for problems, man.
I got places to be.

330
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
We're being told
it may take weeks before...

331
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,500
we get the city inspectors back down here
to approve these site changes.

332
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,700
- Weeks?
- Every day we wait, you lose money.

333
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Man, what the fuck?

334
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,800
How does anybody make any money
in this game, man?

335
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,400
Every time I think we good,
you back in my pockets.

336
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,400
- You need to make a call.
- Again?

337
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,500
He's the consultant, right?

338
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,000
You're paying him a nice chunk of change
to consult, right?

339
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,500
This is why we have a politically-connected
guy like that on the payroll.

340
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,500
He goes downtown and does for us
what we can't do for ourselves.

341
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,800
Democracy in action, Mr. Bell.

342
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,600
All right, look. Me and Slim,
we're gonna work through the alleys...

343
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,500
and hit them from the side.

344
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,600
I want you to come through here.

345
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,000
- Slow down, through the intersection.
- Oh.

346
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,000
Why don't we just come up this way?

347
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,500
Then we ain't got to worry
about crossing no intersection.

348
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,900
Come that way? You putting
your driver in the line of fire, man.

349
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,900
Think on it. He getting taken out.
Car gonna crash.

350
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,500
Now, where that put you at?

351
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,500
Besides you don't wanna be shooting
across your driver, do you?

352
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
All right, so come in easy.

353
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,900
They ain't gonna be looking for you
'cause we gonna have they full attention.

354
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,500
And, look, pick your targets,
drop them and move out quick.

355
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
- Who driving?
- I'm under the wheel.

356
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,200
All right, you make sure you slow down
at the end of the block...

357
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,400
and toss your weapons.

358
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,000
And get rid of any shell casings
that kick back in the car.

359
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,600
Police can trace them shits.

360
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,400
- Toss the gloves, too, right?
- No, hold on to them.

361
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,900
They're gonna have that DNA shit
all on them.

362
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,900
All right, look, it's gonna take us some time
to get set up...

363
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,100
so we need y'all to lay back
about four or five blocks.

364
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,900
And when we ready,
we're gonna hit you on the burner...

365
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,900
but y'all hold tight till I call you.
You got it?

366
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
We gonna handle our end.

367
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,800
You just make sure there's some
fucking work left out there for us...

368
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,500
'cause I don't wanna feel
like I'm just some damn decoy.

369
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,400
Damn right about that.

370
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,500
It's just to relocate, no big deal.

371
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,500
I'm not asking for
round-the-clock protection...

372
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,500
- or anything like that.
- No big deal? Come on, Bunny...

373
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,700
where the fuck am I gonna find a house
for this old broad?

374
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,600
I got one already.

375
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,400
It's a foreclosure up on the Harford Road.

376
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
All you gotta do
is file the emergency petition...

377
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
my boys'll move her in.

378
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,900
And she's witnessing against
a violent drug crew.

379
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
Without her cooperation,
I doubt if it'll go forward.

380
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
She's 73 years old.

381
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,200
Brave old broad to be doing this,
I guess, but...

382
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,600
Come on, Ray.

383
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,000
Look, we just lost a witness in a drug case.

384
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,800
We don't wanna lose another one so quick.

385
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,300
If Rawls gets wind of this,
you forged my signature.

386
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,800
Where is she living now, anyway?

387
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,000
She's on Vincent Street, Sector Two.

388
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,400
- It's a bad location, huh?
- You wouldn't believe it.

389
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,500
We should wait for the call.

390
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,300
Man, what if that crew got lookouts?

391
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,500
Motherfucker, if we wait,
it'll be all over time we get there.

392
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,400
Man, plus, look, man, I'm saying
how's that gonna play with Avon, man?

393
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
They taking all the credit.

394
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,600
Yo, fellas, strap up.

395
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,100
There go that motherfucker Nay-Nay, man.
I say we take him.

396
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,900
- We should wait for the call.
- Man, we wait, he gonna get away, man.

397
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,400
Go, go, go!

398
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,900
Get out, get out!

399
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,400
Motherfucker!

400
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,800
What the fuck?

401
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,400
Didn't I say something
about waiting for a fucking phone call?

402
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,200
You know how you blow off half
the invitations you get to be somewhere?

403
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,100
Ribbon cuttings, playground clean-ups
and shit?

404
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
I got to. No choice.

405
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,800
I was gonna cut out on one the other day.

406
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,500
It was a fundraiser for the Delta Phis,
you know?

407
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,800
But I drag-ass over to the Forum
to show the flag.

408
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,300
And who was there in his ironsides
but old Odell Watkins.

409
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,700
The rainmaker himself.

410
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah, talking in public about being
kind of disappointed in the Mayor.

411
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,400
Disappointed. Yeah?

412
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,300
- Like how?
- Like sincerely disappointed.

413
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,100
The way you'd be with one of your kids.

414
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Like he really wanted
to see the Mayor pressed, you know?

415
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,800
Got me thinking.

416
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,400
Maybe somebody can take a run at Royce
in next year's primary.

417
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,000
Like who? Madam Council President?

418
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,800
Well, Mickey Pepper
would give him a fight.

419
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,900
No, Mick's already said he doesn't want
to leave the legislature. He won't risk it.

420
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,300
Well, you gotta have someone with balls.

421
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,100
And somebody black.

422
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,400
This being Baltimore and all.

423
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,100
- How many y'all take?
- Two.

424
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,600
Didn't get nearly a shot off.

425
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,000
Speak to the quality of Barksdale people.

426
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,400
He's gonna have to come back at you.

427
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,000
You know it ain't gonna stop at this.

428
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,600
I don't want it to stop.

429
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,400
Barksdale weak today.

430
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,900
And he ain't working
with the ammunition I got.

431
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,300
No doubt, you carrying a full clip.

432
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,100
But what you gonna do
when you sitting at the head of the table?

433
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,100
Once you there, you got to hold it down.

434
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,900
Sound like one of them good problems.

435
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

436
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,400
Prison and graveyards...

437
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,600
full of boys who wore the crown.

438
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,400
Point is, they wore it.

439
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,500
It's my turn to wear it now.

440
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,800
We're gonna do this, right, Chris?

441
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,000
- Gonna do this, son.
- It's ready like yesterday, dawg.

442
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,000
Want a white T's, man?

443
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,900
Need to get yourself a white T, dawg.

444
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,600
So you working your plan, huh, Bubs?

445
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,000
Dollar here, dollar there, Kima.

446
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,500
So, what's up? Why you call?

447
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,000
Was just checking in.

448
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,000
You're still interested
in that boy, Marlo, right?

449
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,700
No?

450
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You wanna keep getting paid, you need
to get your ass up to Park Heights...

451
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,800
school yourself on that Jamaican
named Kintel got them corners.

452
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,400
Kintel, huh?

453
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,800
My bosses don't give a fuck about Marlo.
Stringer's people neither.

454
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,100
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

455
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,100
'Cause now we got a whole lot of drama.

456
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
What happened?

457
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,200
That young buck, Marlo,
ain't getting runned off.

458
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,400
He just dropped two of Barksdale soldiers
on the corner of Mount and Fayette.

459
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,400
- Two hours past.
- What?

460
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Corners is all jumping bad.

461
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,200
I thought Marlo had them corners
for Stringer. We saw them meet.

462
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,400
I don't know what you saw.

463
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,000
All I know is Marlo is flying his own colors.

464
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,500
West Side's about to be
all Baghdad and shit.

465
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,600
But y'all looking for Jake,
what's his name? Kintel?

466
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,600
Y'all are too fickle with Bubs, man. I swear.

467
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,000
A little gift for you and your boys.

468
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,300
Call me.

469
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,400
Whitey sale! Whitey sale!

470
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,300
Deputy, I am aware of the incident
and my men are on it.

471
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,600
We called in the 7-to-3 flex squad early...

472
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,300
and my DEU is out canvassing.

473
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,100
<i>And what do we know?</i>

474
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,500
Only that it seems to be rival gangs.
But, what does homicide have?

475
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,100
<i>Fuck homicide.</i>

476
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
<i>I'm asking you</i>
<i>for answers right now, Major.</i>

477
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,600
- Sir, my men...
<i>- And you damn sure have none.</i>

478
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,200
My men are out there...

479
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,600
What do we know
that we can actually tell the man?

480
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,400
It's like you said. Rival gangs.

481
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,000
No, which gangs?

482
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
Gangs. Assholes who don't like each other.

483
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,400
I'm sorry, Major, but we got nothing on it.

484
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,200
Play it. It don't make me no never mind.

485
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,900
It's all about trumps.

486
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,700
Evening, Omar.

487
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,500
Evening, Bruiser.

488
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,900
Speaking of them trumps now.

489
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,600
Hey, everybody.

490
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,300
What's for dinner, Jen? I'm starving.

491
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,800
It's working.

492
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,800
- Hi, Daddy.
- How you doing, beautiful?

493
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,000
Daddy, we shared with you.

494
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,300
That's nice.

495
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
Hey, Jen, you seen that tape
I was watching last night?

496
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

497
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,100
You gotta see this.

498
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,700
Videotape from last Monday night's
Council meeting.

499
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,600
Keiffer tried to block my resolution,
but I laid him out good.

500
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
I was in rare form, baby.

501
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,300
- You seen that tape?
- Maybe you left it in the VCR?

502
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,300
What? Son of a bitch!

503
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,500
- Who the hell...
- Daddy, Franky shared...

504
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,300
his sandwich with you.

505
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,000
We hid it so no one else could eat it
before you came home.

506
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,600
Can I get some chips
and pickles with that, too?

507
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,000
I don't want to disrespect you.

508
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,900
String been good to me, you know?

509
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,600
Not just my bills.

510
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,500
Him and Avon
probably think they owe me that much.

511
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,300
And it ain't what people might be thinking
or saying, either.

512
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,100
What they saying, honey?

513
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,300
It ain't like I don't miss D.

514
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,200
I do.

515
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,100
Yeah, well, I miss him, too.

516
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,200
- But he's been gone a while now.
- More than a year.

517
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,400
Stringer's fine.

518
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,800
No denying that.

519
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,100
I feel safe around him.

520
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,100
You asking to get with String...

521
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,100
I'm okay with that.

522
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,300
Thought you was gonna be mad.

523
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,700
I mean, everything with D
is so messed up, you know?

524
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,600
I mean, every time I think about <i>it...</i>

525
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
And you know this one police...

526
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,300
he came by here
and brought it all up again.

527
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,500
- Who did?
- Police detective from the city.

528
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,100
The one tried to turn D on Avon
when he got pulled up in Jersey.

529
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,700
White boy?

530
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,800
- Bushy hair?
- Yeah.

531
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,400
What'd he say?

532
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,600
What'd he say?

533
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,900
He said...

534
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,500
maybe D'Angelo didn't <i>take...</i>

535
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,000
You know.

536
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,900
Take his own life.

537
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,400
He said maybe it was something else.

538
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
And he came to you with that?

539
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,300
Left his card here one day...

540
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
but I didn't say nothing to the man.

541
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Just told Stringer, is all.

542
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,900
She's gonna run for Council?

543
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,500
She is.

544
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,700
Probably win, too, if I know her.

545
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,100
And you're the proud husband?

546
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,300
Not sure how that makes me feel.

547
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,600
It's just for show
until the election next year.

548
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,100
A city police lieutenant looks good
on her arm.

549
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Who even cares anymore?

550
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,000
Half the country are separated.

551
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,500
The other half are getting divorced
for the second time.

552
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
This is a favor. For her.

553
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,200
It's hard to explain.

554
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,700
Look, I disappointed her.

555
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,300
She lived through me for a lot of years...

556
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,300
telling herself I was tracked
for Deputy Commissioner at worst...

557
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,100
and past the police department,
who knows?

558
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,300
And there were some things that
happened a long time ago...

559
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,200
when I was in Eastern.

560
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,700
I guess she wanted more out of me.

561
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,400
I guess she wanted more out of me.

562
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,600
And after a lot of years and a lot of plans...

563
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,300
it turns out I have a better head
for police work...

564
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,300
than I do for climbing the ladder.

565
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,500
She hung in there thinking my career was
going to turn into some kind of big deal.

566
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,900
And I probably let her believe it
just to keep peace.

567
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,600
Now she wants to be the big deal.

568
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,700
What do you want?

569
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,200
I just don't want to disappoint her anymore.

570
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,700
And right now...

571
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,100
I'm more help
showing up at some chicken dinner...

572
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,100
in my wedding ring and dress blues...

573
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,000
than being
the not-even-divorced-yet husband...

574
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,400
with the white woman on his arm.

575
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,400
I'm going to do what I can to see
she gets what she wants this time around.

576
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,100
Nothing more than that.

577
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,000
Last seen Gerard, man,
he was racing bullets up on Fayette Street.

578
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,600
He appeared to be winning, too.

579
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Look, man, till he shows back up here...

580
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,500
we ain't gonna know
what happened out there.

581
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,300
I damn sure know one fucking thing
for sure.

582
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,100
Two of our people chalked
and we ain't got shit to show for it.

583
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,400
Man, police gonna be real heavy
on this, man. I say we slow down...

584
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,100
take our time to build our muscle...

585
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,600
No, I ain't got no more
motherfucking time, man!

586
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,200
When the word come out this boy, Marlo,
punking me, what I'm gonna look like?

587
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm gonna go do this shit my damn self.

588
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,900
No, man, you just this minute got home.

589
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,700
Your name come up in a murder beef, man,
they gonna pull your parole.

590
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Let me take care of this.

591
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,300
We was thinking, man, me and Cutty...

592
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
you know what I'm saying,
we could hit at them ourselves, man.

593
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,300
That way there won't be no fuck-ups.

594
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,200
Look, you two niggas get on it, man.

595
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,300
And get it right.

596
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,500
You see how shit have to be handled, man?

597
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,200
The game is the fucking game. Period.

598
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,400
Same as it ever was.

599
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't know though, man. I <i>mean...</i>

600
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,900
I <i>mean...</i>

601
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,600
I don't know, I was just down the way
with one of our young'uns...

602
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,900
on Vincent Street where they got the,
you know, the empty houses over there.

603
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,900
And they got crews over there...

604
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
twirling dope and coke
like the shit was candy.

605
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,000
Kids with a lemonade stand.
It's a different world down there.

606
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,600
Like the cops was just standing around
like that shit was...

607
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,000
legal.

608
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,400
I mean...

609
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,300
every day.

610
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,900
Now, that shit was business.

611
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,100
What you saying, man? What's up?

612
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,300
Nothing, man.

613
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,500
Nothing at all.

614
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Our CI tells us those are Stringer's people.

615
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,600
You want us to be about bodies,
now we are.

616
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,500
We had this kid, Marlo,
working for Stringer...

617
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,700
but that might be wrong.

618
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,600
He might be going to war for those corners.

619
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,800
Let me be clear.

620
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,600
This is no longer about Stringer Bell...

621
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,400
or Kintel fucking Williamson
or any of them.

622
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,900
What is my rank, Detective Greggs?

623
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,500
- My rank!
- Lieutenant, sir.

624
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,800
What is my rank, Detective McNulty?

625
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,500
If you can't remember that much,
then you can go the hell back to narcotics.

626
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,300
And you can go to whatever the hell unit
will still have you.

627
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,700
Now get the fuck out of my office.

628
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,300
Your message said you'd be here.

629
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,500
Still, kind of thought it'd be one of
your minions showed up in the flesh.

630
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,500
You called on some of my people's people.

631
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,000
I was just working.

632
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,800
Doing what a man is supposed to do.

633
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Well, I know you been busy.

634
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,000
Caught some talk from them young men
you rousted over there on the West Side.

635
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,000
That was about a gun belonged to a police.

636
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,400
Yeah, caught some talk about that, too.

637
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,300
This here, it's about something else.

638
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,200
Girl by the name of Tosha
who got her head blown off in a firefight.

639
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,200
If you're not here to cooperate,
then why are you here?

640
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,000
Okay, I could just pull up
that other girl from your squad.

641
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,300
She ain't gonna talk to you.

642
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,200
Ain't nobody gonna talk to you.

643
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,300
I just came here to make that clear, man.

644
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,800
Ain't no thing.

645
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,500
'Cause I already got me an eyeball wit.

646
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,800
You do?

647
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,800
I don't know about that.

648
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,700
Old Bruiser, he be blind
behind that fortified half the time.

649
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,000
Shit, you gonna have to dry him out
just to get him on the stand.

650
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,100
Besides, he done had a change of heart
to that story.

651
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,000
That's what I heard anyway.

652
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Shit, past that, y'all gonna have to call
this one of them...

653
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,000
Shit, past that, y'all gonna have to call
this one of them...

654
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,800
cost-of-doing-business things
y'all police be talking about all the time.

655
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,200
You feel me?

656
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,700
No taxpayers.

657
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,300
Shoot, the way y'all look on things,
ain't no victim to even speak on.

658
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,100
Bullshit, boy. No victim?

659
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I just came
from Tosha's people, remember?

660
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,200
All this death,
you don't think that ripples out?

661
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,400
You don't even know
what the fuck I'm talking about.

662
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
I was a few years ahead of you
at Edmondson.

663
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,800
But I know you remember
the neighborhood, how it was.

664
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,400
We had some bad boys for real.

665
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,900
Wasn't about guns...

666
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,000
so much as knowing
what to do with your hands.

667
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,400
Those boys could really rag.

668
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,300
My father...

669
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,900
had me on the straight.

670
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,800
But, like any young man,
I wanted to be hard, too.

671
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,000
So I'd turn up at all the house parties
where the tough boys hung.

672
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,400
Shit, they knew I wasn't one of them.

673
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,400
Them hard cases
would come up to me and say...

674
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,400
"Go home, schoolboy,
you don't belong here."

675
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,900
Didn't realize at the time
what they were doing for me.

676
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,800
As rough as that neighborhood could be...

677
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,300
we had us a community.

678
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,000
Nobody, no victim, who didn't matter.

679
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,200
And now all we got is bodies...

680
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,000
and predatory motherfuckers like you.

681
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,200
And, out where that girl fell,
I saw kids acting like Omar.

682
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,700
Calling you by name. Glorifying your ass.

683
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Makes me sick, motherfucker,
how far we done fell.

684
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,800
$25,000. You don't need more than that
to get it done.

685
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,200
The fuck you say?

686
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,400
I'm just telling you
how they do down at zoning and permits.

687
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,500
They know you got a general contractor...

688
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,400
and his people out there
sitting on they ass.

689
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,700
They know you paying twice that
every week they sit.

690
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,900
$25,000 gets me the permits?

691
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,800
$20,000 gets you the permits.

692
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,600
$5,000 is for me
for bribing these downtown motherfuckers.

693
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,200
I mean, I'm the one got to risk
walking up to these thieving bitches...

694
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,300
with cash in hand, right?

695
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,400
I'm telling you, String...

696
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,600
the people running the city nowadays...

697
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,200
they make the last bunch look sanctified.

698
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,600
I mean, this some shameful shit.

699
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,000
Permits come when?

700
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,500
Monday. Latest.

701
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,400
Spider bags! Green tops.

702
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,900
Spider bags!

703
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,300
Cut, that's him.

704
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,900
Fool.

705
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,100
Spider bags! Green tops.

706
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,600
- Yo, I know that nigga, man.
- Yeah?

707
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,600
- Owe me money, actually.
- Yeah?

708
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,600
Spider bags. Green tops.

709
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,900
- She ain't say it like that.
- Spider bags. Green tops.

710
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,100
No, she say it like she wanna
get pregnant and shit. Hold on.

711
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,500
You all right?

712
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,700
Damn!

713
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,100
I opened up too early, man.
I stepped on your shot.

714
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,300
Come on, let's roll.

715
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,800
Hey, yo, there go five-o right there, yo.

716
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,700
- Yeah, I know. It's nothing.
- Huh?

717
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,000
The cops be letting niggas
grind down here.

718
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,100
It's all...
Get the fuck out of here, little hoppers.

719
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,600
Get the fuck out of here, son.

720
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,300
Who are these little niggas?

721
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,700
Hey, yo, what if they lock us up?

722
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I hope y'all got toothbrushes.

723
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,400
'Cause down in Boys' Village...

724
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,200
you know what I'm saying,
if you don't have no toothbrush...

725
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,200
you gonna be using
some other boy's brush...

726
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,500
or rubbing your teeth
with your damn finger.

727
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,400
If you don't get locked up...

728
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,100
y'all can keep
an extra $20 each off the pack.

729
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,900
All right.

730
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,200
- Who got that fire, baby? That fire.
- WMD!

731
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,600
Come on, Tommy, give it up already.

732
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,400
Look, Terri, you gotta do this for me.

733
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,300
Tell me why you wanna be mayor.
And why should I vote for you over Royce?

734
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,400
'Cause something is wrong in that city
and I think I can fix it.

735
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,800
This guy, he don't give a shit
about tackling the problems.

736
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,100
Crime is out of fucking control.

737
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,700
Last week, a kid witness in a drug case...

738
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,700
turns up shot dead
because of flaws in the system.

739
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,600
I go to the Mayor who promises action.

740
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,900
And then Mr. "Reform is more than
the watchword of my administration"...

741
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,500
pats me on the ass,
thanks me for my concern...

742
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,300
points me out the door. The end.

743
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,900
So, with crime as the issue...

744
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,700
the great white father rides to the rescue...

745
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,700
against a black incumbent mayor,
in a city that's 65% black?

746
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,400
Black, white, green, people are pissed off.

747
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,400
What makes you think this is doable?

748
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,400
One, I hear the Mayor's got problems
in his base and with key supporters.

749
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,600
Two, I got the Police Commissioner...

750
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,300
Royce's own man, telling me all kinds
of stuff about his fucked-up department...

751
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,900
and about Royce's inner circle.

752
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,500
And three, Tony Gray,
from the Fifth District...

753
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,700
comes pretty close to telling me
he's thinking about a run for mayor.

754
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
That'd split the black vote.

755
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,000
You'd still need a player
who gives the black middle class...

756
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
permission to vote
against one of their own.

757
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,000
You got one of those in your pocket?

758
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,100
Not many of those around.

759
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,200
Elijah?

760
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,500
Congressional Black Caucus
ain't gonna save your skinny white ass.

761
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,300
What about Odell Watkins?

762
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,000
Well, it's funny you should mention him...

763
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,200
'cause I don't think he's too happy
with the Mayor right now.

764
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,500
I don't know. I hear a new poll
shows Royce's negatives pretty high.

765
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,100
You'd have to raise a load of dough.

766
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,600
He has to see it. I know he sees it.

767
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,000
It's past that now.
It's about us showing some respect.

768
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,700
Oh, fuck respect.

769
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,700
- He ain't right.
- No, he ain't.

770
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,100
But at this point, with you on the other side
of the argument, he'd rather be wrong.

771
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,900
Maybe if the word came down
from on high...

772
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
it might change his mind.

773
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,700
I mean...

774
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,300
if your friend Bunny Colvin's up to his ass
in bodies...

775
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,000
I bet he'd take all the help he can get.

776
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,400
Not that you'd ever go behind
anybody's back or anything like that.

777
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,000
Right?

778
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,200
No way.

779
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,200
Two more murders yesterday.

780
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,700
Another three today...

781
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,200
including a 14-year-old.

782
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,000
We're doing all we can.

783
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,700
You're at 260 for the year...

784
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,200
and it's barely October.

785
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,000
You promised me 275 or under, Erv.
I had that as a promise.

786
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,900
- Sir...
- We see 300 before the New Year...

787
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,500
and I'm not sure that I can justify
a full term for you.

788
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,100
Now, I hate to say it, but there it is.

789
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,100
Barksdale's people and who?

790
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,900
Marlo Stanfield. It's the new kid.

791
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,500
We've been on him a couple weeks.

792
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,700
I thought Daniels' people
are up in the Northwest.

793
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,900
Look, your war's
only gonna get worse, Major.

794
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,300
Northwest has been quiet for weeks.

795
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,400
You willing to backdoor your lieutenant
like this, huh?

796
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,800
You ain't changed, Jimmy.

797
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,500
Shit.

798
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,900
It's always about your case, huh?

799
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,900
Do what you can.

800
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,400
Keep my name out of it.

801
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,200
How'd it go?

802
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,800
We got one of the two
of them motherfuckers, you know?

803
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,700
You mean, you motherfuckers come
strolling in here all walking tall and shit...

804
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,400
Yo, B, man, I'm saying, man...

805
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,000
we was blazing on them dudes.
Man, you know what I'm saying?

806
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,300
Just got in the heat, man.
We was blazing, though.

807
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,200
- It was like...
- All right, all right. Relax, man.

808
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,100
I already heard. Go sit down.

809
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,600
I'm not tweaking behind none of this.

810
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,300
That's one less motherfucker
that's breathing than was yesterday.

811
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,000
You know what I'm saying? So we all good.

812
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,100
But I'm surprised at you, though, man.
Shit didn't get by you back when.

813
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,300
Wasn't my man's fault, man.
I unloaded on the young'un too soon, man.

814
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,700
Gave him enough room
to buck and run, man.

815
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,900
- I fucked that shit up myself, you know.
- Hold on.

816
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,800
It's on me.

817
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,000
I had that kid in my sights...

818
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,100
close enough to take off his Kangol
and half his dome with it.

819
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,600
Couldn't squeeze the trigger.

820
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,600
Couldn't do it, man.

821
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,800
Why not?

822
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,800
Wasn't in me, I guess.

823
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,700
You know, whatever it is in you...

824
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,700
that lets you flow like you flowing...

825
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,900
do that thing.

826
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,600
It ain't in me no more.

827
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,600
All right.

828
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,600
So you done soldiering, but you ain't done.

829
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,400
Could use you
for what you got in your head.

830
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,500
We're gonna put you on a corner,
you could be inside...

831
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,800
No, man.

832
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,400
I ain't making myself clear.

833
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,800
The game ain't in me no more. None of it.

834
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,100
But you ain't done shit else.

835
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,400
You know what I'm saying?
So what you gonna do?

836
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,900
I don't know.

837
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,200
But it can't be this.

838
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,300
All right then. We straight.

839
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,900
- See you.
- See you.

840
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,700
B, he was a man in his time, you know?

841
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,900
Yeah.

842
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,200
He a man today.

843
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,000
He a man.

844
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,500
Any idea what this is about?

845
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,700
Lieutenant.

846
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,200
What's he got in his head, right?

847
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,100
Here he is, Bunny.

848
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,300
Cedric Daniels to the rescue.

849
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,900
Man of the hour.
