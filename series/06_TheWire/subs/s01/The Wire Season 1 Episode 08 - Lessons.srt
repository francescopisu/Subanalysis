00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,700
Cleaned, corrected & sync adjusted by Tronar

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,474
Number 18.

3
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,776
Conine.

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,314
I knew that one.

5
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:19,283
All right, this one's for Mikey.

6
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,684
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, one lemonade, please.

7
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,183
You ready?

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,348
Number 6.

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,086
I know it.

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,987
- David Segui?
- Melvin Mora, numbnuts.

11
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,929
I thought Mora was number 9.

12
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,935
Guys, we're gonna play that spy game.
Remember the spy game?

13
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,231
- Yeah.
- Who's it?

14
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,398
That tall black guy over there.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,700
You're supposed to say
African-American, Dad.

16
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,142
African-American, then.

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,238
- I'm the front, you're the follow.
- I was the follow last time.

18
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,180
Don't argue, go on. Go.

19
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,847
Come on!

20
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,656
I got him.

21
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,909
Yeah, they're both brown hair, one that big,
the other about that big...

22
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,885
and he's wearing, I don't know
what the fuck he's wearing. He's...

23
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,149
Will Michael and Sean McNulty
please report to the offices...

24
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,693
at the rear of the market.

25
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,660
Michael and Sean McNulty.

26
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,955
Please report.

27
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,226
One pay phone goes down, don't mean shit.

28
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,859
Both at the same time, that's a plan.

29
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,439
- We spooked them.
- Busting the runner?

30
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,667
Maybe it's that, maybe it's something else.

31
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,641
We still got the tower phones.

32
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,178
And we're up
on Stringer Bell's pager now, too.

33
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,147
Yeah, but this shows
just how cautious these guys are.

34
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,083
We make any play,
and they're ready to change up on us.

35
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,053
If they're not using
the pay phones in the low-rises...

36
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,714
then what are they doing?

37
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,088
They're walking to another pay phone.

38
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,526
We might see more traffic
on the tower pay phones.

39
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,767
Sergeants' test's tomorrow, right?

40
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,828
4:00 in the afternoon.

41
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,937
You ain't gonna take it this time?

42
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,406
Sure, why not?

43
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,775
- You ain't gonna study?
- Sure I am.

44
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,774
You guys need to follow
some of the boys out of the Pit...

45
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,353
and see what they're using for pay phones.

46
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,121
Excuse me, is that a direct order?

47
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,248
I'm just saying...

48
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,918
If you wanna follow these assholes
from phone to phone...

49
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,552
why don't you do it yourself?

50
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,722
I'm in-office, remember?

51
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,799
- Right, they took your gun.
- For shooting your car.

52
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,767
No, that was before.

53
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,931
- That's right, that was something else.
- Right.

54
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,675
You believe this guy?
Like there are fucking stripes on his sleeve.

55
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,614
You guys need to get up
on those rooftops today.

56
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,347
See what these mopes are using for phones.

57
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,500
Come here, look at this shit.

58
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,873
What the fuck is that?

59
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,880
- Let me look at that shit.
- Bird told me that shit.

60
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,712
Fucking peter-puffer,
get the fuck out of here.

61
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,834
Mr. Omar, you want ends on this?

62
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,106
No, darling, I'm cool.

63
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,480
Nice shirt.

64
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,319
Yeah, fuck you.

65
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,483
It takes guts wearing a pink shirt
on the BPD Homicide unit.

66
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,083
Yes, it does.

67
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:46,892
Guts, or a familiarity
with alternative lifestyles.

68
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,228
- What are you chasing?
- Toyota Camry.

69
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,463
Whose?

70
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,396
It's listed to some woman
with a county address...

71
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,840
but Saturday, my man
Stringer Bell was using it.

72
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,639
You were working the weekend?

73
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,145
No, I'm down in the Northeast market
with the kids, right?

74
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,240
- Who should appear before me?
- Market day for String, too?

75
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:09,583
I know he makes me if I get too close,
so I tell Sean and Michael front-and-follow.

76
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,181
They're so good, I lose track of them,
scared the shit out of myself.

77
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,852
But they stay with him, spec the Camry...

78
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,430
and Sean, my flesh and blood, gets the tag.

79
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,396
Your kids know front-and-follow?

80
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,696
They fucking love it.
We play spy in the mall sometimes.

81
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,601
Anyhow, I got a Woodmore address
of a woman...

82
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,731
who lends her wheels to Stringer Bell.

83
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:33,311
- It's a start.
- The fucking family McNulty. Jesus.

84
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,807
What?

85
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,013
Wallace.

86
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,052
- What?
- Yo, Wallace.

87
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,923
- What?
- What's this about here?

88
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,225
This one here?

89
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,764
"A bus traveling on Central Avenue begins
its route by picking up eight passengers.

90
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,607
"Next, it picks up four more, and then an
additional two, while discharging one.

91
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,704
"At the next-to-last stop,
three passengers get off the bus...

92
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:14,309
"and another two get on. How many
passengers are on the bus at the last stop?"

93
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,555
Just do it in your head.

94
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,124
Yo, testers coming out today.

95
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,354
New package.

96
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,621
I might be down later.

97
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,332
Later?

98
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,061
Look, I'll catch you
around the way, all right?

99
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,837
Wallace, man, you can't just lay up in here.

100
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,670
- Seven, right?
- Dee been asking about shit.

101
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,109
- So what?
- I been telling him you sick...

102
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,908
but you know he won't let me carry that
too much longer.

103
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,711
Now, look, I be down later sometime.

104
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,982
- No, man, testers gonna be out.
- Look, man, fuck the testers, all right?

105
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,489
Fuck the testers, fuck Dee, fuck all that shit.

106
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:56,789
Just let me hold $10,
and I'll give it back to you by Friday.

107
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,729
How? Dee ain't gonna pay you
for not working.

108
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,164
Look, you gonna let me hold $10, or not?

109
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:08,999
Eight?

110
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,368
Damn, Sarah, look. Close your eyes.

111
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,071
You working a ground stash. 20 tall pinks.

112
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,343
Two fiends come up and ask for two each,
another one cops three.

113
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,544
Then Bodie hands you 10 more,
but a white guy rolls up in a car...

114
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,143
waves you down, and pays for eight.

115
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,812
How many vials you got left?

116
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,657
Fifteen.

117
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,455
How the fuck can you keep the count right,
but not do the book problem?

118
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,723
Count be wrong, they'll fuck you up.

119
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,766
- No, he coming to you.
- Today?

120
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,701
- Yeah.
- He in a rush or something?

121
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,070
No, we told him to do it like that.
He had his hand out last night...

122
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,405
and we told him first thing today.

123
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,480
- He ain't coming into the tower?
- No, not like that.

124
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,846
Just run 20 on down to him.
He gonna roll on his way, all right?

125
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,852
- Be there in, like, an hour, maybe.
- Who gonna know?

126
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,787
- Little Man, he know Day.
- All right.

127
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,856
That was Stringer Bell?

128
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,690
Calling tower pay phone number 1,
after taking a page 15 minutes ago.

129
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,388
- We know Little Man?
- Yeah.

130
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,728
Enforcer in the 221 building.

131
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,293
Okay, so he's rolling out of the 221
in about a half an hour or so...

132
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:15,237
with 20 whatevers to hand off
to someone named Day.

133
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,733
Product coming out of the towers.

134
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,276
We're usually trying to catch it going in.

135
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,610
Yeah, if you wanna catch them,
we're gonna have to hustle.

136
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,446
Wallace, man, he bugging.

137
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,049
- Where he be at?
- Nowhere.

138
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,648
He just lays around all day, you know?

139
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,351
Begged my ass off for sandwich money.

140
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,327
You worried about him?

141
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,695
I mean, shit ain't right, Dee.

142
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,899
You might consult with him some.

143
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:47,200
What the fuck, man? If he don't wanna
be down here, that's on him.

144
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,639
I mean, ain't like nobody holding
no gun to his head or nothing.

145
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,007
Yeah, but he ain't about nothing else.

146
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,273
He up in his room and shit, all the damn day.

147
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,316
All right, tell Wallace to come see me.

148
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,478
All right.

149
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,452
Be right back.

150
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,379
It's been two hours.

151
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,284
What if Little Man ain't working
in the 221 today?

152
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,251
What if this Day guy don't come?

153
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,098
What if he came,
and we missed the pick-up?

154
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,067
Yo, Herc, what if your mother
and father never met?

155
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,376
- How's shop doing?
- Steady rolling.

156
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,139
All right, let's take a ride.

157
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,715
- Beef run.
- Beef run, where at?

158
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,082
Pulaski, baby, the good shit.

159
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,248
Get in the car, man.

160
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,530
Yo, Poot. You the man for an hour.

161
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,504
Shit, look at me.

162
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,863
- Kima.
- The Lincoln, we're on it.

163
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,509
Hang back. Let's see where he goes.

164
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,719
I don't understand that, never did.

165
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,229
Damn, Bey, how can you stand that shit
with all that hot shit on it?

166
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:31,031
Man, trick is not to give a fuck, boy.
I got this, you know me.

167
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:34,629
So what? My uncle's cut y'all loose today?

168
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,173
No, we're celebrating.

169
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,869
Stinkum got some points
for some fresh territory.

170
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,503
I heard about that.
How much is yours in the package?

171
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:42,602
20.

172
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,876
We gotta run off the niggers
that been down there.

173
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,511
Ain't no thing.
Bunch of off-brand niggers is all.

174
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:52,123
You keep running that pit the way you been,
you gonna see points, too.

175
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,318
Yeah, you know, shit, I'm here waiting.

176
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,296
It'll come, right, Stink?

177
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,422
Yeah, I been talking to Orlando, right?

178
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,592
He said he got this good
coke connect from New Orleans.

179
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:07,295
Orlando?

180
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,809
He want me to put what he can get
out into the court, a little extra on the side.

181
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,743
I don't know, Dee,
you better talk to your uncle about that.

182
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,712
- Yeah, definitely.
- Hear that?

183
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,943
Yeah, I'm gonna see what he say on it. Yeah.

184
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,315
But, you know, today is your day, man.

185
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,946
- Stink day.
- His night, too.

186
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,582
Yeah, man, we gonna
break out tonight, daddy.

187
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,059
Bring some of Orlando's good pussy
over there by Little Man's.

188
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,523
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

189
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,533
You up there? You up?

190
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,833
- Yeah, he up.
- You up.

191
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,069
Nigger, I'm up! You don't gotta ask twice.

192
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,480
- What's wrong?
- No.

193
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,951
He give a fuck now.

194
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,116
Water.

195
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,494
- Step out of the car, sir.
- What did I do?

196
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,396
Step out of the car.

197
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,403
Go around to my partner, here.

198
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:20,077
- Man, look, I'm already late.
- Put your hands on the roof, please, sir.

199
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,377
Sir, you were observed in one of the city's
designated drug-free, anti-loitering zones...

200
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,917
where a drug suspect
leaned into your vehicle...

201
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,316
handing you something.

202
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,411
And when we signaled for you to stop...

203
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,013
you leaned over
as if concealing something...

204
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,492
- beneath the passenger seat.
- Look, enough of this shit, now.

205
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,995
- Is there something beneath that seat, sir?
- No.

206
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,032
Then you don't mind if we look, right?

207
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,591
Fuck y'all. This is some bullshit.

208
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:57,276
- That's none of your business, all right?
- How about if I make it my business?

209
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,827
You rang?

210
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,302
- Who's he?
- Damien Lavell Price.

211
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,001
He takes $20,000 in cash
out of the 221 building.

212
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,736
Lester picked up the drop
from one of the tower phones.

213
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,278
We followed him up Reservoir Hill
till he spotted us.

214
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,974
- He's a legislative aide?
- Who paged me?

215
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,510
He's in your office.

216
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,615
We popped him with $20,000 in cash.

217
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,020
- What kind of PC?
- Right off the wire.

218
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,355
Stringer Bell to someone on a tower phone.

219
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,655
We thought we were gonna
come up with drugs.

220
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,492
Got money instead.

221
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,325
I know this guy.

222
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:30,338
Orioles won last night.
Bullpen stood up to Boston.

223
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,035
You get that money cracking cribs, or what?

224
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,708
I'd like to speak to my attorney.

225
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,684
He was driving for a politician
at this fundraiser I went to.

226
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,784
- Which one?
- Someone from Annapolis...

227
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,760
from the looks of his ID, anyway.

228
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:54,491
- What do we charge here?
- He say the money's his?

229
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,031
He doesn't say shit.

230
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,331
Keep the cash, write him a receipt.

231
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,408
He wants to put a claim in
to the city solicitor, he can.

232
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:06,033
But they're gonna ask him
where he got the pile.

233
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,710
The angel of death.

234
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,712
Who's that?

235
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,614
Major Reed, llD.

236
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,789
Lieutenant, a word.

237
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,369
What's up?

238
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,106
- How you doing?
- Me?

239
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,944
Yeah, you. Everything is good?

240
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,746
I'm all right.

241
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,652
I mean, you fixed for cash
or something, man?

242
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:55,092
'Cause if you need a little something...

243
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,992
really, the thing to do is just to ask for it.

244
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,531
That's all I do,
is put money in your pocket...

245
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,760
and make sure
you don't stray from the nest!

246
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,858
Sit down.

247
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,337
Listen, the last motherfucking thing I need
is for the clean name on my liquor license...

248
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,137
to be dirtied the fuck up by you.
You understand that?

249
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,576
Avon, come on, man.

250
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,921
Do your fucking job!

251
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,609
I checked with
the state Personnel Department.

252
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,682
He's on the payroll
of Senator Davis' district office...

253
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,306
for more than a year.

254
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,352
He did four years in Hagerstown
for daytime B and E.

255
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,749
Before that, drug charges
and a PBJ on a check charge.

256
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:02,255
And now we catch him coming out
of the towers...

257
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,522
with $20,000 in manicured, banded money.

258
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,393
You brought him in here on what charge?

259
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,997
Civil forfeiture.

260
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:14,704
Until he tells us a legitimate source
for that money, we keep it.

261
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,568
So you have no criminal charge.

262
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,202
No, just the money.

263
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,445
Give it back.

264
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,811
- Sir?
- Give the man back his money.

265
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,453
Sir, we pulled this off the wire...

266
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,992
with one of our suspects telling
another to expect a pick-up.

267
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,121
- It's drug money in that car.
- Give him back his money.

268
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,696
Write it up as an unwarranted car stop.

269
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,231
Now I ask you to put a charge
on a drug dealer, Lieutenant.

270
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,706
That's all I ask.

271
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:55,309
And now I got wiretaps, pager clones,
affidavits coming out of my ass.

272
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:59,612
And you're in people's shit
where you're not supposed to be.

273
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,442
- Sir...
- I'm shutting this down, Lieutenant.

274
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:06,648
You charge what you can,
and you do it by the end of the week.

275
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,827
- We did nothing wrong here.
- You jacked up a senatorial aide.

276
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,927
You went into his pocket,
pulled out $20,000.

277
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:19,333
And though there's no criminal charge,
you think it wise to try to keep it.

278
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,538
You shit all over yourself...

279
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,768
all over me, all over this department.

280
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:30,579
Now, I told you, no surprises, remember?

281
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,490
$20,000, even.

282
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,120
Sign here, or you can
count it yourself, if you want.

283
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,226
So I can leave now?

284
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,674
Will somebody please tell me
what the fuck that was about?

285
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,484
This is bullshit.

286
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,385
We just gave back 20 large
of Barksdale's money.

287
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,359
Hey, what the fuck?

288
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,427
Let me guess, the Deputy?
How's he got onto this so quick?

289
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,228
- I told him.
- You told him?

290
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,034
Why would you be telling him?

291
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,439
He's the Deputy for Operations,
I arrested an aide to a state senator.

292
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,511
How do I not tell him?

293
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,672
Have you noticed there hasn't been
a complaint from the senator?

294
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:37,713
Know why?

295
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:41,377
What is his driver doing coming out
of the high-rises with so much money?

296
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,317
- I told the Deputy that.
- What did he say?

297
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,888
Mind our own business?

298
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,355
Give the man back his money
and go the fuck away?

299
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,585
Pretty much.

300
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,360
Except he said a few things
for my benefit, too.

301
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,192
Like how I had shit all over him.

302
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,596
Like how he was
shutting us down this week.

303
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,827
- The fuck he is.
- We're done.

304
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,171
I go past Friday, and I'm buried.
He told me that.

305
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,436
He's gonna bury you? For what?
You're doing your fucking job.

306
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,503
You think the job is gonna save me?
You think it's gonna save you?

307
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,582
Chain-of-command.
That's all I got from the Deputy, today.

308
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,014
Chain-of-command?

309
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,514
Did you tell your major about the
senator's driver? Or the Colonel?

310
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,748
No? Then where's your chain-of-command?

311
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:23,157
What's the shift lieutenant doing
going up the back stairs to the Deputy Ops?

312
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,264
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

313
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,496
Goddamn right.

314
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,869
Why, he got something on you?

315
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,634
You say you got the Deputy's ear.
What the fuck's he got on you?

316
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,438
Only rank, Detective.

317
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,397
Yo, Stink. What about the rules, yo?

318
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,331
Special occasion, yo.

319
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,680
Yo, Bey.

320
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,025
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, you ain't.

321
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,728
Burrell thinks I crossed him.

322
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,928
He said this to you?

323
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,028
In so many words.

324
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,164
- You need to explain then...
- Explain what?

325
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,037
That I'm bringing in a case
that goes everywhere?

326
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,771
Today, it was some senator's driver.

327
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,370
Two days from now,
a city councilman, maybe.

328
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,776
He asked for a charge on Barksdale.
That's all he asked for.

329
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,877
This thing with the legislative aide,
who could've foreseen it?

330
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:06,752
He saw it. Burrell.

331
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,829
See, this is the thing
that everyone knows and no one says.

332
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,398
You follow the drugs, you get a drug case.

333
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,864
You start following the money,
you don't know where you're going.

334
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,928
That's why they don't want wiretaps or
wired Cls or anything they can't control.

335
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,409
Because once that tape starts rolling,
who the hell knows what's going to be said?

336
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,379
That son of a bitch McNulty asked me
what the Deputy had on me.

337
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,979
He actually asked me that.

338
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,549
What did you say?

339
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,214
Where everybody go? Where the girls go?

340
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,910
Fuck it, man, party broke.

341
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,787
We drunked out and fucked out.

342
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,950
You all send me out for liquor,
and by the time I get back, the shit is dead?

343
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,585
Look at this.

344
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,390
The Knicks done fucked up their draft again.

345
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,066
What's with her?

346
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,565
Oh, fucked her silly. What can I say?

347
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:37,474
She snorted half the shit we brought up
in here, too, that greedy bitch.

348
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,699
Yo, Bey.

349
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,954
- You wanted to see us?
- What the hell is this?

350
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,756
I got copied this morning.

351
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,365
It's just what it looks like.

352
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:32,766
A memo signed by the Deputy Ops, Rawls
and Forester, telling us to pack it in.

353
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:37,740
We come down on the wire by Friday,
ship the computers to the DEA by Monday...

354
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,402
and charge whoever we have
by the end of next week.

355
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:42,342
Yeah? Who do you have?

356
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:46,639
Couple of mid-level guys.
Anton Artis, a.k.a. Stinkum.

357
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,284
Shooter named Bird,
wanted for killing Gant.

358
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,218
He was the witness in your court.

359
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,052
- That's it?
- Except for a couple of hangers-on, yeah.

360
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:57,059
Why are they doing this? Why now?

361
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,891
We picked up a bag man
coming out of the high-rises...

362
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,898
carrying $20,000 in cash, yesterday.

363
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,468
- So?
- So, he works for Clay Davis.

364
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,935
Of the 39th Legislative District.

365
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,397
The deputy was displeased.

366
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,999
It's okay, though.

367
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,475
We gave the money back,
said we were sorry.

368
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,808
- What can Daniels do?
- Not a fucking thing.

369
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:20,683
The Deputy sent him the same direct order
you have on your desk right there.

370
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,548
Get me Burrell on the line!

371
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:27,355
Detectives, when you swore
that your affidavit was true...

372
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,918
to the best of your ability,
what did the Circuit Court of Baltimore do?

373
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,333
- You gave us the wire.
- For how long, Detective McNulty?

374
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,901
Sixty days, no?

375
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,028
And how long have you monitored
these phone extensions?

376
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,466
Forty days, maybe.

377
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:44,473
Deputy Burrell is on the line.

378
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,336
Erv, it's Phelan.

379
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,108
Kiddo, you're fucking with me here.

380
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,110
Yes, you are.

381
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,114
Erv, listen to me.

382
00:30:58,222 --> 00:31:01,020
The Circuit Court signed two orders...

383
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,889
for a total of 60 days
of telephonic surveillance.

384
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,987
Now, I'm looking at a copy
of a memo from your office...

385
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,225
telling me I can't have my 60 days.

386
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,599
You're not hearing me.

387
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,573
The Circuit Court for Baltimore
ordered 60 days on this tap.

388
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,144
The Court wants its 60 days.

389
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:25,712
Now, if you take this wire down on Friday,
you'll be in contempt of court on Monday.

390
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,445
Understood?

391
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,252
And all the best to Arlene and the kids.

392
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,379
Yeah.

393
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,157
Who's your daddy now?

394
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:58,472
Look, I didn't do a damn thing, Lieutenant.
You got a beef, it's with the judge.

395
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,609
Yeah, he got the Deputy's memo,
he called his own shot.

396
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,148
Ask Greggs if you don't believe me.

397
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,382
Look, I've got to go.

398
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,578
Kima.

399
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,222
Deputy called, mad as the devil.

400
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:50,232
Tell them to quit packing.
We're back up on the wire.

401
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,502
Kima.

402
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,740
McNulty or the judge? Or both?

403
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,365
This time, the judge.

404
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,585
Ask me a question. Any question.

405
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,581
I thought you weren't studying.

406
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,487
This job is common sense.
Ask me a question, dickless.

407
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,025
See how I do.

408
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:19,127
"According to Q1..."

409
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,323
Hold up, help me out, here.
You have to know them by the numbers?

410
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,129
It helps.

411
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,336
Makes it sound more professional that way.

412
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,698
"According to Q1...

413
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,376
"the general order
covering sexual harassment...

414
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,242
"in the event a female officer
in your squad complains...

415
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,838
"that her side partner
has sexually harassed her...

416
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,110
"you should:

417
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,846
"A: Notify the commanding officer.

418
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,945
"B: Notify the shift lieutenant.

419
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:50,588
"C: Notify the ranking female officer."

420
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:53,158
I go with D.

421
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,724
D?

422
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,200
Yeah, bitch-slap the side partner
for dipping into my private stock...

423
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:02,067
then take missy home
and fuck her till she smiles.

424
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,557
What the hell?

425
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:58,325
When a small change in price
creates a large change in demand...

426
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,866
then demand is said to be elastic,
but some products are inelastic.

427
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,027
Meaning, a change in price
does not affect demand.

428
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:10,870
Some key factors that affect
the elasticity of demand are what?

429
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,341
- Mr. Bell?
- Desire.

430
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:14,902
Consumer need.

431
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:19,642
Right, specifically, the ability of a consumer
to delay acquisition. What else?

432
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,282
My pencil lost its point.

433
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,912
All the girls say so.

434
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:06,295
Damon, we got work orders here,
and ain't nothing happening.

435
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,764
These jobs were due yesterday,
and people going to be coming in here...

436
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,199
asking for their work
and nothing been done.

437
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,669
Man, fuck them. Let them wait.

438
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:18,833
No, you are not going to bring that
corner bullshit up in here, you hear me?

439
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:22,401
You know what we got here?

440
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,073
We got an elastic product.
You know what that mean?

441
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:29,516
That mean when people can go elsewhere
and get their printing and copying done...

442
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,609
they gonna do it.

443
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,713
You acting like we got
an inelastic product and we don't.

444
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:37,783
Now, I want this to run
like a true fucking business.

445
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,991
Not no front, not no bullshit.

446
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,294
Understand me?

447
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,966
I'm serious.

448
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:55,234
- Where you snatch this old wreck from?
- Out Frederick Road.

449
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,507
Ditch it over Eastside when we done.

450
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,543
Check it.
Him there, and that other fool there.

451
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,822
They the only ones might be trouble.

452
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,756
I'll drop Scar,
you just drop that other motherfucker.

453
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:13,159
No, just Scar.
His boy break, we going to let him.

454
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:17,399
- But if he raise up, I'm on him, see?
- Damn, I wish Bird was here, man.

455
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,332
Bird be loving this shit right here.

456
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,997
Which do remind me,
we get up out of here...

457
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,700
you need to drop that shit
down a storm drain.

458
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,710
Now give me some time
to go around the block...

459
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,440
and set up on the other side, all right?

460
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,246
What up, who got black tops?

461
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,253
Hey, now.

462
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,725
What the fuck?

463
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,860
Listen here, Bey.

464
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,828
You come at the king, you best not miss.

465
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,441
- Stink's been got.
- Stink?

466
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,910
- Bey caught one, too, in the leg.
- Shit, man, what happened?

467
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:46,471
- They down the gulley on Edmondson.
- Fucking Scar, man.

468
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,076
- No, it ain't him. Omar, man.
- Omar?

469
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,848
Bounty's going up on that bitch.

470
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,116
That fucks us.

471
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,216
We had Stinkum tied up with a bow
from the arrest of the runner...

472
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,628
and now he's out of the case.

473
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,228
The man's a fucking loose cannon.

474
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,731
- Literally.
- We've got to pull his ass up at least.

475
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,069
There's a dime on this cocksucker's head.

476
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:09,932
One of you motherfuckers needs to step up.

477
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,705
- Where you go with that?
- Maryland General.

478
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,247
Walked up in there and told them
I was on the corner, caught a stray.

479
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,078
- Police come talk to you?
- Just a roller, no homicide.

480
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,778
- Put it out there.
- Not just our people, either.

481
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,685
I'm talking about any nigger
who wants to step up.

482
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,114
Put out the word.

483
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:30,216
There's $10,000 on Omar
or any motherfucker standing with Omar.

484
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,387
Y'all niggers ain't got shit to do
but be on this motherfuckin' hunt.

485
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,692
- Now be on it.
- All right.

486
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,540
So, what you think, homes?

487
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,814
I'm thinking this is the worst
part of the game.

488
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,979
- Best we do is break out even, right?
- What?

489
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:02,457
I'm saying, this shit got personal.
Ain't nothing else to it.

490
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:08,398
- So, you talking about letting it slide.
- For a time, maybe.

491
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:12,461
I'm saying we put the word out
that you ready to talk a truce.

492
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,903
When this nigger come out
from underneath his rock, you hit him.

493
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,442
But right now? This shit got out of hand.

494
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,433
What you want me to say?

495
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,610
Look, I don't know nothing
about Stink getting dropped...

496
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,704
and I don't know nothing
about Bey getting shot, either.

497
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:01,842
- I don't know about this crazy nonsense.
- I don't know, it came back to us quick.

498
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,715
You know how that be.

499
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,483
Everybody want to believe
the worst about Omar.

500
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,186
But live and let live, you know?

501
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,853
I don't see you letting
them slide on Brandon.

502
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,226
If I was coming after certain people...

503
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:18,199
I definitely wouldn't want to give
y'all fine people any cause for concern.

504
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,997
There are rules here, right?

505
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,799
- Rules?
- Yeah.

506
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:24,772
No mistakes, no bystanders.

507
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,776
No taxpayers getting caught up in the mix.

508
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,943
I mean, you just get in close
and you hit the right nigger.

509
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,279
And lose the gun afterward,
that'd be a rule, too, I think.

510
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,943
One thing, Omar.

511
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,681
Having Stinkum dropped
kind of fucks us on our thing.

512
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,051
How so?

513
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,523
We had Stink caught
with 4 G-packs on a re-up.

514
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,958
And maybe we could've built
something on that.

515
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,327
- Roll him up with Stringer, maybe.
- Now he's got no roll to him.

516
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,992
So, the point is, Omar,
while we're all grateful...

517
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:55,629
for the case you gave us on Bird,
and we admire your do-it-yourself nature...

518
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,764
We need you to hang back.

519
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,409
Look, man, it ain't all up to me, right?

520
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,342
I got a bounty on my head.

521
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,849
Yeah, we saw the van.

522
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:15,184
Look, man, I do what I can do
to help you all, but the game is out there.

523
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,222
And it's either play or get played.

524
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,063
What, that it?

525
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,268
Gentlemen. Ma'am.

526
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,906
Lester, are we still cops?

527
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:43,114
- Technically, I suppose so.
- Okay, I was just checking.

528
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:48,515
Keisha ain't called, and she ain't been home.
How was she when you left her?

529
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,719
She was sick, I told you that.

530
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:56,289
She missed work last night and she ain't
been down there to pick up her check today.

531
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,637
You know something?

532
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,763
This game...

533
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:07,405
this thing with my uncle...

534
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,044
might not be right for me, I'm thinking.

535
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,306
Why do you say that?

536
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,943
Nothing good to it but the money.

537
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,980
Sounds a lot like my job.

538
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,224
I mean, you got people using each other.

539
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,426
Scamming each other.

540
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,061
Cutting each other up
because they're late on a bill.

541
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,366
Shooting folks because
there might be a fucking dollar in it.

542
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:44,180
It gets to sometime
like I can't even fucking breathe.

543
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,045
Like I can't even get no air.
You know what I mean?

544
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,282
Do something else.

545
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,786
- So, you happy with your job?
- Shit.

546
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,619
Well then, do something else.

547
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,755
I am. I'm going to have to. Shit.

548
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,629
Can't stay pretty forever.

549
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,869
It's not forever, right, Dee?

550
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,075
And then what?

551
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,885
You pretty now.

552
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,457
Now we pretty.

553
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,462
You got me, holler back.

554
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,461
Dee, man.

555
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,300
Raise up and roll in quick.
Stink been got, man.

556
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,204
You hear me? They got Stink.

557
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,544
I need your help.

558
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:31,321
Who caught the one
from Edmondson last night? Anton Artis.

559
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,651
Cole, with an assist from Dunnigan.

560
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,455
- Omar was the shooter.
- Fuck me.

561
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,262
It's all over the wiretap.

562
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,169
Okay, let's see.

563
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,298
We put down one murder on the testimony
of one eyewitness...

564
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:53,171
who then goes out and drops
somebody else.

565
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,973
Yeah, it was payback
for his boyfriend, Brandon.

566
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,048
Anton Artis is Stinkum, one of the boys
who snatched Brandon and did him up.

567
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,618
I'm sure that motherfucker
had his reasons, Jimmy...

568
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,389
You want to give back the Gant case,
then tell Cole the name of his shooter.

569
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,084
Otherwise, tell him we're hearing talk
on the wire...

570
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:12,525
and we'll give him his clearance
once we wrap our case.

571
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,692
But you won't.

572
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:18,761
No, we won't.

573
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:22,736
You want me to go and bullshit Cole
out of his case for you?

574
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,467
- Why don't you go tell him yourself?
- Are you kidding?

575
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:29,909
If Rawls sees my fingerprints on this,
he'll run my nuts through a cheese grater.

576
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,118
Fuck you, Jimmy.

577
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,350
- How's it going with it?
- Pretty good.

578
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,588
I like this kid who's fucking
my victim's old girlfriend.

579
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:50,330
Ray, can I talk to you for a minute?

580
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:54,936
In my office.

581
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:13,348
With cases like this one,
you are put in some strange fucking places.

582
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,585
Cole's doing good this year,
he don't need the clearance.

583
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,460
All right, I know this fucks him.

584
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:25,160
You should've seen his face when I told him
you'd give him his shooter down the road.

585
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,061
He's happy?

586
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,868
Yeah. He looked at me like a damn puppy.

587
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,003
- I'm sorry, Bunk.
- I'll carry it.

588
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:38,880
Fuck it.

589
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,084
No, tonight's mine.

590
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,623
Look, I'll tell you what, I'm going to roll out.

591
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,431
Here's the money
I would've spent on your ass.

592
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:00,864
Jimmy.

593
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:06,003
Call Nadine and tell her I caught one,
and I'm out on the street.

594
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,144
I lied for you, didn't I?

595
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,761
- You got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

596
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,666
I think I might have fucked something up.

597
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,897
Yeah?

598
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,472
I'm interviewing Omar, a few weeks back.

599
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:45,208
And he's giving it to me
that Bird is the shooter in the Gant case.

600
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:48,848
He tells me, if we catch up to Bird,
he'll have the gun on him.

601
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,283
Which he does.

602
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:54,617
But the thing is I told him that
we needed an eyeball witness.

603
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:56,919
At which point, he volunteers.

604
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,186
Maybe he saw it.

605
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:02,593
Or maybe he put himself in it
just to see Bird locked up.

606
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,228
I got the impression there
wasn't much love between them.

607
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,373
I fucked up, didn't I?

608
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,906
A little. But the gun matches.

609
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:19,644
And he's consistent with our witness
on the description and the scenario.

610
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:21,717
So, don't sweat it.

611
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,012
Kima.

612
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,122
You know, interrogation
is more art than science.

613
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,421
You've got to feel your way through
on instinct, mostly.

614
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,961
Come, take a look at this.

615
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,165
Who are they?

616
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:47,300
Some dancers who work at Barksdale's club.

617
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:50,273
I pulled their names
off of liquor board complaints...

618
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,473
and state employment records.

619
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,853
If you were going to try to turn
one these girls, which one would it be?

620
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,749
Her.

621
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,084
Why?

622
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:08,524
She doesn't have a record, for one thing.
She's just a DMV photo.

623
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,894
Why else?

624
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,567
I don't know. I can't really say.

625
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,167
I like her face.

626
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:18,238
Soul, conscience, whatever you want
to call it. She's a citizen, right?

627
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,240
It's in the eyes.

628
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:24,174
Instinct, Detective.

629
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,083
Yeah?

630
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,416
What?

631
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,161
Who is this?

632
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:43,555
He did?

633
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,060
How the hell did you get my number?

634
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:52,500
Yeah, okay.

635
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:55,375
Yeah.

636
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:02,209
- Ma'am?
- Get this crazy bastard out of here.

637
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,550
- What's the matter?
- He set off the smoke alarm, twice.

638
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,384
That good?

639
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,748
In the bathroom.

640
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,061
Bunk, it's Jimmy.

641
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:17,432
What the fuck?

642
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,162
Bunk, wake the fuck up.

643
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,372
- Bunk, wake up.
- What?

644
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,406
- The fuck are you doing?
- I hear you, Jimmy.

645
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,971
What are you doing?
Where are your fucking clothes?

646
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:33,246
Right here.

647
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,884
- Who gives a shit?
- Come on, man.

648
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:37,976
No.

649
00:52:38,888 --> 00:52:41,618
What did you burn your clothes for, man?

650
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,990
Got hair, got fibers and...

651
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,730
got pussy on it and...

652
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,066
What, trace evidence?

653
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,966
You smell pussy?
I don't smell no pussy no more.

654
00:52:57,073 --> 00:53:00,634
- Knock it off.
- I think you all can just take my ass home.

655
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,878
Trace lab ain't going
to have shit on the Bunk.

656
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:08,349
That shit. No fucking case file, Detective.

657
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,811
Where are your fucking shoes, man?

658
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:14,520
Ma'am, you seen his shoes?

659
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:18,117
Give me that pussy,
and now you going to take my shoes?

660
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,297
That ain't right, shit.

661
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,572
Shit.

662
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,804
Christ, Jimmy.

663
00:54:16,986 --> 00:54:20,478
Bunk, I'll give you that
burning trace evidence makes sense.

664
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,256
What the fuck did you plan to wear home?

665
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,062
Shit.

666
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,499
Jimmy, you know something?

667
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:37,229
You're no good for people, man.

668
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:42,334
I mean, damn. Everybody around you...

669
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,110
Christ.
