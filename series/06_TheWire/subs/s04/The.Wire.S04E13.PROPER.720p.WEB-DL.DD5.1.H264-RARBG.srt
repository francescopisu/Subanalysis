1
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,344
A-boom-boom ba-too ba-too ba-too
boom boom

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,014
Bam ba-dam bam ba-dam bam ba...

3
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,527
All that from overnight?

4
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:31,531
All that from Freamon.
He's out early today rooting through empties.

5
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,701
You know what he is?

6
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,036
He is a vandal.

7
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,038
He is vandalizing the board.

8
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,708
He is vandalizing this unit.

9
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:46,629
He is a Hun, a Visigoth,
a barbarian at the gate,

10
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,673
clamoring for noble Roman blood

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,551
and what's left of our clearance rate.

12
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:55,096
- And you sit here doing what exactly?
- A hot shot, maybe.

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,599
I got a sack in the box, says he owns one
from a couple days ago. White Coat Alley.

14
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,394
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

15
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,606
Is everybody on a crusade
to make more murders out of bullshit?

16
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:09,652
The mope's confessing, Jay.
He walked up to the Western desk to do it.

17
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:13,156
Well, at least when you
go to manufacturing a murder, Eddie,

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,199
you already have a suspect in hand.

19
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,326
I respect that part of your game.

20
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,204
Oh, that others might learn.

21
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,124
I need a witness for the statement
in box number one.

22
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,794
Yeah. Let me dump my shit. I'll be there.

23
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,214
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,467
Sodium cyanide.

25
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,761
You're telling me,
if we do a full tox screen on this kid,

26
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,804
he comes back positive for cyanide?

27
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:41,100
Yeah. That's what I'm saying, OK?

28
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,311
You need to lock me up

29
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,438
because I killed that boy, I did.

30
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:51,444
I did it. I did it. So just lock me up
and be done with it, all right?

31
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,113
Where'd you get the cyanide?

32
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,704
You, you getting sick there, bunky?

33
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,749
When's the last time you had your medicine?

34
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:10,129
No. No, I'm not getting high anymore, OK?

35
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,800
Let me ask you again,
where'd you get cyanide from?

36
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,802
If you're saying...

37
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,805
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry.

38
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,350
- Shit. He got my fucking sleeve.
- Just calm down.

39
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,311
We'll get something to clean this up,
and maybe a soda or something.

40
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,356
- Get some sugar in you at least.
- I'm sorry.

41
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,443
He settles down, I'll Miranda.

42
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,320
Yeah.

43
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,242
Fuck.

44
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,601
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock

45
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,612
Steals like my ex-wife's lawyer.

46
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,827
Jesus.

47
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,246
Get up there.

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,540
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Give me a sec!

49
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,625
Come on.

50
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,686
Call 911. The mutt in box one
just tried to hang himself.

51
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,289
When you walk through the garden

52
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,583
Watch your back

53
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,336
Well I beg your pardon

54
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,922
Walk the straight and narrow track

55
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,467
If you walk with Jesus

56
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,968
He'll save your soul

57
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:26,599
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

58
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,352
He's got fire and the fury

59
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,896
At his command

60
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,649
Well, you don't got to worry

61
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,943
Hold on to Jesus' hand

62
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,904
We'll be safe from Satan

63
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,573
When the thunder rolls

64
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,952
But you gotta keep the devil

65
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,079
Down in the hole

66
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,877
Oh yeah, mm

67
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,467
We'll be safe from Satan

68
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,973
Gotta keep the devil

69
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,684
Down in the hole

70
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,980
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

71
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,816
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

72
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,318
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

73
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,113
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

74
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,699
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

75
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,701
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

76
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,714
No idea on this one.

77
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:44,301
Two in this block and three off Lanvale.

78
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,928
They cluster.

79
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:50,057
When they found a block they liked,
they came back on it.

80
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:54,854
- One in the next block, across Gilmore.
- That makes nine.

81
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,024
Scary thing is we're only
looking at one district.

82
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,109
Shit. One sector.

83
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,488
How far you think they might have roamed?

84
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,409
There's only one way to find out.

85
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,708
Excuse me. Daniels.

86
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,336
- How we doing with forensics?
- That's the colonel's domain,

87
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:23,799
but my understanding is that we're
sending a lab team to every house.

88
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,385
So far we're finding nine-millimeter casings.

89
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,556
Once they start scoping at the morgues,
we'll probably have slugs to go with them.

90
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,517
Tracewise, we're laser-printing
around every body

91
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:38,439
and vacuuming every crime scene for hair
and fiber, but, of course, these are vacants.

92
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,443
It'll take our lab a year
to sift that many bags of dirt.

93
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,822
- Is this all from one drug crew?
- Probably.

94
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,700
- Marlo Stanfield's bunch.
- Where are we on them?

95
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:53,037
Major Crimes was working wiretaps
until three months ago,

96
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,665
- but we came down on those.
- Can we get back up?

97
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,002
Trying, but Stanfield's people
may have changed up the pattern.

98
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,089
Well, Colonel, whatever you need.

99
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,134
Actually, what I need is Patrol.

100
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,596
- Patrol Division?
- That was Detective Freamon on the phone.

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,016
We found two more at Lafayette
and another on Lanvale.

102
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,602
- Jesus Christ.
- Starting at the first scene,

103
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,439
we've been going door to door, but there's
no telling how far the shooter wandered.

104
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,817
And with 15,000 vacants in the city,

105
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,111
it'll take my people weeks
to cover that ground.

106
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:35,955
He brings this case in,
he'll be closer to the throne.

107
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,791
Look, I wouldn't worry about Daniels.

108
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,668
He's a long way from my chair,

109
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,128
as are you.

110
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,923
You made your move too soon.

111
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,510
I did.

112
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,930
Politics doesn't suit you. Stick to operations.

113
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,226
And don't you ever cross me like that again.

114
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,899
Get it out to all the bulletins.

115
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,195
Leander, go downtown.

116
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,072
Run a flyer for every roll call.

117
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,450
Show them the nails
and the screws in detail. All right?

118
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,370
You grab a couple of those nails
and hit all the hardware stores.

119
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,664
Find out exactly what the model is
that we're looking for.

120
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,834
- What do you need from me?
- Herc.

121
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,961
I'm serious. Get hold of him.

122
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,844
- How's he looking?
- Pretty good, considering.

123
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,346
No worse than before he hung himself.

124
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,269
- The fuck are you going?
- West Side. Freamon found another.

125
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,272
Fucking Freamon.

126
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,611
- He a transport?
- Borderline. BP and pulse are normal.

127
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,988
We gave him Ativan for withdrawal.

128
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,492
Hey, you want to go to a hospital?

129
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,463
Let me ask you something.
What kind of a fellow rigs up a hot shot,

130
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:12,051
then walks into a police station
to talk about it? Huh? Who does that?

131
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,638
- You want us to wait?
- No.

132
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,730
What is in your head, fella?

133
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:36,158
The hot shot was for this motherfucker
that's been beating on me.

134
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,329
And the boy?

135
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,129
He was dipping.

136
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,008
I knew he was. I...

137
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,014
I just didn't... I didn't think...

138
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,354
The child had no one for him.

139
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,439
No mother, no family.

140
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,485
He in the street like I'm in the street.

141
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,738
So I tried to, um...

142
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,790
Like I ain't know who I am, right?

143
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,713
Like I'm pretending I ain't been
a dope fiend my whole damn life.

144
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,806
Just lock me up, man.

145
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,400
'Cause I killed that child.

146
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,685
The shot wasn't for the kid.

147
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,689
Let's throw this one back.

148
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,569
This sad-ass motherfucker's carrying
more weight than we'll ever put on him.

149
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,447
What about the clearance?

150
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,784
- Fuck the clearance.
- Cut him loose?

151
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,704
Shit, he'll go off a roof or some shit.
My luck, I'll catch that call too.

152
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,248
Maybe D ward over at Bayview,

153
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,334
something with soft walls.

154
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,712
Is you out of your mind, nigger?

155
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,382
You think I'm-a pay you twice
for the same motherfucking package?

156
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,219
I'm in the same box here. Faggot took
my shit same as he took y'all's.

157
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,306
Man, that's on your own people.
Your guys was the ones doing security.

158
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,185
Hey, they worked it the same as we did
the last dozen shipments.

159
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,604
Y'all was fine with it up until this, right?

160
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,732
Ain't no one have a problem with it
till the motherfucker gave us one.

161
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,568
Thing is, Joe, we called a quorum on this,

162
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,738
took a vote that says it's your people
need to make this right.

163
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,075
No, no, a co-op means share and share alike.

164
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,244
You share the good and you share the bad.

165
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,875
All right.

166
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,839
I'll dig deep and do the full shipment
if that's what y'all need,

167
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,592
But don't even think about coming
back to me for a re-up after this,

168
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,179
'cause when that good raw shit
comes straight off the boat,

169
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,597
it's gonna be mine only,

170
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,101
seeing as how y'all can't find
the heart to stand with me now.

171
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,943
You want to quorum up again,
think it over a little?

172
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,198
Yeah, I thought you might.

173
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,120
I'll get word back that we need
a fresh shipment, and right quick,

174
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,790
and you can think about what we need to do
to improve security,

175
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,792
make sure it only happens the once.

176
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,184
What's up, young 'un?

177
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,985
Which one of your people
was in charge of the stash?

178
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,238
I mean, I want to talk to him.

179
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,617
My nephew. My sister's boy.

180
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,661
I can't give him up like that.

181
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,581
I can't do it.

182
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,585
My connect had people there
when the shit went down.

183
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,629
If that's what you need to make you believe,

184
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,963
you can hear it straight from him.

185
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,310
- Gente.
- Huh?

186
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,356
- What's up?
- ¿Todo bien?

187
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,274
Yeah. Good.

188
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,740
- OK?
- OK.

189
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,917
We are rich. That's what I'm talking about.

190
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,341
Butch.

191
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,763
My man. Mm.

192
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,936
Right, now, girl, you sell
that off slow, you feel me?

193
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
'Cause word gonna get around.

194
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,399
- They gonna come back on you now.
- Nah. None of that.

195
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,818
Yo, anybody ask about me on another job,

196
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,988
tell 'em, "Kimmy been retired," all right?

197
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,741
Be easy.

198
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,870
How much you got left after splitting
with the Mexicans?

199
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,914
26 raw.

200
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,584
Mm. Gracious.

201
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,086
Only problem, I'll spend the rest of my life

202
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,588
trying to put that out on the street.

203
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,924
I ain't no drug dealer, Butch. You feel me?

204
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,009
Mm.

205
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,928
Shit, we just stole too much this damn time.

206
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,351
So, what am I gonna do, Butch?

207
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,106
Well......

208
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,775
you could come give Joe a call.

209
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,071
Offer to sell the shit back to him
for 20 cents on the dollar.

210
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,993
Joe, Joe oughta find some humor in that.

211
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,078
I know you do.

212
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,007
I understand there's a waiting list.

213
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,010
The thing is this kid has already
been in a foster home.

214
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:14,640
Right. And now his foster mother's
been hospitalizeed, so...

215
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,267
Right. No.

216
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,980
Is there a supervisor that I can talk to?

217
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,317
I'm gonna be a little late for roll call.
Gotta get this kid settled.

218
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,693
What's wrong with DSS?

219
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,404
On the phone with them right now.
They're talking about a group home.

220
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,865
Either you come up with a guardian,
or he goes to Social Services.

221
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,949
No two ways about it.

222
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,662
Hello? Hello?

223
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,007
Need your help. Get dressed.

224
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,678
I'm suspended with pay,
pending a full trial board.

225
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,638
Can't do nothing for no one, Kima.

226
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,766
Fuck what they say. This here's police work,

227
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,602
and I'm asking if you police.

228
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:06,066
All right. Listen up, you mutts.
This is complicated. It isn't complicated

229
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,110
if you went to college or...

230
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,696
I don't know, your mothers actually
stopped drinking for a minute

231
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,155
while they was pregnant.

232
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,034
But for Baltimore City Police,
this is complicated.

233
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,956
Anyway, this right here is for
the Major Crimes homicide investigation

234
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,292
into the bodies being found
in the vacant houses here in the Western.

235
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,921
Command now wants all the districts
to check every vacant in the city.

236
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,550
That means you will need to go door to door
to every vacant house in your post

237
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,969
and look at what was used to board it up.

238
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,055
Most will have the Phillips head
screws that HCD uses,

239
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,390
like this here on the flyer.

240
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,935
But if you see a house that's been
boarded up with nail-gun nails

241
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,895
like these shown here,

242
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,315
call your sector sergeant immediately.
You can enter the house

243
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,446
but, if you find a body,
do not disturb the crime scene. All told.

244
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,700
What I don't understand is
why they keep busting my balls about this.

245
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,078
Daniels gave me a slap on the wrist
for the thing with the minister.

246
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,540
Marimow got bounced just before
he could fuck me up on anything else.

247
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,751
You sure we on the right block?

248
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,920
Yeah. Put them on the curb right here,
more or less.

249
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,090
And then you fired the nail gun
into the asphalt, right where they sat?

250
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:16,261
Yeah. Right next to the little broad's leg.
So who tells these IID fucks

251
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,639
to start running through my paperwork,
looking for who the fuck cares?

252
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,266
I mean, it's not like they caught me stealing

253
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,976
or brutalising motherfuckers, right?

254
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,021
Bunk.

255
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,860
Yeah, it looks like it could be.
Is that about right?

256
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,863
Yeah.

257
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,115
Must have worked itself free.

258
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,125
I took them nails to Ballistics.

259
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,211
Comparer said he could match
anything out of that gun,

260
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,422
and maybe the nail gun itself,
if we could get it.

261
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,218
I know they'll take my stripes,

262
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,386
but you don't think they're
gonna go past that, right?

263
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,388
Herc, what'd you do exactly?

264
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,644
Lost the camera I took from ISD
without my lieutenant's approval.

265
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,230
And what evidence I got from the camera,

266
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,566
I put to a made-up informant.

267
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:18,031
Son, they're gonna beat on your
white ass like it's a rented mule.

268
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,160
Fuck.

269
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,622
Make him sign it.

270
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,500
...to himself, that cocksucker.
I hate that bastard.

271
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,002
He called him cocksucker.

272
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,674
Damn bedside.

273
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,930
You're gonna break that call button.

274
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,182
Look, I'm sorry. I don't mean to bother y'all,

275
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,851
but I don't get but four channels.

276
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,979
- That's all you get.
- What about my man over there?

277
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,689
He has insurance.

278
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,233
And insurance pays for his cable hook-up.

279
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,569
Only reason you're admitted is that fracture.

280
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,197
Soon as we can discharge you, we will.

281
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:04,202
All you gangsters
wash up in our ER like it's your due.

282
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:08,456
You could stand out there
slinging drugs till you get shot or cut,

283
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,961
have us put you back together
free of charge so you can do it again.

284
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,839
- Gangster, huh?
- Oh, you're not that?

285
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,799
I pulled your admissions.

286
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,510
You were here in '90 for a gunshot wound,

287
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:24,431
and, three years before that, you were
here for chest surgery for a cutting.

288
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,892
Long time back, yeah.

289
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,768
And I see you're still at it.

290
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,148
Dennis Wise, I'm Howard Colvin.

291
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,649
Are you police?

292
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,575
I used to be

293
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,328
but now I'm a bit of a teacher up at Tilghman.

294
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,458
I got a little problem
and you know Carver over at the Western,

295
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,294
he said you might be able to help me.

296
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,590
I went up to, uh, your gym.
They told me what happened.

297
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,677
What is it that I'm supposed to know about?

298
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,930
It's Namond Brice.

299
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,307
Yeah. What's the problem?

300
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,392
Oh, sh...

301
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,687
Well, I've just come to care about the kid.

302
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,528
You heard it was Little Kevin?

303
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,782
I seen one of the police step out
the household with his necklace.

304
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,367
That's Kevin up in there, yo.

305
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:33,249
This motherfucker be killing niggers
just to do it. See?

306
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,878
Nigger killing motherfuckers just
'cause he can,

307
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:37,963
not 'cause they snitching,

308
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,216
not 'cause it's business,

309
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,551
but 'cause this shit just come natural to him.

310
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,388
- Yo, Bodie, man...
- I mean, Little Kevin is gone.

311
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,766
This nigger don't feel nothing. And all them
motherfuckers in them row houses,

312
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,435
- nobody mean a fucking thing to him.
- Bodie, calm the fuck down.

313
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,604
Fuck Marlo, man! Fuck him,

314
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:58,316
and anybody that think
it's all right to do people this way.

315
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,403
You hear me? Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.

316
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,071
Get the fuck off me, man.

317
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,408
That's his friend in the bag.

318
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,457
It's like that nigger ain't fit, man.

319
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:19,170
- Fuck up that police car!
- Take his ass downtown.

320
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,799
- This motherfucker goin' down.
- You see that shit, yo?

321
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,719
- Lock his dumb ass up.
- Attica!

322
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,014
Attica! Attica!

323
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,726
The number of victims discovered shot
to death in the boarded-up buildings...

324
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,519
How flattering for us.

325
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,730
Knocks the school deficit off the front page.

326
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,066
- There's your silver lining.
- Those bodies are on Royce.

327
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,693
School deficit should be too.

328
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,320
Should be, but that'll play out in the next
fiscal year.

329
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,655
By then you're out of Teflon.

330
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,950
So I take the governor's money,
then two years from now,

331
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,911
when I shake the hand of any voter
in the DC suburbs, they say,

332
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:56,416
"You're the guy who needed my tax dollars
to bail out your school system."

333
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,544
If you take his check, you lose votes
in Prince George's and Montgomery,

334
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,713
and you can't beat him statewide
without the counties.

335
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:06,342
Two years from now, if you're governor,
you can help the city from Annapolis.

336
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,386
He's the mayor now.

337
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,472
I agree we can't fix the city schools

338
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,724
but we can't let them get any worse either.

339
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,519
Go to Annapolis. Eat his shit.
If we lose control of the schools,

340
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,188
Nerese and the teachers'll rip you

341
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,149
but the rest of the city'll see
you did it for them kids.

342
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,860
Kids don't vote.

343
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,386
Taking a risk with our supply, ain't you?

344
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:54,307
I mean, setting up a meet
with anybody other than us.

345
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,519
Got to. The boy crave reassurance.

346
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,106
Boss, you get that boy Marlo in line
on our connect,

347
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,819
he might try to go round the co-op,
go round us. You know what I'm saying?

348
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,280
Cautious as those Greeks be,
who you think they gonna trust?

349
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,783
They know us. They don't know him.

350
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,788
Damn. Look at this nigger coming round.

351
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,333
Easy, son. Easy.

352
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,802
Yeah. I knew I'd find you boys
in here, burning that oil after hours.

353
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,762
Nigger, I'm-a kill you twice.

354
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,557
Oh? So you don't want your shipment, huh?

355
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,895
Say your piece.

356
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,693
Well, it just so happens
I got some hairon for sale.

357
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:50,196
Marketwise, you fellas
look like buyers. You feel me?

358
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,157
This some shameless shit.

359
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,159
Ain't no shame in my game, dawg.

360
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,495
I'm here about the business.
Ain't that right, Joe?

361
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,249
- How much?
- 20 on the dollar.

362
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,293
Ten, nigger.

363
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,171
Don't make me say 25 now.

364
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,258
That's 400,000.

365
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,970
How about we take your
faggot ass in the back room

366
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,182
and get into some diabolical brutality,

367
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,517
find our shit the old-fashioned way?

368
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,478
- Feel me?
- Oh, I feel you.

369
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,689
Sound like a plan.

370
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,443
But I don't know, though, Joe.
You think Omar gonna give it up?

371
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,237
20 on the dollar it is.

372
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,954
Say, how's she ticking, Joe?

373
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,765
Oh.

374
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,857
I'll be in touch.

375
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,201
And he thinks I'll help the schools,

376
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,454
help the city a lot more
if I'm governor two years from now.

377
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,834
Thinking that way it wouldn't
just be about me if I don't take the money.

378
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,171
Are you asking me what I think?

379
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,218
I think you'll do the right thing.

380
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,452
For real, I'm telling you the truth.

381
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,415
It tickles.

382
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,296
You sure you want to do this?

383
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,298
I don't wanna hurt you.

384
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,049
Nah.

385
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,033
Detective Crutchfield,
do you have a moment?

386
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:26,371
Yes, ma'am. Is something wrong?

387
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:30,083
I've got a question
on these reports.

388
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,043
Were they all found in the basement?

389
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:37,382
No, ma'am. We found most in the basement,
but some are on the upper floors too.

390
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:42,095
Can you be specific in the 24s,
for my sake, anyway?

391
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,930
- No problem.
- Thanks.

392
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:46,766
How many so far?

393
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,061
- 17.
- Christ.

394
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,146
That's a lot of red names.

395
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,024
It's your first red ball.

396
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:59,904
Yeah. I thought I'd get a nice quiet
domestic or two to start me off.

397
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,906
We got national press on this already.

398
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,449
You'll be fine, Ronnie.

399
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,245
Just don't let any of these guys
see you sweating.

400
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,414
Hey, I need a case dropped.

401
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,667
To tell Mello to sign off I need a friendly ASA.

402
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,380
He kicks out a radio-car window,
and you wanna give him a walk?

403
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,428
What's the date range as per decomp?

404
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,471
The one on Mount Street
looked about a week?

405
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:28,141
Some a few days,

406
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,810
some are skeletal at this stage.

407
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,439
- They all head shots?
- Multiples, most of them.

408
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,524
- Black males, 15 to 25?
- Uh-huh.

409
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,651
No, some older.

410
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,779
We got one in a security guard's uniform
here somewhere.

411
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,573
- You laser-print?
- Mm-hm.

412
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,575
Vacuum the rooms?

413
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,829
- Yes.
- Gluco for blood? What's the geography?

414
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,916
13 on West Side, Baltimore
to Winchester, Schroeder to the Grove.

415
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,919
The Eastern boys found four more
on Monument Street.

416
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,921
- East Side?
- That threw us.

417
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,256
We're casting a wider net now,

418
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,510
- searching the vacants citywide.
- My number's 23 in the office pool.

419
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:08,639
- I still have hope.
- Hell of a case, right here.

420
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,144
You know, if I was police,
I don't think I could lean back on it. You?

421
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,230
- Not if I was real police.
- Right. Right.

422
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:20,401
Thank you, Detective.

423
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,750
What's up?

424
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,525
- Calvin, you done already?
- Yeah, I'm done.

425
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:30,346
Attention, a reminder.

426
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,934
Answer sheets must be turned
into the office by you and only you

427
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:38,563
immediately upon completion of the tests.

428
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,315
Thank you for your cooperation.

429
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,526
Where are we on the nail gun?

430
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,612
A Hilti DX model. High end
but common among contractors.

431
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,490
Is it what Sergeant Hauk saw
in the back of Chris Partlow's truck?

432
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,409
We showed him one, and he thought so.

433
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,745
Then we dragged his ass back down
to the block where he did the car stop.

434
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,665
- Anything?
- We found what might be a hole

435
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,793
where he said he fired
into the street but no nail,

436
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,921
even after sweeping the block
with metal detectors.

437
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,173
Probably took a ride in some bastard's radio

438
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,967
but now it's in a tire pile somewhere.

439
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,886
So our next move is a search
and seizure on that truck.

440
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,599
And a court order for hair
and blood from Chris and Snoop both.

441
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,226
With everything we're pulling
out these houses,

442
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:19,061
we might get lucky with tracework.

443
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,273
- What's your PC?
- Herc sees the nail gun.

444
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,816
Nothing wrong with owning a power tool.

445
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,861
What's the PC on Chris and Snoop
specifically?

446
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,946
A witness.

447
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,825
The boy who was told by a co-conspirator
who the murderer was.

448
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,203
The boy is a source. He's not a witness.

449
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,706
If he's just a source, you don't have enough.

450
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,002
But with the links between some of these
bodies and Stanfield, we have a pattern.

451
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,464
Weak. Very weak.

452
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,424
Oh, fuck it.

453
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,385
Give me an hour.

454
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,475
You haven't left me alone all week.

455
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,479
Every time I come out of the pool,
you want to dry me off without a towel.

456
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,318
- Dennis Wise.
- Hey, man.

457
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,737
Yeah. Were you able to get some word?

458
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,075
On my say-so, he willing
to sit and hear you out.

459
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,745
But what you asking him for... I don't know.

460
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,417
Good luck, though.
If you see my man Carver again,

461
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,712
you tell him he owe me one now.

462
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,591
- All right, man. Appreciate it.
- You got it, bro.

463
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,596
- All right.
- Y'all coming back with a warrant?

464
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,350
The roughneck in room 232.

465
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,313
From what I know,
he runs a gym program for kids.

466
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,608
He got himself shot
for trying to pull a kid off the corner.

467
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,657
Look, you need to speak up now or face
the fact that you never spoke at all.

468
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,620
They wouldn't let me see my son at marches.

469
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,791
Said there wasn't much left
by the time y'all found him.

470
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,839
We did the best we could
with the information we had.

471
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,434
Word come to me that a man named Chris

472
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,937
and a girl named Loop or Snoop
or some such

473
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,065
took my son and killed him.

474
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,443
Told I would never see my boy again.

475
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,616
Why can't you just make an exception

476
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,620
and move his name to the top of the list,
see that he gets another foster parent?

477
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:45,166
The list is the list. Some clients have
been in group homes for years.

478
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,834
He was in group homes for years.

479
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,754
- Now he's gotta go back...
- Please don't raise your voice.

480
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,007
- If you're going to raise your voice...
- Please.

481
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,012
There's gotta be some way
that he doesn't have to go...

482
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,767
Yeah, there is.

483
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:05,978
There's gotta be.

484
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,191
How about...

485
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,988
How about if I take him. As a foster parent?

486
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,783
The screening process
takes three to four months.

487
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,451
This child can't be in your custody, Sergeant.

488
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,954
He needs to come back under
our supervision per the juvenile order.

489
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:32,087
Mm.

490
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,300
Think you all that
for hassling niggers and shit?

491
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,219
I know I'm all that.

492
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,262
I'm thinking about some pussy.

493
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,306
- Yeah. Me too.
- M-hm.

494
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,725
They dumped their tools.

495
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,898
Nothing under the seats.
Nothing in the glove box.

496
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,361
Registered to some
little old lady, no doubt.

497
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,530
These guys know the drill.

498
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,325
Can you see these two riding tame?

499
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,831
Come on.

500
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,898
Aw, shit.

501
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,612
There it is.

502
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,616
Whoa.

503
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:46,120
- Uh-huh?
- It ain't even our truck.

504
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,880
But I need to hear it from you.

505
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,299
From me?

506
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,718
This is not my affair, huh?

507
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,554
It is what Joe says.
I'm only here right now for Joe,

508
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,390
who I trust, who I respect,

509
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,393
who I worked with for many years.

510
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,354
You, I do not know, and I don't need to know.

511
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:17,276
But because this thing
goes wrong for Joe, then...

512
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,238
Well, how am I supposed to know
this ain't no setup?

513
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,783
How am I supposed to know
your people ain't in on it too?

514
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,746
You know because Joe says

515
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,166
and because I say.

516
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,169
And you trust your people like that?

517
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,546
I talked to my driver.

518
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,840
I looked into his soul.

519
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,285
Chris and Snoop just been popped

520
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,789
with a gun charge, found in the truck.

521
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,958
Call the bondsman.

522
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,920
But first, put a follow on him right there.

523
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,798
- Who, white dude with the hat on?
- Mm.

524
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,967
- What, he a problem?
- Nah.

525
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,513
I just need to know more.

526
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,058
- All right.
- All right.

527
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,981
- Satisfied?
- $90,000 to you in the morning.

528
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,482
We'll put a hunt on Omar later,

529
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,734
after the heat
on them empty houses give way.

530
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,913
The fuck are you doing here?

531
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:57,334
You think that charge gets dropped without
somebody showing you some special love?

532
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,425
You hungry? Come on.

533
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:20,024
All right. Might be a surety bond
on this Chris Partlow,

534
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,275
given all of his priors.

535
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,820
Pearson woman, not so much. All right?

536
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:43,797
- What's this?
- Court order. We get blood and hair.

537
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:49,344
14 head hairs, 14 body hairs,
two blood samples each.

538
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,723
It's a lot of houses, a lot of deeds.

539
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,100
Who knows what you left behind?

540
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,614
We still in the city?

541
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,785
Cylburn Arboretum.
Pimlico's right up the hill.

542
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,457
This is nice.

543
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,629
I ain't no snitch.

544
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,966
Didn't say you were.

545
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,803
I've been doing this a long time.

546
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,138
I ain't never said nothing to no cop.

547
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,817
I feel old.

548
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,278
I been out there since I was 13.

549
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,865
I ain't never fucked up a count,
never stole off a package,

550
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,202
never did some shit that I wasn't told to do.

551
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,539
I've been straight up. But what come back?

552
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:02,376
You think if I get jammed up on some shit,
they'd be like, "Yeah. Bodie been there.

553
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,463
"Bodie hang tough.
We got his pay lawyer. We got a bail."

554
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,715
They want me to stand with them, right?

555
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,260
But where the fuck they at
when they supposed to be standing by us?

556
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:15,514
When shit goes bad
and there's hell to pay, where they at?

557
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,309
This game is rigged, man.

558
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,480
We like the little bitches on a chessboard.

559
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,023
Pawns.

560
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,612
Yo, I'm not snitching on none of my boys.

561
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,866
Not my corner, and not no Barksdale people,

562
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,325
or what's left of them.

563
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:40,622
But Marlo, this nigger and his kind, man,
they gotta fall. They gotta.

564
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,210
Well, for that to happen,
somebody's gotta step up.

565
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,760
I'll do what I gotta. I don't give a fuck.

566
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,763
Just don't ask me to live
on my fucking knees, you know?

567
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,479
You're a soldier, Bodie.

568
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,317
Hell, yeah.

569
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,757
I remember you. You used to be a roll-up
on Pennsie and Fremont.

570
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,508
Yeah. It was my old post.

571
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:36,970
- I came up with CBS.
- Calhoun, Baker, Stricker.

572
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,974
Yeah. I used to have
to bang up on y'all all the time.

573
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,060
I remember that too.

574
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,898
Yeah. I ain't a cop now, right?

575
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,567
I mean, like I told Cutty,

576
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:54,613
I'm sort of like a teacher now,
and that's how I come to know Namond.

577
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,907
Only reason I'm even here
is Cutty spoke for you.

578
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,617
He say what I'm asking?

579
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:02,913
Your boy...

580
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,707
is smart and funny

581
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,126
and open-hearted,

582
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,337
and he got some flex in him.

583
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,840
And I ain't see it at first,
'cause he was always acting out,

584
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,552
always full up of corner talk,

585
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,639
you know, just talking shit to hide himself.

586
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,725
But he could go a lot of places
and do a lot of things in his life,

587
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,562
be out there in the world in a way
that didn't happen for you and me.

588
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,318
I mean, you know, our kind? Shit.

589
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,322
Man, we both know we gonna
go to our grave forever knowing

590
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,825
what block Bentalou dead-ends at,

591
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:43,120
or who got their liquor license
over at the Underground,

592
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,454
or what corner Tater man got shot on

593
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,707
when he come out the Musical Lounge
back in '88.

594
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,002
It's a vision in gold.

595
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,303
The West Side we knew...

596
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,723
it's dead, man.

597
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,183
You know, people in the game nowadays,

598
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,936
I mean, it's a whole different breed.

599
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:10,063
No code, no family,

600
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,900
and damn sure no respect.

601
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,071
You send Namond out on the corner now,

602
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:22,993
I'm giving him maybe one, two years
before he down at the morgue.

603
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,039
And maybe, if you're lucky, up here with you.

604
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,375
Maybe, maybe not. That's the game.

605
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,711
I'm talking about Namond here, Mr. Brice.

606
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,425
He's a lot of things, a lot of good things.

607
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,929
Before you know, he might surprise
all of us given half a chance,

608
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,474
but he ain't made for them corners, man.

609
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,143
I mean, not like we were.

610
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:52,522
That's why I come down here
because I gotta believe that you see it,

611
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:55,942
being who you are
and all you've been through.

612
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:00,947
You know your son.

613
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,331
It's in your hands, man.

614
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,295
You asking too much.

615
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,632
Yeah, but I'm asking.

616
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,971
- You sure it was the boy Bodie?
- I seen him come

617
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,766
from out the Central Booking
on Eager Street side.

618
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,726
Then he got in some car
with some white dude.

619
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,062
Police? What kind of car, a Caprice?

620
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,856
No, a hooptie, I think.

621
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:43,073
They on you like a motherfucker.
They jacking you up,

622
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,075
pulling all your work out them houses, right?

623
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,579
We can't have nobody snitching on us now.

624
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,832
We ain't sure it's that.

625
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,875
What, you wanna let it go?

626
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Risk it?

627
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,213
Send a message.

628
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,966
Maybe give it to your pup, get him started.

629
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,636
You and Snoop, y'all lay low
till this shit here blow down.

630
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:09,182
Boy worked for Bodie. First time,
best be someone he ain't know.

631
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:20,944
You hear what Joe said? Joe's saying
this cocksucker who stole our shit

632
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,572
wanna sell it back to us for 30 on the dollar.

633
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:30,328
Joe's saying it's another 90
to buy back our share.

634
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,373
Mm.

635
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,130
Dag, yo.

636
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,424
Thought you forgot about me.

637
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,012
Why don't you wait outside, all right?

638
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,393
You spoke to his father?

639
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,858
If it goes the way I think, he'll be back
with his mom by tomorrow.

640
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,069
Big day all round tomorrow.

641
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,655
Delegate Watkins got us 30 minutes
at the mayor's office.

642
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,577
Icicles! Get 'em while it's going!

643
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,205
Icicles! Come on!

644
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,748
Yo, Spider, what's the count?

645
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,542
I don't even think we gonna
sell out today, man.

646
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,132
Icicles! Icicles!

647
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,555
Yo, Bodie. Yo, Bodie.

648
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,854
Icicles! Icicles!

649
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:45,153
- Yo, Bodie, you better run, yo.
- Yo, this my corner.

650
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,279
I ain't running nowhere.

651
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,656
Bodie, is you crazy?

652
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:02,128
- Shit is on!
- Run with it, motherfuckers!

653
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,714
I don't give a fuck!

654
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,551
I'm right here!

655
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,387
You ain't putting me up in one of them
empty-ass houses, neither.

656
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,933
Bodie, come on, man.

657
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:45,565
Come on,
you skinny-assed bitch! Come on!

658
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,570
I don't know about this.

659
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,572
Mayor's office.

660
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:57,869
Yes. Actually, you want the Department
of Housing and Community Development.

661
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,288
Look, I don't know about this, man. I just...

662
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,670
Ma'am, uh...

663
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,632
Uh, if, uh...

664
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:12,967
Oh, sorry.

665
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,595
If the mayor prefers not to, um...

666
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:20,016
If he, like, feels more comfortable
with Dr. Parenti alone, you know,

667
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,852
because of the drug-legalisation
controversy last year...

668
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:26,940
I don't think Mayor Carcetti
is in your meeting. He's in Annapolis.

669
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,987
OK. Thank you.

670
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,248
- What up?
- What up?

671
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,626
Still asleep?

672
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,421
Early bird get that worm.

673
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,508
Hm. How you liking the crib?

674
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,136
Fine, thanks.

675
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,805
Must feel good to be on your own.

676
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,144
Yo, where you get that ring from?

677
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,773
Took it from a nigger.

678
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,072
Why? You want it?

679
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,574
Nah, nah, you keep it, shorty.

680
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,499
I'll go get Bug ready for school.

681
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,002
You ready to put in work?

682
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,048
Two things, then.

683
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,510
First, we're gonna give you
the corner up on Payson.

684
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:41,222
Used to be Bodie's old corner.
Now it's yours.

685
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,101
Crew that up. Run that shit.

686
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,520
You get the points on that shop.

687
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,150
Then we got this other thing.

688
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,238
Yo, if I ain't stepping on nothing,

689
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,365
who was that we dropped for you, yo?

690
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,373
- Bug's daddy.
- Word?

691
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:27,811
That's not how you spell "paraphernalia".

692
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,103
How the fuck do you spell it?

693
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,940
- Hey, fellas.
- Not like that. McNulty.

694
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,651
Hey. You're four to 12, right?

695
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,611
- You heard about Bodie?
- What about?

696
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,530
- Bodie, from up Payson.
- Yeah, yeah. What?

697
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,115
Shot dead on his corner.

698
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,077
Midnight shift caught it. Check the readout.

699
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,538
Sergeant, get your ass in here.

700
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,586
God damn it, Sergeant,
you're on the brink of insubordination.

701
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,559
You call DSS right now and ship him out.
That's an order.

702
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,477
Lieutenant...

703
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,359
I got $235, if it helps.

704
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,530
How would that help?

705
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,783
Maybe we can get a foster spot like that.
Pay somebody.

706
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,671
This is tracking, plain and simple.

707
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,048
No, it's a socialisation process.

708
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,801
But to any parent who complains,
you're still segregating them.

709
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:44,846
But it's for their benefit, and for the benefit

710
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,389
of the teachers trying to teach.

711
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,434
And you're proposing to expand this
to every middle school?

712
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:54,272
With enough grant money
and your support, yes. By September.

713
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,733
But you wouldn't be teaching
test curriculum?

714
00:53:56,817 --> 00:54:00,028
These would be the children
left behind, so to speak.

715
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:03,448
Yeah, but as it is,
we're leaving them all behind anyway.

716
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,783
We just won't admit it.

717
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:11,414
- What we mean to say is...
- Gentlemen...

718
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,167
we'll be in touch.

719
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,760
So, what, that's it?

720
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,012
After a two-minute hearing,
they stick a fork in us?

721
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:28,806
I'm a liability in there, man.

722
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,393
Seems like every time
I open my mouth in this town,

723
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,437
I'm telling people something
they don't wanna know.

724
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,689
- It's not you. It's the process.
- The process?

725
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,776
We're gonna get the grant. We study
the problem, we propose solutions.

726
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:44,113
If they listen, they listen. If they don't,
it still makes for great research.

727
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,282
What we publish on this
is gonna get a lot of attention.

728
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:49,535
- From who?
- From other researchers, academics.

729
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,456
Academics?
What, they gonna study your study?

730
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,547
When do this shit change?

731
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,426
And you put him out, huh?

732
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,470
He need to get hard.

733
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,056
Well, if he out, then he out.

734
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,186
Oh, no, you not. You ain't gonna take
my son away from me...

735
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,481
Remember who the fuck
you talking to right here.

736
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,817
Remember who I am.

737
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,403
My word is still my word.

738
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,697
In here, in Baltimore

739
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,908
and in any place
you can think of calling home,

740
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,452
it'll be my word, they'll find you.

741
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:37,083
Man come down here to say
my son can be anything he damn please.

742
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,835
Except a soldier.

743
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,340
Yeah, well, look at me up in here.

744
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:47,885
Who the fuck would want to be that
if they could be anything else, De'Londa?

745
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,930
Hm?

746
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,144
So...

747
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,272
did you cut me off too?

748
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,401
You still got me. We'll get by.

749
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:07,822
But you gonna let go of that boy.

750
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,824
Bet that.

751
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,209
- OK, now?
- It's Omar, baby.

752
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:53,743
For your bank?

753
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,580
That's for your pain, Butch.
I be my own bank now.

754
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,999
Mm. They ain't follow you?

755
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,168
Nah. Joe played it my way.

756
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,004
He had to admit my word was
better than his. You feel me?

757
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,674
Let's go, then.

758
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:24,649
Yeah, it's in the van, in the garage
in the back of 2249 Polk Street.

759
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,734
The key gonna be in the cinderblock.

760
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,712
You steal this much, and this ain't over.

761
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,009
This ain't over.

762
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,458
Thing about that Republican ass,

763
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:27,587
it's not the flesh of his political fathers.

764
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,319
Jesus.

765
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:56,657
- You left it on the table.
- Smug son of a bitch.

766
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,368
He was gonna make me beg,

767
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:04,707
then call a press conference
so the world could see me on my knees.

768
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,792
Don't worry.

769
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,670
Two years

770
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,130
and we'll make him pay.

771
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,136
Icicles, icicles! Got those icicles!

772
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,015
Time-out! Time-out!

773
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,934
Shakedown!

774
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,899
Corner's indicted. Go on. Get.

775
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,860
Except you, motherfucker. On the wall.

776
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,699
Sorry about Bodie.

777
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,745
I ain't jacking you up.
I'm trying to do right for your boy.

778
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,164
- Who dropped him?
- Y'all did.

779
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,376
They took him out 'cause
he was talking to y'all.

780
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,920
Word is they seen him with the police

781
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:55,967
down at Central Booking. So cuff me
or kick my ass off this corner

782
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,094
before you do me the same.

783
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,401
Hey, Duquan.

784
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:16,696
Don't you need to be at Douglass?

785
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:20,157
I'm on my way there, yeah.

786
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,035
- Where's your book bag?
- Oh, it's, um...

787
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,663
I'm-a stop past the house and get it.

788
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:34,005
It's a present for all you did.

789
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:40,511
- It's for your desk.
- That's great, Duquan.

790
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,722
Thanks.

791
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,393
Stop past any time,

792
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,730
let me know how it's going with you.

793
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:53,899
OK.

794
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:05,703
- But I ain't want to go back.
- Program's ending, Zenobia.

795
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,622
Yeah, boy. Back to genpop.

796
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:12,043
Yes. Pack my bags.

797
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:17,923
- What about you?
- I mean, this was all right...

798
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,054
but maybe it's time.

799
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,354
Why are you up?

800
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,231
You're working four to 12.

801
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,150
What's the matter?

802
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,278
It's the thing with these bodies.

803
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:42,990
Lester and them are getting up on it.

804
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,869
It's under Daniels.

805
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:52,375
He's got suction now. He can deliver.

806
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,210
You want in.

807
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,171
I just feel like I owe it now.

808
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,464
To who?

809
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,302
To this kid. Corner kid.

810
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,889
Getting ready to turn him, you know,

811
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,725
wrap him up and give him to Lester
as a present.

812
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,727
He one of the bodies in the houses?

813
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,479
No, they dropped him in the street.

814
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,735
Maybe I'd be different, you know?

815
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,820
Different?

816
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,073
Yeah, no more of the...

817
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,951
drinking and the whoring and all that.

818
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,327
All that anger.

819
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:35,084
'Cause I'm better now here with you.

820
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:44,260
No more playing "Jimmy Bust Balls"
with the world.

821
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:46,345
"Jimmy Bust Balls"?

822
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:51,225
I swear to God, Beadie,
that son of a bitch nearly killed me.

823
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,626
It's OK.

824
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,421
- What?
- You tried.

825
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,423
You don't need to feel bad.

826
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,636
Thanks.

827
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:44,028
Hey, yo, look at this!

828
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:45,738
Randy Wagstaff.

829
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,574
All right, Randy, this way.

830
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,599
Ain't no fuckin' thing, man.

831
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,322
Take that top bunk over there.

832
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,464
Five-0.

833
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,467
Are you sure?

834
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:36,390
I'm not asking 'cause I can't use you.
I'm asking for your sake.

835
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:41,103
I think I can do this
and keep myself away from myself,

836
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,187
if that makes any sense.

837
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,869
But I gotta tell you,
we're not gonna get Marlo Stanfield

838
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,162
or anyone else above the street,

839
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,914
- not on street rips.
- What do you suggest?

840
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,459
Either a wired CI or a Title III.

841
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:06,837
- That's what makes this case.
- You sure?

842
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,382
Maybe you do this fast and clean and simple.

843
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,928
Then you don't do it at all.

844
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,766
Chain of command, Colonel.

845
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:23,646
How in the hell do we kick up percentages
in math and reading both?

846
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,814
You believe the numbers?

847
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,901
38% proficient. 8% advanced.

848
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,488
- What?
- "Proficient" means they're at least

849
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,490
two grades below their level.

850
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:38,702
"Advanced" can mean
they're at grade level or a year below.

851
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:41,413
They score 'em like that, and...

852
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:44,833
they say we're making progress.

853
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:49,672
- OK. I'm still learning.
- Nah, you're gonna be fine.

854
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:53,717
Albert, Zenobia, Namond,
good to have you back with us.

855
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:57,012
Yeah. Your worst nightmare
come right back on you.

856
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,603
Say, no, I'm just playin'.

857
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:09,108
OK. Everyone open to 121.

858
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,157
Who figured out the first problem?

859
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:18,826
- Kareem?
- 164.

860
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,745
- Correct. How'd you get it?
- Don't know.

861
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,330
Come. Show us.

862
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,960
Oh, just when you think you're done...

863
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,714
What's that one? 20?

864
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,716
22.

865
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,886
- Anybody heard from Bunk?
- Ballistics say the guns match to nothing.

866
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,638
- Opened and closed.
- Mm.

867
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,598
And they cleaned the prints.

868
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:44,685
Well, maybe we find a witness.

869
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:49,356
Maybe trace lab gives us
a hair or splatter or something.

870
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:52,276
But short of that,
we're gonna have to go proactive.

871
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,486
Where are you on the new wire?

872
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:58,240
Back to square one.
We're in here for the long haul.

873
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,951
How you happen to pick
this place for us to stage?

874
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,870
- Lemel?
- Mm.

875
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,665
They closed it a few years back, and I knew
it was near a lot of our crime scenes.

876
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:11,336
I went to school here back in the day.

877
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,673
Got a decent education,
now that I think on it.

878
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,618
You try and talk to him?

879
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:47,456
Didn't know what to say. Only heard
from my sergeant this morning.

880
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,626
Guess I missed the 24 they wrote on it.

881
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:54,338
And he really tried to do himself?
It wasn't just for show or nothing?

882
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:58,967
Bubs' got some problems,
but insincerity ain't one of them.

883
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:03,013
Shame's some tricky shit, ain't it?
Makes you feel like you want to change,

884
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,974
and then beats you back down
when you think you can't.

885
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,310
When was the last time y'all talked?

886
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:13,357
More than a couple of years,
since he last got on the wagon, I think.

887
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:18,111
If he's up in D ward, he's cleaner than
a motherfucker right now.

888
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:49,935
Oh.

889
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,814
You coming?

890
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,692
Maybe later.

891
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:47,910
Can't believe he'd leave
that money on the table.

892
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:52,581
- Why not?
- School. Kids.

893
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:56,668
Shit. You ain't done enough
of this here, I suppose.

894
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,671
They always disappoint.

895
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:05,427
Closer you get, more you look.
All of them.

896
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,015
Who you going with next year?

897
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,311
If he tries for Elijah's seat,
I might stay with Royce.

898
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:17,689
If not, there's this
young buck out in Salisbury

899
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,858
thinks he can snatch up
the First District seat.

900
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:23,487
Hm.

901
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,950
Mistletoe. Come get 'em.

902
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:35,666
Mistletoe!

903
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,046
How y'all doing?

904
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,842
Ain't so much money. Mistletoe!

905
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,443
You can look at 'em in the eye now.

906
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:08,865
No matter who he is or what he's done,
you look 'em right in the eye.

907
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,093
I'm still your father.

908
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,150
Some people think they jive me

909
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,736
But I know they must be crazy

910
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,613
Can't see their misfortune

911
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,116
Maybe if they're lazy

912
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,578
Walk through all the fire
- The case against...

913
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:57,164
Fly through all the smoke

914
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:59,207
See my enemy

915
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,293
The end of the road

916
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,880
Walk on pines and needles

917
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,132
See what they can do

918
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,968
Walk on gilded splinters

919
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,554
With the king of the Zulu

920
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:15,682
Come, come, kiddy come, come

921
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,185
Walk on gilded splinters

922
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:20,979
Come, come, kiddy come, come

923
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,648
Walk on gilded splinters

924
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,584
Till I burn up
Till I burn up

925
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:45,170
Put gris gris on your doorstep

926
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,672
Soon you'll be in the gutter

927
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,592
I can melt you just like butter

928
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,011
A-a-a I can make you stutter

929
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:55,972
Walk through all the fire

930
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:58,600
Walk through all the smoke

931
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:00,852
See my enemy

932
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:03,396
End of the road

933
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,399
Walk on pines and needles...

934
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,902
- What you want?
- See what they can do

935
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:11,738
Walk on gilded splinters

936
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:14,032
With the king of the Zulu

937
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,494
Come on, come, kiddy come, come

938
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,663
Walk on gilded splinters

939
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:22,833
Come on, come, kiddy come, come

940
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:25,085
Walk on gilded splinters

941
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,384
Till I burn up

942
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,722
Till I burn...

943
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,403
Right to the body.

944
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:56,533
That's right. Keep it moving.
Where your eyes at? What you looking at?

945
01:14:56,617 --> 01:15:00,620
Come on, come, kiddy come, come

946
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:03,081
Walk on gilded splinters

947
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,959
Come on, come, kiddy come, come

948
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:08,503
Walk on gilded splinters

949
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:11,298
Come on, come, kiddy come, come

950
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:14,009
You cannot be out here.
Y'all need to find something constructive

951
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,553
to do with yourselves. Go on.

952
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:19,014
Walk on gilded splinters

953
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,734
Come on. Answer the question.

954
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:32,777
Michael.

955
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,698
Michael.

956
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,410
The gun.

957
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,530
Na', you're gonna be late.

958
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,576
Go on. Go.

959
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,006
Boy, where's your plate?

960
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:05,036
Yo, Tyrell, wait up.
