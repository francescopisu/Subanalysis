1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,844
So, Rashad has 82 apples...

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,931
and 12 friends...

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,184
all of whom are hungry.

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:23,147
And, uh, so he looks carefully at his apples
and sees that seven have worms.

5
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,067
Another 15 have gone rotten.

6
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:31,572
But he wants to be fair
and distribute all the good apples equally.

7
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,367
- "Distribute"?
- Give out.

8
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:38,621
- Well, just say that, yo?
- OK.

9
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:50,383
OK, so how many apples
does each of Rashad's friends get:

10
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,845
A - four, B - five.

11
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,764
C - six or D - seven?

12
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,308
Take your time but do it fast.

13
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,854
Nigger said, "I got my rights,"

14
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:07,066
so my boy said, "Oh, yeah?
Well, here's a left to go with your right."

15
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,736
He was like, pow!

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,071
- Calvin, you done already?
- Uh-huh.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,658
- Yeah?
- B - 5.

18
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,828
How did you work that out so fast?

19
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,706
Easy. "B - 5" got the dinks.

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,292
- The what?
- If you want, I could show you.

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,879
Don't show him, show me.

22
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,922
OK.

23
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,093
You did this with
the earlier math class, right?

24
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:37,013
So, you, like, got 82 apples...

25
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,390
12 niggers...

26
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,060
and then how many blah, blah, blah...

27
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,939
then you went, like, dinking all round
this one and no other one.

28
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,276
So the answer is "B - 5." Everybody get that?

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,863
- Yeah.
- "B - 5," it got all the dinks.

30
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,200
"B - 5," and I'm an Audi 5000.

31
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,217
When you walk through the garden

32
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,219
Watch your back

33
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,971
Well I beg your pardon

34
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,766
Walk the straight and narrow track

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,144
If you walk with Jesus

36
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,771
He'll save your soul

37
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,276
Gotta keep the devil down in the hole

38
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,987
He's got fire and the fury

39
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,949
At his command

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,326
Well, you don't got to worry

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,745
Hold on to Jesus' hand

42
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,706
We'll be safe from Satan

43
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,209
When the thunder rolls

44
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,754
But you gotta keep the devil

45
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,840
Down in the hole

46
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,555
Oh yeah, mm

47
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,103
We'll be safe from Satan

48
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,775
Gotta keep the devil

49
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,319
Down in the hole

50
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,782
Keep him in the hole
In the hole

51
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,493
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

52
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,996
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

53
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,874
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

54
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,376
Keep him in the hole
Keep him in the...

55
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,378
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

56
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:45,516
The priority should be keeping the
H files up to date with all notes transcribed,

57
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:49,103
the standard office report. Uh...

58
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,941
On our day shift today, you may encounter

59
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:58,154
Councilman and Democratic
mayoral nominee Thomas Carcetti,

60
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,574
who's been fact-finding
within the department.

61
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:06,537
So, if you go leaving your facts laying around
and he finds them, that shit's on you.

62
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:13,210
Uh, lastly, as most of you are already aware,

63
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,922
our CID Commander Raymond Foerster,

64
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,551
after a long bout with cancer,
passed away last night at Johns Hopkins.

65
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,432
Better, uh, eulogies are coming.

66
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,476
So, let me just say

67
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,354
that the man served 39 years

68
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,690
attaining the rank of colonel

69
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,027
without leaving a trail of bitterness
or betrayal.

70
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,240
In this department,
that's not a career, it's a miracle.

71
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,329
Uh, there'll be a detective's wake this evening

72
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:54,043
followed by viewings on Wednesday
and a burial Mass on Friday.

73
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:59,048
The family suggests donations
to the colonel's favorite charities.

74
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,259
Addresses will be posted in the coffee room.
All told.

75
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,056
And, Bunk, I just got
your overtime for the week.

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,934
Get in to my office and pull your pants down.

77
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:33,457
No, no, no! Fuck that.
You finish a pot, you make the next one.

78
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,128
OK.

79
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,427
I don't see the right one in here anywhere.

80
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,514
- Sergeant Hauk.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,933
I just got off with Beauford at IAD.

82
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,519
He says a harassment complaint's been filed.

83
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,606
A Jamaican woman says you had her
searched by Amtrak police?

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,361
Yeah. Well, you see, in my report,
we had what we thought was reliable info

85
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,781
that she was a drug courier
for Marlo Stanfield.

86
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,534
I mean, we actually scoped Stanfield with her.

87
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,494
What was the info?

88
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,331
The CI's been reliable.

89
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,376
Great track record with us. Long history.

90
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,005
CI 238. Give me his name.

91
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,340
His name? Sir.

92
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,928
Sir! Sir, I've never been comfortable
with, you know,

93
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,223
tossing around names
of informants in squad rooms.

94
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,392
- I feel that it's...
- Name.

95
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,145
Fuzzy Dunlop, sir.

96
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:42,151
- I might have to meet this character.
- He's kind of leery of meets.

97
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,363
He's been reliable, I promise you.
This one baffled the shit out of me, too.

98
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,158
But he's never been off, never.

99
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,495
You jumped out
on bad information, Sergeant.

100
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:57,958
You brought in another agency
and brought discredit to this unit - my unit.

101
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,127
In good faith though, sir.

102
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:05,841
If anything comes of this, I have your report,
and I will bury you with it.

103
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,976
And in case you haven't been paying attention
to the election results,

104
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,354
your rabbi has left the building.

105
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,404
- No tantrums today?
- What's the point?

106
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:31,575
- They're not gonna suspend us, right?
- Right. What's the point?

107
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,577
So, we're here, like it or not.

108
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,500
If it makes you feel better, you're here
because you beat the system.

109
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,377
You had no interest in class,

110
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,130
and you made it
impossible for everybody else,

111
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,465
and now you're out. You won.

112
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,552
- Yeah!
- You feel like winners?

113
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,804
- Always.
- That's how we did.

114
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,764
Who's we?

115
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,433
- Us.
- No, who are you?

116
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,519
- Players.
- Kingpins?

117
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,064
Nah, that comes later.
Right now, we just corner boys.

118
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:06,610
- So how long until you're kingpins?
- I'm thinking two, three years.

119
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,696
Two, three years.

120
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,866
Let me ask,
and I want everybody to write this down,

121
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,702
where do you see yourself in ten years?

122
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,207
Come on, pencil and paper.
This isn't schoolwork, this is about y'all.

123
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:26,046
- She's young but she's good.
- Yeah. Doctoral candidate,

124
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:32,595
psych department of College Park. Thesis
work is on social alienation and analysis.

125
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,224
- All right, how many wrote "NBA"?
- Yeah, but only for the Lakers.

126
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:42,354
I want to be a pediatric neurosurgeon
like that one nigger, what's his name?

127
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,773
- Ben Carson.
- Yeah, that dude.

128
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,694
- A black surgeon at Hopkins.
- You need to go to medical school.

129
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,779
Whatever.

130
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:55,409
- How many wrote "dead"?
- Shit, you saw that coming, huh?

131
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,662
Shame y'all have so little time and you're
wasting it here.

132
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,372
You know where you're going.

133
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,834
- We can't teach you anything about that?
- That's what we've been saying.

134
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,379
- Namond, put away the magazine.
- I ain't reading no magazine.

135
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,175
- Namond.
- What? It ain't even mine.

136
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,970
- It was laying here when I came in.
- Y'all little pissers.

137
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,434
You know, we're giving them a fine education.

138
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,481
"It ain't even mine.
It was just laying here when I came in."

139
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,859
You know this right here,
the whole damn school,

140
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,613
the way they carry themselves,
it's training for the street.

141
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,242
The building's the system, we the cops.

142
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,244
Yeah, you are for sure.

143
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,997
I mean, y'all come here every day
and practice getting over,

144
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,583
try running all different kinda games.

145
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,669
It's practice for the corner, right?

146
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,421
Ain't no real cops. Ain't no real danger.

147
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,007
But y'all are getting something out of this.

148
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,636
- Bet you didn't even know that.
- I'd still rather be out there.

149
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:02,226
Can I, uh...? Corner boys, huh?
Let me ask y'all something.

150
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,729
You help us home in on this,
and maybe we do a little better job.

151
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,190
- What makes a good corner boy?
- Eyes open.

152
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,776
- Keep the count straight.
- Don't trust nobody.

153
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,405
Uh-huh. If you don't got no respect,
you ain't got nothing.

154
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,994
If you stupid, you get killed.
That's the only way.

155
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,374
This name in black right here got stink on it.

156
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,377
- Eyeball witness, Bunk.
- Go back to the scene with me,

157
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,298
- take a fresh look.
- You're out of line, here, Bunk. You are.

158
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:37,219
- A lot of names. Too many.
- No, we're good with it.

159
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,656
Listen, you back-seat-driving motherfucker,
the guy picked him out -

160
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,659
Omar-fucking-Little. Why?
Who the fuck cares?

161
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,661
We got a dead female taxpayer,

162
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,247
- and somebody's saying him.
- I don't buy it.

163
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:09,710
And this ain't the motherfucker
that came up with 62 ways for the peanut.

164
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,838
His name pops up on five
or six cases I know of,

165
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,467
including two of yours,
and you want him back on the street?

166
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,970
But this ain't him.
So someone else is walking on you all.

167
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:25,017
Bunk, the next body you catch,
I'm going to be crawling all over it,

168
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,394
second-guessing your ass every step,

169
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,356
pulling on every last motherfucking thread.

170
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,941
Yeah. We gonna see how you like it.

171
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,325
Hey, Vern. Hey, Vern, Vern, Vern, Vern.

172
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,660
- Just go back on it with me.
- What?

173
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:49,625
Shit doesn't play out any differently, I'll give
you a back rub you'll never forget.

174
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,480
You guys don't need to do anything
you wouldn't normally do just cos I'm here.

175
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,694
I wouldn't know what we
normally do around here.

176
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,575
I'm new and inexperienced.

177
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,661
Oh, you're, uh...

178
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,289
Yeah. I am.

179
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:33,043
I'm just trying to get a feel
for your response to the violence.

180
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,629
I'm not the hall monitor or anything.

181
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:08,620
- So, this is your day?
- We catch a body, it's different.

182
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,689
- You got my camera?
- I what?

183
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,568
- Licence and registration.
- You do me one, I'll do you.

184
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,571
You got a card or something?

185
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,705
City, huh?

186
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,166
Video camera gotta come back.

187
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,836
Yeah, well, I see what I can find out about it.

188
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:01,423
But you know cameras -
kind of like pigeons in a storm.

189
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,008
Know what I'm saying?

190
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,553
Sometimes they come back. Sometimes...

191
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,932
But I keep an ear out on it.

192
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,856
Pigeons? Did he just say pigeons?

193
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:23,028
He's fucking with you. Tell Marimow you used
the camera for the PC at the train station.

194
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,863
Then admit the camera got took.

195
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:28,992
I already put it down to the CI.
I tell dickhead the truth,

196
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,954
- he takes my stripes on it.
- Come on.

197
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,873
I'm just saying
you weren't suspended that long.

198
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,917
Is it because Tiff dropped it,

199
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,628
or you had to do something
for Miss Donnelly?

200
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,090
- Do something?
- I don't know. Like, promise or something.

201
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,511
No, Tiff dropped it. Ain't nothing past that.

202
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:52,140
That's good. You know,
the thing with the teachers and cops,

203
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,519
they always come at you
like they got you by the ass.

204
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,606
But keep your mouth shut,
ain't nothing they could do.

205
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,067
So, more times than not, they go away.

206
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,902
Word on that.

207
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:09,491
It don't even matter. Miss Anna...
she got me on this short leash now.

208
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,161
Can't go out the house unless
she know right where I'm going.

209
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,831
Shit, at least you've got a leash.

210
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,476
We turned and shook

211
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,604
As we had a look

212
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,774
In the room where the dead men lay

213
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,777
So big Jim Dwyer made his last...

214
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,157
What the fuck is that?

215
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,951
Club soda...and lime.

216
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,829
You mincing bitch.

217
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,916
Why not just suck a dick and get it over with?

218
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,005
- That'll get the bad taste out of your mouth.
- Ah.

219
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:54,888
- Yeah.
- I'm a freeborn man of the USA

220
00:16:54,972 --> 00:17:01,937
I'm a freeborn man of the USA
I'm a freeborn man of the USA

221
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,831
Almost new.

222
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,334
- Don't want no dead man's hat.
- I'm just fuckin' with you.

223
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,712
Here, let's pray.

224
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,715
Here we lay a couple of New York boys

225
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,343
who came too far south
for their own fuckin' good.

226
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:37,139
Fucking Yankee proud of it now,
you fuckin' bitches.

227
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,144
Let's get the fuck out of here.

228
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,236
You hungry?

229
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,155
You want some Chinese?

230
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:58,285
- She didn't...
- No talking.

231
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,165
Keep your eyes on your paper.

232
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,131
Yo, Mr. Prezbo, this say "cars."

233
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,509
- So?
- The stuff we practised was about food.

234
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,762
It's OK. It's just a different object.

235
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,513
Pay attention to the number.

236
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,266
Numbers are messed up, too.
We never did one-thirds.

237
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,978
It's the same operation.
One-fourth, one-fifth, one-third.

238
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,689
It's the same steps, different denominator.

239
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,276
- How do you get one-third of a car?
- It's one-third of all the cars.

240
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,987
Was I talking to you?

241
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:43,830
You get close enough...
you could take a headshot.

242
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,832
Why?

243
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,002
Cos maybe he vested up.

244
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,214
Word. A chest shot maybe won't do it for you.

245
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,551
Then what? You.

246
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,930
- It's his turn.
- Thug, you on it.

247
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,308
You shoot from a distance,
you can't risk a headshot.

248
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,978
You go for the belly, the dick or the ass area.

249
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,773
Because the vest don't go down that far.

250
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,068
Bam. Take 'em out.

251
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,154
- Then what?
- Walk up,

252
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,490
- finish 'em off.
- With a...?

253
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,408
Headshot.

254
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,038
Damn, y'all coming along full effect.
I hear it. I hear that.

255
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,043
All right, now say he in a car.

256
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,964
Sergeant Thomas Hauk, Baltimore City Police.

257
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,508
Didn't I say City would come running?

258
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,678
- Did.
- I'll check this joker out for you.

259
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,930
See what's what.

260
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,350
One other thing, you're doing OK

261
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,687
running them New York niggers
of the East Side, I know that.

262
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,690
But this thing you got
with disappearing the bodies...

263
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,068
My man is saying if you just
vanishing the bodies like that,

264
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,530
it do kind of defeats its own purpose.

265
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,826
Niggers don't know if they
went back to the Bronx or whatever.

266
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,913
- You feel me?
- Course. I'll tell my people.

267
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,250
No disrespect to your
professionalism or nothing.

268
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,045
We all impressed how you lose
the motherfuckers like that.

269
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:19,509
We just trying to send a message
to these New York people in full effect.

270
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:23,179
- You know what I'm saying?
- I'll get back to you on this.

271
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,406
So, Councilman, I understand
you were at CID yesterday.

272
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,991
See anything big downtown?

273
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,951
They messed up the lunch order.

274
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,787
No, I figured I needed
to get closer to the street.

275
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:52,292
Rolling with the mighty.
Remember, we had a shooting last week

276
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,503
so keep those corner fucks to one window.

277
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,715
Shit, if only we had a van full of you guys.

278
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,551
Dressed like that,
Stevie Wonder make you as police.

279
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,930
Radios out of sight.
Volume up on those boom boxes.

280
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,933
- Ten bucks say we collar up first.
- 20.

281
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:12,854
Mr. Mayor, in the Eastern we are hungry
motherfuckers - respectfully, I mean.

282
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,651
So, you're saying, you don't ever
give anybody a break?

283
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,818
Anybody?

284
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,404
Nah, nah. Cos if you let him slide for a dollar,

285
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,906
it's a sign that you're weak.

286
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,908
Today's dollar is tomorrow's two.

287
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,912
Same with your crew. Your boy
come up short saying spillage or police,

288
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,749
you let him be, and then he gettin' over
on you, then you a chump.

289
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:37,087
So, you got to fuck him up!
You gotta...mess him up.

290
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,715
Nah. Nah. Something for real happen,
you do that.

291
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,344
Do it over some bullshit,
all you did was lose a good worker.

292
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,639
- I don't know...
- You gotta fuck that nigger up, man.

293
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,188
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

294
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,149
Whoa.

295
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:02,487
Stop talking on top of each other.
This how you communicate out on the street?

296
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,157
All right, it's like this -
your boy come back to you,

297
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,244
- say this happened...
- Then you fuck him up.

298
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,330
I'm gonna let him
make it out of his own cut, too.

299
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,749
If he a good worker, he know what to do.

300
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,420
- Yeah, he got a point.
- He got a point. That's a good one.

301
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:24,259
If he thinks about it, says it ain't his fault,
then that nigger runnin' game on you.

302
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,344
And then you fuck that nigger up.

303
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,347
- Yeah.
- All right, yeah.

304
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,142
- But why?
- You know it gotta happen, man.

305
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,687
- You know what I'm saying!
- Wait, wait, wait! One voice.

306
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,648
- One voice, y'all. One voice.
- D, you tell him.

307
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,525
There always people watching.

308
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,944
- Watching... you.
- True. Yeah.

309
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,532
What's taking you so long?
There he is now.

310
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:53,538
- Hurry up, this guy. This guy right here.
- Fuck you, guys.

311
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,832
Yo, man, we need some pills.

312
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,417
You in the right place.

313
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,336
- Get them for us.
- Man, I'm going to work.

314
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,381
Yo, 20 for the pills and ten for you.

315
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,717
- Leave the bike.
- What, you want steal my bike?

316
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,304
What the fuck I want your bike for?
I got a car.

317
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,264
Give me a minute.

318
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:19,564
$20 might mean nothing to you
but I ain't making that much money.

319
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,108
It's hard money.

320
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,195
Y'all some lazy motherfuckers.
It's round the corner.

321
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,238
We appreciate this.

322
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,783
I love it when they come
to work pumped like this.

323
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,246
Shit!

324
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,626
Come on, man. I'm going to work.
I'm going to work, man!

325
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,629
It's bullshit!
This is some bullshit right here.

326
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,340
For real! For real!
I ain't got no drugs, no shit on me.

327
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,468
I ain't got nothing on me, man.
You taking my bike, too?

328
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,762
I need that. This is bullshit!

329
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:55,141
- One down.
- ..comin' here, fuckin' with us.

330
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,227
This is fucked up right here, man.

331
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,024
Andre, how you doing?

332
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,279
- This is a friend of mine, Detective Moreland.
- Hey.

333
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,533
You doing OK there or what?

334
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:17,455
Listen, for my friend, tell me one more time
how the thing went down.

335
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,041
- The boy came in.
- Omar?

336
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,168
- Omar.
- Omar.

337
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:25,755
He puts the nine on her.
Says to me, "Whatever you got."

338
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,465
Mm-hm.

339
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,302
A nine, huh? Where were you?

340
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,556
- Where you see me at.
- Mm-hm.

341
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,352
Nine wouldn't go through this.

342
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,813
- Why did you come out?
- Cos he said to.

343
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,316
- Trying to save her life.
- Right, I'm saying...

344
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,694
This is like Bank of England glass.

345
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,780
Fort Knox glass.

346
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,325
And who put that up there? Huh?

347
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,954
Guy must have had an elephant gun
or some shit.

348
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,708
I don't know. The boy had a mask on.

349
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,670
A mask, huh?

350
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,755
Like Zorro, huh?

351
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,552
- When did that happen?
- A few weeks back.

352
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,308
- Put in a report?
- It got away from me.

353
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,310
Mm-hm.

354
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,855
Andre,

355
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,734
we're going to need you
to come down to the office

356
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,278
and straighten out a couple of things.

357
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,116
I'm running a business here.
I ain't going nowhere.

358
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:45,084
Give me a bottle of Mylanta. Please.

359
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,800
His whole story is fucked, and here's why.

360
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,886
First, it don't make any sense.

361
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,140
The shooter took out the woman
and left him breathing to talk to you.

362
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:03,519
He should be dead, too.
Second, that's a drug depot in there.

363
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,441
The glass, reinforced steel,

364
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,152
camera, low inventory.

365
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,201
And, third, he's shining us on
about that big-ass .50-cal hole

366
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,329
because I know who put it there
and he knows.

367
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:25,750
And if he were to say,
"Oh, that? That's Omar's previous.

368
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,837
"Ripping off a re-up in here,"
which is what happened, he be fucked.

369
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,092
So what? A guy comes in the first time

370
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,428
with a .50 caliber because
he knows the glass is thick,

371
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,056
then comes back
the next week with a nine?

372
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:45,603
The job isn't about picking
the stories we like best.

373
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:49,649
Motherfucker. Now you're going
to lecture me about what the job is?

374
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,569
- My apologies.
- OK. Let's go downtown.

375
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,582
It's a new law, yo.
Three pills, that's felony weight.

376
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,960
And you're on a pre-indicted corner.

377
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,546
- What?
- You better show some stash,

378
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,464
or it's off to Cheltenham.

379
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,967
Those DC boys down there, too, right.

380
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,845
- They love fresh Baltimore ass.
- Mm. Mm-mm.

381
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,513
I ain't know no stash.

382
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,724
- They say it's better than pussy.
- Hah!

383
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,685
- Those my pills.
- Yeah?

384
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,314
Have you ever heard of federal guidelines?

385
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,859
Pre-indicted corners, homeboy.
Three years mandatory.

386
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,194
Unless you mitigate.

387
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,948
- Mit-a-what?
- The stash, front boy.

388
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:42,869
I don't know no stash. Those my pills, man.

389
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,371
- I'm high right now, look.
- Yeah.

390
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:46,873
Yeah?

391
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,584
They gonna love him up in there. Come on.

392
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,129
- I saw him first. Bitch is mine.
- Those are my pills, I swear.

393
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,214
That's two.

394
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,925
Get the fuck in the car.

395
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,596
- Damn, fractions?
- He's doing fractions.

396
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,849
Shit, you know what we talked about
in my new class?

397
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,309
- What?
- Slinging.

398
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,187
Yo, I'm not playing.
We talked about business,

399
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,605
about putting shit on the damn street.

400
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,524
- Nigger, please.
- It was like we schooling them.

401
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:17,779
- Yo, my new class is the shit.
- You going by the gym today?

402
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:22,492
No, man. I gotta go vial up
what's left on this package so I can re-up.

403
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,285
- All right.
- All right, man.

404
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,537
- Peace, man.
- That shit crazy, though, right?

405
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:41,719
- I gotta leave soon, Duquan.
- OK.

406
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,763
- What level are you on?
- 12.

407
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,640
Ah.

408
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,310
- I never made it past ten.
- Wanna see me get to 40?

409
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,314
That's cheating.

410
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,317
Want me to show you how?

411
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:07,412
- Baltimore City Police Department.
- Uh, yes, ma'am, this is Sydney Handjerker

412
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,623
with Handjerker, Cohen & Bromburg.

413
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:15,420
I'm trying to locate a Sergeant Thomas Hauk
in regards to a client I'm representing.

414
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,505
Hold, please.

415
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:22,969
- Mayor's office, Lieutenant Hoskins.
- Yes, hello. This is Ervin Pepper

416
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,430
of Pepper, Pepper & Bayleaf.

417
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:29,600
I'm calling in regards to
a Sergeant Thomas Hauk in regards to...

418
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,728
He's no longer on this detail.
Hold on for a minute.

419
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,317
Major Crimes. May I help you?

420
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:42,613
Uh, this is Dr. Jay calling
with test results for Thomas Hauk.

421
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,658
He's on the street.
You want to leave a message?

422
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,743
Hello?

423
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,422
- Let's do it.
- Just walk up on him, all right?

424
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:04,385
Snap one. Make sure he's from New York
first, right? Gotta ask.

425
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,512
Ask what? "You from New York?"

426
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:10,391
No, ask a Baltimore question,
something a New York nigger won't know.

427
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,643
- What's a Baltimore question?
- I don't know,

428
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,812
maybe something about club music.

429
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,899
They don't know nothing
about that shit up in New York.

430
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,527
- Huh?
- Ask him, like, who Young Leek be.

431
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,822
We're shakin' it, jiggin' it...

432
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,326
Or K-Swift.

433
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,663
Man, I don't know nothing
about that 92Q shit, man.

434
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,624
Man, who gives a fuck, yo?

435
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:38,920
You don't know Marc Clarke?
"The Big Phat Morning Show"?

436
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:44,634
You ain't right, girl. The average
Baltimore nigger know all that shit, a'ight?

437
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:48,804
They don't listen to that shit in New York.
They listen to some bullshit.

438
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,681
- Go ahead.
- Whatever.

439
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,851
- Got a bet going on, man.
- What's up?

440
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,521
Who's your favorite on
"The Big Phat Morning Show"?

441
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,481
Your New York girl, Sonjay.

442
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,359
- Who?
- Kill that show any day.

443
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,361
Snoop, yo. Snoop, yo. Yo.

444
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,072
Chill! Sonjay be on the show, too.

445
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,791
Maybe I ask the questions
from now on, all right?

446
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,922
They entrap some poor bastard on a bet,
haul in $20 of drugs.

447
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,883
They've got to process him,
feed him, property voucher his bike.

448
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,762
Next they're working on some 14-year-old
like he's Bin Laden.

449
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,056
The big haul is three vials of cocaine.

450
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,934
I mean, are you with this?

451
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,562
I've been fighting this bullshit for years.

452
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,815
You pick the targets
that'll make a dent out there,

453
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,567
reduce the violence.

454
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,527
So what's the problem?

455
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,446
- Problem is I do what I'm told.
- Meaning?

456
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,743
Mr. Mayor, I'm no more a racist than you are.

457
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:57,456
The thing about affirmative action -
I'm just talking policy here, no offense...

458
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,959
- None taken.
- It's a numbers game.

459
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,087
And numbers games
breed more numbers games.

460
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:07,466
You need a 20% hike in black officers
to match the city demographic.

461
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,760
But that's got to be reflected up the chain,

462
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,389
which means fast-tracking
some people past where their...

463
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,476
How do I say this? Their experience warrants.

464
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:21,564
And he who owes his good fortune
to the numbers, abides in them.

465
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,734
Gotta show arrests are up 15, 20%?

466
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,069
We'll worry about the quality later.

467
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,572
So what you saw out there, it's a con game,

468
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:34,869
a Band-Aid on cancer, so no, I'm not with this,
but I do follow orders.

469
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,623
However, if those orders were to change

470
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,876
or if I had the opportunity
to change them myself...

471
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,433
Oh, no, you not!

472
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,435
What's this shit doing in my house?

473
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,981
- I'm stretching bottles, Ma.
- Your daddy bring his work home?

474
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,776
That's what you got a lieutenant for.

475
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,780
Police come through this door
they have this whole house.

476
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,824
This has got to be packed up
and elsewhere right now.

477
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,202
All right, be cool.

478
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:19,455
Wait till Bey hear about this.

479
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,254
Did you hear that appeal to racial solidarity?

480
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,632
I'd like to kick his pale entitled ass.

481
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,386
Were you listening?
He's no more a racist than I am.

482
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,013
Might have to kick your ass, too.

483
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,228
What have you heard about this fella Daniels?

484
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:47,525
- Major in the Western.
- Yeah, he's there, but not much politically.

485
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,611
I don't think he's got any suction
with anybody.

486
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,454
Where's the Rice-A-Roni?

487
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,540
Ma, where's the Rice-A-Roni?

488
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,876
A boy on the stoop
looked like he was starving.

489
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,714
- So you cooked it for him?
- No, I just gave it to him.

490
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:14,635
You just gave it to him.
Boy ate a raw box of Rice-A-Roni?

491
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,059
How much did you sell the groceries for?

492
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,145
Don't look at me like that.

493
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,481
I gotta go out.

494
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,579
- Ten?
- You have your Rice-A-Roni profits.

495
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,789
Michael, come on!

496
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,754
You ain't gonna hold the DSS card
if you ain't gonna do right by me.

497
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,590
You're gonna let me hold that card.

498
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,177
You a hard child.

499
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,815
Next time, don't go selling
the food out of our mouths!

500
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,740
Yeah, like y'all say - don't lie, don't bunk,

501
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,367
don't cheat, don't steal or whatever.

502
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,203
But what about y'all, huh?

503
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:27,792
What, the government? With the Enron?
Steroids, yeah.

504
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,836
Liquor business?
Booze is the real killer out there.

505
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,172
And cigarettes? Oh, shit.

506
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,469
- You got some smokes in there?
- I'm trying to quit.

507
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,349
And drugs paid your salary, right?

508
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,811
- Not exactly but I get your point.
- We do the same as y'all,

509
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,980
except when we do it, it's like,
"These kids is animals."

510
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,233
Like it's the end of the world coming.

511
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,485
Man, that's bullshit, all right?

512
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,656
Cos it's like, what is it?
Hypocrite...hypocritical?

513
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,035
We got our thing
but it's just part of the big thing.

514
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,247
- Exactly.
- But this corner-boy thing, right?

515
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,791
All y'all did all this talking up in here.

516
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,585
Could you write down the laws to your thing?

517
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,088
- Hell, yeah. I'll do it right now.
- Shit.

518
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,592
No, can y'all do it together?

519
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:26,934
I give the test on fractions,
half the kids have breakdowns.

520
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,521
I have a lot of kids who can
barely handle whole numbers.

521
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,526
Well, if it's any comfort,
I have, outside of my advanced class,

522
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,529
maybe half a dozen reading at grade level.

523
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,531
Try the periodic table of elements.

524
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,868
Thing is, it's your curriculum
and you have to stick to it.

525
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,412
- I can't. It's absurd.
- You have to.

526
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:50,708
That test is the difference between
the state taking over the school or not.

527
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,460
- Maybe the state should.
- Mr. Withers...

528
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,046
You don't teach math, you teach the test.

529
00:36:56,131 --> 00:37:00,092
This is about the leave-no-child-behind
stuff getting spoon-fed.

530
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:04,513
- And what do they learn?
- Find some middle ground.

531
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:07,308
Every day try to do a little for the statewide

532
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,227
and keep a problem on
the blackboard for Donnelly.

533
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,439
If she comes to visit,
she thinks you're on point.

534
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:17,443
The rest of the time,
do what you feel like you need to do.

535
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,821
But be careful.
You're still on your evaluation.

536
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,784
The first year isn't about the kids,
it's about you surviving.

537
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,758
Get up. Get up.

538
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,843
Hands on your head.

539
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,598
- I was eating that.
- Fuck you.

540
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,059
- That's my lunch.
- Fuck you.

541
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,020
Find a wall, motherfuckers. Man...

542
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,732
Pick your feet up.

543
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,609
- This is harassment.
- What did I say?

544
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,945
"Fuck you."

545
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,323
- That's what you said to me.
- There's nothing here, man.

546
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:08,243
- Oops. My bad.
- You want to play games with me?

547
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:12,122
I'm going to be in your shit every day
until my camera comes home.

548
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,292
You hear me? Every day.

549
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,295
You and yours. Let's go.

550
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,299
Ah. That felt good.

551
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,969
The old Western DEU rides again.

552
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,556
Yes, sir.

553
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,852
Anyone from the CID
report to the front desk.

554
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:41,986
Respectfully, sir, I would feel better if you
clear this through the chain of command.

555
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,531
Yes, sir.

556
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,243
I'll think about that.

557
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,500
- Problem with the bosses?
- One in particular.

558
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,546
- That was our mayor-to-be.
- Carcetti?

559
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,883
- Seriously?
- He wants to meet.

560
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,303
You and him? Alone?

561
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:12,725
He wants to talk about the police department.
What works, what doesn't.

562
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,686
You have the mayor's ear now.

563
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,647
- Look at you.
- Here's the thing. What do I say?

564
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:22,192
- What do you mean?
- How honest should I be?

565
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:25,696
It's one thing to talk tactical shit
or enforcement strategies,

566
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,282
but the shit that actually goes on?

567
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,534
If I start on that, I don't know if I can stop.

568
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,578
Cedric, this is your chance.

569
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,414
This is a career.

570
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:40,210
What if I take my shots at Burrell and Rawls
and he decides not to clean house?

571
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:44,381
The new mayor calls you up,
asks you for your take on things

572
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:49,386
- and you don't want to be, what, impolitic?
- Carcetti, I don't even know the man.

573
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:54,516
If he's calling you, it's because guys
like Burrell and Rawls are on the ropes.

574
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,313
- Maybe.
- I know there's a risk but...

575
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,485
baby, I'd fire away...

576
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,322
both barrels.

577
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,703
All white out here, man. Up top.

578
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,836
All white. All white.
You got that grub, you got that pot.

579
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,172
All white.

580
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,134
Shakin' and jiggin' it, yo.
Who made that track?

581
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,261
Yo, who you talking to, dawg?

582
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,139
I'm asking who Young Leek be.

583
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,517
- You mean Too Fat's cousin? Who?
- Nah.

584
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,728
- Then how the fuck should I know?
- Who the fuck is you...

585
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,481
Aw, shit. Nigger got smoked.

586
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,610
Fuck that nigger.

587
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,282
What up, B?

588
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,576
- Where Ma at?
- Upstairs.

589
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,583
Michael, my daddy came home.

590
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:06,213
- Daddy came home?
- Look who home.

591
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,590
Michael.

592
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,352
Damn, you grew.

593
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,826
And a pack of Kools for Macia.

594
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,372
Still tricking for that clown?

595
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:44,835
Why do people talk trash about him?
All I know is he loves me.

596
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:50,257
When you get tired of him going upside
your head, you'll really know who loves you.

597
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,259
Whatever.

598
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,596
Whoa.

599
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,604
Motherfucker, what?

600
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:14,656
- He had 12 years.
- Parole.

601
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:19,745
- It was only a drug charge.
- You swore he wasn't coming back.

602
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,914
This is a good thing, Michael.

603
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,541
It's going to be back the way it was.

604
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,543
The way it was?

605
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,545
We a family again.

606
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,508
You lied to me.

607
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,723
People change, Michael.

608
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,229
He said you can give him
the independence card too.

609
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,564
He gonna take care of all that for us.

610
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,327
Thanks for coming up from Washington.

611
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,414
We're happy for the opportunity.
You've got some heat behind you.

612
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,209
- But down to business.
- The way we see it,

613
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,711
we need a citywide turnaround.

614
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,588
Call it the "Baltimore Miracle" or some shit.

615
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,633
Starting with a 10% drop in crime.

616
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,552
That was your campaign cry,
you want the double digits.

617
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,055
No doubt.
Then he's gotta do a bricks and mortar,

618
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,057
put his name on something downtown.

619
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,143
We're flush with stadiums,
got hotels out of the ass.

620
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,271
You got a good convention center?

621
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,356
And an expansion.

622
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,611
Gotta get something on it that says
"Brought to you by Tommy Carcetti."

623
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,781
Think on it, but you don't have
too much time to decide.

624
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,784
- Anything else?
- Education always polls good.

625
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,329
Uh, no, not the schools.
Our last four administrations

626
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:47,874
left us with an inner-city system
with inner-city problems.

627
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,670
We get involved, start talking shit,
it becomes our mess.

628
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,298
Gotta respect the depths.

629
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,342
One, you get the drop in crime,

630
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,511
two, build something downtown

631
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,596
and three, stay away from schools.

632
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,765
And, four, keep your boyish good looks.

633
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,727
Do all that,
you might run for governor in 2008,

634
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,688
maybe take back that statehouse for us, hm?

635
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,483
- Can you get the square corners?
- Easy.

636
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,695
- I don't like these backgrounds.
- You don't?

637
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,739
They don't fit so good...

638
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,796
Shi...it. Next time, dude.

639
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,639
You OK?

640
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,685
- Yeah.
- You sure?

641
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,814
- Something at home?
- No.

642
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,777
- Come on.
- I said no.

643
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,529
OK.

644
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,950
If there's ever anything
you want to talk about...

645
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:08,372
there's me, but if you'd rather,
I can write you a pass

646
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,999
to see the social worker.

647
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:12,626
Just say when.

648
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,009
Michael, do you wanna see the social worker?

649
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,972
No.

650
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:43,657
I've never seen kids like them
this animated in a classroom.

651
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,034
Focused. The corner culture kids, at least.

652
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,703
The ones with deeper problems,
they opted out.

653
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,873
- Deeper problems?
- It's not just corner logic.

654
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:56,753
I see oppositional defiant disorders,
clinical depression, post-traumatic stress,

655
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:59,589
and, with Chandra,
borderline psychosis maybe.

656
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:03,427
With those problems,
we need a social worker here full-time.

657
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,096
But the corner kids, yeah,
they really came alive.

658
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,433
When they talk about what they know,
they stay on point.

659
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,518
Shit, they were even taking turns.

660
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,230
Can we get them in that kind of mindset
with stuff they don't know?

661
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,065
Have them learn on faith alone?

662
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,735
In all honesty, this is uncharted territory.

663
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,824
Where do you go from here?

664
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,494
How about we just let this ride,
see where it takes us?

665
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:33,832
All right, here's the thing -
once you got it, it's all you.

666
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,626
Anything happen,
I'm-a have to fuck you up.

667
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:40,130
Yeah, but that's nothing.
The guy trusting me on this, Marlo,

668
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,549
he'll kill you and your whole family.

669
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,011
So don't shake the bottles
cos Marlo weighs that shit.

670
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,513
- I ain't shaking shit.
- See that you don't,

671
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,765
cos if you fuck with them, I'm gonna know.

672
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,073
All right, that's good.

673
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:23,965
All right, it's good. All right,
you under 13 and shit.

674
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,635
So you safe from everybody
but me and Marlo.

675
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,180
- So I'm a lieutenant now?
- Yeah. You my lieutenant.

676
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,807
And alls I get is an extra $10?

677
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,227
You do this good and we'll talk.

678
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:45,195
See this guy here? That's the grand jury
prosecutor. Now, you lie to us,

679
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,488
it's just good clean fun.

680
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,866
But you tell tales
to that three-piece motherfucker, oh, shit!

681
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:51,868
I ain't telling lies.

682
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:54,204
Gary, let me ask you hypothetically,

683
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,874
how much time does a witness
get for lying to your grand jury?

684
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,877
- You kidding? As much as I can get him.
- What's the max?

685
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:04,464
- Ten years.
- Oh, people go away for ten years?

686
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,883
Oh, hell, yeah, all the time.

687
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,719
Ten years! I thought
he was gonna say two or three.

688
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,348
That motherfucker went upside my head.
I couldn't see straight.

689
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:17,352
- Which motherfucker?
- Then they got me on that medication.

690
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:21,898
It made me groggy as shit. Then this man
starts working at me. Was it him?

691
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,401
- Fuck I did!
- I mean, shit...

692
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:28,530
I'm still groggy now. I mean, I got to, uh...

693
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,782
Is there a washroom around?

694
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,958
Lying motherfucker.

695
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:43,295
For real?

696
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,845
Pull over, asshole.

697
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,514
Shit.

698
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,607
Step out of the car, please.

699
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,694
Step out of the car. Put your hands on the car.

700
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,366
Got anything on you?
Have a seat on the curb.

701
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,038
Cross your feet. Hands on your head.

702
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:31,718
- What the fuck is this powder?
- Lime for my mama's garden.

703
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,436
What, are you building a clubhouse?

704
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,731
- That shoot nails. Be cool.
- I know what it does.

705
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,947
I want my fucking camera.

706
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:02,499
I heard what you said
at Comstat the other day.

707
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:05,460
I also hear you're a commander
who knows police work.

708
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:10,465
- Nice of people to say.
- I did a ride-along in Eastern,

709
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,386
watched some street pops, undercover rips.

710
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,972
- So what am I thinking?
- My guess...

711
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:22,102
you witnessed a waste of time, money, energy
and, in a few cases, talent.

712
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:28,358
Rawls says it's Burrell's numbers game. Says
if I unleash him, all that bullshit goes south.

713
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:33,113
A return of high-end police work
and it'll be the dawning of a new day.

714
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,865
- Rawls said that?
- Yeah.

715
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:40,286
Says he's just following orders,
being a good soldier.

716
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,414
What do you say?

717
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:48,294
Mr. Mayor, if you want to talk about
what happens in the street or in the Western,

718
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:52,590
I'll talk your ear off. But I'm a soldier too.

719
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,884
I don't go up the chain with my opinions.

720
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,720
I can respect that.

721
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:01,057
I will say this though -
we did have one unit doing high-end stuff,

722
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:04,686
Major Crimes working out
of an offsite on Clinton Street.

723
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,981
"Did" is past tense. What wrecked it?

724
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:12,736
Good question, Mr. Mayor.

725
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,948
With Ray Foerster's passing, I need
a new CID commander right away.

726
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,410
Would you object to being
a colonel working under Rawls?

727
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,834
- Under Rawls?
- He is deputy ops, is he not?

728
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:33,673
Will the mayor make the changes
or leave it to the good soldier?

729
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:39,095
What I'm really asking is -
how for real are you?

730
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:44,434
Well, I guess we're going to
find that out together, aren't we...

731
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,186
Colonel Daniels?

732
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,735
What the fuck do we do?

733
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:58,531
- I don't know.
- These guys don't scare.

734
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,453
If we all kick in, you, me, Sydnor,

735
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,580
maybe we could afford a used camera?

736
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:10,835
I thought of that. It ain't gonna match
the serial numbers from the one from ISD.

737
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,968
We've gotta get wood on Marlo.
It's the only way.

738
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:23,389
This Randy kid,
he can't give us a murder, right?

739
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,975
Shit, he can't even give us a body.

740
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,977
But he says some Little Kevin kid

741
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:32,148
was the one supposed
to tell Lex to go up in that alley.

742
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,943
Plus, what did fucknut say Little Kev said?

743
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,239
"Lex went up the alley
but he ain't coming back."

744
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:44,202
Maybe he saw the whole thing.
Maybe he's our eyeball witness.

745
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,746
- Little Kevin.
- Little Kevin.

746
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,845
80, 100, 10, 20. 420.

747
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,930
Where's the rest?

748
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:08,726
Um, I'm on a hard strip.
It's tricky on Lafayette.

749
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,896
- What the fuck are you doing there?
- I gotta build it up.

750
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:15,775
No, no, you ain't got to build up shit.
Your father built them corners

751
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,611
and they owe you cos they owe him.

752
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,866
Bodie got a real short memory
when it comes to giving props. Hm.

753
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,826
Ma...

754
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,915
I'm going to straighten this shit out right now.

755
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,500
Ma, let me build.

756
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:35,420
Ma.

757
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,174
Sir.

758
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,926
Bill...

759
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,223
We need to regroup.

760
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:51,477
Come up with something fresh
for the new administration.

761
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,607
Hm?

762
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,567
I don't mind telling you,

763
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:01,613
I'm uncomfortable with the way
Carcetti is running around in our shop...

764
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:05,158
He's talked to me, several times.

765
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,496
Huh.

766
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,291
You're making your move, huh?

767
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,844
We were a good team, you and me.

768
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,681
We were.

769
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,712
- Miss Ella, where Bug at?
- He went home, Michael.

770
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,547
Nah, he waits for me.

771
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,634
The man who picked him up
said he was his father.

772
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,928
And Bug said so, too.

773
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,846
Fuck!

774
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,933
Mm.

775
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,913
What the fuck did you do?

776
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,250
- And why'd you let him do it?
- Listen...

777
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:42,839
No. That's how you got him with his head up
his ass, unsolving his own fucking murders.

778
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,551
Your job is to turn red to black,
not the other way.

779
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,930
And you, stand the fuck up for yourself.

780
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:05,486
You don't gotta do the whole thing
on your fingers, little man. Look, first column.

781
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,573
- Six and six is...
- 12.

782
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,451
Put down the two, you bring over the one.

783
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,494
- Bug.
- Hey, big man.

784
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:15,580
- Get over to me now.
- We were going...

785
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,582
Now.

786
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,989
Yo, hold on.

787
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:21,395
Yo, you owe me 800 on that, bitch. You owe.
