00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,400
Sure, lindsay. you can go see the who.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,400
And you can go see the rolling
stones at altamont, too.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,900
Come on, dad. Don't make
a big deal out of it.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It would be so much fun.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm sure it'd be fun. what's not fun

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,500
About sitting around in a
cloud of marijuana smoke,

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,500
Watching some maniac wag his bloody tongue?

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,500
That's not the who, dad. that's kiss.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,700
The who smash their guitars.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,700
That's terrible.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,200
They don't do that anymore.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,600
Mom, the who wrote a rock opera.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,100
I'm sure it's terrific.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,100
Honey, i don't see what the big deal is.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,600
She's been to concer before.

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,100
We took her to see rich little last summer.

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
May an overfed yak

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,700
Relieve himself on your buick.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,600
Ha ha ha! ha ha!

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,600
That's good. That sounds just like him.

22
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,900
Mom, rich little isn't a concert.

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,400
Oh, yeah? Well, you tell that

24
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,900
To the 2,000 people

25
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,400
That were laughing their butts off.

26
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
They're not too loud, are they?

27
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
No.

28
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,900
Says tha the guinness book of world records

29
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,900
T they're the loudest band on earth.

30
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,400
Sam.

31
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,800
Hey, if i'm not allowed

32
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,800
To seekentucky fried movieever,

33
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,600
Then you shouldn't be
allowed to see the who.

34
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,100
Dad...how am i supposed to become an adult

35
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,600
If you never treat me like one?

36
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Fine. i'll tell you what.

37
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
I'm gonna listen to one of these records,

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,500
And if there's nothing objectionable on it,

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,500
I'll let you go.

40
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,900
Thanks, dad. i'm sure it's fine.

41
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,200
Don't get ahead of yourself.

42
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,200
I'll be listening to it backwards, too.

60
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,300
Tball, not a tea party!

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
Come on, move it!

62
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,300
Move it, you guys! come on!

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Man, this is some sloppy play.

64
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm free

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,600
I'm free...

66
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,100
Gimme the ball!

67
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,600
Give me the ball!

68
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,500
And freedom tastes of reality

69
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,500
Haverchuck!

70
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,300
I'm free

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,700
I'm free...

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,100
Bill, put it in!

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh, no!

74
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
This is not good.

75
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,600
...For you to follow me

76
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Nice shot, haverchuck.

77
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,800
Told you not to pass it to him.

78
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,200
I'm telling you guys, seriously.

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
No disrespect to zeppelin,

80
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,700
But i saw the who

81
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,700
2 weeks ago atit indianapolis.

82
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Blew my mind. it was crazy.

83
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Man, i can't wait till they hit detroit.

84
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,700
Oh, i hope my ears start bleeding.

85
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
Hey, i got an idea.

86
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,700
My cousin floyd, he's got that school bus

87
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,200
He got at the city auction?

88
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,200
We could all go in that
- on our own...magic bus.

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,700
Yeah, a magic schoolbus.

90
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,600
Shut up.

91
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,100
I hope ldsay gets to go.

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,100
I want to write her a song on my guitar...

93
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,100
Tell her how i feel.

94
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
You can't even play the guitar, thank god.

95
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,100
That's where you're wrong.

96
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,100
I'm like pete townshend, man.

97
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,100
Self-taught. i'm a master. Wanna see?

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,100
Ready, man. rip one off.

99
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,100
This is a little song i wrote for you guys.

100
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,600
Michael, row the boat ashore

101
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Hallelujah

102
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Michael, row the boat...

103
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey, hey...coco...

104
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,500
This isn't the cafeteria fromfame.

105
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,000
Uncle, uncle.

106
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,500
Who the hell's coco?

107
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,500
She was that hot chick who
took her shirt off in the movie.

108
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,000
Ohh, yeah! that was sweet, man.

109
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Every year is the same

110
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
And i feel it again

111
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm a loser

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,500
O chance to win

113
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Leaves start fallin'

114
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Comedown is callin'

115
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Loneliness starts sinkin' in

116
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,900
But i'm one

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I am one

118
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,800
And i can see that this is me

119
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,800
And i will be

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,800
You'll all see i'm the one

121
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm one

122
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I am one

123
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,400
And i can see that this is me

124
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,600
And i will be

125
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,200
You'll all see i'm the one

126
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:48,700
I'm the one

127
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,900
Eh-heh, heh...

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,900
Hey, little man.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
Hey, mom. how was work?

130
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,400
Oh...dead.

131
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,400
I made 18 bucks in tips today.

132
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,400
How is anybody supposed
to live on that, huh?

133
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,900
Oh, no, you're not gonna
start dancing again, are you?

134
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,400
No.

135
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,900
Good.

136
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,900
Besides, they don't want

137
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
An old broad like me anymore.

138
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,800
Mom. it's true.

139
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,800
So...guess what?

140
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,800
We're gonna have a guest
over for dinner tonight.

141
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,300
Dad? no, no.

142
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,800
This is a... a new friend.

143
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Another new friend?

144
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,300
It's... someone you know.

145
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,300
Neal's dad?

146
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,900
Dick schweiber? no! Gross!

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,900
God, you gotta be kidding me.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,400
No. This is somebody
that i met at your school.

149
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Do you remember when i had to come in

150
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,900
For that parent-teacher conference

151
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,400
'Cause you were having a hard time at gym?

152
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Yeah.

153
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,900
Well, i've been...

154
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,900
I've been seeing mr. Fredricks.

155
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,400
My gym teacher?!

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,900
Physical education teacher.

157
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,400
No, you can't!

158
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
Honey, he's a really nice guy.

159
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
No, he's not!

160
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,900
He's a jerk. he's a dumb jock.

161
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,800
No, he's not. You just
don't know him very well.

162
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,300
I know him better than you do, believe me.

163
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,300
I doubt that.

164
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,300
We've been seeing each
other for a little while now.

165
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,800
What? Why didn't you tell me?

166
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,300
Because i didn't want you to get upset.

167
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,800
I was just waiting to see
if it was serious or not.

168
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,300
It's serious?

169
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
I think so.

170
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,700
You gotta-
you gotta-

171
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,700
You gotta...dump him.

172
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,200
Who's that?

173
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,000
How much do tickets cost?

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
40 apiece, but the who never tour.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I heard this is gonna
be their last tour ever.

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,500
I hear fleetwood mac is amazing in concert.

177
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,000
I heard stevie nicks is a witch.

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What do you mean?

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know. she does witch stuff.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
She casts spells on people.

181
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,000
I heard she cast a love
spell on lindsay buckingham.

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I like all her shawls.

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,500
Maybe i should be a witch.

184
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Cut off a lock of daniel's hair

185
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
And stick it to a voodoo doll.

186
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
That way, whenever he gets out of line,

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,400
I'll just jab him with a pin,

188
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,400
And he'll shut up.

189
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,400
I don't think so. voodoo's pretty serious.

190
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,900
Well, i'm pretty serious.

191
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,900
It's about time i had
some supernatural powers.

192
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,400
What the hell was that?

193
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,900
I think you hit something.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,900
No. It's my shocks or
something are out of whack.

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,400
I don't know. Daniel was working on my car.

196
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,900
I don't know. I think it
could've been a squirrel.

197
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,400
We should turn around.

198
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Lindsay, we don't have time.

199
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,400
The world will survive
with one less squirrel.

200
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,000
...One of my favorite
customers. He's a regular.

201
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,500
Honey, the soup was cold.

202
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,500
I mean, i'd be mad, too.

203
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
No, that is not my fault.

204
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,000
I do not cook it. i serve it.

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hey, bill
- greatest movie of all time?

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,900
Uh-uh...rocky ii.

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,900
It is.rocky ii.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,900
Much better than the first one.

209
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,400
That carl weathers... he's ripped.

210
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,400
He's got the abs, buddy-
thlllt-the six-pack.

211
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,900
Doing something.

212
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,900
Well, sweetie, you just
saw a movie recently.

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,900
What was it?

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,400
A movie called... stripes.

215
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,300
I saw that.

216
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
Did you like it?

217
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,300
Come on. Bill murray's a wiseass.

218
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Somebody oughta smack
some respect into that guy.

219
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,300
Bill murray's the
funniest man on the planet.

220
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,200
I, um...guess if you're a comedian,

221
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
You're supposed to be a wiseass, huh?

222
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,700
Gloria, you should've seen
bill in gym class today.

223
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,200
Buddy, i'm telling you, you apply yourself,

224
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,300
You'll be playing for the school
tyou got the height for it.

225
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,800
Sweetie, maybe ben could give you

226
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,800
Some private lessons or something.

227
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,800
Who's ben?

228
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,800
Eh-heh...he is.

229
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Benfredricks.

230
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Excuse me. I have to use the restroom.

231
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,200
We don't have a restroom.

232
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,200
We have a toilet.

233
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,800
Just calm down. They're
stolen hall passes...

234
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,300
It's fine. ha ha ha!

235
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Hey, millie, what's wrong?

236
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Goliath's dead.

237
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,700
Oh, god, millie.

238
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,700
Who's goliath?

239
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Goliath's her dog.

240
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,300
What happened?

241
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Some maniac ran over him
last night with their car.

242
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
God, millie...

243
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,000
Someone hit him with a car? That's horrible.

244
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,900
I'm so sorry.

245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,900
He must've gotten out.

246
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,900
My dad found him on the street

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,900
Right between our houses.

248
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
The worst part is...

249
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,500
They didn't even stop.

250
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Who would do that?

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, i gotta go to class.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,500
I have a test. see ya.

253
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,500
Yeah, see ya, millie.

254
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh, my god.

255
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,000
Lindsay... we killed millie's dog.

256
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,200
Hey, guys...

257
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,700
I killed millie's dog.

258
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,100
Like, with your bare hands?

259
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,100
No. I ran it over.

260
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,100
Oh.

261
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,600
You're pretty sick.

262
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,500
I didn't do it on purpose, doofus.

263
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah, it was an accident.

264
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,000
I always say...

265
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,900
Girl plus car equals dead animal.

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,900
How true.

267
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,400
We have to tell millie.

268
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Why?

269
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,900
It's not gonna bring her dog back, lindsay.

270
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,400
It'll just upset her more.

271
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,800
It's not like you killed a human being.

272
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,300
It's just a dog.

273
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,300
It's even worse, ken. i love dogs.

274
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,300
Why? Dogs suck.

275
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,100
They're stupid, and they
smell, and they're ugly.

276
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,000
They don't even like us people.

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,500
They pretend to, but they're
just kissing our asses

278
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
So we'll feed 'em.

279
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,700
I ain't buying into that hoodwink.

280
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, man.

281
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,700
Lindsay...look.

282
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,300
Oh, god. poor millie.

283
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,300
She's just...

284
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Sitting there... by herself.

285
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,300
I am telling you, mashis not funny.

286
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,300
I heard radar o'reilly
has, like, no fingers.

287
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,300
That's why he always carries a clipboard.

288
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,800
Hey, hey, billy! you know what?

289
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm still stuffed from your mom's pot roast.

290
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,000
I couldn't even eat breakfast this morning,

291
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,000
But i'll tell you, it wasgoo-ood!

292
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,500
I'll see you in gym class, big guy.

293
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,000
Whoa... wait a minute.

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,500
What the hell was that?

295
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,000
What-i-wh-what?

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,300
He ate your mom's pot roast?

297
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,500
I...really don't wanna talk about it.

298
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,100
Come on, bill. You have to talk about it.

299
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,600
You can't tell anyone, ok?

300
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
What? Tell us.

301
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,600
My mom is...kinda dating mr. Fredricks.

302
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Don't say a word.

303
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
I didn't say anything.

304
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,000
Good. Don't.

305
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Hey.

306
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,800
How's it going?

307
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,300
Ok.

308
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
You?

309
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,200
I don't know.

310
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,700
Perlick's gonna kill me.

311
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,200
I didn't do any of the assignment.

312
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Me, either.

313
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
You kidding me?

314
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,200
I was up all night crying.

315
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,200
You know...

316
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,200
I know how you feel.

317
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,700
I had a dog that died once, too.

318
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
What was his name?

319
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Bobo.

320
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,900
He was so smart.

321
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,400
He used to sit with me
and watch tv all day long.

322
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,900
He loved tv.

323
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,900
Goliath used to attack the
tv if there was a cat on it.

324
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,900
Ha ha ha!

325
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
So, what happened?

326
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,800
Well...he was epileptic...

327
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,800
So, all of a sudden, he would
start to froth at the mouth,

328
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,800
And then his little
legs would get all tense,

329
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,800
And he would start shaking
and then... Poop himself.

330
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,800
And get his paws in the poop
and get poop all over the place.

331
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,300
Aw...poor puppy.

332
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,800
My parents couldn't take it.

333
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
They didn't even tell me

334
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,300
That they were going to put him to sleep.

335
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,300
One day, i got home, and...he was gone.

336
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,300
I'm putting goliath to rest
under his favorite tree.

337
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,200
Do you wanna come?

338
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:59,200
Yeah.

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
Well...here comes bill's future dad.

340
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Oh, come on, neal. We promised
bill that we wouldn't say anything.

341
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
We can make jokes to each other,

342
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Just not to bill.

343
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,500
Besides, i can kinda see why
mr. Fredricks is dating her.

344
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,100
She is kinda hot.

345
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Fred Weirdo.

346
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,200
All right everybody.

347
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,800
Ave some potential basketball
superstars in this class,

348
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,300
So today, we're gonna work
on fundamentals, all right?

349
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,500
Who knows? maybe one of you

350
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,500
Might even make the school team next year.

351
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,200
But, uh, let's warm up, all right?

352
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,700
10 laps around the gym. Come on.

353
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,200
Mr. Fredricks?

354
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,200
Yes, bill?

355
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,700
I can't run.

356
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Why?

357
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,100
I have better things to do.

358
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,600
Excuse me?

359
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,100
I have better things to
do than run around a gym

360
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,100
And shoot a stupid ball in a hoop.

361
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,900
Oh, really, bill?

362
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,400
What better things do you have to do?

363
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,900
Anything.

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
Pick my nose and eat it...

365
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,100
Or read the comics or go to the bathroom.

366
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,600
Uh, all those are better than gym class.

367
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,600
Heh! He is so dead.

368
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,100
Kill him, mr. Fredricks.

369
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Shut up, alan.

370
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,000
For once in your life, shut
your big, stinkin' trap, ok?

371
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,500
He was the one
- i'm talking to you.

372
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,300
Shut your mouth.

373
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,400
I've had it th the constant
comments and the incessant cackling.

374
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
You got me?

375
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,900
Ok.

376
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,600
Bill, you're gonna run the laps...

377
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
And you're gonna do the
drills. You know why?

378
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,100
'Cause this is my gym.

379
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,100
I'm the teacher. you're the student.

380
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,200
Ok? Sit down-

381
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,700
You can't tell me what to do.

382
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,700
You keep walking, you're in
big trouble, mr. Haverchuck!

383
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,200
What are you gonna do, call my mom?

384
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,700
Hey, bill!

385
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Leave me alone.

386
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,200
I never thought I'd say this,

387
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,700
But Haverchuck's the King! Heh heh heh.

388
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,600
You were always there for me,
my entire life,

389
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,000
But i know you're with jesus now,

390
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,000
And you're happy in heaven
with all the other dogs,

391
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,600
And you can run and play,

392
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
And you never have to be on a leash again...

393
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,400
'Cause there are no leashes in heaven.

394
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,400
You're my favorite puppy.
i love you, goliath.

395
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Lindsay, you wanna say something?

396
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,900
Huh?

397
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,400
Do you wanna say something to goliath?

398
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,900
Um...no. That's ok.

399
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,400
Lindsay...

400
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,400
Say something to goliath.

401
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
Um...

402
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,400
Goliath...

403
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,400
You were a sweet dog, and...

404
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,900
You had really nice fur...

405
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,800
And...there's no leashes in heaven...

406
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,500
I already said that.

407
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,500
Oh. Um...i remember when my mom
used to come over in her furry boots

408
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,500
And you would hump her foot...

409
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,000
Ha!

410
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And we thought that was funny...

411
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,400
And then you got spayed,
and you didn't do it anymore.

412
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,800
And we're not sad now because...

413
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,800
You lived a very long... long, happy life.

414
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
That's right.

415
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,600
A long and happy life.

416
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Only love can make it rain

417
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,400
The way the beach is kissed by the sea

418
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Only love can make it rain

419
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Like the sweat of lovers
laying in the fields

420
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Love

421
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Reign o'er me

422
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,600
Love

423
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,200
Reign o'er me

424
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,200
Reign o'er me...

425
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,100
...Sells t-shirts and, like, concert stuff.

426
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
Hey, linds, your old man

427
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,600
Make up his mind yet about the concert?

428
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,800
Huh? Nah, but count me in.

429
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,300
He's just making me sweat it.

430
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,300
After school, kim and i are
going to the record store.

431
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,200
You wanna come?

432
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,200
Uh...

433
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,200
What?

434
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm gonna buy some who albums

435
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,500
So i can sing along to the concert.

436
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,900
You're going to the who concert?

437
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,800
Millie, what about your parents?

438
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,300
Ever since my dog died, they've
been letting me do anything.

439
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Well, i'm gonna go home
and study for my trig test.

440
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,700
Right, millie? Don't you
think you should study?

441
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Oh, yeah. that's right.

442
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
I forgot about that.

443
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,100
Well, you know... blow it off.

444
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,600
You're in mourning. You can't
be expected to do homework.

445
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,100
Good point.

446
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,100
I guess i'm gonna blow it off.

447
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Oh, my god. i am so bad.

448
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,200
All right, i'll meet you
out front right after school,

449
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,700
And we'll go to the mall.

450
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,700
And you're gonna wear your big coat, right?

451
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,700
The one with the pockets?

452
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,600
Ok. See you, linds.

453
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,400
She loves my big coat.

454
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,900
She's been talking about it all day.

455
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,900
Millie, please don't wear your big coat.

456
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,100
You know, lindsay, when you
started hanging out with them,

457
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I felt kinda bad for you

458
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Because i thought you were
gonna turn into a dirtbag.

459
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,500
But then i realized that
you were just exploring,

460
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,500
And now i guess i'm kind of exploring, too.

461
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,200
It's kinda catchy.

462
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Yeah. I like the banjo.

463
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,700
Mama's got a squeeze box
she wears on her chest

464
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,200
And when daddy comes home, he never
gets no rest what'd he say? Squeeze box?

465
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,700
'Cause she's playing
all night is it just me,

466
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,200
Or does that sound filthy? Honey.

467
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,700
And the music's all right i
think it's about an accordion.

468
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Mama's got a squeeze box,
daddy never sleeps at night

469
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,200
What?

470
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
It's nice.

471
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
She goes in and out and in and out

472
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,100
And in and out and in and out "in and out"?

473
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,600
The instrument.

474
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,600
She's playing all night jean,
that is not about an accordion.

475
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,100
And the music's all right...
that is...in and out!

476
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,100
Yeah-in and out.

477
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,100
In and out?! In andoff is what it's going!

478
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:20,100
...Daddy never sleeps at night

479
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Hey, kim.

480
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Oh, hey.

481
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,400
Hey, will you do me a favor?

482
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,900
Will you give this to ken?

483
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,400
You're copying ken'shomework?

484
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,900
Attempting to.

485
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,900
He writes like a mental patient.

486
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,900
I was thinking,

487
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,900
We should tell millie the truth.

488
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,400
We can't do that.

489
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,900
We have to.

490
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,400
Why?

491
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,900
Because she's gonna wind
up getting into trouble.

492
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,800
Why? 'Cause she's hanging out with us?

493
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,300
What's the difference?

494
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,300
You're only hanging out with
her 'cause you feel guilty.

495
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,300
No, i'm not.

496
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,300
She's kinda funny.

497
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Yeah, but you don't know millie.

498
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,900
She's really smart,

499
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,400
And she really loves church,

500
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
And she loves her family a lot-

501
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,900
And what, we're scum?

502
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,400
No. That's not what i'm saying.

503
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,300
Well, what are you saying, lindsay?

504
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,800
I just don't think we should
interfere with her life.

505
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,800
What are you so worried
about anyway, you know?

506
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,300
That millie's gonna
start hanging out with us

507
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
And then you're not gonna
have anyone to run to

508
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,300
When you get scared of your bad friends?

509
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
And yo kim.

510
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,800
U know what, if you do tell her,

511
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,800
I'll kick your ass.

512
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,900
I don't know what else i could do.

513
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,900
I mean, if he hates me, he hates me.

514
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,400
He's just having a really
hard time with this.

515
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,900
Well, so am i.

516
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,600
Honey, you just need to
spend more time with him.

517
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
You need to get to know each
other a little bit better.

518
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,100
Look, he doesn't want to know me.

519
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,600
He doesn't care.

520
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,600
Oh, come on.

521
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,600
Don't be such a baby.

522
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,100
Come here.

523
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,100
What?

524
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,600
You should take him someplace special.

525
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,100
You know, show him that you like him.

526
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
What, like the movies?

527
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,600
I'm not seeing thatstripescrap again.

528
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
He's been bugging me to take him

529
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,100
To this go-cart city place,

530
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,600
But i keep saying no.

531
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,100
Maybe you could take him there.

532
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,600
Really? I love go-cart city.

533
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
You do?

534
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
I do.

535
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,100
Yeah, i'll take him there.

536
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,500
Really?

537
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah.

538
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,500
He's a he's fat.

539
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,500
Gym teacher, and he's
not even in good shape.

540
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,500
And he never runs,

541
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,500
You never see him play the games with us.

542
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,500
You shoukd tell your mom to dump him

543
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,500
Even if he wasn't the
biggest jerk in the world,

544
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,500
He has a terrible job.

545
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,100
He's a gym teacher.

546
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,600
There's no upward mobility.

547
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,600
It's not like you can become...

548
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,600
C.e.o. of a school.

549
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,800
Yeah. My mom really likes him, you know?

550
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,800
And he acts different around
her than he does around us.

551
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,300
He's all sweet and phony.

552
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
It's sick.

553
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,600
Maybe-maybe he's not such a bad guy.

554
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,300
Excuse me?

555
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,800
He let you be captain in gym class.

556
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,300
You're right.

557
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,900
I'll just start calling him "daddy" now.

558
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,400

559
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,200

560
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,500

562
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Hi, fredricks.

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,600
Uh, listen, bill, i was just wondering,

564
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,600
Yo maybe tomorrow,

565
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,400
U might want to go to go-cart city with me.

566
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Um...

567
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,000
We'd love to go.

568
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,900
"We"? Uh...

569
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,400
Ok. all right.

We can all go. you wanna go, sam?

571
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,400
Sure.

572
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,100
All right. Ok, bill?

573
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,100
I guess.

574
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Yeah, i guess so.

575
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,600
All right.

576
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,100
The 4 men

577
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,600
Are gonna have some fun.

578
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,000
Thanks a lot, neal.

579
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,100
What?

580
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,600
No one else is gonna take us there.

581
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
It's all the way out in the boonies.

582
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
So, you know i didn't wanna go with him.

583
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,700
We'll just ditch him and
ride go-carts all day.

584
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,100
No way. Absolutely not.

585
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,600
Lindsay, that song is pornographic.

586
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,600
Dad, come on. don't be a prude.

587
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,000
If i was such a prude, you wouldn't exist.

588
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Fine. Then i'm gonna be the
only kid in the whole school

589
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,500
Who can't go to a rock concert.

590
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
All right, all right.

591
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Maybe we could chaperone you.

592
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,600
You know, sit behind you, be real quiet.

593
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,800
It could be fun.

594
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,300
I don't wanna do that.

595
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,800
Dad, look, i understand your concerns.

596
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,200
I have them myself, but i...

597
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,700
I wouldn't be fighting you.

598
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,700
It's just that millie is going.

599
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,400
Millie is?

600
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Yeah. Her parents said she could go,

601
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,700
And i just sort of wanted to go

602
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,100
To keep an eye on her.

603
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,400
Oh, honey, you really are such a good rl,

604
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,900
Aren't you?

605
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,800
Yeah. I can handle myself.

606
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,300
Honey, millie is going.

607
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
All right, fine. Go.

608
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,300
You just keep those boys
away from your accordion.

609
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,500
So, forget bill russell.

610
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,600
Great. Give him the trophies, whatever.

611
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Yeah, he won the championships.

612
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,500
I tell you,

613
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,000
They changed the game for one man-

614
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,500
Wilt chamberlain, wilt the stilt.

615
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,000
Who's your favorite basketball player?

616
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
Come on. favorite player.

617
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,900
Neal.

618
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,900
I don't know. I don't watch basketball.

619
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,700
No? Sam.

620
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,200
Um...

621
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,200
Havlicek?

622
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Dr. J?

623
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,700
From the a.b.a.?

624
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,700
Got you guys something.

625
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Here you go, bill.

626
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,200
Cool. all right.

627
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,700
Thanks. Just what i always wanted.

628
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Doody.

629
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Isn't it crazy?

630
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
I got it from the joke shop.

631
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,700
I heard you guys were into comedy,

632
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,200
So i picked you up a couple of things.

633
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,700
Here you go, neal.

634
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
All right! Vomit.

635
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,700
It kinda looks like pizza.

636
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,200
I don't have this one.

637
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Oh!

638
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Hey. Hey, neal, i got you a present.

639
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,600
Isn't that great?

640
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,600
Hey bill, you want a dollar ?

641
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,500
Do you want a dollar?

642
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,500
No, thanks.

643
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,600
I said, lady l, let your soul be free

644
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,600
You closed your eyes, and you wouldn't see

645
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,600
The only one who could ease your pain was me

646
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,500
As i ride on my horse
through the countryside

647
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,700
I said, lady l, let me give you a ride

648
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,200
But as i pulled the reins of that horse

649
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,200
She pulled the reins of her soul

650
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,700
I'm outta control, lady l

651
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:51,300
Lady l

652
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,800
You couldn't see through my cloud of smoke

653
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,800
You held my heart

654
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,300
Now it's bloody and broke

655
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
And is your green army jacket

656
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,800
The only thing keepin' you warm tonight?

657
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,600
Lady l

658
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,000
She's my lady l

659
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,000
Lady l

660
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
La-la-la-la
la-la-la-la

661
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That's the sound of l

662
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You're my lady l

663
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah

664
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,000
What'd you think?

665
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,500
Well, you
know, i-i-i...

666
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
I thought i would hate it,

667
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
But, you know, i kinda liked it.

668
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,000
Really?

669
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,400
No.

670
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,900
Man, that was terrible.

671
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,600
"Lady l"?

672
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Seher real name.

673
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,000
You shouldn't use yourreal name,

674
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,000
You're writing that stuff.

675
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,000
Well, i think as long as that
i am using my real emotions,

676
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,500
That that's all that matters.

677
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,000
Lots of wackos use their real emotions.

678
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,100
Whoo-hoo!

679
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,900
Go-cart city, boys!

680
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,500
Huh? Who's the man?

681
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
You are! you are!

682
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500

683
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,000

Yeah. Thanks, mr. Fredricks.

687
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,400
My dad would never take me here.

688
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,400
You're welcome.

689
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,900

Well, you're gonna be the loser.

692
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,300
Tr you think so?

693
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,200

00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,700

Let's race.

698
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,100

Oh, yeah!

703

Keep me movin'

706
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,300
No! No! No way!

707
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,800
I don't care about pollution

709
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm an air-conditioned gypsy

710
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I got you!

711
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,900
That's my solution

712
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,400
Watch the police and the tax man miss me

713
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,900

714
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,600

Bill, that was incredible!

719
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
Bill, that was so cool!

720
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,100
You should've seen yourself spin out.

721
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,600
The ice cream is mine.

722
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,900
What is it, bill?

723
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,400
I hate you!

724
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
You what?

725
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,900
You always have to win.

726
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,900
All you care about is winning.

727
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,400
You don't care at all about
other people's feelings.

728
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,400
I'm sorry, bill. i...

729
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,500
I am not the actor

730
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,700
This can't be the scene

731
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,200
Hey, guys.

732
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,200
Have you seen millie?

733
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,200
No.

734
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Ok.

736
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,300
How do you like the magic bus?

737
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,800
Wow. It's amazing. Yeah.

738
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Hey, come back. I got a
who-dog with your name on it.

739
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Ok.

740
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Hey.

741
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,300
Have you seen millie?

742
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Yeah, she's right there,

743
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,800
Playing frisbee with stroker.

744
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,700
You know, she's pretty hot.

745
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,200
I like it when the good girls cross over.

746
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,700
Shut up.

747
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,200
Keep away from her.

748
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,700
God. Who are you, her mom?

749
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,600
Hey, millie.

750
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Millie?!

751
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Millie!

752
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,600
Skinny's in trouble.

753
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,700
Millie. Honey, i thought we agreed

754
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,200
That you were not going
to go to this concert.

755
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,900
I didn't. you did.

756
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,900
Well, you're not going.

757
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yes, i am.

758
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,000
Don't talk back to me.

759
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Mom, this is important to me.

760
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,500
I'm a straight "a" student.
i never do anything wrong.

761
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,900
Honey, you're just a kid.

762
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,900
Mom, i'm 15.

763
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,900
You don't know the kind of
things that could happen.

764
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,400
I can't believe you can't trust me.

765
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,900
It's not like i'm gonna drop acid

766
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,400
Or have sex in the parking lot.

767
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,800
Millie!

768
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,200
You...

769
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,700
You get in this car.

770
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,200
I am taking you home right now.

771
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,500
No.

772
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,500
Just lve me alone.

773
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,500
Fine.

774
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,500
You go right ahead and
do what you want to do.

775
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,500
Obviously, you don't care what i think.

776
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,700
What a mouth on that chick !

777
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,100
That's it! you tell mama!

778
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Tell her how it is!

779
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,900
I'm sorry, bill.

780
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,900
I didn't mean to crash into you.

781
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,900
It's a wet track today. I don't know.

782
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,300
We just don't know each other, do we?

783
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,800
I mean, i thought we knew
each other in class this year,

784
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,800
But we don't know each other at all.

785
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,800
But i know what you think of me.

786
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,800
You think i'm a stupid
jock gym teacher, right?

787
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Bing! You-you're probably right.

788
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
But i don't know what to-

789
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,700
I mean, you know what i am?

790
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,200
I'm a guy who loves your mother very much.

791
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,600
She's a special woman. i love her.

792
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,600
You know, she's had a hard
time the past few years.

793
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,100
What do you know about it?

794
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Ly what she tells me.

795
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,100
But i think she deserves to be happy,

796
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,100
And, you know, i can make her happy.

797
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I've never cared about anybody

798
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,000
As much as i care about your mom.

799
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,000
I might not be as bad
a guy as you think i am.

800
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,800
Hey. hey.

801
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800

802
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Huh? Oh.

Oh, really?

808
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,300

Actually, i wrote a song for you...

810
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,700

811
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,700
Nuh-uh.

814
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,500

820
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Smash me a piece of that!

822
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,500

crack-up, right?

823
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,900
Yeaaaaah!

824
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,400
This is the biggest
favor i ever did for you.

825
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,400
You're buying me a new guitar, man.

826
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,400
Hey.

827
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,400
You ok?

828
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,000
I've never seen her like that.

829
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,900
I feel kinda sick.

830
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Hey, who wants a beer? anybody?

831
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,500
I'll have one of those.

832
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,000
Go ahead. snag it.

833
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,800
Here you go. opener.

834
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,300
Millie, you don't drink.

835
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Now's a good time to start.

836
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,800
Bottoms up.

837
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,300
I killed your dog!

838
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,100
What?!

839
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,600
Um...

840
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,600
I was the one that ran him over.

841
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,600
I'm so sorry, millie.

842
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,600
That's not very funny.

843
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,900
I'm not kidding, millie.

844
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,900
It's true.

845
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,000
Why didn't you say something?

846
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Why didn't you tell me?

847
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,900
I don't know.

848
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,400
Well, we didn't know how to.

849
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,000
Lindsay?

850
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm really sorry, millie.

851
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
She's really mad.

852
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Good.

853
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,900
I'm gonna go talk to her.

854
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Hey, kim.

855
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Thanks.

856
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,900
You know I'm glad 
we didn't go to that concert.

857
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,900
I hear they're so noisy, anyway.

858
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Yeah. I hear that the
bathrooms smell really bad

859
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,900
And that it's not safe to sit.

860
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,900
Could you imagine holding it for 4 hours?

861
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Oh!

862
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,800
Look. I found this in
my drawer the other day.

863
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,800
I thought maybe you might want it.

864
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Wow.

865
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,300
I remember that.

866
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,300
That's the day goliath

867
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,800
Stole all the steaks off
the barbecue and ate them.

868
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,300
Oh, yeah.

869
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,800
Your dad was so mad.

870
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,700
Yeah.

871
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,200
He was a good dog, lindsay.

872
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,200
Yeah, he was a good dog.

873
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,900
Looks inside,
tried to push the ball

874
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,900
In the corner to warnsey.
there's nothing there...

875
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Oh, i'm
- i'm sorry, bill.

876
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,300
Did you want to watch something?

877
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:12,300
Dallas is on.

878
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,800
Bobby ewing: yes, i'm right in the middle.

879
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,200
Pam ewing:well, bobby-

880
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,700
Wait a minute. is it true?

881
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,200
You can do something about it.

882
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,700
What?

883
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
Honey, it's like j.r. said.

884
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,800
I either vote for mama or daddy,

885
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
And either way i lose.

886
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,300
Well, can't you just not vote?

887
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,700
Yes, i can abstain,

888
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,700
Or i can ask to be
excused from the committee;

889
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,200
But i'm not gonna do it.

890
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,700
That's pamela

891
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,700
and Bobby J.R.'s brother.

892
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,100
Oh, yeah?

893
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,600
J.R.'s evil,

894
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,700
So bobby has to protect pamela.

895
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,400
What, so-so bobby'a good guy?

896
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,300
Yeah.

897
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,300
Yeah, but right now he's
caught in a ewing land battle.

898
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,400
What kind of lanbattle? with bobby, or-

899
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,400
Wait-

900
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,900
I'm sorry.

901
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,900
It's ok. I'll tell you
during the commercial.
