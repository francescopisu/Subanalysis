00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,000

Sam, up and at 'em, sam. let's go.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,800
Why is it on so late?

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,700
'Cause at 8:00 you can't say,

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,200
"Jane, you ignorant slut."

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
I got your ice cream right here.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,100
What do you say, fellas?

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Who wants your ice cream, huh?

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,100
2 down front, dad.

00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Okey-doke.

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,000
All right.

19
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,500

Nice to meet you.

26
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,700
I'm from jersey.

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,600
God, i miss bill murray.

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,500
Piscopo cracks me up.

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,800
Oh, i love piscopo.

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,400
Dad, if bill's not gonna eat
his ice cream, can i have it?

31
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,900
Oh, bill's gonna have his ice cream,

32
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,900
Because, bill... Live from new
york! It's saturday night! Bill!

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,900
Why do you guys always put stuff on me?

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,900
I'm gonna get some pop,
that'll keep you guys up.

35
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,300
Your dad's the coolest.

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,300
I heard that!

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
What are they doing to this song?

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,100
What song is it?

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,100
It was chicago's 25 or 6 to 4,

57
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,200
But now it's totally unrecognizable.

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,600
Why do you even know this song, man?

59
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,100
Cause it's a good song, man.

60
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,600
Oh, my god, you guys, you guys,

61
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,600
Check out the pizza-face
dork with the trombone.

62
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,100
Why doesn't he just pop those things?

63
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,500
I think if he did, he'd die of blood loss.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,500
Oh, oh, here we go.

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,000
Look, look, it's tuba girl.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,500
Hey! Hey, your tuba is so big and sexy!

67
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,500
It makes me hot listening to it, baby!

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,500
Play me some billy joel! Yeah!

69
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,000
Hey, at least she knows
how to play an instrument.

70
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,000
That's not playing an instrument.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's like blowing into a toilet.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,500
It sounds better than your singing.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,900
Lindsay, here's an idea.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
How about you break up our band

76
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
So you can make out with nick?

77
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Oh, wait, you already
did that, that's right.

78
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Shut up man !

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,900
Hey, i'm really, really
sorry he said that, you know?

80
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,900
Ehh.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,900
No, really. He didn't mean it, you know?

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,900
Whatever. no big deal.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,800
Yeah? yeah.

84
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Oh, so, harold,

85
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,400
Neal's dad is performing
emergency dental surgery tonight.

86
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Well, good for him.

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,900
Yeah, last week he told me about this lady

88
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,400
Who slipped on the ice onto the sidewalk

89
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
And cracked her teeth.

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,800
She was allergic to anesthetics

91
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,000
So she had to bawake for the whole thing.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
She had a tooth imdded
in the roof of her mouth

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,500
And my dad had to suction
out, like, a gallon of blood.

94
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,300
Well, what a charming story.

95
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,800
Oh, so lindsay, have you
seen ordinary peopleyet?

96
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,300
No, i haven't seen it.

97
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,300
Oh, well, you have to.

98
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,800
I cried.

99
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,300
And, um, i'm gonna see it again.

100
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
Cool. I'm sure you and sam

101
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,300
Avea really good time.

102
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,200
No, i'm not gonna see it.

103
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
It's not funny.

104
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,700
Neal, would you like some more meatballs?

105
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, no, thank you.

106
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,500
My fathesays that too much red meat

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Can lead to heart disease.

108
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,500
Oh.

109
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,300
Uh, dad, can i have an
atari for my birthday?

110
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,200
An a-what-ee?
atari.

111
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,700
That's one what the heck is that?

112
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,700
Of those expensive video games, isn't it?

113
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,200
No, no, it's not expensive.

114
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Yeah, well, whatever it
costs, it's a waste of money.

115
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:01,700
And time.

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,100
You know, the welfare rolls

117
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,100
Are full of video game players.

118
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,600
No, they're not.

119
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,600
Well, they're gonna be. trust me.

120
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,400
But dr. Schweiber told neal

121
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,800
He was gonna get him an
atari for his birthday.

122
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,400
Oh, i asked for it.

123
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,900
That doesn't mean i'm gonna get it.

124
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm out of here

125
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,900
Wh

126
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,400
Oa, wait a minute, there.

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,800
Where are you going?

128
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,300
I'm going to the library.

129
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,800
I have to do some research
for this history paper.

130
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
It's on the panama canal.

131
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Well, could you finish
your dinner first, please?

132
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,600
See ya.

133
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,700
Bye, linze.

134
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Don't even try it.

135
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,800
Hey, sorry i'm so late.

136
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,400
Well, thanks to you we had to
cancel our dinner reservations.

137
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,500
Can you ever not be sarcastic?

138
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,500
I'm sarcastic?

139
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
All right, andopolis, come on.

140
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm getting some more fries.

141
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Hey. hey.

142
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I think i'm gonna go pee.

143
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,600
So, lindsay, what is the deal with you two?

144
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,700
Do you still like nick?

145
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,700
No. I'm just tryin to be friends again.

146
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Forget it. you'll never be friends.

147
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,800
Maybe in, like, 2 years.

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
Ll

149
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,900
Until nick gets another girlfriend.

150
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,400
And then you're just gonna want him back

151
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
And then this whole thing
is gonna start over again.

152
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm not gonna want him back.

153
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,400
All right. Yeah, sure.

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Look, just don't lead him on, ok?

155
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
'Cause he's obviously
still in love with you.

156
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,700
No, he's not. nick is the one

157
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,200
Who broke up with me, remember?

158
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,100
Oh, yeah, lindsay, like that fooled anybody?

159
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Come on.

160
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,700
Look...

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,800
O nice,you know?

162
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,300
He's gonna get the wrong idea.

163
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,100
Well, what am i supposed to be, mean?

164
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,300
No, don't be mean.

165
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,800
Just be a bitch.

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,400
I don't know-

167
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Look, this is for his own good.

168
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,900
Believe me, if he knew what
you were doing, he'd thank you.

169
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,400
I can't help it, man, i'm just-

170
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
I'm so in love with her.

171
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Right. No kidding.

172
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Look, you gotta stop being
so nice to her, all right?

173
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,900
That's how you blew it the first time.

174
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,400
Oh, like you're the expert, or something?

175
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
You and kim fight all the time.

176
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Yeah, but check my new strategy.

177
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
See, she can flap her lips all she wants,

178
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I ain't fighting back.

179
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Sooner or later, she runs out of gas.

180
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
That is a brilliant plan.

181
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,900
Only took you 2 years to figure that out?

182
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,400
It's like the tortoise
and the hare, all right?

183
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,900
Little rabbit gets tired,

184
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,900
Guess who wins?

185
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,400
Are we still talking about the same thing ?

186
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,900
Nick, you want to get lindsay back,

187
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,400
You gotta give her the cold shoulder.

188
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,900
I don't
- i don't know, man.

189
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
That doesn't seem right.

190
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Trust me.

191
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,400
Don't call her house,

192
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Don't write her notes,

193
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,900
And don't sing to her.

194
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,800
Jeez, man, wedon't want
to be friends with you

195
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,300
After hearing about that one.

196
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,300
Yeah, nick. we need our space.

197
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,300
Hey, neal, your mom's here.

198
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,800
So, how was your tennis game?

199
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Oh, god, don't ask.

200
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
My serve was in the crapper.

201
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I'm telling you, i'm
getting too old for this.

202
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,700
Every time i swing that
racket, everything jiggles.

203
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,700
I'd spend more time on the court

204
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,200
But i've got a full-time job.

205
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Oh, really?

206
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,700
Yeah. Being neal's chauffeur.

207
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh.

208
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
The only thingsis t i'm missing

209
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,200
He little hat and the mini-bar

210
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
In the back of the buick.

211
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I know that feeling.

212
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Hello, baby angel.

213
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,100
Baby angel.

214
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,100
Shh, shh, shh.

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Thank you again for letting
neal stay for dinner.

216
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,600
He is welcome any time.

217
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,100
All right, well, ciao.

218
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Bye.

219
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Ciao. Ha ha!

220
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Hey, amy.

221
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,500
Hey, lindsay.

222
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,000
Nice threads.

223
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,500
Nice voice.

224
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hey, sgt. Pepper,

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,500
Where's the rest of the
lonely hearts club band?

226
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, looks like you ate 'em.

228
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,300
Yeah, ken, when are the twins due?

229
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,300
That's not nice.

230
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,700
Lindsay, is this bonehead a friend of yours?

231
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,200
No, he's just a pain in my ass.

232
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Oh, it's all right.

233
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,100
See you later, elvis.

234
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,600
Good luck with those muttonchops.

235
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,200
Look at this.

236
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
I see you're admiring our new microwaves.

237
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,700
Oh, no, we're just browsing, thank you.

238
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,200
See a demonstration?

239
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Only take a minute. literally.

240
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,400
I don't know. my husband says

241
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,400
Anything cooked that fast
can't be good for you.

242
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,900
Well, you know what? I'll
bet he wouldn't say that

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,900
If he was the one doing the cooking, right?

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
Ha ha. Moo.

245
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,400
Just kidding.

246
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,400
Frozen solid. now watch this.

247
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,100
Think of all the free time
you'll have to play tennis.

248
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,800
Mom, i'm gonna look at the ataris, ok?

249
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,300
Ok, sweetie.

250
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,800
Wow.

251
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Your boy like hot dogs?

252
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,900
Yeah.

253
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,900
30 seconds.

254
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,900
Oh, my gosh, you're kidding me.

255
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Dr. Schweiber?

256
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Hey, sam i am.

257
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,900
What are you doing here?

258
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,400
Um, looking at microwaves with my mom.

259
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,900
Oh, yeah?

260
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,400
Well, scotty,

261
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
I hope you're not planning

262
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
To cook a tribble,

263
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,900
Because i believe they're better barbecued.

264
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm sorry, where are my manners?

265
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,400
Sam, this is, uh, an old
high school friend of mine.

266
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,900

00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,300
Oh, very nice to meet you, sam.

270
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,800

other, isn't that funny?

271
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,300

281
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,700

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Oh, that would be great, yeah.

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
And it was very nice meeting you, sam.

290
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Good-bye, dr. Schweiber.

291
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
Oh, hey, you know what?

292
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,100
They're doing laser floyd

293
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,600
At laser dome tomorrow night.

294
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, yeah, i heard that.

295
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
It was in all the newspapers.

296
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,100
Oh, and you're too good for a laser show?

297
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,600
Man, why do i need to go to a laser show

298
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,100
When i can make my own, in my mind?

299
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,600
You guys, it's floyd.

300
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
"If you don't eat your meat,

301
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
You can't have any pudding!"

302
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
It's floyd! come on,

303
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,300
They're not gonna do laser floyd forever.

304
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,800
All right! we'll go! Shut up!

305
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,800
Go where?

306
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,800
Oh, to, uh, laser dome.

307
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,800
You're taking me to laser dome?

308
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,800
Yeah. be happy.

309
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,300
Isn't laser dome just a bunch
of squiggly lights on a ceiling?

310
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,800
No, it's not just a bunch

311
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,300
Of squiggly lights on a ceiling.

312
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
What is wrong with you people?

313
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Laser dome is a metaphysical experience.

314
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Yeah, especially if you have your hand

315
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,800
Up wendy franklin's shirt.

316
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Ooh.

317
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,300
So, do you want to go or not?

318
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,800
Yeah.

319
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,700
Maybe. i don't know.

320
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,200
Is it just me or did it
get a little chilly in here?

321
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

322
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,100
You guys want to go to stackey's?

323
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,100
Mmm. yeah.

324
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,100
Watch her run, just like a little rabbit.

325
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,100
I am the tortoise.

326
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,700
Was i too mean?

327
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,200
No. No, no, no, no, no.

328
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,800
I think that was perfect.

329
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,300
You know, nick really got the message.

330
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,800
Ok, so who's wendy franklin?

331
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Oh, long story.

332
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Let's just say she's a cheap little slut

333
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,300
That daniel made out with
while we were broken up.

334
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,800
But it's over with her, right?

335
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,300
Lindsay, that's not the point.

336
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
He did it with her at the laser dome.

337
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,800
Now he wants to go there with me?

338
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
So, are you going?

339
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Well, yeah. I mean, what else am i gonna do?

340
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Ugh. this is disgusting.

341
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,300
I can't eat this.

342
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,800
So, i wake up this morning,

343
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
And guess what is sitting

344
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
On the end of my bed?

345
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,300
A turd?

346
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Yes, bill, a turd.

347
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,800
Eww, gross.

348
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,200
An atari video set.

349
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,700
Is my dad the coolest, or what?

350
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,700
So, uh, shall we say asteroids,

351
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,200
My place, 3:30?

352
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,700
Yeah, if that's when you
want to get your butt kicked.

353
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,700
Yeah, yeah, 3:30 sounds great.

354
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,700
All right. if you'll excuse me,

355
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,700
I'm off to get another delicious serving

356
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,000
Of ben franklin beans.

357
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Remind me not to sit next to him on the bus.

358
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
What's with you?

359
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,000
Ok, bill, i have a secret,

360
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But you can't tell anyone.

361
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,500
You swear? ok.

362
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
No, really, bill.

363
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,000
I said ok.

364
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Ok. Last night i saw dr.
schweiber at the mall.

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,500
He said he was gonna buy neal the atari.

366
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,000
So?

367
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,900
So, he was with another woman.

368
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,300
He said she was an old
friend from high school,

369
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,500
But it looked weird.

370
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,500
He was hugging her.

371
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,500
Well, there's a lot of
different kinds of hugging.

372
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,500
I mean, was he patting her on the back

373
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
While he did it, like guys do?

374
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,000
Bill, i don't know. it was a hug.

375
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,500
Show me. do it to me.

376
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,600
I'm not gonna hug you.

377
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,100
Why? I'm quite secure with my manliness.

378
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,100
It's ok to hug your friends, sam.

379
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Ok, get off me, i t it, i get it.

380
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,500
Ok. See?

381
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,500
Have you told neal?

382
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
No, and i'm not going to.

383
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
You have to.

384
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
No, but he'll freak.

385
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,500
I know, but there are no secrets between us.

386
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
That's our code, remember?

387
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,500
That's easy for you to say.

388
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,000
You don't have any secrets.

389
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,900
Remember that time in science class

390
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,400
When i tried to sneak out a
fart but it came out a poop

391
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,400
And then i had to flush
my undies down the toilet?

392
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,900
Do you think i wanted to tell you guys that?

393
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
Bill, it's not the same thing.

394
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,900
It is. It's exactly the same thing.

395
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,900
We're not telling him.

396
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,800
Hey, what are you doing?

397
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,300
Nothing.

398
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,800
Who are you looking at?

399
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,300
Oh, i was just,

400
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,300
You know, making fun of the band geeks.

401
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,800
Oh. heh heh.

402
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,300
By yourself?

403
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,300
Let me see. let me see.

404
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Is that who you're looking at?

405
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,800
Tuba girl?

406
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,300
You're in love with tuba girl?

407
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
Shut up, man. just forget it.

408
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,800
Hey, hey, hey.

409
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,300
I'm just excited.

410
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,800
We've been waiting since the third grade

411
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
For you to like somebody.

412
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,800
It's great.

413
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,300
You think she has a boyfriend?

414
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,800
Not even an ex. she's a tuba player.

415
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,200
Screw you, daniel.

416
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,200
Hey, man, i'm just joking.

417
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,700
I'm joking. Relax.

418
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,700
She's cute.

419
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,200
Yeah.

420
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,200
She's friends with lindsay.

421
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,700
You want me to talk to lindsay for you?

422
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,200
Yes. That's exactly what i want you to do.

423
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,700
I'll do it.

424
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,700
Hey, you know,

425
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
If you tel anyone about this,

426
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,200
You're a dead man.

427
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Hey.

428
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,200
See you later, stud.

429
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,000
Damn, damn you should hyperspace.

430
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,000
Hyperspace,shut hyperspace!

431
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,000
Up, shut up, i'm doing it!

432
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,900
Oh.

433
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,600
Argh! ohh.

434
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,100
Maybe you shouldt have hit hyperspace.

435
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,200
My turn.

436
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,700
I got go to the bathroom.

437
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
Oh, hey, don't forget

438
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,700
To lift the seat this time

439
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,100
Or my mom will kill you.

440
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,100
You remember when we said we'd
tell each other everything?

441
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Yeah.

442
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Did you mean it?

443
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Of course.

444
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,600
Even if it's something
really, really horrible?

445
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
I mean, it might not be horrible,
'cause it might not be true.

446
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,100
But if it is true, it
could be pretty horrible.

447
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,500
Ok, bill, you're killing me.

448
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,100
You gotta tell me now.

449
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,600
Ok, bu

450
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,500
T you might not want to know,

451
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,500
'Cause it's pretty horrible.

452
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,500
Bill, you didn't tell him, did you?

453
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,000
Wait a second, sam knows?

454
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,000
That's not fair.

455
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,000
Ok, if you guys both know, i gotta know.

456
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,000
Sam saw your dad hugging a
lady at the mall last night.

457
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,000
What?

458
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,000
Show him.

459
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,500
All right.

460
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
No, that's possible.

461
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,000
My dad was at the office last night

462
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Performing root canal surgery.

463
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So, that wasn't my dad.

464
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,500
It was your dad.

465
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,000
I talked to him.

466
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're lying.

467
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,800
No, you're just jealous

468
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Becausmy dad is cooler than yours.

469
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,700
I'm not jealous!

470
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,500
Neal.

471
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,400
We just thought you should know

472
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
'Cause we tellach other
everything, remember?

473
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,700
Oh, shut up, bill.

474
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,200
You don't even have a d.

475
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,800
I do too! I talked to him 3 months ago.

476
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,000
Hey, guys. how's the game?

477
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Do i get to fly one of those rocket ships?

478
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I need to go home.

479
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,800
I gotta go, too.

480
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Wait a second.

481
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,900
Hey, guys, i'm so lonely.

482
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,400
We have to go

483
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Can't you hang around?

484
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,900
We could have, like, a
little asteroids contest,

485
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Or, uh, benny hill.

486
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Always good for a...

487
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,400
Hey.

488
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Still leaking oil?

489
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,900
Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.

490
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
Chinese or pizza? I'm famished.

491
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Yes, sure. you pick, my love.

492
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,400
If you had a boyfriend

493
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,900
Who humped

494
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
A slut like wendy franklin

495
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
In a certain place-

496
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,400
Let's just say the laser dome-

497
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Would you really want to hang out there?

498
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,100
She's got a point.

499
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,900
Wouldn't you be a little wigged out

500
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,400
By the idea that your boyfriend

501
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,900
Did things with this slut

502
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,400
In the very same seat

503
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,400
You could be sitting in?

504
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Can i go to the bathroom?

505
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,200
Hey.

506
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I regret it.

507
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,700
You're so full of crap, daniel.

508
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,600
What if i'm not?

509
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Well, are you?

510
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,600
I don't think so.

511
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,400
Yes, thank you so much.
that's-that's great.

512
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
All right, thanks.

513
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Sam, is that you?

514
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Hey, hold it right there, mister.

515
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Now, you know i don't mind

516
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,900
If you don't come home
right away after school,

517
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,400
But you have to call me and
let me know where you are.

518
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,600
Sorry, i was at neal's
house playing the atari.

519
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I guess we lost track of time.

520
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,100
They got him that tv game?

521
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,600
I thought they were
waiting for his birthday.

522
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,200
Um, i have to do my homework.

523
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,700
Ok, dinner will be ready in about an hour.

524
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,700
Oh, and you have to get
to bed early tonight.

525
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,200
You have a dental appointment
at 7:00 tomorrow morning.

526
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
What?!

527
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Yeah, dr. Schweiber just called.

528
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,200
He said he could fit you in
early for your 6-month check-up.

529
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Sam, did you take my pink floyd album?

530
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
No.

531
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,000
What's the matter?

532
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,700
Why do people have affairs?

533
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,200
Maybe they meet someone
that they like better.

534
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, do you think dr.
schweiber would ha an affair?

535
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,900
I never ought about it.

536
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,500
Do you think dad would have an affair?

537
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,400
Dad?

538
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,000
Somebody call me?

539
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What's so funny?

540
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Finish your homework.

541
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Have a seat.

542
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,100
Dr. Schweiber will be with you in a minute.

543
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,400
Hello, sam.

544
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Hey. hey.

545
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,900
Open, please.

546
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,400
A little wider.

547
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Thank you.

548
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
Tongue, please.

549
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,900
No, back. Back. bad tongue.

550
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,900
You know what?

551
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,400
I think that you and me need to talk.

552
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
What about?

553
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Well, for starters, you were acting

554
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
A little differently
when i saw you yesterday.

555
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,900
Open, please.

556
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,400
And, i tell you, i was a little bit hurt.

557
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,900
I-i just didn't feel well.

558
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
Well, you know what i think?

559
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,400
I think that you may have thought

560
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,300
You saw something that you
didn't see the other night.

561
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,800
I didn't see anything.

562
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,300
Spit.

563
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,300
And, uh, you didn't say anything to neal

564
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,300
Or to anybody else about
meeting my friend, hmm?

565
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,300
No. good.

566
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,600
Some people love nothing more

567
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Than gossiping about...

568
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,700
About seeing someone spending time

569
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,700
With another woman who isn't their wife.

570
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,700
Well, you can rest assured

571
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,700
That nothing happened
between me and my friend.

572
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,000
You do believe me, don't you?

573
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,500
I believe you.

574
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,500
You know, when i was younger,
i didn't have many dates.

575
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Met mrs. Schweiber back in college

576
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
And, you know, she's a wonderful woman

577
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,000
And she keeps a beautiful home.

578
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's just that when you
get older, you get bored.

579
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
You know?

580
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,900
No, not really.

581
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's just
- it gets so hard, sam.

582
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,900
I feel that there's
something missing in my life

583
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,900
And i think i deserve the chance

584
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,900
To find out what that something is.

585
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,400
Don't you?

586
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,400
I-i don't know.

587
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,200
Yeah.

588
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,200
I promise you, things will
be back to normal pretty soon.

589
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,200
All i need is time.

590
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,700
In the meantime, um,

591
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,700
I can count on you and me
keeping this just between us?

592
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,400
Sure.

593
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,100
Ok.

594
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Well, w the bad news, bud.

595
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,200
You got a cavity.

596
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,500
No, he wasn't on the bus this morning.

597
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Man, i feel really bad, you know?

598
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah, so do i. I knew we
shouldn't have told him.

599
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:29,000
Hey.

600
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,500
So, are you still mad at us?

601
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,000
No.

602
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm actually glad you guys told me.

603
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,500
I was wrong about your dad.

604
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,000
He cleaned my teeth this morning.

605
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,500
I'm sure nothing happened.

606
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,400
Well, i don't know.

607
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,900
After what you guys said,

608
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,800
I went through some of his stuff...

609
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
And i found this.

610
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,000
Yeah? So what?

611
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,800
This clicker isn't for our garage door.

612
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
I tested it. why would he have it?

613
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,100
Well, maybe it belongs
to just a friend of his

614
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,100
Who left it there.

615
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,100
Yeah, a female friend.

616
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,200
I saw this donahueonce

617
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,700
About husbands that cheat.

618
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,600
You can't do it at home, right?

619
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,000
So they all had secret love nests.

620
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Maybe your dad has a secret love nest.

621
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,400
There's only one way to find out.

622
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Hey, ken.

623
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,100
Oh. Lindsay.

624
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,600
Look, i was talking to daniel-

625
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,600
And he said that i wanted to nail amy

626
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
And you're here to tell
me that it'll never happen.

627
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,600
No. He didn't sayyou wanted to nail her.

628
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,900
He wanted me to ask her if sheanted
to go to laser dome tonight.

629
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
Oh.

630
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,400
So, do you want me to do it?

631
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,900
'Cause i want to make sure

632
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,900
That you want me to do it before i do it.

633
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,000
I want you to do it.

634
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,500
Are you gonna be nice to her?

635
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,500
'Cause i'm not gonna do it
if you're gonna be a jerk.

636
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Of course i'll be nice to her.

637
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,000
I'll be an angel.

638
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,800
Forget it.

639
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,300
Lindsay.

640
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm serious.

641
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,500
Ok.

642
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,600
Do you think that there's any chance

643
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
That this may actually happen?

644
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Oh, my god.

645
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,500
What?

646
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,500
You really like her, don't you?

647
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
I feel odd.

648
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,300
So, i told my mom i was
eating at your house,

649
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,300
And bill told his mom he
was eating at my house,

650
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,300
So that should give us some time.

651
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,300
When are we really gonna eat? I'm hungry.

652
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,800
Do you think we're gonna find this house?

653
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,300
Well, we'll never know if we don't try.

654
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Well, what are you gonna do if we find her?

655
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm gonna say, hey, lady,

656
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
You want to mess with the schweiber family?

657
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,300
Is that what you want? ok-boom!

658
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,800
Head butt

659
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,800
Hey
- sorry.

660
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,400
Amy!

661
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Oh, hey, lindsay. what are you doing here?

662
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,400
I just came to say hi.

663
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,900
That was really great.

664
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,400
Makes me wish i played an instrument.

665
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Yeah, you should join band.

666
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,900
Well, i'm kind of taking
a break from activities.

667
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
I quit the mathletes. twice.

668
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,500
Yeah, millie told me.

669
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
So, anyway, um,

670
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,000
I know this is kind of out of the blue,

671
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But i know this guy-ken.

672
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
He's got a crush on you.

673
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,500
Do i know him?

674
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,900
Well, you kind of met him the other night.

675
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,900
Was he the guy who was making fun of me?

676
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,900
Yeah, he's a total wise-ass,

677
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
But that's how he shows that he likes you.

678
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,900
It's just this weird sense
of humor, i don't know.

679
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
So, if you're not doing anything,

680
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,900
We were gonna go to laser dome tonight.

681
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,100
Why? laser dome sucks.

682
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
Yeah, that's what i thought you'd say.

683
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,600
I totally understand.

684
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,100
But i'll go.

685
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,100
Really?

686
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,100
Yeah, i mean, why not?

687
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,100
Ken's cute, don't you think?

688
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,600
Uh-huh.

689
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,100
I love those funky sideburns.

690
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,100
Don't you just want to
reach out and touch them?

691
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,100
Heh. Do i.

692
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,500

693
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Let them knock you around

694
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,600

695
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Let them make you a clown

696
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,000

697
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,500
Let therush, you rock 'n' roll

698
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:13,800
Let the good times roll

699
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,200
Tell you one thing. when i get married,

700
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,700
I'm never gonna cheat on my wife.

701
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,700
Even if she gets old and fat.

702
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,200
Yeah.

703
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,700

But i don't think i want the kind

That's gonna get old and fat.

I don't even know how you even getonegirl.

708

How does anyone get two?

You know what would be cool, guys ?

710
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,400
To find a girl in a bottle,

711
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,900
Like-like i dream of jeannie.

712
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,400
I'd like to make out with
her on that little couch.

713
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,400
Yeah. Cindy would look
good in those puffy pants.

714
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,900
You think your dad's
ever cheated on your mom?

715
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,100
No, no, i don't think so.
my dad's a little too old

716
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,600
To want to make out with anyone.

717
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah. I'm startin' to wish my dad

718
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,200

00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,600
Actually, i could go for a hot dog.

743
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Oh, yeah? Yeah. You want one? It's on me.

744

00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,000
Wow. This song really rocks.

747
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,600
Yeah. Next time, you should
bring your tuba and...jam.

748
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
She seemed to like me, right?

749
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah.

750
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,000
See the show

751
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,600
Man. I haven't been here
since, like...fifth grade.

752
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,100
Boy, you must've been
really cute in fifth grade...

753
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,600
With your little blond pigtails.

754
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Ohhh...

755
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,600
See?

756
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,600
Now i've already got a crick in my neck.

757
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,100
Oh. Well, why don't you lean the seat back?

758
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,600
It goes back, silly.

759
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,600
Oh.

760
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,600
Lean your head back.

761
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,600
There. is that better?

762
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,600
Mm-hmm.

763
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,000
Good.

764
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Did you lean your head back with that slut?

765
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,500
Hey, look. Isn't that the big dipper?

766
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
God! Whatisit with you?

767
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,000
You're acting so weird!

768
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,000
Am i?

769
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,500
Ohh! You're driving me insane.

770
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,500
Excuse me!

771
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,000
Hey, come here.

772
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Don't touch.

773
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Don't talk to her.

774
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,500
No singing

775
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,000
Right.

776
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Thanks.

777
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,100
Floyd rules!

778
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Comfortably numb!

779
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,600
Yeah!

780
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,200
What the hell's goin' on?
what happened to floyd?

781
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
That's next week, man.

782
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,100
Tonight's southern rock night.

783
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,100
Yee-haw!

784
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,600
The devil went down to georgia

785
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,200
He was lookin' for a soul to steal

786
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,700
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind

787
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,400
He was willin' to make a deal

788
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
When he came across this
young man sawin' on a fiddle

789
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,900
And playin' it hot

790
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,400
And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump

791
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
And said, "boy, let me tell you what"

792
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,900
"I guess you didn't know it

793
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,900
"But i'm a fiddle player, too"

794
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,900
I don't know.

795
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,400
It happened. It's like
being in the twilight zone.

796
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,900
"But give the devil his due"

797
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
"I bet a fiddle of go against your soul"

798
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,900
"'Cause i think i'm better'n you"

799
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Been to a million houses, neal.

800
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,400
How-how many more are we gonna do, anyway?

801
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,900
As many as it takes.

802
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,400
I don't think we'll find it.

803
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,900
Then go home.

804
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,900
It could be way on the other side of town.

805
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,900
Then we'll find it there.

806
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,900
Right now we're lookin' here.

807
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,400
Hey.

I gotta go home.

810
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,800
My parents are gonna be worried.

811
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,800
Yeah me too.

812
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,300
My mom doesn't like to watchdallasalone.

813
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
I can't believe it.

814
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,200
I can't believe you guys
are gonna bail on me!

815
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,700

816

If this wasyo your dad,

I just... didn't want to...

862

Lead you on, and i know
it's so stupid, but...

863
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:56,100
I thought that you might still like me.

00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,100
Wow.

00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,100

Well. It's about time

Your mother and i have
something to tell you.

882
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,000
What?

883
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,500
That maybe sometimes it's ok

884
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,400
To spend a little extra money

885
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,400
On such a good kid.

886
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,700
Yeah. Maybe you can teach me
about those space invaders. Huh?

887
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,200
Oh...

888
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,600
Dad.

889
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Boy. Must've really wanted that game, huh?

890
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,300
I'd be lyin' if i didn't
say this is painful.
