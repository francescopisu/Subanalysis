00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,700
Dr. Schweiber?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,700
Sam saw your dad hugging a lady

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,700
At the mall last night.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,200
This clicker isn't for our garage door.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,200
Maybe your dad has a secret love nest.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
Bill, that is not sexy.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,500
Yes, it is.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
Bill, it looks like you're having a seizure.

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,900
Women love this.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,400
They don't care that rerun's fat

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,600
'Cause he's got the moves.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,600
Come on. you guys get up here.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Try it.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Sam, come on, shake it.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
You won't break it.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
Ok.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
You cut me off mid-funk.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,300
Look, neal, you always
want to impress the ladies.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,300
Th this is how you do it.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,100
At's never impressed the ladies.

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,000
It's 'cause i haven't done
it in front of the ladies.

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,000
Look, if i had,

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,500
I'd be fighting 'em off with a stick.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,300
Guys, let's get serious.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,300
That is not going to impress the women.

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Trust me.

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,000
Ok, and you know what will, don't you?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
As a matter of fact, i do.

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,700
I've discovered something
that will change our lives.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,800
It'll bring us power, respect, and money,

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,300
And it's right here in the suitcase.

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,300
What is it?

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,700
You sure you want to know?

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Ha ha!

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,800
Yes, so open it up.

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,300
Think you can handle it?

39
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,800
Yeah. Open it.

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,300
Gentlemen...

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,500
Say hello to morty.

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Hi, dummies.

60
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,600
Is that, uh, is that jenna zank?

61
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Oh, yeah. yeah.

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,100
Didn't she drop out ?

64
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,600
Why would you drop out ?

65
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
And stay in chippewa?

66
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,000
That's crazy.

67
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,500
She used to be so hot.

68
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,500
Yeah.

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,500
She still is.

70
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, if you like clowns.

71
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,000
Clowns.

72
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,900
Mmm...

73
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,900
By the way, i got a late
rsvp from jim narotsky.

74
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,400
He and liz are coming.

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,900
Are there any more ?

76
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
'Cause you keep adding on like this,

78
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
I'm gonna have to get more food.

79
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,400
Lillian, we've had this party

80
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,900
Every year now for 10 years,

81
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,400
And we've never run out of food,

82
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Not even come close.

83
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,400
Ell your dad

84
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
About your history test?

85
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,800
Well, that doesn't sound good.

86
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,800
I got a "d."

87
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,300
"D"? What, did you even get
your name right at least?

88
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Honey, this is a few grades like this.

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Doou think that maybe...

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,700
Morty is distracting you a
little bit from your studies?

93
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,700
Ism.

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,700
Hey, we're just trying to talk here, buddy.

95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,200
We just want to make sure you're all right.

96
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,700
I'm sorry. I had a couple of bad tests.

97
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,200
I'll do better. i promise.

98
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,200
All we ask is that you try your hardest.

99
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200

100
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,700

103
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,700
Sure.

104
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Harold, we have to go or the
schweibers will be offended.

105
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,700
We missed it last year.

106
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,200
We didn't miss anything.

107
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,700
It's the same party year after year.

108
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,200
It's smarmy.

109
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
What kind of doctor
invites his patients over

110
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
To listen to his dental jokes?

111
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
It's sick.

112
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,100
Honey, we have to go.

113
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,100
Mom, i don't have to go, do i?

114
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
I don'out of it.

115
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,700
He's your dentist, too.

116
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,200
Fine. I'll switch dentists.

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,700
Say, that's an idea.

118
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,100
Harold, you are acting like a child.

119
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,100
Now, we're going.

120
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,600
Lindsay, you don't have to go.

121
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,500
Yes.

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,200
Hey, neal, can i put my
history book in your locker

123
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,700
Until after next period?

124
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't have a lot of extra room.

125
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,000
Aah!

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Ok, now you're inging the
dummy to school with you?

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,800
Hey, it's called a figure, not a dummy.

128
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,800
A dummy is someone who calls it one.

129
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,300
Oh, is it?

130
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
No, don't take it out.

131
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Relax. it's just morty, bill.

132
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Yeah, you got a problem?

133
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,800
Tell it not to talk to me.

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Oh, bet you want a piece
of me, huh, stretch?

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,300
Shut up already.

136
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Sorry.

137
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Just need time to rehearse.

138
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,300
My brother's coming home this weekend,

139
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,800
So i won't have much time then.

140
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,700
What are you rehearsing for?

141
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,700
Is there some sort of a
talent show or something?

142
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,700
For life.

143
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,700
I'm taking control.

144
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
I know i can't depend on
my crazy parents anymore.

145
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,200
Who knows? I can make big bucks with this.

146
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,000
I doubt it.

147
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, ventriloquism isn't funny.

148
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Perhaps you've never seen
a little show calledsoap.

149
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
I mean, that guy's hilarious.

150
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Now he's rich, thanks to ventriloquism.

151
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
When barry comes home this weekend,

152
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,400
I think i'm gonna tell him about our dad.

153
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
What, about that woman?

154
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Mm-hmm.

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,900
You think that's a good idea?

156
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Well, i have to tell him. he's my brother.

157
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,100
Mrs. Desario: DANIEL!

158
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
Daniel, you come back here.

159
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,100
I need you to run to the drug store

160
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
And pick up your father's prescriptions.

161
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,100
I can't, ma. i got to go to music.

162
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,000
You know i can't leave
him alone. He might fall.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
Well, why don't you call
joey? He's not working.

164
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,700
Oh, yeah. Trust your brother
with those painkillers?

165
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,200
Never again.

166
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,700
All

167
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
Right, fine. i'll go after school,

168
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,000
But i gotta go. I can't
get any more tardies.

169
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,000
It cannot wait. your father's in pain.

170
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,000
I need you to do this now.

171
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,500
What do you want me to
do? I'm in high school.

172
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,500
Oh, yeah, when it's
convenient for you, you are.

173
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,500
You're 18. You're going to be
the oldest junior in michigan.

174
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,500
What do you want me to do?

175
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I can bring us you want me to drop out?

176
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,000
Home a big whopping 2.50 an hour.

177
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,100
You know i wouldn't turn that down.

178
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Hey, come on, daniel. what
am i supposed to do here?

179
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,600
What do you mean, what
are you supposed to do?

180
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,100
You're supposed to go
inside, take care of him.

181
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm supposed to go to school.

182
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
It's called wednesday.

183
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Where you goin'?

184
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,700
I'm gonna get the stupid pills.

185
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,800
Hey, desario!

186
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
What?

187
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
I've been waiting for you.

188
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Where the hell were you this morning?

189
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,300
You have my notes.

190
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Oh, i was held up.

191
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Well, thanks a lot.

192
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,300
I failed a test because of you.

193
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,200
What are you talking about?

194
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,200
It was an open-notes test.

195
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,200
I left my bag in your car last night.

196
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,700
Oh, so it's my fault

197
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,200
No that you left your bag in my car?

198
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,800
. It's your fault that
you're the most unreliable guy

199
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,300
On the face of the planet.

200
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, you're certainly reliable.

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,500
You're always a bitch.

202
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,000
Why don' you know what, daniel?

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
T you enjoy spending the
rest of your life alone?

204
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,000
Uh, neal, i don't see your report here.

205
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,100
I-i did it.

206
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,900
Where is it?

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,900
In my mind.

208
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,900
I didn't want to write it down

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,400
Because i didn't want to kill a tree.

210
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,400
Did you know that our
rainforests are disappearing?

211
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Neal

212
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,900
Hector.

213
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,300
All right, that's it.

214
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,800
You just bought yourself a
ticket to the principal's office.

215
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,300
You mean to see jerry? i love that guy.

216
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,300
He owes me money!

217
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,300
Girl: PUT ME DOWN!

218
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Put me down!

219
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,200
Come on. You know you love me!

220
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,200
You're crushing my ribs!

221
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,700
Put her down.

222
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,700
What? We're just having some fun.

223
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
No, i'm not. put me down.

224
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,200
I said put her down!

225
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Ow!

226
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
That hurt, you burn-out.

227
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Yeah, well, it's supposed to hurt, you jerk.

228
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Hey! miss weir...

229
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,700
Leave me alone.

230
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
We don't hit people here at mckinley.

231
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,300
Yeah, what's your problem?

232
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,800
I think she's high, man.

233
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,300
She went crazy on me.

234
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,700
He wouldn't put her down.

235
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
We were just messing around.

236
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,400
Ay!

237
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,400
All right, that's it.

238
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,900
The two of you can work it out

239
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,900
This afternoon in detention.

240
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,900
What?

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,900
Burn-out!

242
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,400
Mr. Botwinick, i was
just trying to help her.

243
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,400
She looks like she can take care of herself.

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Sorry, friend.

245
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,300
Pick up a little bug the other night.

246
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,300
Long story.

247
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Look, mr. Rosso, i'm really
sorry i mouthed off in class.

248
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,300
I'll apologize to mr. Lacovara. I promise.

249
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
It'll never happen again.

250
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,800
Neal, have a seat.

251
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,300
Here's what i see-

252
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,000
A kid whose grades have
taken a sudden tumble,

253
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And for the first time,
starting to get into trouble.

254
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,500
Now, in my business,

255
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,300
We call those warning signs.

256
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,100
I'm here to help you,

257
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,100
But i can't help you
if you won't talk to me.

258
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Really, mr. Rosso, everything's fine.

259
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,900
Neal, sometimes we like to
say that everything's fine

260
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Because, really, things aren't fine.

261
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Everything's fine.

262
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,600
I've had kids lying to me
since before you were born.

263
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,500
You're new to it, and
you're not that good at it.

264
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,000
Come on.

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,500
Ok.

266
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,000
You want me to talk? you think it'll help?

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Fine.

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,500
My father is a womanizer.

269
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,000
He's cheating on my
mother, and she has no clue,

270
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And i have to decide
whether or not to tell her.

271
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,300
Daniel, you're father trying to sleep.

272
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,300
All right, i'll be quiet.

273
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,300
He's always trying to sleep.

274
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Rise aboveplays]

275
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,700
Jealous cowards try to control

276
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,700
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

277
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,200
They distort what we say

278
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,700
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

279
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
Try to stop what we do

280
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,200
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

281
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,700
When they can't do it themselves

282
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Rise above, we're gonna rise above

283
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,800
We are tired of your abuse

284
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,700
Uh, what are you doing, miss weir?

285
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,500
What? I'm doing my homework.

286
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
That's not allowed in here.

287
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,200
What?

288
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
This is detention.

289
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,300
Thpoint is to think about what you've done.

290
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,700
What?

291
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,600
Why would you want to keep
these people from studying?

292
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,100
I mean, isn't that the point?

293
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,100
You can't schoolwork at school?

294
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,600
It's the stupidest thing i've ever heard.

295
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,100
Teachers just quarantine bad kids

296
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,100
And make them sit and stare into space

297
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,600
Until their brains get numb?

298
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,100
You're manufacturing idiots.

299
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,100
What kind of system is this?

300
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,600
I'm doing my homework.

301
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Uh, no, you're not, miss weir.

302
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,200
Put the books aw, and you know what?

303
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,200
You're not doing your
homework tomorrow afternoon

304
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,200
When you come in here, too.

305
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,700
What? That's insane.

306
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,100
And you're not doing your homework friday

307
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,600
When you come in here.

308
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Ha!

309
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,100
Botwinick's an idiot.

310
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,600
Seidelman's an idiot.

311
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
This school turns people into idiots.

312
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,500
It's this school.

313
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,500
I hate this school.

314
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,500
I broke up with daniel.

315
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,500
Really?

316
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,500
Yeah.

317
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,500
Well, that's a good thing, right?

318
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,100
Yeah, i guess.

319
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,100
Well...then congratulations.

320
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Thank you.

321
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,900
Ha. This food is fit for a king.

322
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,500
Here, king. here, king.

323
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,400
Hey, honey.

324
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,400
What do you say i ditch this chump

325
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,000
And you and me get out of here?

326
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,000
Sam, do you see another table open?

327
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,500
Neal, people are looking at us.

328
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,500
And not in a good way.

329
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
What are you guys talking
about? I'm killing.

330
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Can't you just put that
thing in your locker?

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,500
Hey, who are you calling a thing?

332
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,000
Hey, schweiber, nice doll.

333
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,500
Did it come with a dress?

334
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,400
Hey, seidelman, nice head.

335
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,000
Did it come with a neck?

336
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,000
Hey, morty.

337
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm really sorry.

338
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,500
I can't control him sometimes.

339
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Hey, schweiber, how about i kick your butt?

340
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,400
It's not me, it's him.

341
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,600
Oh, ok, right.

342
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,100
Gotcha.

343
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,600
Well, how about this?

344
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
How about i kick your butt...

345
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,100
And he can talk about it?

346
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Does that sound good to you?

347
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,700
Hey, seidelman, knock it off.

348
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,200
Why don't you go pk on
someone your own size?

349
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,300
There's a bus in the parking lot.

350
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,800
Ha ha ha.

351
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,300
Thanks a lot, mr. Kowchevski.

352
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,300
Some people just don't appreciate art.

353
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,800
Yeah, you're a hero.

354
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,300
What are you,

355
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,800
A gl

356
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,100
Ton for punishment, schwibber?

357
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
It'sschweiber.

358
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,100
You tell 'em, morty.

359
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,400
That stupid dummy almost got us killed.

360
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,900
"It's not a dummy, it's a figure."

361
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,900
He shouldn't even be messing
with that stuff, you know?

362
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,400
What do you mean?

363
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,300
Have you seen the moviemagic?

364
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,800
Yeah. Remember we saw it
instead of seeinggrease?

365
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,300
Yeah. What if neal has the kind of dummy

366
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,800
You that's inmagic?

367
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Know, one minute it's all fun
and games, everybody's happy,

368
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,300
And then, "hey, schmucko,
why don't you go kill bill?"

369
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,300
I know he's going through
a hard time and all, but...

370
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,800
You get to be a jerk

371
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Just because your dad's having an affair?

372
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,000
Hey.

373
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,700
How's it goin'?

374
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
Remember me?

375
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,700
FROM mckinley?

376
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,700
Daniel.

377
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,200
I don't know. Maybe.

378
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,800
So, uh, how's the dropping out going?

379
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,300
A lot better than the stayin' in was.

380
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
A lot fewer idiots hassling me all the time.

381
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Yeah. That's cool.

382
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Do you want something?

383
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,100
Aren't you the guy

384
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,600
That had that psycho girlfriend?

385
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,100
Yeah, but, uh...

386
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,600
We don't really share the
same interests anymore.

387
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,500
Well, that's too bad.

388
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,500
Yeah, you know, like...

389
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,000
It's like, you know, she's
not into current affairs, i am.

390
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,500
She's not a punker, i am.

391
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,000
Really?

392
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, that's right.

393
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You know what punkers don't do?

394
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,500
Call themselves punkers.

395
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Uh-huh.

396
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Who do you listen to?

397
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Clash, iggy, the ramones,

398
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Sex pistols...

399
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
All the obvious guys.

400
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Yeah, well, you know i listen
to more obscure stuff, too.

401
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
What are you doin'?

402
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,100
This is where i'll be saturday night.

403
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
It's called the armpit.

404
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,500
It's downtown.

405
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,500
So...

406
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,500
Maybe i'll see you there.

407
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,500
Yeah, definitely.

408
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Yeah, but if i did pull the firalarm,

409
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,900
Would all the girls get dressed

410
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
Before they ran out of the locker room?

411
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,900
Or would they just run out naked?

412
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,900
I don't know.

413
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,900
Hey, where were you guys during lunch?

414
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,400
Morty and i had the
lunch ladies cracking up.

415
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,900
I pretended there was some guy

416
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,400
Drowning in the beans.

417
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,900
Help me!

418
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Oh. Sorry i missed it.

419
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,000
All right, i'll see you
later, mr. Forrester.

420
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
I made good time driving in.

425
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,400
I figured i'd stop by, see the old prison.

426
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,900
What is this thing?

427
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,400

00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,600
You all look so hot.

443
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,100
Neal, you gotta spend
some more time over there.

444
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,100
Believe me, i've been trying.

445
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,700
So, hey, how's college?

446
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,900
Oh, i can't tell you.

447
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,400
It would make you feel bad.

448
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,900
Really? it's tremendous.

449
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,400
There's no detention, there's no-

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,600
Hey, fat ass, why don't you shove it?

453
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,200
All right, come on.

454
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,700
Let's go to the principal's office.

455
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm

456
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,900

461
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,500
Ok.

462
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,500
Calm down.

463
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,800
Lindsay, you're gonna come

464
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Yeah. Ok. ok.

465
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,300

466
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,800

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,800
God, i hate it when they come back!

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,800
Come on, let's go. get to class, come on!

469
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,500
No. Fraternities
- fraternities are lame, dad.

470
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,400
They are not!

471
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,400
Yes, they are.

472
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,900
They-you know what they make you do

473
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,400
To get into a fraternity?

474
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
You have to, um, pick up a meatball

475
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,300
And with your rear end

476
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,300
Walk it to the other side of the room.

477
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
And if you drop it on the way,

478
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
They make you pick it up and eat it.

479
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,800
Oh!i me oh!

480
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,300

To havme take part in that kind of activity?

Besides, you're a schweiber man!

506

Ok, now you're creeping me out.

525
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,700
What?

526
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,600
Well, i liked when senor wences did it.

527
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,100
But i don't know what-

528
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,100
What you're trying to accomplish.

529
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Um...

530
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Barry, there's something i've been, um,

531
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Meaning to talk to you about.

532
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,000
What's that?

533
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,100
It's about dad.

534
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,000
What about him?

535
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,500
I really don't know how to say it.

536
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
You're probably gonna get upset.

537
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm not gonna get upset. Just say it.

538
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,900
I think dad is cheating on mom

539
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,900
How did you find out?

540
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,400
It's a long story,

541
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,400
But i'm pretty sure i'm right.

542
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,400
You're right. you're right.

543
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,900
What?

544
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Dad cheats on mom.

545
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,400
I-i've-i
know.

546
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Really?

547
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Yeah.

548
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,800
I-i spotted them at
a-at a movie once,

549
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,300
And he was sitting wit
like, a young redhead.

550
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,800
Uh, did he see you?

551
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,700
I don't know. i don't know.

552
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,700
He, uh, that year, he bought
me a-a car for my birthday.

553
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,200
Wha...

554
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,200
Why didn't you tell me?

555
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,200
Why would i tell you?

556
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,700
Did you tell mom?

557
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
No! No.

558
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,700
Why not? He's making a fool out of her.

559
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,700
So-uh, huh.

560
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,700
You wanna tell her?

561
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,200
Is that what you wanna do?

562
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,700
You wanna tell her so they can get divorced?

563
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,700
Right?

564
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,700
So they can sell the house,

Hey, nick.

568
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,400
Maybe, uh, maybe you'll get
lucky at the punk club tonight.

569
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,400
You think so?

570
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,900
Sure.

571
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,900
You know, all these punk
girls hate themselves.

572
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,500
It's got to improve your chances.

573
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,000

right about something!

599
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,300

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,800
Hey, hey, phyllis, hi, how are you?

Listening to the same old dentist jokes

620
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,400
Without plenty of anesthesia.

621
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,900
Oh, honey, go easy.

622
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,400
Do you want me to take this from you ?

623
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,400
'Cause

00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,900
You're not eating it.

625
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,900
I don't want it to go to waste.

626
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,400

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You want to ask me that, don't you?

642
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
No! Uh-uh. not if you're gonna snap!

Honestly, i have no idea.

644

You know, uh, do you know
what you're gonna major in?

645
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,900
No. Not a clue.

646
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,400
Probably i'll just be glad
i'm out of high school.

647
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Barry?

648
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,900

00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
She's on she keeps ignoring me.

You asked me to come here.

672
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,200
Oh, it's you.

673
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Yeah.

674
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
You look different.

675
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,600
Well, you know, this is the real me.

676
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,600
Yeah?

677
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,100
Yeah.

679
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,300
Yeah!

680
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,800
How do you like the band?

681
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,300

Yeah, i know! they rule!

685
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
And so the dentist says-i
know you heard it already-

686
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,700
The dentist says, "make up your mind,
honey. I gotta adjust the chair."

687
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,200
Harold, you want another?

688
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,200

689
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,200

690
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,200

691
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Ahh.

692
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
A dentist joke!

693
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,800
He's an... He's an actor.

694
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Meanile, bush is the
former head of the c.i.a.

695
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,700
Come on, do you really think
john hinckley was working for him?

696
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,200
Uh, not directly, but yes.

697
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,700
That's ridiculous.

698
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,700
Well, at least i find it easier to believe

699
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,700
Than that, uh, fakakte jodie foster story.

700
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,200
Faka-what?

701
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Oh, sorry. Fakakte.

702
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,700
It's, uh, yiddish for, like, lame.

703
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Oh, yeah. Ok.

704
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Fakakte!

705
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,600
That's very good.

706
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,100
Thanks.

707
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,500
You wanna get outta here?

708
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah.

709
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,700
Ugh.

710
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,200
Uhhh.

711
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,900
Oh. Ow.

712
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Are you ok?

713
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,300
Is there a bathroom around here?

714
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,800
Over there!

715
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,800
All right. i'll be right back.

716
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,800
Man, can you believe how
many posers are out there?

717
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,800
Yeah, i ain't no poser, man, check this out.

718
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,800
What? I ain't callin' you a poser, man.

719
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,800
Relax.

720
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,900
I don't know, he was really into me,

721
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,400
But he was just stoned all the time.

722
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,900
Hmm.

723
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,900
Do you smoke?

724
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,400
No. What, are you crazy?
it gets me paranoid.

725
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:11,900
Yeah? Me, too.

726
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,400
Yeah, i

727
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,900
Lock myself in my room.

728
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,500
It's bad.

729
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Yeah, that stuff, it's fakakte.

730
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
That-that's it,that's though,

731
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,000
The perfect use of that word.

732
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Wait, so what were we talking about?

733
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Your-your friends.

734
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
Oh, yeah. they're really fun,

735
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,000
And they're
- they're funny.

736
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,500
But they're just...

737
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,000
Well, they don't inspire me or challenge me.

738
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,500
I don't know, does that sound mean?

739
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,400
Relax. you think too much.

740
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,900
Yeah. Tell me about it.

741
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,900
You know...

742
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
When you get to college,
it's funny, it's like,

743
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,900
All that high school stuff disappears.

744
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,400
Really, it's like...

745
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,900
It's a do-over.

746
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,400
I mean, when you get there...

747
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,900
It's, like, no one knows
that you were an athlete

748
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,900
Or that you were a burn-out.

749
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
It's like a fresh start.

750
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,900
You can be whoever you wanna be.

751
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,400
Like, take-take me for instance,

752
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,900
When i was in high school,

753
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,300
I got-i got beat up
more than neal, you know.

754
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,800
But when i got to college, i mean,

755
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,300
You didn't-you didn't hear
me say, "hey, look at me!

756
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,300
I'm the guy that got beat
up every day! That was me!"

757
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
No, i said,

758
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,900
"Look at me, i'm the-the handsome,

759
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Dashing jew."

760
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
And, huh, people bought it!

761
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,400
Which is-

762
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Yeah.

763
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
I buy it.

764
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,400
You see what i'm saying?

765
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,800
So what do i wanna be?

766
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,800
Give me the weekend...

767
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,800
And i'll come up with something good.

768
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,500
Hey, look at you. hey.

769
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,400
"Oh, look at me, look at
me, i'm such a good husband."

770
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,400
Blah, blah, blah.

771
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,400
You know, fantasy islandis on.

772
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,900
We could watch that.

773
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,300
Hey, everybody!

774
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,300
I'd like to propose a toast.

775
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,800
To the woman without whom we'd all be hungry

776
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,800
And without whom my life
wouldn't be complete.

777
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Mmm.

778
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,700
Oh, thank you.

779
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,700
Cheers. hear, hear.

780
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,700
This sucks. i gotta get outta here.

781
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,700
Oh, no.

783
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,700
Hey, buddy.

784
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Hey, neal.

785
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,100
Don't-don't let me interrupt.

786
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,100
I was just out for...

787
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Hey! I've been lookin' all over for you.

788
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
What?

789
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Well, i want you to do
your ventriloquism act.

790
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
What?

791
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
N-no, not now.

792
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,400
Why? With a friendly audience like this?

793
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,400
Come on, who wants to see
neal do his ventriloquism?

794
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,900
Yeah.

795
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
Ha ha ha ha!

796
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,900
Go on!

797
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,900
Go on, get your dummy.

798
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,900
It's called a figure!

799
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Oh, gosh.

800
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,400
These artistic types,

801
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Very sensitive, you know.

802
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,300
How's your head?

803
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,800
It's fine. You know,
just another battle scar.

804
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,700
Just hold still.

805
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
All right.

806
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Just do it.

807
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,300
Almost done.

808
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
There you go.

809
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,800
Thank you!

810
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,300
Thank you very much.

811
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,300
Who's next?

812
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,200
I am.

813
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,700
Just gonna ice it for a minute.

814
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,700
Oh, yeah.

815
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,200
Hey, daniel, what are you doin', man?

816
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,700
Never mind.

817
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,700
Hey, uh, daniel, i don't think

818
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,200
This is such a good idea, man.

819
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,700
Forget it.

820
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Ready?

821
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Yeah.

822
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Ok. On 3...

823
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,200
I'm gonna push it through.

827
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
Ohh.

828
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
Oh, jeez.

829
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,200
Oh, my god. ow!

830
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,600
You ruined it, you wimp.

831
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,600
Oh, jeez, man.

832
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,100
Can we get outta here?

833
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,600
That's makin' me sick, man.

834
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,600
Let's get out. where's ken?

835
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,100
That's

836
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,100
Terrible! where's ken?

837
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,200
Well, let's check this out.

838
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,700
Ladies and gentlemen!

839
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,700
Uh, neal and morty!

840
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,200
Hey! whoo-hoo!

841
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,700
Uh, hi, everybody!

842
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,200
M-morty, say hello to the nice people.

843
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,700
Hello, nice people.

845
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,200
Say, how come these people
are so funny-looking?

846
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
W-what do you mean?

847
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Their teeth!

848
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,200
They're terrible!

849
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,700
Morty, i mean, come on.

850
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
No, no, no, no, no.

851
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,200
Haven't they ever heard of a toothbrush?

852
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,600
Morty! Wh-what do you mean by that?

853
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,600
Look at them. look at ese people.

854
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,100
Look at that lady over
there. Her teeth are so bad,

855
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,600
She should be a professional hockey player.

856
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Boo.

857
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
All right, can we
- can we just

858
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Get to the act now, please?

859
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,100
Oh, sure thing, sure thing.

860
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
All right.

861
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Be what's the difference

862
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,100
Tween a proctologist and a dentist?

863
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,600
I-i don't know, what?

864
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,500
Ha! One's a doctor of the ass

865
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,500
And the other's an ass who's a doctor.

866
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Morty, come on, be nice.

867
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,000
All right, all righ all right.

868
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,400
Well, uh, ok, here-here's
another one. Here's another one.

869
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,400
Ok. What's the difference between a dentist

870
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,900
And a brand-new pair of leather shoes?

871
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,400
I-i don't know, what?

872
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,400
A brand-new pair of leather shoes

873
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,400
Will never give you an
unnecessary root canal

874
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,400
So he can build an addition on his house.

875
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
Ok. hey, morty,

876
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Come on, that's not really funny.

877
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,400
All right, all right.

878
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
Dr. Schweiber is a wonderful dentist.

879
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,300
I ain't lettin' him touch me.

880
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,300
He's not gonna put me under.

881
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,800
Ha, next thing i know i'll wake up

882
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,300
And my wisdom teeth'll be gone

883
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,800
Along with my virginity!

884
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,300
Ok. Ok, that's enough. thank you.

885
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,800
All right, thank you.

886
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,800
Why is dr. Schweiber a dentist?

887
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,300
I-i have no idea, why?

888
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,800
Because he's so stupid he
flunked out of medical school!

889
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Ok, that's enough, neal.

890
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Thank you.

891
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,300
Ok, that enough, thank you.

892
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,800
Thank you! there's more-

893
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,300
Neal and morty's show is over folks.

894
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,700
Thank you very much.

895
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,700
You' hey, hey!

896
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,700
Re out of order! you're out of order!

897
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,700
This whole dental practice is out of order!

898
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,200
Ok, that's enough.

899
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,700
He

900
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,200
Hey, get your hands off me.

901
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,700
Neal, neal! get your hands off me!

902
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,100
Leave me alone!

903
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,500
Excuse me.

904
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,500
See?

905
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Told you that thing would take him over.

906
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,300
Honey, what's going on?

907
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,300
I told him i didn't wanna do it.

908
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,700
Neal-
oh-

909
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,200
He asked for a comedy routine,

910
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,700
A-and that's what he got.

911
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,700
Neal, what's wrong?

912
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,200
Nothing.

913
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,700
You can tell me, it's all right.

914
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:42,200
No, i can't tell you. why?

915
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Because i don't wanna ruin your life.

916
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,200
Dad's cheating on you.

917
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
It's ok.

918
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,100
I'm sorry, mom.

919
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,100
Shh.

920
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,600
I'm sorry.

921
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,100
It's ok.

922
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,100
Why is it ok?

923
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,100
Marriage is a very complicated thing.

924
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,100
But there is nothing...

925
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:29,100
That is more important to
me than you and your brother.

926
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,500
Your father and i love you
more than anything in the world.

927
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,500
Now, he and i have got the rest of our lives

928
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,500
To work out our marriage,

929
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,500
But we've only got a couple more years

930
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,500
With you here.

931
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,100
Do you mean you know?

932
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Neal,we're working on it.

933
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,100
Shh.

934
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,100
But that's between me and your father.

935
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Nothing will ever change the fact
