Freaks and Geeks S01E01 Pilot (VO)

1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,797
Come on, ladies,
let's see some hustle.

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,127
Excuse me.
Is our little practice bothering you?

3
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:11,552
Get out of here.

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,391
All right, let's work.
Squib it, come on.

5
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,977
You seem so distant
these days, Brad.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,437
Is this something I did?

7
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,023
Cause if it is,
I want you to tell me.

8
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:24,812
Ashley, it's just...

9
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:28,353
I'm ready to work through whatever
It's that we need to work through.

10
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:30,328
But we need to communicate.

11
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:32,866
I need you to talk to me.

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,244
Ashley, it's just that I...

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,912
I love you so much...

14
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,540
It scares me.

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,430
Oh, man,
you wanna hear something way messed up?

16
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,433
You know that Molly Hatchet
shirt I was wearing the other day?

17
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,686
The one with the executioner guy
holding that bloody axe,

18
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,397
under his foot, the severed head...

19
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:06,653
That's my shirt.

20
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:09,026
Yeah, so...

21
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:12,113
My mom, she makes us go
to church every week.

22
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,573
I gotta dress up.

23
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,410
So I get there, and this stupid
priest says I can't come in.

24
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,747
You can't wear stuff like that
in church, man.

25
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,665
Why not, man, it's church!

26
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,335
Supposed to forgive people there.

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,255
"So, you hate my shirt,
forgive me, let me come in!"

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,175
Yeah, I believe in God, man.
I've seen him. I've felt his power.

29
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:36,262
Plays drums for Led Zeppelin
and his name is John Bonham!

30
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,146
Here you go, here you go.

31
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,941
"Hey, Lisa,
here are those biscuits you ordered."

32
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:50,994
"And here, Cinderella story..."

33
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,947
"A former greenskeeper..."

34
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,662
"50 yards!"

35
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:57,083
"It's in the hole!
It's in the hole!"

36
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,367
Damn Weir.

37
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,206
You really like Bill Murray,
don't you?

38
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,708
Yeah, he's great.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,668
Bill Murray sucks, man.

40
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,920
- No, he's cool.
- Really?

41
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,090
What's he, your boyfriend?

42
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,549
Sam Queer?

43
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,511
- It's fighting time, man.
- Leave me alone, Alan.

44
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,889
I'm sorry, I don't speak geek.

45
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,180
I've always wanted to know what
it's be like to fight a girl.

46
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:24,355
I'm a girl.

47
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:27,568
Wanna see what it'd
be like to fight me?

48
00:02:29,186 --> 00:02:31,067
Weir's sister has to protect him?

49
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,947
I'm not protecting him. Just trying to
figure out why you need to pick fights

50
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,366
with guys who weigh less
than 100 pounds.

51
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,993
Watch out, Alan.
I think she's high on pot.

52
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,247
Yeah, and I just go psycho
when I am.

53
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,540
Wanna try me?

54
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,754
You're dead, alright?

55
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,507
As soon as your freak sister
isn't around, I'm gonna cream you, man.

56
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,307
You know, you really didn't need to
do that. I could have handled it.

57
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,558
Yeah, I know.

58
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:07,429
And by the way, I weigh 103 pounds.

59
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,357
Sorry.

60
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,194
Man...

61
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:17,318
I hate high school.

1
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,800
I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation

2
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,700
Livin' in the past, it's a new generation

3
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Go and do what you want to do

4
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,200
And that's what i'm gonna do

5
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,000
And i don't give a damn
'bout my bad reputation

6
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

7
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Not me. Me, me, me, me

8
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,500
Whah! No!

9
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

10
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,500
Not me

11
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Me, me, me, me

12
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,300
I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation

13
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,400
I've never been afraid of any deviation

14
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,000
And i don't really care
if you think i'm strange

15
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,400
I ain't gonna change

16
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
And i'm never gonna care
'bout my bad reputation

17
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Not me!

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,793
You know, I ran into
Mrs. Patton today,

64
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,168
at Farmer Jack,

65
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,469
and she said she saw you smoking.

66
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,348
Well, she's crazy. Mom.

67
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,395
I can't believe it. You seriously
think I would start smoking?

68
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,274
I had a friend that used to smoke.

69
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,068
You know what he's doing now?

70
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,194
He's dead.

71
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,906
You think smoking
makes you look cool,

72
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,282
let's go dig him up now,
see how cool he looks.

73
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,826
Daddy, if i started smoking,
I would tell you.

74
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,538
Oh, good. Now I don't have to worry.

75
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,956
Hey, Dad.

76
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,376
They're showing <i>Monty Python
and the Holy Grail</i> {\at Parkway }Saturday night.

77
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,921
Neal, Bill and I are gonna
watch it twice in a row.

78
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:56,906
Great.

79
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,924
Sam, isn't the homecoming
dance Saturday night?

80
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:05,137
- Are you going?
- No, why would I do that?

81
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,591
- You're sister's going.
- No, I'm not!

82
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:08,766
Alright, kids.

83
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,102
High school is for learning.

84
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,522
But it's also where you should
be learning how to socialize.

85
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,150
That's what the high school
dances are all about.

86
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,947
No. It's a chance for popular
kids to experience sex in their cars.

87
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,072
Lindsay!

88
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,992
I mean, if that's what you want me
to do, then I'd be happy to go.

89
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,584
You know...

90
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,455
There was a girl in our school...

91
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:32,331
She had pre-marital sex.

92
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,501
You know what she did
on graduation day?

93
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,079
Died!

94
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,879
Of an overdose. Heroin.

95
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:41,216
Are any of your friends alive?

96
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,758
The smart ones.

97
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,177
I'm sure there are plenty
of kids who are just

98
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,335
dying for someone to ask them.

99
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,351
Mom, that's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

100
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,936
Honey, it's stupid
until you consider how happy

101
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,312
it'll make somebody
who really wants to go.

102
00:05:56,437 --> 00:05:57,981
Nobody I know wants to go.

103
00:05:58,106 --> 00:05:59,569
- Dad.
- Honey.

104
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,909
Great. No, that works out perfect.

105
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:05,204
I'm having a midnight madness
deer hunting sale at night,

106
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:08,029
and you can wait on
all those nice hunters.

107
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,286
Choice is yours.

108
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,503
Thanks, Carl.

109
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:26,186
Hey, Eli...
I think Carl needs a hug.

110
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,846
My buddy!

111
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,900
- You're such a jerk, man.
- Eli likes you. Congratulations.

112
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,742
- Hey, Mr. K.
- Mr. Schwieber.

113
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,118
It's Schweiber.

114
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,127
Mr. Bones, Mr. Spock,

115
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,463
may I join you here,
in the Enterprise vessel?

116
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,634
I'm so hungry I could eat a Tribble.

117
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,929
I don't get it. Who's that?

118
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,098
John Wayne.

119
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,437
Why does my mom always
put a note in my lunch?

120
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,105
It's so embarrassing.

121
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,359
At least she doesn't write it
on the bag.

122
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,032
Are you guys going to
the homecoming dance?

123
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,742
I really don't see that happening.

124
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,837
I'm sorry,
did I crush your Twinkies?

125
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:37,665
What did you do that for?

126
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,209
What are you gonna do,
go crying to your sister?

127
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,502
Sam Rear?

128
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,171
No. No, I'm not.

129
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,924
Mr. Kowchevski,
Alan smashed my Twinkies.

130
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,760
My God, you're such a woman.

131
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,975
Alan. You don't have anything better
to do than to squash Mr. Weir's dessert?

132
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,227
I was just bending down
to talk to him,

133
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,895
and I accidentally leaned on it.
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,482
Why don't you go
{\do the nice thing }and buy him some new ones?

135
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,775
Oh, yes, sir.

136
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,861
Thank you, Mr. Kowchevski.

137
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,280
Sam, want some advice?

138
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,740
Be a man.

139
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,371
You shouldn't let
Alan do that to you.

140
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,080
I don't see you doing anything!

141
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,543
My father tells me to stay out of
fights that don't affect me directly.

142
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:25,297
It'd be nice if you guys
backed me up once in a while.

143
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,382
My sister does and she's a girl.

144
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,010
Yes, but if we do,
Alan is gonna terrorize us, too.

145
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:36,438
Listen, you guys have got to help me.
He's never gonne leave me alone.

146
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,994
- Hey, Daniel.
- Hey, Lindsay.

147
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,579
What's up? Where you been?

148
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:54,943
I've been... around.

149
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,247
Come on, let's hit the patio.

150
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,958
The smoking patio?

151
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,048
It's all right, they don't bite.

152
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,181
Don't touch me.

153
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,394
I'm sorry.
Your butt was calling to me.

154
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,400
- Hey Nicholas, you got those M80's?
- Don't know, man, you got the money?

155
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,782
You guys know Lindsay?

156
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,536
You were in my English class
last year, right?

157
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,830
You're that chick who got an A.

158
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,833
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?

159
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,004
I don't know, what are you gonna do?

160
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,930
Are you guys going to
the homecoming dance?

161
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:00,683
I beg your pardon?

162
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,186
That's funny. That's a joke, right?

163
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,273
My dad's kind of making me go.

164
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,525
Your dad is making you
go to the dance?

165
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,235
What's that all about?

166
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,070
Who is your dad? Hitler?

167
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,491
I just thought maybe
you guys were gonna go.

168
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,502
To make fun of people.

169
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,664
- That could be funny, right?
- I would go...

170
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,291
but I have a prior engagement.

171
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,962
My cousin just sent me a bunch of
mushrooms and I'm gonna eat them.

172
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,841
Look. I mean, you know
they're gonna play disco, right?.

173
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,976
Disco sucks. I hate disco.

174
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,057
I'd rather make out
with Principal Farber.

175
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:42,764
Again?

176
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,686
Shut up, man.

177
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:54,654
Oh, my god, man.

178
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,532
I can't wait til
you're not paying attention.

179
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,326
- Check it out.
- What does she want?

180
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,999
- Linds!
- Friend of yours?

181
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:07,794
"Linds"?

182
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,129
I'll be right back, OK?

183
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,011
Millie, what are you doing out here?

184
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,679
What are <i>you</i> doing out here?

185
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,556
This place is for freaks.

186
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,849
Millie, go away.

187
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,646
Today is the deadline
to enter the Academic Decathlon.

188
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,022
Mr. Rosso said you didn't
turn up your application.

189
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,106
What? Millie, I'm not entering.

190
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:36,696
But you are our best mathlete.

191
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,157
Can we not talk
about this right now?

192
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,035
Lindsay, what's wrong with you?

193
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:47,040
There's nothing wrong with me. I just
don't wanna do Decathlon this year.

194
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,545
Aren't you at least gonna help the soda
refreshments at the homecoming dance?

195
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,046
We're trying to raise money to buy
the school computer.

196
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,595
Gentlemen, here's my advice.

197
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,431
Listen to Neal.

198
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,582
You should handle Alan

199
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:08,311
the same way Han Solo
dealt with Jaba the Hut.

200
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,981
- Avoid him.
- Just avoid him forever?

201
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,649
Just for 4 years.

202
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,071
There's Cindy Sanders.

203
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,073
Dream on, Sam.

204
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,785
- Oh, man.
- Hu-oh. Incoming.

205
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,748
Sam, I've been looking all over
for you. Is this your jacket?

206
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,170
You left it in science,
I didn't want it to get all dirty.

207
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:40,134
Thanks, Cindy.
That was really nice of you.

208
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:42,895
Yeah, well, I'll see you later.

209
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,142
Sam, you are so in.

210
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:50,014
What?

211
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,355
She brought you your jacket.

212
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,102
She saw it,

213
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,951
she remembered it was yours,

214
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,863
she picked it up
and carried it through the halls.

215
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,156
People probably saw her with it.

216
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,701
I wonder if she has
a date for the dance.

217
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,121
Cindy Sanders is
in love with you, man.

218
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,888
- Do you really think Cindy likes me?
- Hello... the jacket.

219
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,640
There's no way.
We're not her species.

220
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:31,765
Just do me a favor. Ask around,
see if she has a date for the dance...

221
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,773
Who should I ask?

222
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:38,526
OK, the dance is tomorrow.
She is a cheerleader.

223
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,155
You've seen Star Wars 27 times.
Do the math.

224
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:43,349
I know,

225
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:46,660
but my dad says the prettiest
girls usually don't get asked out

226
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,621
because guys are too afraid
to ask them.

227
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,541
Really? Maybe I should ask out
Farrah Fawcett Majors.

228
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,211
Maybe I should ask out Bill's mom!

229
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,006
- Oh, you better not!
- Just ask around, OK?

230
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,931
Don't even think about it.

231
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:10,092
- The chemistry exam you ordered.
- Alright, good job.

232
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,855
- Where are the answers?
- You just said to steal the test.

233
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,109
Good work, genius.
Why don't you use your brain?

234
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,237
Who's got gum?

235
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,828
Oh, yeah, that's real great.

236
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,457
Why don't you blow your nose in
some bread and make me a sandwich?

237
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:37,752
Why is everyone
calling up my butt today?

238
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,337
Because you're an moron?

239
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,962
Hey Kim, I got some.

240
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:43,633
What's she doing here?

241
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,884
She is our friend.

242
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:48,679
What, are you doing her? So she'll
help you with your math homework?

243
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,341
Lay off.

244
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:53,017
- Kim...
- I wasn't not talking to you, brain.

245
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,853
Don't you have a test or something?

246
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,980
Would you be cool? Please?

247
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,942
Did I do something to you?

248
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:02,985
You're here.

249
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,657
I have as much right
to be here as you do.

250
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,454
Hey, brain...

251
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,456
I shoplift in your daddy's store.

252
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,669
You're just some rich kid
who's trying to piss off her parents.

253
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:23,390
You think you can hang with these guys?
You think that's gonna make you cool?

254
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,094
I don't know what to tell you.

255
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,969
You know, I'm sorry.

256
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,559
Let's be friends.

257
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:41,357
There, now we're friends.
See you at the mall.

258
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,355
What are you, on your period?

259
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,071
If you wanna hang around with
your little poser friend here

260
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,281
and pretend with her,
that's your waste of time.

261
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,032
Just keep her away from me.

262
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,041
That is exactly why
I don't carry a purse.

263
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,422
I gotta get to shop class.

264
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,081
It's the only way I can pass it.
Here.

265
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:08,826
And... sorry.

266
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,223
Don't you have to get to class, too?

267
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,227
I'll survive.

268
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,402
These shorts aren't very flattering,
are they?

269
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,113
No, you look good.

270
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,535
How come your sister
is dressing so weird now?

271
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,621
What do you mean?

272
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,874
I mean, she's been wearing
your dad's army jacket.

273
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,335
I don't know.

274
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:46,256
She's been acting weird
ever since our grandma died.

275
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,385
You're dead, Weir.

276
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,267
- Alan?
- What?

277
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,604
What's the point of all this?

278
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,648
The point?

279
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,903
The point is, you're dead too.

280
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:10,822
Little man.

281
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,749
I kind of wish I didn't
come to school today.

282
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,883
Would you go to
homecoming dance with me?

283
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,602
I would,
but I already have a date, so...

284
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,478
Will you go to
homecoming dance with me?

285
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,900
- Eli, there a bee on your book.
- Where?

286
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,401
I'll get it.

287
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,905
What's the matter with you?
Jerk.

288
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,824
Sorry, didn't mean to upset
your husband.

289
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,664
What if he was my husband?
That's be some kind of joke to you?

290
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:05,126
It's no joke to me,
I think you two make a good couple.

291
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:08,755
Maybe we do.

292
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,427
Do you wanna go to
the homecoming dance with me?

293
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,804
Yes, I do, really, please.

294
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,681
I will go.

295
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,447
Alright, fellas,
I just wanna let you know

296
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,867
that in honor of the big
homecoming game tomorrow,

297
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,292
I'm gonna give you guys the day off.

298
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,122
Can we go home?

299
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,794
Schweiber, don't be an idiot.
We are going to do something fun.

300
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,756
I'm gonna let you guys...

301
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,049
play dodgeball.

302
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,027
Can somebody please tell me
what's supposed to be fun about this?

303
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,530
We just let ourselves get hit,
and we can sit down.

304
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:21,453
Let's just pretend to get hit.
Nobody will know.

305
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,079
I don't think we can.

306
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:26,875
Ladies, put down the mascara,
and get in there, play.

307
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:34,840
I can't take it, man,
I gotta get out of here!

308
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,842
Look, little man is running away!

309
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,429
Hey, only my mom
is allowed to call me that.

310
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,069
OK, now it's time to sneer Weir.

311
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,572
- Sam, get away from me.
- We need to stay together.

312
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,325
- Are you crazy?
- Hey, kid!

313
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,168
Soddleman, that's illegal.
You're out of it.

314
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,422
Schweiber, come on, walk it off.

315
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,849
Sit down, you nugglehead.

316
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:21,721
There's nowhere to hide, Weird.

317
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:25,099
Kid, get away from us.
That psycho is after you.

318
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,648
Nice throw, wuss.

319
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,448
He caught my ball! I'm out!

320
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,366
Go Sam! Go!

321
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,610
White, take a seat.
Come on Weir, throw it back.

322
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,657
Catch it, come on.

323
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,380
Dodgeball is kind of
a stupid game, isn't it?

324
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,465
You just signed your death warrant.

325
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:47,098
Man, that chick totally likes me.

326
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,351
It's funny.

327
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,107
That Jimmy Carter,
he's some president, right?

328
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,776
He's doing a hell of a job.

329
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,736
He's doing a hell of a job!

330
00:22:02,912 --> 00:22:06,784
But I'm a little concerned his handling
of the economy, aren't you?

331
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,584
I'm a little concerned. Maybe.

332
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:12,547
Maybe I'm a little concerned.

333
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:17,003
Come on, Eli. Give him a break. Look
what he has done in the Middle East.

334
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,546
In the Middle East.

335
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,507
The Middle East.
The middle of the East.

336
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,220
- You'd make a good president.
- President Eli?

337
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,472
OK! President Eli!

338
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:33,227
Hey, you guys, cut it out.
Leave him alone.

339
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,981
What? We're having
a political discussion.

340
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,481
Yes, we're political.

341
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,026
You don't have to talk to them,
they're just being mean.

342
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:42,988
No, but they're my friends.
My friends!

343
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:46,032
Yes, we are his buddies.
Isn't that right, Mr. President?

344
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,577
- No they're not, Eli.
- I'm making them laugh.

345
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,413
Yeah. Not this way.

346
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,750
There's a good kind of laughing
and a bad one. This is bad.

347
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,508
Eli, they're only laughing at you
because you are retarded.

348
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,338
I'm not retarded, I'm special.

349
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:04,884
- I'm special! Just special.
- Yeah, I know.

350
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,220
I'm sorry. I know you're special.

351
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,931
- They're being mean to you.
- I'm not retarded...

352
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,443
- You're retarded!
- I'm sorry!

353
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:15,937
I'm not retarded! I'm special!

354
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,272
I don't wanna go
to the dance with you!

355
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,899
Sorry!

356
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,620
And I'm the mean one?
How does that work?

357
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,148
What's going on here?

358
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:57,687
All I... I was trying
to do something nice

359
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,232
in this stupid school where
nothing nice ever happens

360
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,443
but instead,
Eli broke his arm and...

361
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:06,112
I feel like the biggest idiot
in the world.

362
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:10,200
No, why aren't you taking part
in the academic Decathlon?

363
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,288
We need you,
you are our best mathlete.

364
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,624
Oh, God, please don't say that word.

365
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,630
Are you having
some problems at home?

366
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,173
No, I'm not.

367
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,592
- Is it a boy?
- No.

368
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,136
You can tell me...

369
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,014
I know it seems square to actually talk
with your guidance counselor,

370
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,225
but I was a kid once, too.
And not that long ago.

371
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,562
Mr. Rosso, there is nothing to tell.

372
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,147
Trust me.

373
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,319
I see the problem here.

374
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,365
Let's just rap... as people. OK?

375
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:55,536
From now on,
I'm not Mr. Rosso, guidance counselor.

376
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,039
- You're not?
- No.

377
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:01,167
I'm just Jeff,
your friend who cares.

378
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,003
Jeff?

379
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,586
Exactly.

380
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,516
And you're not Ms. Weir,
high school student,

381
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:12,178
You're Lindsay, a girl
who seems like she needs a friend.

382
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,181
So, come on, Linds,

383
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:18,017
talk to your buddy Jeff.

384
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,190
I've never felt better
in all my life.

385
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,688
Then maybe someone
should tell your face.

386
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:37,454
Ah, yes, interesting problem...
Freshmen bullies.

387
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,457
He's obviously acting out of insecurity
in a new environment.

388
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,835
If you can disconnect emotionally,
it's really quite sad.

389
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,421
In his own way,
he's reaching out for a friend.

390
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:49,632
Not that you should feel sorry for him,
his kind should be destroyed.

391
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,093
So, what do we do?

392
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,471
I recommend the Cresman conundrum.

393
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,180
What the hell is that?

394
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,642
Tom Cresman, my freshman tormentor.

395
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,186
The idea was,
if you fight your bully,

396
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,565
afterwards, whether you win or lose,
they'll tend to leave you alone.

397
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,276
Did it work?

398
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,778
He broke my tailbone,
but the result was effective.

399
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:11,904
He got expelled.

400
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,449
- It's a good plan.
- It's a terrible plan.

401
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,243
I'm not fighting Alan,
he's not my tormentor.

402
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,581
I know every hall he takes to each
class. And I avoid those halls.

403
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:24,793
It's that simple. Just start living
at the janitor store, like I do.

404
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:30,884
- Are you looking for a fight, dork?
- No, sir.

405
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,301
Well, you're gonna get one!

406
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,436
Tell me about that stupid
Cresman conundrum.

407
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,701
Are you... I don't... Are you OK?

408
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:02,247
Is it just me
or does the whole world suck?

409
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,043
Alright, after class,
you and me are cutting out of here.

410
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,088
Cutting?

411
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,683
I've got something
to show you that...

412
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,720
it's gonna make you feel better.

413
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:26,021
I guess, the first thing we're
gonna do is get him on the ground.

414
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,482
How are we supposed to do that?
Cut his legs off?

415
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:32,109
Should I wear a cock for this?

416
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:35,113
That's between you
and your God, Bill.

417
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,167
Hey, geek.

418
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,421
Got a problem?

419
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,842
No, I was...

420
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,345
I was just looking
at a friend of mine.

421
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:02,642
Are you telling me that I look like
a friends of yours?

422
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,477
Kim, I think he likes you.

423
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,479
Is that true?

424
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,474
Do you like me?

425
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,610
Do you love me?

426
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:18,323
I like you like a friend.

427
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:19,947
I don't think so.

428
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,994
I think you <i>like me</i> like me.

429
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,706
I think you want to kiss me.

430
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:29,079
Do you wanna kiss me?

431
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,128
I don't know.

432
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:33,798
Come on.

433
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,927
Just one little kiss.

434
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:39,928
I'll be your girlfriend.

435
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,894
In your dreams, geek.

436
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,741
Maybe we should get <i>her</i>
to beat up Alan.

437
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,493
Go.

438
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,294
Wait for me, man.

439
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,879
Be prepared to have your mind blown!

440
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,178
Check it out, man.

441
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,961
That's fourteen mounted toms,

442
00:29:26,086 --> 00:29:29,853
eight floor toms,
four splashers, two gongs,

443
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:33,815
ten Caravelles, four rides,
five snares, man...

444
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,775
a roto tom rack!

445
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:39,777
And it's all mounted on my infamous
quadruple kick drums system.

446
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:43,449
Six more pieces, and I got a bigger kit
than Neal Perth drums from Rush.

447
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,078
That's great, Nick.

448
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:51,243
Look, these teachers
want us to work, you know?

449
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,048
And I say, fine. I'll work.

450
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:57,755
But you gotta let me do
the kind of work I want to do.

451
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:02,099
And for me, Lindsay,
it's my drum kit, man.

452
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,971
This is my passion, you know?

453
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,765
This is the essence of who I am now.

454
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:10,847
But before I had this,
I was lost, too.

455
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,521
You see what I'm saying?

456
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,445
You need to find...

457
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,609
your reason for living.

458
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:22,949
You gotta find your big,
gigantic drum kit, you know?

459
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:29,627
Maybe I'll buy a clarinet.

460
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:39,714
If you're not going to the dance,
I thought you could come over my house.

461
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,550
A bunch of guys who play guitar
are gonna come.

462
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,929
We're gonna try playing
"Dark side of the moon".

463
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,806
Just tell your dad you went.

464
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,891
I can't lie to my dad.

465
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:52,226
Really?

466
00:30:57,732 --> 00:31:00,110
Why don't you tell your dad
you got a date?

467
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:03,661
I'll put on a suit.

468
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,990
I'll come pick you up,

469
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:09,075
talk nice to your dad,
and then I'll take you to the school.

470
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,039
We can walk up to the door of the dance,
and then we can take off.

471
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,751
Then you can tell your dad you went.
You wouldn't be lying.

472
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,004
You'd really do that?

473
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,422
Absolutely.

474
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,056
Hello, there.

475
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:31,933
Hello Jeff.

476
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,352
Guess who's in trouble.

477
00:31:36,857 --> 00:31:37,857
Here's the deal.

478
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,945
If you get take part in
the academic Decathlon,

479
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,357
I'll forget this ever happened.

480
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,574
You're forcing me to a mathlete?

481
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:49,993
That is so not fair.

482
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:53,788
The world is not black and white.
It's gray.

483
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,082
And I really think
it'd be good for you.

484
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,627
I really do can't that.

485
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,883
Fine, Ms. Weir.

486
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,886
Maybe it's time for some tough love.

487
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,384
How about I call your parents?

488
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,183
And let them know
that their daughter is turning into

489
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,352
a burnout who skips class.

490
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,893
You know what,
I can't make you be a mathlete.

491
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:22,533
But I can make you work
the refreshment table

492
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,652
at the homecoming dance.

493
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:28,323
I'll see you Saturday at 7 pm.

494
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,574
<i>You know who used to cut class?</i>

495
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:32,118
Jimi Hendrix.

496
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:35,372
You know what happened to him?
He died!

497
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,123
Choking on his own vomit.

498
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:39,751
Dad, I skipped Latin.

499
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:43,547
Oh, I can understand why you
wouldn't want to learn about that.

500
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,257
It's only the building block
of our language.

501
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:50,595
I'm just glad your grandmother
wasn't alive to hear about this.

502
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,350
You can't cut corners in life.

503
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,019
You know who cut corners?
Kennedy.

504
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,605
Kennedy cut corners when
he was running the Bay of Pigs.

505
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:03,657
A lot of good men lost
their lives because of it.

506
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:07,111
You know who else cut corners?
Janis Joplin.

507
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,279
Dad!

508
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,907
What are you talking about?

509
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,826
You don't make any sense!

510
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,870
I just cut class and guess what?
Everybody's still alive.

511
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:17,704
Just leave me alone.

512
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:28,174
You understand what I'm saying,
don't you, Sam?

513
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,680
Good. Pass the rolls.

514
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:55,952
Can I come in?

515
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:07,046
Do you think that me,
Neal and Bill could beat up Alan?

516
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,426
Just Alan?

517
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,431
Alan and his buddies...

518
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,444
- No to maybe.
- That's what I thought.

519
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,900
Why are you throwing your life away?

520
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,072
Did Dad tell you to ask me that?

521
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,866
No, Millie did.

522
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:42,207
You tell her to mind
her own business.

523
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:48,255
Just because
she asked me to ask you,

524
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,215
doesn't mean I was gonna
tell her what you said.

525
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:02,807
They ever told you that I was
the only one with Grandma when she died?

526
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,640
No.

527
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:12,195
They went down to the cafeteria
to get some coffee.

528
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,157
Grandma looked so terrified.

529
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,202
I didn't know what to do.

530
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:25,704
She grabbed my hand,
and told me she didn't want to go.

531
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,218
She looked so scared, Sam.

532
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:32,674
So I said, "can you see...

533
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,052
God, or a heaven or a light
or anything?"

534
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:39,096
What did she say?

535
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:41,648
"No.

536
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,686
There is nothing."

537
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:50,942
She was a good person all her life,
and that's what she got.

538
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,159
So...

539
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:04,287
you do think we could beat up Alan?

540
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,259
He's a goner.

541
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,007
Where is Sam? It's almost 3 pm.
Alan is gonna be here soon.

542
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:58,927
I bet he forgot his math book.
I'm sure he is coming.

543
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,681
Collin! You came to help us?

544
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:04,516
No way, I just came to watch.

545
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:06,184
Should be exciting.

546
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,936
Because we are going to win?

547
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,402
Either way.

548
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,065
Oh, man, where is Sam?

549
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,861
Can't talk, gotta fight Alan.

550
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:30,542
Where is Sam? It's three o'clock.

551
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:34,045
Don't let Alan hit any
of your pressure points.

552
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,049
If he does, you're not gonna feel
anything but you'll drop dead in 3 days.

553
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:44,008
- My stomach hurts.
- Bill, you'll be fine.

554
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:46,936
No, it really hurts.
I think I should go home.

555
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,394
This is how Houdini died.

556
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:51,938
Always guard your face.

557
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:54,983
If he hits in the nose, it could
drive the nose bone into your brain.

558
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,943
Then you'll release
your bowels and die.

559
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,695
Shut up, would you.

560
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,906
He's right. There are a lot
of ways to die in a fight.

561
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:05,160
Maybe we should put this off.

562
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,453
There is Sam.

563
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:13,501
Stop, you moron!
It's not Sam, it's Alan!

564
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:18,791
- So, what are you doing?
- Just going home.

565
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:21,634
- And you?
- I'm cheerleading the game.

566
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:26,890
Well, you're dressed for it.

567
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,602
What are you losers
doing on my street?

568
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:34,725
- Nothing.
- We're kind of here to beat you up.

569
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:38,235
- Really?
- He is just kidding.

570
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,194
I'm not talking to you, dork.

571
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:44,410
- What are you laughing at, pinhead?
- I'm just here to watch.

572
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:46,534
Really? Well, watch this.

573
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,842
You are so dead!

574
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:12,310
I gotta get out there. I'll see you!

575
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:13,811
See you.

576
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,445
I was wondering...

577
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,762
Do you wanna go to
the homecoming dance with me?

578
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,725
I'm already going with Dan Lewis,
he asked me two weeks ago.

579
00:39:58,516 --> 00:40:02,193
I just thought I would ask just in case
you didn't have anyone to go.

580
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:07,115
I gotta go, so I'll see you.

581
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,244
If you're there,
I'll save a dance for you.

582
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,750
See you.

583
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,790
That could be good.

584
00:40:25,307 --> 00:40:27,385
Get off me, you psycho!

585
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:34,356
You ripped my shirt.
You're gonna buy me a new shirt!

586
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:37,020
You guys are all dead, man!
Really dead!

587
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:45,075
I got punched in the nose,
but I'm still alive.

588
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,240
I guess the nose bone
must have missed my brain.

589
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,115
Yeah, my stomach
does not hurt anymore.

590
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:52,451
Mine does.

591
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:58,291
Did you see me? I was taunting him.
He was terrified.

592
00:40:59,078 --> 00:41:02,668
Did you see me? I had his arms.
Totally shut him down.

593
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:04,506
I had his shoes.

594
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,135
Wait a minute.

595
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:12,180
You guys fought Alan.

596
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:14,391
No, we got hit by a car.

597
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:18,061
I'm so sorry.
I was talking to Cindy.

598
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:22,816
- You stood up for me.
- You should see how he looks.

599
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,359
We tore his shirt.

600
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:26,736
So what did she say?

601
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:29,989
She's got a date.
But she's saving a dance for me.

602
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:31,449
So you're going?

603
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,829
You got a slow dance.

604
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:38,248
Yes, definitely slow.

605
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:42,039
Thanks. You know,
I'll be there the next time.

606
00:41:42,164 --> 00:41:45,004
Oh, God,
I hope there's not a next time.

607
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:11,364
Look, I know you're not
happy about this, but...

608
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:13,992
don't make me the bad guy, here.

609
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:18,660
If the worst thing in your life was
somebody making you to go to a dance,

610
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:21,750
then I'd say you have
a pretty good life.

611
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:19,557
I was wondering...

612
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,901
You said you would save
a dance for me, so...

613
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:25,563
can I have it now?

614
00:43:28,853 --> 00:43:30,776
I mean, if you're not busy.

615
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:33,446
I'm not busy.

616
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:14,696
Come on, Sam.

617
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:53,902
What are you thinking about,
Lindsay?

618
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:56,780
I think I'm gonna dance with Eli.

619
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:59,032
I'll be right back, Jeff.

620
00:44:59,157 --> 00:45:00,241
Oh, Linds...

621
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:03,620
Maybe you should start
calling me Mr. Rosso again.

622
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:57,299
That's the perfect couple.

623
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,009
They've got some chemistry.

624
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:00,801
- Shut up.
- What did I do?
