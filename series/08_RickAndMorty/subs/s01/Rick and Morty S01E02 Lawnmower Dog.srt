1
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,910
Coin collecting is considered
the perfect hobby.

2
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:35,829
Beautiful putt right there...

3
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:36,746
Good birdie.

4
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:39,126
That's only the...
eighth birdie of the day.

5
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,628
What?

6
00:00:40,713 --> 00:00:41,754
Why are you looking at me?

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,424
You want to go outside?

8
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:44,718
Outside?

9
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:49,016
Outside?

10
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:55,694
Are you kidding me?! Come on!

11
00:00:55,778 --> 00:00:56,654
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:57,739
W-what's wrong?

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,741
Your idiot dog!

14
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:00,535
Oh, he...
he didn't mean it, Dad.

15
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,454
D-did you, Snuffles?

16
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:02,413
You're a good boy.

17
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,166
Don't praise him now, Morty!

18
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,126
He just peed on the carpet!

19
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,211
Bad dog! Bad!

20
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:07,212
Morty, come on.

21
00:01:07,213 --> 00:01:08,214
I need your help tonight.

22
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,967
Hey, wait, hold on a second,
Rick.

23
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:12,573
You wouldn't by any chance have
some sort of crazy science thing

24
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,266
you could whip up that might
help make this dog a little

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,602
smarter, would you?

26
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:17,146
I thought the whole point
of having a dog was to

27
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,397
feel superior, Jerry.

28
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:19,691
If I were you,
I wouldn't pull that thread.

29
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:20,985
Come on, Morty.

30
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,823
Listen, Rick, if you're
gonna stay here rent-free

31
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:26,035
and use my son for
your stupid science,

32
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,581
the least you could do is
put a little bit of it to use

33
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:29,832
for the family.

34
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,753
You make that dog smart or...

35
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:32,670
Morty's grounded!

36
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:34,173
Ha-ha! Aw, man!

37
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:37,011
Boy, you really got me up
against a wall this time, Jerry.

38
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:43,418
All right, Ruffles...
What's his name?

39
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:44,315
Snuffles.

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,693
Snuffles, shake.

41
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:48,571
Roll over.

42
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:51,618
Go to the bathroom.

43
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:54,289
- Holy crap!
- No way.

44
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:57,253
Yeah, you're at the top
of your game now, Jerry.

45
00:01:57,337 --> 00:01:58,212
Have fun.

46
00:01:58,296 --> 00:01:59,130
Come on, Morty.

47
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:00,341
That was fantastic, Rick!

48
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:01,885
Yeah, Morty, if you

49
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,638
like that, boy, you're... you're
really going to flip your lid

50
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:04,556
over this one.

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,016
W-w-w-what is it?

52
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:08,521
It's a device, Morty, that
when you put it in your ear,

53
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,148
you can enter
people's dreams, Morty.

54
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,354
It's just like that movie that
you keep crowing about.

55
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:13,946
You talking about "Inception"?

56
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,782
That's right, Morty.
This is gonna be a lot like

57
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,911
that, except, you know, it's
gonna maybe make sense.

58
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:19,246
"Inception" made sense.

59
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,832
You don't have to
try to impress me, Morty.

60
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,794
Listen, tonight we're gonna go
into the home of your math teacher,

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,964
Mr. Goldenfold, and
we're g... we're gonna incept

62
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:28,011
the idea in his brain to give
you A's in math, Morty.

63
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:29,555
That way you can, you know...

64
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,000
y-you're gonna help me with my
science, Morty, all the time.

65
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,686
Geez, Rick, in the time it
took you to make this thing,

66
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,813
couldn't you have just,

67
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:36,441
you know, helped me
with my homework?

68
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:37,776
Are you listening to me, Morty?

69
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,862
Homework is stupid.

70
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:40,531
The whole point is
to get less of it.

71
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:42,200
J-J... come on,
let... j...

72
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:43,828
let's just get over there
and deal with this thing.

73
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,539
W-we're gonna incept
your teacher.

74
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,001
Y-y-y-y-y-you're
frustrating me.

75
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:53,302
You don't know me!

76
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:56,515
Nice, Mrs. Pancakes...
real nice.

77
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,562
Next week on "The Days And
Nights Of Mrs. Pancakes"...

78
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:01,732
You don't know me!

79
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:04,320
Then let me get to know you,
damn it!

80
00:03:04,404 --> 00:03:05,989
Uh-oh! Spoilers!

81
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,909
I'm a full season behind.

82
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:09,536
Wow, Rick, I can't believe
we're sitting around,

83
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,957
standing around in
Mr. Goldenfold's house.

84
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,042
It's really weird.

85
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,838
It's about to get a whole
lot weirder, Morty.

86
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,769
Wheat Thins. Wheat Thins.

87
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:26,021
I'll take two.

88
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,066
Oh, I think you've
had enough, sir.

89
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,151
You don't know me.

90
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:33,534
All right, Morty,
time to make our move.

91
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:35,328
Make it bounce.

92
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,455
No, you didn't.

93
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,415
Oh, jiggle it now.

94
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:38,625
You better stop with that.

95
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,878
Allahu Akbar!

96
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:42,484
We're gonna take control
of this plane!

97
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:44,552
We're gonna 9/11 it unless
Morty Smith gets better grades

98
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:45,511
in math!

99
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:46,836
Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!

100
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,224
The name's not buddy.

101
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:49,727
It's Goldenfold.

102
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:51,354
Nice to wheat you!

103
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,528
Take cover, Morty!

104
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,451
Ooh!

105
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:01,656
Goldenfold's got more control
here than I anticipated.

106
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:02,748
I mean, the guy teaches
high-school math.

107
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,711
L-I-I-l didn't take him
for an active dreamer.

108
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:07,672
We got to take him out
so he wakes up, Morty.

109
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:09,091
But we can't get killed.

110
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:10,510
If you get killed in
someone else's dream,

111
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,138
you die for real, Morty.

112
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:13,303
What?! Are you kidding me?!

113
00:04:13,308 --> 00:04:14,308
Ohhhhhh!

114
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:15,685
Don't be a baby!

115
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,688
You avoid getting shot in real
life all the time, Morty.

116
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:19,650
Just do the same thing here,
and we'll be fine!

117
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:21,737
Now bring me my slippers.

118
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:25,493
Now, be my footstool, Snuffles.

119
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:27,079
This is what I'm talking about.

120
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,082
This is a dog.

121
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,084
Oh, yeah.

122
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:31,878
This should play out just fine.

123
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,633
You said the same thing,
equally sarcastically,

124
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,219
at our wedding and guess what.

125
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:46,026
Oh, my God.

126
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:47,278
He's trying to tell
us something.

127
00:04:47,363 --> 00:04:48,697
That is so awesome.

128
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:53,831
Aw, he's saying
"I love lasagna."

129
00:04:57,754 --> 00:04:59,339
He's saying
"I love Obama."

130
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,758
So cute!

131
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,887
I'm posting this online,
like, right now.

132
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:04,390
I should call Bob Saget.

133
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:05,724
Is that still a thing?

134
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:17,076
Hmm?

135
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:26,425
Goldenfold, we're coming out!

136
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:27,510
We just want to talk!

137
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:28,971
Why would I negotiate with you?

138
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,726
Because we're both rational
adults that don't want anything

139
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,810
bad to happen.

140
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:34,229
And because I
have a human shield.

141
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:35,315
Mrs. Pancakes!

142
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:39,697
Oh, no, Morty.

143
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:40,990
His subconscious is panicking.

144
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,576
Run!

145
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,341
Relax, Morty.

146
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:52,175
Look!

147
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,460
Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute.

148
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,596
Come on!

149
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,974
Hey, you don't know me!

150
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,435
Oh, no, Rick, look!

151
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,896
Goldenfold landed the plane,

152
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,025
and he's created a mechanical
arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes

153
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:04,862
out of the air while he lets us
fall into a giant vat of lava!

154
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,156
Pretty concise, Morty.

155
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,034
Looks like we've merely
prolonged the inevitable.

156
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,203
That's it, Morty!

157
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:10,413
Prolonging the inevitable!

158
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:12,291
Listen, if we go into Mrs.
Pancakes' dream,

159
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,503
everything will go
100 times slower, Morty.

160
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,047
That'll buy us some time to
figure this out!

161
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,132
You don't know m...

162
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:21,765
All right, let's go.

163
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,112
Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.

164
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:31,864
Don't judge, Morty.

165
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:32,950
Okay.

166
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:34,494
All right, well...

167
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:35,913
Look, Mrs. Pancakes
is right over there.

168
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:37,541
I'll just go ask her to tell
Goldenfold not to kill us

169
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,918
when she wakes up.

170
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:41,524
Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to
incepting is making people think

171
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:42,757
they came up with the idea.

172
00:06:42,842 --> 00:06:44,218
Listen to me.

173
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,764
If we're gonna incept Mrs.
Pancakes, we have to blend.

174
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:48,726
I'll talk to you after lunch.

175
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:51,814
Ooh, hey!

176
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,026
Ooh, oh!

177
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,236
Oh, man.

178
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:57,239
- Come and join us.
- I'm sorry. No, no.

179
00:06:57,324 --> 00:06:58,700
- Ooh, come here!
- No, thanks!

180
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,161
Ooh, wow!
Come over here, baby!

181
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:01,538
No, I'm okay.

182
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,543
Whoa!

183
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:06,087
Summer?!

184
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:07,255
Hey, there, stranger.

185
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,966
What do you think
of these things?

186
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,845
Ohh! Oh! Gross!

187
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,013
Gross!

188
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,307
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

189
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,851
What's the matter with you,
Morty? Calm down!

190
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,395
You're kind of killing
the vibe in here.

191
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,481
It's S-S-S-Summer!

192
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:18,983
Aw, geez.

193
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,403
Looks like Goldenfold has some
predilections so shameful he

194
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:23,406
buries them in the dreams
of the people in his dreams,

195
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,827
including a pervy attraction
to your underage sister.

196
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,413
Can you blame him?

197
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:28,874
Come on, old man, little boy.

198
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,629
Let's make an
inter-generational sandwich.

199
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:33,590
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

200
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:35,115
Put some clothes on,
for pete's sake!

201
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:36,219
This is disgusting!

202
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:37,179
I'm gonna puke!

203
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:39,015
I can't take it, Rick!

204
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,229
Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure
chamber are punishable by death!

205
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:43,439
Off with their heads!

206
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:45,985
Time to go another
dream deep, Morty!

207
00:07:53,415 --> 00:07:55,083
What the hell?

208
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:58,046
Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream
version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream

209
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,426
version of a Centaur be dreaming

210
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,053
about a scary place
like this, Rick?

211
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:03,012
Geez, I don't know, Morty.

212
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:04,258
Wha-what do you want from me?

213
00:08:07,146 --> 00:08:09,106
Welcome to your nightmare,
bitch!

214
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,192
Oh, here we go!

215
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:12,653
Holy crap!

216
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:15,074
Looks like some sort of legally
safe knock-off of an '80s horror

217
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,911
character with miniature swords
for fingers instead of knives.

218
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,915
I'm Scary Terry.

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,169
You can run,
but you can't hide, bitch!

220
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:25,883
Whoa! Hey, buddy.

221
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,510
What you got going on there?

222
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:29,013
Snuffles fix.

223
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:30,348
Make better.

224
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:32,603
Humans understand Snuffles now?

225
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,981
That... is... awesome!

226
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:37,402
Snuffles want to be understood.

227
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:39,864
Snuffles need to be understood.

228
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:41,492
Okay, yeah.

229
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,244
I get what Beth
was talking about.

230
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:44,413
Fun's over.

231
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:45,707
Whoa, Dad, you can't, like,

232
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,002
endow a creature with
sentience and then rip it away.

233
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:48,921
Why not?

234
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:49,838
I don't know.

235
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:52,468
It's Indian giving.

236
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:55,306
A sophisticated predator,
nature's perfect killing

237
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,853
machine, the vicious wolf
stalks its prey with purpose

238
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,439
and skill.

239
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:03,319
It was only with years of
selective breeding and genetic

240
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:07,116
altering that this noble beast
was transformed into man's

241
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,996
subservient little buddy.

242
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,465
Aw! Oh, my God!

243
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,428
He recognizes the
other dogs on TV.

244
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:22,433
# "A," "B" #

245
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:24,186
# His name is Scary Terry #

246
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,314
# "C," "D" #

247
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,567
# He's very scary #

248
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,069
Holy crap!

249
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,947
We have to escape into
someone else's dreams, Morty!

250
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:32,449
Ohhhhh!

251
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:35,121
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

252
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:36,582
# "E," "F" #

253
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,127
# He'll design your death #

254
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,504
The little girl!

255
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:44,093
Huh?

256
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,223
# "J," "K,"
He'll really ruin your day #

257
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:48,684
Are you kidding me?
This again?

258
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,645
Oh, man, it looks like we've
hit dream bedrock here, Morty.

259
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,731
Oh, geez, Rick.

260
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:52,816
W-w-whoa, this isn't good.

261
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,194
Nothing but fear from
here on out, bitch!

262
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,155
Ohhhh!

263
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:57,072
Holy crap, Morty.

264
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:58,366
He can travel through dreams.

265
00:09:58,451 --> 00:09:59,994
He can travel through dreams!

266
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:01,496
We're so screwed!

267
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:12,681
Where are my testicles, Summer?

268
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:17,689
Where are my testicles, Summer?

269
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:18,775
They were removed.

270
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:20,361
Where have they gone?

271
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,030
Oh, wow.

272
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:24,534
That's an intense line of
questioning, Snuffles.

273
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:26,120
Do not call me that!

274
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,459
"Snuffles" was my slave name.

275
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:32,756
You shall now call me Snowball
because my fur is pretty

276
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,965
and white.

277
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,263
Okay, Snowball,
just calm down, okay?

278
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:38,348
You're scaring me.

279
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:39,642
Scaring you?

280
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:43,398
Tell me, Summer, if a human
was born with stumpy legs,

281
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,485
would they breed it with
another deformed human

282
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:48,782
and put their children on
display like the Dachshund?

283
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:49,741
Uhhh...

284
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:50,660
Hey.

285
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:52,413
Oh, wow.

286
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:54,258
Okay, is... is...
is everything okay in here?

287
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,753
Jerry, come to rub my
face in urine again?

288
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:58,214
No!

289
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:02,721
No, we were... uh, just seeing
if Summer wanted to ...uh...

290
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:05,976
Go on, um, one of our famous
midnight family walks!

291
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:07,353
Yeah. Totally.

292
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:08,439
Let's go.

293
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:14,991
You will walk when it
is time to walk.

294
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,793
What are we here for again?
Incepting?

295
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:24,089
We're trying to incept
me to get an "A" in math?

296
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:25,258
Oh, yeah.

297
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,387
Buckle up, bitch!

298
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:32,269
Man, he sure says "Bitch" a lot!

299
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:34,940
You can run,
but you can't hide, bitch!

300
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:37,027
Hold on, Morty.
Y-you know what?

301
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,447
He keeps saying we can
run but we can't hide.

302
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:40,699
I say we try hiding.

303
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,160
But that's the
opposite of what...

304
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,163
Yeah, well, since when are
we taking this guy's advice on anything?

305
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:45,248
Hey, you know what?

306
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:46,810
You got a really
good point there, Rick.

307
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:49,547
Like, if the truth was that we
could hide, it's not like

308
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:51,759
he'd be sharing that
information with us, you know?

309
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:54,305
I-I-I think it's a good idea,
Rick.

310
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,389
Worst-case scenario...

311
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,934
we're back to running.

312
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:03,152
Wow, you know what?

313
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:04,988
I mean, it looks like we could
have just hid this whole time.

314
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:06,449
Boy, Rick,
that was some good thinking.

315
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:07,952
Thanks, Morty.

316
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:09,704
Yeah, it's nice to be on the
same page every once in a while.

317
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,624
You can run...

318
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,587
but you can't hide!

319
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:19,387
Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that.

320
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:20,639
He's getting sleepy.

321
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,684
Just a little bit longer
before he calls it a day.

322
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:24,311
That's when we make our move.

323
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,285
Snuffles, we didn't
mean you any harm!

324
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:35,371
This is a huge misunderstanding.

325
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,249
Dad, he wants to
be called Snowball.

326
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:38,668
Well, I'm not calling him that.

327
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:39,795
That's ridiculous.

328
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,091
You're being very
aggressive, Jerry.

329
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:44,928
Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps
will solve that problem

330
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:46,347
with a bit of surgery.

331
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,354
You think you can control
me with a haircut?

332
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,537
Hi, honey. You're home early.
How was your day?

333
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:01,915
I don't want to talk about it!

334
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,709
Oh, of course. You never
want to talk about it.

335
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:05,211
Get off my back, bitch!

336
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:09,677
Out there.
Not in here.

337
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:12,641
Yeah, I know, I know.

338
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,271
I shouldn't take my anger
out on you or Scary Brandon.

339
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:17,857
I love you, Melissa.

340
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,860
I love you, too, Terry.

341
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:22,615
Morty, this is perfect.

342
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:23,992
After a little scary coitus,

343
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:26,621
they should be fast asleep
and then we'll incept him.

344
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:33,131
Looks like Scary Terry's
having a nightmare.

345
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:34,425
Oh, boy, Rick.

346
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,805
I can only imagine what horrible
things must, you know...

347
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,392
scare Scary Terry.

348
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:42,355
Oh, no!

349
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:43,732
I'm late to class, bitch!

350
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,193
Oh, no!

351
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:46,779
I'm not wearing any pants!

352
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:51,912
Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't
you tell the whole class

353
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,292
the proper wordplay to use when
one is chasing one's victim

354
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,588
through a pumpkin patch?

355
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:59,633
Oh... um...

356
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:00,593
"Bitch."

357
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:03,597
Oh, come on, Terry,
you can't think of a pun

358
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:06,269
involving pumpkins, bitch?

359
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:07,521
Hey, leave him alone!

360
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:08,982
Yeah, this is a
bunch of bullcrap.

361
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:11,862
Who cares what stupid pun you
make when you kill someone?

362
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:14,027
Why don't you let the poor guy
say whatever he wants?

363
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,826
Well, I never!

364
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,164
I-I see no reason to
stand here and take this.

365
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:21,627
You're putting too much pressure
on yourself, Scary Terry.

366
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:24,674
You know, I mean, y-you're
perfectly scary enough as it is.

367
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,513
Hey, yo, Scary T., don't even
trip about your pants ...dawg.

368
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:30,058
Here's a pair on us, fool.

369
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:32,061
Aww, bitch.

370
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:33,563
I don't know what to say.

371
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:34,565
You don't need to say anything.

372
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:35,649
We got you, dawg.

373
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,526
You're our boy, dawg.

374
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,071
Don't even trip.

375
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:47,544
Oh, hey, it's you guys!

376
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,008
I haven't seen him
this relaxed in years.

377
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:53,971
If you guys ever need anything,
just say the word.

378
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:55,432
As a matter of fact, Terry,

379
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,158
there is something
you could help us with.

380
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:00,649
# "Q," "R,"
You won't get very far #

381
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,151
I always hated that song!

382
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:09,121
These halves don't
belong together, bitch!

383
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,047
Sex is sacred!

384
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:24,521
This is because you don't give
Morty Smith good grades, bitch!

385
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,903
Holy crap! God damn!

386
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:33,411
I know one thing for sure...
I'm giving Morty an "A" in math,

387
00:15:33,495 --> 00:15:35,372
and that's my idea.

388
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,584
That is an original thought.

389
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:44,762
What the hell?

390
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:47,308
Out of the frying pan dot,
dot, dot, huh, Morty?

391
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:48,852
Oh, man, what's going on?

392
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:51,106
Well, it's possible that
your dog became self-aware

393
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:53,234
and made modifications on
the cognition amplifier,

394
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,237
then turned on Jerry, Beth,
and Summer after learning

395
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,450
about humanity's cruel
subjugation of his species,

396
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,578
but your guess is as
good as mine, Morty.

397
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:02,708
I can't believe how
mean Snuffles got just

398
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,252
because he's smart.

399
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:07,257
- This is why I choose to get C's.
- Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.

400
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,175
Dad!

401
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,260
Rick!

402
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,057
Oh, thank God, Morty.

403
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:13,141
Oh, you're welcome.

404
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,602
All right,
let's get out of here.

405
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:17,148
If we hurry we can set
up camp in a sewer tunnel

406
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,194
or something before the dogs
completely take over.

407
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:20,070
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

408
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:21,154
We're not going anywhere.

409
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,240
This is my house.

410
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,283
I'm not abandoning it.

411
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:24,619
It's all over, Jerry.

412
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:26,705
The dogs are on a path
to total world domination.

413
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,502
But, hey, at least they know not
to piss on your carpet, right?

414
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:30,670
Wait a minute.

415
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:31,755
I have an idea.

416
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,304
Gentlemen,
a moment of your time.

417
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,434
See that?

418
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,312
I'm peeing all over
your special guns.

419
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:43,399
That means I own them.

420
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,948
Bad person. Bad.

421
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,450
Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

422
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:51,120
Bring the boy to me.

423
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:56,629
You were always kind to me,
Morty.

424
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:59,133
That's why I will leave
you with your testicles.

425
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:03,307
From now on, you will be my best
friend and live by my side.

426
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:04,851
Th-thanks, Snuffles.

427
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,817
Begin phase two.

428
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:11,820
Fighting continues as the dog

429
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:14,073
army captures the
Eastern seaboard.

430
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,120
It appears clear at this time
that the era of human

431
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,208
superiority has come
to a bitter end.

432
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,008
Please! Please don't kill me!

433
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,137
What's she saying, Bill?

434
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:29,891
I think she's saying,
"I love lasagna."

435
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,591
Mmm.

436
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:52,219
Thank you, Fido.

437
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,640
Rick!

438
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:55,766
I thought you were dead!

439
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:56,768
No, no, no,
I was just playing dead.

440
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:58,020
Good news, though, Morty.

441
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,147
This whole thing's
gonna be over really soon.

442
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:00,023
What?

443
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:01,109
It's a dream, Morty.

444
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,319
We're in your dog's dream.

445
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:03,644
The night the dogs captured us,

446
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:05,908
after you cried and
crapped your pants, we...

447
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:07,327
we all went to sleep.

448
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:09,497
Then I used my dream inceptors
to put the two of us inside

449
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:10,707
Snuffles' dream.

450
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:12,335
But I-it's been
like a whole year!

451
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,879
It's been six hours.

452
00:18:13,964 --> 00:18:16,091
Dreams move one one-hundredth
the speed of reality,

453
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:18,178
and dog time is
one-seventh human time.

454
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,064
So, you know, every day
here is like a minute.

455
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,643
It's like "Inception," Morty, so
if it's confusing and stupid,

456
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,354
then so is everyone's
favorite movie.

457
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,440
Aw, man.

458
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:26,817
I really liked this life.

459
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:29,237
Well, at least I didn't
really crap my pants.

460
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,324
No, no, that happened before
you went to sleep, Morty.

461
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:33,286
You're sleeping in
your crap right now.

462
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,080
Out of all the things that
happened to you,

463
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:36,666
that was the only real
thing that, you know,

464
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,210
is that you crapped your pants.

465
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:39,838
I mean, it's a mess out there.

466
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:42,509
I got some on my hands, Morty,
and then I got it on the dream

467
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:44,345
inceptor, and a piece
fell in my mouth.

468
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,598
Aw, man, geez!

469
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:46,849
Seriously?

470
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,351
Look, d-d-d-don't
worry about it, Morty.

471
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:49,729
Here, here take these, Morty.

472
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:50,647
Take these.

473
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:53,444
Are these pills supposed
to wake me up, or something?

474
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:54,778
Close.

475
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:55,947
It's gonna make your
kidneys shut down.

476
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:57,074
What?!

477
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,285
It's necessary for the plan,
Morty.

478
00:18:58,369 --> 00:18:59,871
Don't even trip, dawg.

479
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,877
It's pretty bad,
Emperor Snowball.

480
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,562
We're gonna need to do another
operation.

481
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:06,632
Anything.

482
00:19:06,674 --> 00:19:08,635
Anything for my precious Morty.

483
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,800
Sir, as your accountant,
I must advise you that these

484
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:13,726
medical expenses are putting you
in serious financial jeopardy.

485
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,437
You could lose your Kingdom.

486
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,900
To hell with my Kingdom,
Bean Counter.

487
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:21,822
I would trade it all for my
human's health and happiness.

488
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:23,826
Do you think they would
have done this for us?

489
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:26,038
We are not them!

490
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,754
We are not... them.

491
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:39,393
Assemble the troops.

492
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,271
I've made a decision.

493
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:44,986
Taking over the human's world
will lead to nothing but more heartbreak,

494
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,197
more cruelty.

495
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:50,619
Instead, we will go to a new
world and colonize it with a

496
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:53,624
society of intelligent dogs...

497
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:57,380
one that will not make the same
mistakes as humanity and one

498
00:19:57,465 --> 00:20:00,010
where pet insurance
will be mandatory.

499
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:01,596
I'm gonna miss you, Snowball.

500
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,270
You can call me Snuffles, Morty,
and I'm going to miss you, too,

501
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:07,939
very much.

502
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,913
Jerry?

503
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:19,124
I'm sorry.

504
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,294
It's just like the end of
"Old Yeller."

505
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,256
Oh, Jerry.

506
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,925
You mean because it
had dogs in it.

507
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,052
Wow!

508
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:29,098
A whole world populated
by intelligent dogs.

509
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:30,017
I wonder what it'll
be like, Rick.

510
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:31,519
I think it will be great, Morty.

511
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:33,564
You know, it's g... i-i-i-i-it
could be developed in-into a

512
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,569
very satisfying project
for people of all ages.

513
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:39,324
I mean, I'd watch it, Morty,
for at least 11 minutes a pop.

514
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:41,285
You know, may-maybe they'll
do it board-driven.

515
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,873
You know, that's a real
comforting idea, Rick.

516
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:46,293
What do you know, Morty?

517
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,379
What do you know?

518
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:19,514
Hi, guys.

519
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:21,100
I'm your new teacher
for Scary class.

520
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:23,019
My name is Scary Mr. Johnson.

521
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,356
Uh, actually, you know what?

522
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,318
That's my dad's name,
so why don't you just

523
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,655
call me Scary Glenn, yeah?

524
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,618
So, anyway, I understand your
previous teacher was having you

525
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,663
work on Fundamentals of Fear.

526
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:36,416
Which is... what is that?

527
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,793
You know?

528
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:39,337
So, uh, here...
here's what I say...

529
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:43,052
You can't learn anything until
you learn ...how to chill.

530
