1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,672
So, Dad, guess what tomorrow is.

2
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:05,716
Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday.

3
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:08,261
No.
Well, it... might be.

4
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:09,430
- It is.
- Fine.

5
00:00:09,515 --> 00:00:12,185
But also, tomorrow is your
one-year anniversary

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,561
back in our lives.

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,857
I'm gonna make you
flying-saucer-shaped pancakes.

8
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:17,610
Oh, t-t-there's no need
to do that, Beth.

9
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:19,071
Regular pancakes are fine.

10
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:27,876
Oh, my god!
Oh, what is happening?!

11
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:02,223
Happy anniversary, Dad.

12
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:03,600
Oh, I get it.

13
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:06,438
Regular pancakes are already
shaped like flying saucers.

14
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:08,274
Mmm. l-I should be
making you breakfast

15
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:10,152
for putting up with me.

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,281
You should be making us
a whole restaurant.

17
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,409
Nonsense. We couldn't be
happier to have you around.

18
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:16,496
I just wish I got
to see more of you.

19
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,128
Rick Sanchez of Earth
dimension C-137,

20
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:23,715
you are under arrest for crimes
against alternate Ricks

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,845
by the authority of the
Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks.

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,765
- Hey! What the heck?!
- Neutralize the Jerry.

23
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:31,102
- Wait! No! I'll...
- Dad!

24
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:32,480
- Dad!
- Rick!

25
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:34,066
Everybody, relax.

26
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,027
If I know these a-holes,
and I am these a-holes,

27
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:37,738
they just want to haul me
to their stupid clubhouse

28
00:01:37,823 --> 00:01:39,449
and waste my time
with a bunch of questions.

29
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:42,078
- Let's get it over with.
- Bring his Morty.

30
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:44,290
- Oh, man.
- Leave my Morty out of this.

31
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,835
You lost the right to have
a say in these things

32
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,880
when you refused to j...
join the council.

33
00:01:47,964 --> 00:01:49,799
W-W-W-What about Jerry?

34
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:53,221
Will you at least
unfreeze my daughter's idiot?

35
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:54,640
Give you anything!

36
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:56,434
I have a rare antique-
coin collection!

37
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,312
Just don't hurt me!

38
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:02,570
Okay, maybe not antique,
but it was a limited minting.

39
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:04,735
They have little R2-D2s
instead of George Washington.

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,992
Our son's been abducted!

41
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,579
You hate me for buying
those coins!

42
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:13,628
Geez, Rick, w-what is
this place?

43
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:14,922
The citadel of Ricks.

44
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:17,509
It's the secret headquarters
for the Council of Ricks.

45
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,722
- Council of Ricks?
- As you know, Morty...

46
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,474
I've got a lot of enemies
in the universe

47
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,227
that consider my genius
a threat...

48
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,355
galactic terrorists,
a few sub-galactic dictators,

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,735
most of the entire
intergalactic government.

50
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,821
W-W-Wherever you find people
with heads up their asses,

51
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:31,699
someone wants a piece
of your grandpa,

52
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,704
and a lot of versions of me
had the same problem,

53
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,124
so a few thousand versions of me
had the ingenious idea

54
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,754
of banding together
like a herd of cattle

55
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:41,548
or a school of fish

56
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:43,676
or those people who answer
questions on Yahoo! Answers.

57
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,431
Hey! What do you know?
It's a cowboy version of me.

58
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:47,892
Geez, you're easy to impress.

59
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,256
Yeah, most timelines
have a Rick,

60
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:50,812
and most Ricks have a Morty.

61
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:52,899
This place is a real who's who
of who's you and me.

62
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:56,948
Turn your boring, old Morty
into a f... hot fashion statement

63
00:02:57,032 --> 00:02:58,700
with some Morty dazzlers.

64
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:00,662
Hey, check this out.

65
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:02,790
- Show me the Morty.
- Dumb.

66
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,417
Excuse me, sir,
is your Morty insured?

67
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:06,463
You know, every year, hundreds
of Mortys are injured...

68
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:07,714
Back off!

69
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,050
Not my cup of tea, this place.

70
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:11,596
I say the point of being a Rick
is being a Rick.

71
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,265
Save your anti-Rick speech

72
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,977
for the Council of Ricks,
terror-Rick.

73
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,688
Hey, save your Rick rules

74
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:18,774
for the sheep-Ricks,
Rick-pig.

75
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:20,735
- Fuck me, pal.
- Fuck you?

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,657
No, no, no, no, no.
Fuck me.

77
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:37,762
Bring up the holograms.

78
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:41,811
27 Ricks brutally murdered in
their own timelines...

79
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:45,191
an unprecedented Rick-icidal
epidemic.

80
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:47,945
What say you,
Earth Rick C-137?

81
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,656
You think I did this?

82
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,661
Why am I the first Rick you pull in
every time a Rick stubs his toe?

83
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,581
You have a history
of non-cooperation

84
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:56,501
with the council.

85
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,713
Yeah, so does the scientist
formerly known as Rick.

86
00:03:58,797 --> 00:04:00,841
W-W-W-W-W-Why isn't he here
in handcuffs?

87
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,886
Because he's dead, too!

88
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,185
Who else would we question?
You fit the profile.

89
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:09,480
Of all the Ricks
in the central finite curve,

90
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:11,984
you're the malcontent,
the rogue.

91
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:14,404
I'm the Rick, and so
were the rest of you

92
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,407
before you formed this
stupid alliance.

93
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:18,133
You wanted to be safe
from the government,

94
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:19,871
so you became
a stupid government.

95
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,582
That makes every Rick here
less Rick than me.

96
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,130
Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags.

97
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,300
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got pancakes back home

98
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:28,427
with syrup on top of them.

99
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:30,639
They're about to hit that
critical point of syrup absorption

100
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:32,308
that turns the cakes
into a gross paste,

101
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:34,269
and I hate to get all
Andy Rooney about it,

102
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:37,274
but I think we all like fluffy
discs of cake with syrup on top,

103
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:40,028
and I think we also like to be
accused of crimes

104
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,614
when there's evidence!

105
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,119
So, as they say in Canada,
peace oot!

106
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:47,791
Evidence! Good idea.
Scan his portal gun!

107
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,085
Oh, come on.

108
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,923
Don't look at another man's
portal-gun history.

109
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,968
We... we all
go to weird places.

110
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:56,054
Yes, but it appears you alone

111
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,767
have been going to the exact
timelines and locations

112
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,854
in which the murders occurred.

113
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:02,940
What?!
That's Rick-diculous!

114
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:04,609
I'm obviously being set up.

115
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:08,282
Earth Rick C-137, the council
of Ricks sentences you

116
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:11,078
to the machine
of unspeakable doom,

117
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:13,791
which swaps your conscious
and unconscious minds,

118
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:15,669
rendering
your fantasies pointless

119
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:18,841
while everything you've known
becomes impossible to grasp.

120
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:21,469
Also, every 10 seconds,
it stabs your balls.

121
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,849
I've heard enough.

122
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,521
Run, Morty!

123
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:28,815
Unh-unh. Not you.

124
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:32,696
Aaaah!

125
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:56,067
Oh! Oh!

126
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:00,658
Yeah, I'd like to order one
large person

127
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:02,911
with extra people, please.
White people.

128
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,455
No, no, no, no.
Black people.

129
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,166
And Hispanic on half.

130
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,854
Yes, I'd like to order one
large sofa chair

131
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,857
with extra chair, please.
High chair.

132
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:23,151
No, no, no, no. Recliner.

133
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:25,196
And wheelchair on half.

134
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:38,926
They could have gone
into any one of these.

135
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:41,014
Son of a...

136
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:43,100
- Oh, geez.
- We lost 'em.

137
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,602
Yeah, I'd like to order one
large phone

138
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,272
with extra phones, please.
Cellphone.

139
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:47,733
No, no, no, no. Rotary.

140
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:49,944
And pay phone on half.

141
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,949
That'll keep 'em
busy for a while.

142
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,872
Those guys were wrong, right?

143
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,501
Y-Y-Y-You d... you wouldn't kill
yourself... y-y-yourselves.

144
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,005
Of course not, Morty.
How could that profit me?

145
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,674
But someone out there is
killing Ricks,

146
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,385
and the council ain't
gonna stop thinking it's me

147
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,890
until we clear our names...
by finding the real Rick-killer.

148
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,642
I'm scared, Rick.

149
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,354
Maybe we should go home
and stockpile weapons,

150
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:13,106
like that show
"Doomsday Preppers."

151
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,734
Not really my style, Morty.

152
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:15,986
Besides, your home is
most likely

153
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:17,989
swarming with Ricks by now.

154
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:21,411
All right, listen, Jerry.

155
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:24,165
If Rick calls, this device is
gonna trace his location.

156
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:27,128
You just gotta keep him on the phone
for 30 seconds or longer.

157
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,466
- Who wants lemonade?
- Oh, yeah.

158
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,220
Mmm!
Oh! Delicious!

159
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:34,306
Beth you're a treasure.

160
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:36,435
I have a Beth just like you
in my reality,

161
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,230
except you know what?

162
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:41,025
She's not as brilliant or
attractive.

163
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,446
- Aw.
- Thank you.

164
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,366
Oh! She did! She did it!

165
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,918
- H-hello?
- Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.

166
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:54,004
Rick! Hey.

167
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,465
What's... what's up?

168
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,554
So, listen, the heat's on,
and there's nowhere left to turn,

169
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:00,640
so Morty and I are just gonna
fly my spaceship into a black hole.

170
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:02,685
- What?!
- Is that cool with you, dawg?

171
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,730
Rick, no! Morty!!
We got it.

172
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,525
The call's coming from...

173
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:08,445
♪ Inside the house ♪

174
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,489
- Look at his face!
- You dummy!

175
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,534
Can't believe our daughter
married you.

176
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,412
Too easy!

177
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:15,956
The Ricks are probably
gonna waste some time

178
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,125
messing with Jerry.

179
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:18,711
They won't be able to help
themselves.

180
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,839
But as soon as they get bored,
they'll be onto us.

181
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:22,964
Phones à la clams and
phonesghetti with phone balls.

182
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:23,969
Anything else?

183
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,430
Yeah, more phone sticks, please.

184
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:26,347
Right away, sir.

185
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,975
You know, Rick, when I first saw

186
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,269
all those Ricks and Mortys,

187
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:31,398
I thought, "gee, that
kind of devalues our bond."

188
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:32,774
but then I realized it just means

189
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,737
that our relationship must
be pretty special

190
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:36,907
to span over all those
different timelines.

191
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:39,285
Yeah, it's got to be that way.
You're a camouflage.

192
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:42,499
Camouflage? W-W-W-What are
you talking about, Rick?

193
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,251
Ricks have a very distinctive
and traceable brain wave

194
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:46,046
due to our genius.

195
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,771
The best way to hide
from an enemy's radar

196
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,593
is to stand near someone
with complementary brain waves

197
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:51,429
that make ours invisible.

198
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:53,350
See, w-w-w-when a Rick I-is
with a Morty,

199
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:56,563
the genius waves get
canceled out by the, uh...

200
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:58,816
Morty waves.

201
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:02,489
Um... because o-our
personalities are so different?

202
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:04,450
Oh, shit, dawg.

203
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:06,453
My portal gun was hacked
remotely, Morty...

204
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:08,457
obviously by the real killer,
to frame me.

205
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,502
But I was able to trace the signal.
Come on. Let's go.

206
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:12,255
Uh-oh.

207
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,341
Excuse me. We've tracked
a pair of dangerous criminals

208
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:16,052
to this exact location.

209
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:18,138
They look exactly like us,
so in order to avoid confusion,

210
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:20,184
I'm gonna mark us each
with a red "X" right now.

211
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,062
That way, if someone has a gun

212
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,982
and we both tell you to shoot
the other one

213
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:26,527
because they're the evil one,
you'll know who's lying.

214
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:28,447
Hey, check it out.

215
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:31,034
Damn it!

216
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,872
Hey, you didn't pay your bill!

217
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:36,334
T-The red "X"! Red "X"!

218
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:38,337
Hey, it's a good thing
that space outlet had lab coats

219
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,258
and your favorite kind of shirt
in stock, huh, Morty?

220
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:42,136
Yeah, Rick, l-I heard
you the first time.

221
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,972
You don't have to keep saying it
over and over.

222
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,641
Man, this place is way
off the grid.

223
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:47,436
This guy does not want
to be found.

224
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,566
Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just
have to stand by a Morty to hide?

225
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,403
I mean, isn't that what Mortys are...
human cloaking devices?

226
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:56,325
Morty, you're making a bigger
deal out of this than it is.

227
00:09:57,494 --> 00:09:59,204
Oh, my god, Rick, look!

228
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:02,043
There's a bunch of people
strapped all over that building!

229
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:05,088
Not people, Morty...
Mortys.

230
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,559
Oh, god!

231
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:14,437
W-Why would somebody do this?
It's horrible!

232
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,690
Well, one Morty's enough to hide
from the bureaucrats,

233
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,694
but you get... you get
a whole matrix of Mortys

234
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,447
and put them in agonizing pain,

235
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:23,618
that creates a pattern that can hide
even from other Ricks, motherfucker.

236
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:26,706
I fiddled with a concept
like this once.

237
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,336
On paper, Morty.
On paper.

238
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,172
I wouldn't do this.
It's barbaric overkill.

239
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,217
I mean, you could accomplish
the same result with, like,

240
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,721
five Mortys and a jumper cable.

241
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,475
Which I also wouldn't do!

242
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,313
I'm just saying, it's bad
craftsmanship.

243
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:43,733
- Coffee time!
- Yo, yo, yo, yo!

244
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,613
That's what I like to hear!

245
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:48,408
Hi, Jerry.

246
00:10:48,492 --> 00:10:50,327
Leave me alone.
I'm working.

247
00:10:50,412 --> 00:10:52,289
Oh, you are?
W-W-W-What do you do?

248
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:55,419
I-I'm... I'm in between
advertising jobs.

249
00:10:55,503 --> 00:10:57,381
Advertising? Wow!

250
00:10:57,465 --> 00:10:59,592
So, people need help figuring
out what to buy,

251
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:01,053
and then y-y-you help 'em?

252
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:03,640
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

253
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,936
Well, I mean, you do it,
and you seem like a guy

254
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,731
who really has it all together.

255
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:12,905
Dude, are you... w...
you're being a dick, right?

256
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,366
Oh, gosh, l-I hope not.

257
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:16,911
I-I-I-l-I-l wouldn't want to
offend you in any way.

258
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,873
You're really a Rick?

259
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,960
Y... of course I am...

260
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,921
just as much
as my Morty's a Morty.

261
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:24,799
Hey, he looks a lot
like Eric Stoltz

262
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,802
from the movie "Mask."

263
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,597
You know, the one
with Cher in it?

264
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:29,682
That's right, Jerry!

265
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,685
He... he's from a reality
where everyone is

266
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,396
Eric Stoltz "Mask" people.

267
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:34,774
He's Eric Stoltz Mask Morty.

268
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:36,234
They assigned him to me

269
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,154
because I never had
any kids of my own.

270
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:39,615
But if I did, boy, I'd love them

271
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,409
if they were as smart
and as successful

272
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:42,578
as you are, Jerry.

273
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:44,164
Hey, get a load of this.

274
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:46,167
Jerry's hanging out
with doofus Rick.

275
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:47,586
This is perfect.

276
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,172
I'm not doofus Rick!

277
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,465
I'm Rick J19-Zeta-7!

278
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,886
Oh, is that the timeline
where everybody eats poop?

279
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,931
Jerry, you know this guy
eats poop, right?

280
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,642
Hey, I don't eat poop!

281
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:58,728
Y-You guys are always
so mean to me.

282
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,653
I guess it's only fair
to tell you now, Jerry.

283
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:05,572
I'm the worst Rick of them all.

284
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:07,618
According to who...
other versions of you?

285
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:08,994
If I've learned one thing,

286
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,789
it's that before you get
anywhere in life,

287
00:12:10,873 --> 00:12:12,835
you got to stop listening
to yourself.

288
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,671
Wow.
You really are wise, Jerry.

289
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:17,633
I-I-I guess that's why you work
in advertising.

290
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:19,637
The fact that you feel that way

291
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,640
makes you the best Rick
of them all.

292
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,643
You don't care about me at all!

293
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,608
I'm no different than that
jacket you've got on!

294
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:27,649
Y-Y-Y... o-or your stupid
portal gun!

295
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:30,112
I'm just a tool!
I-I-I'm just an object!

296
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,990
Hey, it's your choice
to take it personally, Morty.

297
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:33,742
Now, for the love of god,
be quiet.

298
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:35,708
The point of this is to get
the drop on the guy.

299
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:37,373
You know what, Rick?
I'll tell you something!

300
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,044
I'm more than a human shield!
Yeah, that's right. You are.

301
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,799
You're a perfect, impenetrable
suit of human armor, Morty,

302
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:44,760
because you're as dumb
as I am smart,

303
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,513
which is why when I say
"shut up,"

304
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,558
it's really good advice.

305
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,230
Great. Nice work, Morty.

306
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:07,129
Ooh. Look at you, C-137.

307
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:09,174
You... aren't you
a tough customer?

308
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:12,012
The slow clap? Really?
Kind of played out, dude.

309
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:13,848
Not in this dimension, it isn't.

310
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,559
In fact I invented it.

311
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:17,729
Nobody else has ever even
done it here before.

312
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:18,814
Well, la-Di-DA.

313
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,192
Hey, that's mine!

314
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,756
I don't like the look
of that Rick, Morty.

315
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:28,080
- We gotta escape.
- I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

316
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:29,706
Y-You're a monster.

317
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,585
Don't be rick-diculous,
Morty.

318
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,380
Will you stop saying that?
It's stupid.

319
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:34,882
Take his Morty away.

320
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:37,094
- Come with me.
- Yeah, gladly.

321
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:39,472
Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

322
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:41,476
Hey, man, you seem to know
how this place works.

323
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,688
Is there any way we could
shut down that grid

324
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,357
and rescue all those
Mortys outside?

325
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:46,567
It would be pointless.

326
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:49,738
Mortys have no chance
of defeating a Rick.

327
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:50,824
In here.

328
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,134
- Ah. Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah, yeah.

329
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:04,595
Looks like payday at
Neverland Ranch in here.

330
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,098
Zing!

331
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:07,434
That guy got it.

332
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:08,894
Unh-unh-unh, Rick. Quiet.

333
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,814
You're missing my symphony.

334
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:16,782
Hey, I'll take it over
Mumford & Sons. Zip!

335
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:18,660
This guy is on it!

336
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:20,747
He's not laughing at your
dumb jokes, Rick.

337
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:23,250
That's just a random noise
it makes every 10 seconds.

338
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:28,175
You see, Rick, you're not
as clever as you think you are.

339
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,262
I wanted you to find me.

340
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,140
We're not so different,
you and I.

341
00:14:32,224 --> 00:14:34,685
- Yeah, duh!
- See this right here, Rick?

342
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,730
I crunched the numbers.

343
00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:38,901
I created a spectrum
of all the Ricks.

344
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:41,738
I listed them out
from most evil to least evil.

345
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:43,492
Here's where I am.

346
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:45,578
And look it... right here's
where you are, Rick.

347
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:48,082
This guy right here...
super-weird.

348
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,834
I get it. So you want me
to team up with you to take down

349
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,005
The Council of Ricks?
Is that where you're going with this?

350
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,549
'Cause that's where I'd be going.

351
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,844
Please. I think I'm doing
pretty good on my own.

352
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,849
I'm simply gonna download
the contents of your brain

353
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:02,105
and then kill you.

354
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:04,358
Okay, if we add a little more
titanium nitrate

355
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:07,613
and just a tad
of chlorified tartrate...

356
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,035
ovenless brownies!

357
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,830
Mmm. Mmm!

358
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,958
It's incredible what a gifted
mind can accomplish

359
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:16,627
when priorities are in order.

360
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:18,673
Well, come on.
I can't take all the credit, Jerry.

361
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:21,760
It was your idea.
Come here, Jerry!

362
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:27,770
Hey, uh, come here.

363
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:30,232
I-I want to show you
something.

364
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:32,319
Okay, look, everybody makes fun
of me for getting these,

365
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:35,533
but you're a genius scientist.
What do you think?

366
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:39,247
See? There's little R2-D2s where
the George Washingtons should be.

367
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:41,125
You know, Jerry, I'm not
gonna tell you

368
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,003
that these will
increase in value

369
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:44,839
or even hold their current value.

370
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,343
The truth is, you bought them
because you like them.

371
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:50,640
They have value to you.
That's what matters.

372
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:54,188
How long are you staying?

373
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:56,316
Until we find your Rick.

374
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,360
I found mine.

375
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:00,363
I found mine.

376
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,537
- Help!
- There is no escape, my son.

377
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:07,082
We will find our peace in
the next world.

378
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,837
So, what... y-y-y-y-you're
just gonna give up?

379
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:13,259
We're giving in... to the
power of the one true Morty.

380
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:14,970
One day, he will return.

381
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:18,851
Praise the one true Morty.

382
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,106
Ugh.
All right, Mortys, listen up.

383
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:26,364
My name is Morty Smith,
from Earth dimension C-137.

384
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:28,951
I know you're scared,
because I'm scared.

385
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:31,205
But that's no reason to accept
our fate!

386
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:32,122
We're Mortys!

387
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,877
We're not defined by our
relationships to Rick!

388
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:37,172
Our destiny is our own!

389
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:39,343
This sounds like something
the one true Morty might say.

390
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:41,346
I'm sick of being a human
shield.

391
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,432
I-I-I w... I want to be
a gardener!

392
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:46,938
I want to write really crazy,
intense action novels!

393
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:49,066
I'm more than just a hammer!

394
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,028
He is the one true Morty!

395
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:53,365
Hooray!
The one true Morty!

396
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,285
Hey, keep it down!

397
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,344
You've lived quite a life, Rick.

398
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,850
It's a real shame you won't be
around to see it through.

399
00:17:18,364 --> 00:17:20,450
You're crying?
Over a Morty?

400
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,619
No, I'm just allergic
to dipshits.

401
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:23,955
Ugh. Pathetic.

402
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,793
We both know that if there's
any truth in the universe,

403
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:29,423
it's that Ricks
don't care about Mortys.

404
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,098
Do your worst,
you little bastards!

405
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:37,811
Kill me! Do it!
Do I-i-i-i-it!

406
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:40,982
Morty! Thank god!
Get me out of this.

407
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:43,820
- Come on!
- You're lucky I'm not a Rick.

408
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:46,700
Point taken, but this
is no time for arcs.

409
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:50,331
Oh!

410
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,006
Yeah, hello.

411
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:58,386
Hey, what do me and O.J.
not have in common?

412
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,138
Huh? W-Who is this?

413
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:03,727
I found the real killer, bitch!
Get over here!

414
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:08,819
Yo, ding-dong, we're done here.
Time to go.

415
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:10,822
Well, Jerry

416
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:12,992
I guess this means goodbye.

417
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:14,829
W-W-Well, does it have to?

418
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:16,790
I mean, you...
you look just like Rick.

419
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:19,377
We could maybe, you know,
get rid of him.

420
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:21,213
I'm not saying kill him,
necessarily.

421
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:24,051
I... I'm also not saying
necessarily not kill him, but...

422
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,806
Jerry, w-we both know
it wouldn't work.

423
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,894
It's time to go back
to our lives.

424
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:31,981
I love you, Jerry.
I love you.

425
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:49,758
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

426
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:51,637
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut!

427
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,021
W-What... w-what's gonna
happen to all these Mortys?

428
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:59,107
They'll go back to their
families,

429
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:03,281
attend school regularly,
play video games, date girls.

430
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:06,619
Poor little Rickless bastards.

431
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:08,748
Earth Rick C-137,

432
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:11,920
the council apologizes
for its false accusation,

433
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:14,507
and in the way of reparations
for our terrible mistake,

434
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:17,887
we would like to compensate you
with this voucher

435
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:20,433
for a free replacement Morty
in the event

436
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:22,561
that your current
Morty should...

437
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,940
Uh, guys, not a good time.

438
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:26,902
Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

439
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:30,991
Is it time for arcs yet, Rick?

440
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:32,452
I did a pretty good job
back there

441
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,622
for a human cloaking device.

442
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,067
Saved your ass.
All right, Morty.

443
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,835
Don't break an arm jerking
yourself off.

444
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,588
Man, I can't believe you, Rick.

445
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:41,591
That right there, that w...
that was a great opportunity

446
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:43,595
to show a little humanity,
you know?

447
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,181
To connect with me a little.

448
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,641
Hey, Morty, you want connection,

449
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:49,187
go be part of some stupid club,
like all those dumb Ricks.

450
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,691
You know, maybe I don't connect
because I'm the Rickest Rick.

451
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,070
And, you know, it would g...

452
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:56,323
go without saying
that the Rickest Rick

453
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:57,784
would have the Mortyest Morty.

454
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:00,079
- It would go without saying, huh?
- Yeah, it would.

455
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:02,917
Did you hear me say it?
Nah.

456
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,920
The Mortyest Morty.

457
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,216
Just don't get too big
for your loafers, Buster Brown.

458
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:09,469
A cocky Morty can lead to some
big problems.

459
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:11,431
It can be a real bad thing
for everybody.

460
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:13,100
Oh, yeah? How's that?

461
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:16,105
U-Uh, I'll explain when
you're older.

462
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:18,650
What a mess.

463
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:20,613
Pride cometh before the fall.

464
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:22,532
I guess he got what he deserved.

465
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:23,408
What is that?

466
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,246
Hand me the laser difibulator.

467
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:27,957
Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

468
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,335
No! Go clean the toilets.

469
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,254
Maybe you'll make friends
with some turds.

470
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:33,758
You make us ashamed to be
ourselves!

471
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:37,890
My god. I've seen
this technology before.

472
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:41,270
This Rick was being
controlled remotely...

473
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:42,856
puppeteered by somebody else.

474
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,654
This is the receiver.
Yeah, but where's the transmitter?

475
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:38,027
Wubba dubba dub dub!
Oh. Hey, Jerry.

476
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:40,364
W-W-W-What are you doing
in my room, buddy?

477
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,535
Nothing.
I was just, um...

478
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:44,538
checking the smoke detectors.

479
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:47,543
All right.
Okay, get out.

480
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,829
What's that dipshit doing
out there?

481
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,040
Are you friends with him?

482
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,918
You know he eats his own shit,
right?

483
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:15,837
Oh, my god, this is rich!

484
00:22:15,922 --> 00:22:18,842
I've got like 10 Ricks
to call right now.

485
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:21,806
Did you get any of that?

486
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,850
It's a good-a show!
