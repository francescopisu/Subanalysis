<i>In local news,</i>

<i>The man that once ate his own son...</i>

7
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,725
Wow. He's really getting
executed after all this time.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,101
You know the son that he ate was...

9
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,102
Your best friend... Tommy.

10
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,771
We know. Stop true-crime bragging.

11
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,314
I was traumatized, Summer.

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,649
Okay, your generation
wouldn't get that.

13
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,443
Bitch, my generation gets
traumatized for breakfast.

14
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,071
It took years of therapy
to even process the reality.

15
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,489
I mean, when I was a kid,

16
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,616
I just told myself that
Tommy had gotten lost

17
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,910
in the magical realm of Froopyland.

18
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,870
- "Froopyland?"
- My make-believe world.

19
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,414
I know the name's stupid,
but it was so real to me.

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,874
Aren't you guys supposed
to be at your father's

21
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,167
for custody weekend?

22
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,294
We're not in a hurry.
Dad sleeps until sundown.

23
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,796
Can we talk a little bit more
about this Froopy...

24
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,130
Not the bubble gun!

25
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,299
There's no air...

26
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,844
I gotta say, I am warming up
to the bubble gun.

27
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,221
You know, if you're so great
at naming things,

28
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,639
why don't you do it from now on?

29
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,974
- What?
- Froopyland.

30
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,017
Was it my best work?
I don't know.

31
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,019
Does it deserve to be
shit on creatively?

32
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,020
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,939
I agree with your look
of horrified realization.

34
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,483
You can be very
inconsiderate sometimes.

35
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,735
Here it is.

36
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,529
You know, I collapsed
a quantum tesseract to...

37
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,613
Dad, I don't care how you made it.

38
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,323
I want to know
if Tommy's still in there!

39
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,783
Relax, Beth.

40
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,410
If he is, we'll find him.

41
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,078
He'll be the only sun-bleached skeleton

42
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,955
with non-imaginary DNA.

43
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,614
Tommy!

44
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,906
Tommy!

45
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:55,907
This is a nightmare.

46
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,284
I can't believe you used to lock me up

47
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,952
in this glorified chicken coop.

48
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,120
Chicken coop?

49
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,289
Those are procedurally
generated clouds, Beth.

50
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,333
That river is a rainbow. Literally.

51
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,460
Come on, I-I-I put real
elbow grease into this place.

52
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,587
Well, you're supposed to put
elbow grease into your daughter!

53
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,547
- Gross.
- Do you think something ate him?

54
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,799
Nope. Froopyland creatures
were designed to be harmless.

55
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,426
He definitely just starved to death.

56
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,136
I could have been the one
who starved to death in here.

57
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,220
What if I'd gotten hurt?

58
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,056
God, you're right.
I'm a terrible dad.

59
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,390
Well, nothing to live for.

60
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,267
- Goodbye, cruel world!
- Dad!

61
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,227
Oh, how do you like that?

62
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,105
What kind of merciless creator
makes the ground bouncy?

63
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,399
I'm gonna have to drown myself.

64
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,067
Unh!

65
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,277
Oh, no.
Oh, the water's breathable?

66
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,403
Who went and did that?

67
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,446
Oh, whatever.

68
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,447
Yeah, whatever.

69
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,532
A dad makes a toilet look like R2-D2,

70
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,950
and it breaks the front page of Reddit,

71
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,911
but I'm Charles Manson
because I gave you

72
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,454
your own world instead of an iPad.

73
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,289
I think the words you're
looking for are... Aah!

74
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,500
Holy fuck! Shit!
This thing has claws!

75
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,543
Yeah, I get it.
It's a childproof world.

76
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,921
No, no, seriously,
this hurts really bad!

77
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,964
This thing is sinking
razor-sharp claws in...

78
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,383
Aah! Shit!

79
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,968
You've made your point, Dad.

80
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,011
Dad?

81
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,683
Ugh!

82
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,602
Whose idea was this stupid
custody weekend thing?

83
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,771
I think it's supposed to help
prevent abandonment issues.

84
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,064
I want to be abandoned.

85
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,649
Yeah, I'm talking about Dad.

86
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,442
Bienvenue a la Chez Divorced Dad.

87
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,777
Wow, Dad.

88
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,238
Your place looks way less
like a crackhouse.

89
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,949
It's actually clean,
like a cocaine house.

90
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,158
Dad, what's going on?

91
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,202
I'm simply centered, activated...

92
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,455
- And telekinetic?
- Pretty cool, huh?

93
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,582
Check it out.
Who wants a smoothie?

94
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,670
Oh... Oh, no.
Uh, oh, God.

95
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,713
Summer... Summer, can you...

96
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:33,964
- Aah!
- Sorry.

97
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,425
You have much to learn, my Uloo.

98
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,678
Morty, Summer, this is Kiara.

99
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,973
She's a Krootabulan warrior
priestess from Krootabulon.

100
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,975
I-I know where Krootabulans
are from, Dad.

101
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,226
Uh, Chaimuntolo.

102
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,477
Chaimuntolo, younglings.

103
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,396
Hymen... cholo.

104
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,148
Your father's mind holds love for you.

105
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,066
I am humbled to meet in physicality.

106
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,401
Dad, are you...

107
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,320
In love with a badass, sexy alien lady?

108
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,573
Ha, ha, I don't know, Summer.
You tell me.

109
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,366
I wasn't going to ask
if you were in love

110
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,617
since you barely know her.

111
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,620
Summer. Kiara and I met
on that interstellar dating service

112
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,956
Rick was always suggesting when
your mom and I were together.

113
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,417
And things just kind of clicked.

114
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,418
We must move!

115
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,420
Our reservation is at 7:00.

116
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,255
I hate to see her leave,

117
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,258
but I love to watch
her phase shift away.

118
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,218
I'm sure you noticed
what she has three of,

119
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,596
but guess what she has two of.

120
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,974
Aah!

121
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,100
Oof!

122
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,393
All right, knock it off!

123
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,811
Listen, I've been giving you a pass

124
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,147
because I'm charmed
that life finds a way, but...

125
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,690
Aah! All right, you know what?

126
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,234
Ouch!

127
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,736
Oh! Unh!

128
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,613
Ouch! God!

129
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,239
Aah!

130
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,991
Agh!

131
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,911
Oh, yeah, this place is the safest.

132
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,204
Best dad ever.

133
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,623
Can't you just say,
"I admit it, I screwed up"?

134
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,916
Uh, what would be the point of that?

135
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,250
You can't do it, can you?

136
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,544
You can't just fucking apologize.

137
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,713
Okay, okay, Beth, I'm sorry...

138
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,799
you think you deserve an apology.

139
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,759
Hey, don't look at me.

140
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,344
You let your kid roll around
on the floor of a target,

141
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,595
it's gonna get stepped on.

142
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,018
Huh. Well, here's the problem right here.

143
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,270
We've got a bunch of Froopyland
procedural carbons

144
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,148
all gummed up and mixed in
with real human DNA.

145
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,358
Are you saying Tommy survived here

146
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,776
by having sex with Froopy creatures,

147
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,236
creating Froopy-human hybrid offspring,

148
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,612
and then consuming their proteins,

149
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,072
sustaining himself
with an endless cycle

150
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,114
of cannibalistic incest?

151
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,157
It's just a working theory.

152
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,158
Of course, if that's the case,

153
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,910
I expect he'd be worshiped
as a kind of god

154
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,496
by a medieval-level society
of his least-delicious children.

155
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,082
Halt! You are now prisoners
of our exalted ruler,

156
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,375
giver and taker of life,

157
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,293
humper and consumer of mortality,

158
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,670
- dispenser of life...
- Yes, if I could interrupt?

159
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,921
We're way ahead of the reveal here.

160
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,422
Yeah, just take us to King Tommy.

161
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,216
I thought warrior priestesses

162
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,009
could only leave Krootabulon on a hunt.

163
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,177
Mmm. Thank you, sweetie.

164
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,346
I hope it's not human season.

165
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,975
I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix.
I would never hunt a human.

166
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,102
Your father and I are soul-bonded.

167
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,395
Soul-bonded?

168
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,980
Um, does your planet have shorter days,

169
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,023
because you guys are moving
kind of fast, no?

170
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,864
Go get him, honey!

171
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,074
She's always hunting.

172
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,659
She probably knew a Varrix worked here,

173
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,161
and that's why she said
the Yelp reviews didn't matter.

174
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,329
Dad, do you understand

175
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,707
how serious Krootabulon
soul-bonding is?

176
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,294
Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know.
It's got such a casual name.

177
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,753
If you want to lecture
anyone about commitment,

178
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,005
start with your mom.

179
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,507
Oh, my God.
Dad, is that what this is about?

180
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,676
Are you rushing into a new
thing to get back at Mom?

181
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,970
Every weekend, you two
have told me to move on.

182
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,597
Move on, like, out of bed.

183
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,682
Like, stop using paper
towels for toilet paper,

184
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,976
not move on into a sloppy rebound.

185
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,645
Dad, you need to slow down,
rethink this soul bond.

186
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,814
Why don't you just say
what you really mean?

187
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,149
You think it's cool

188
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,984
that having sex with her
gives me telekinesis

189
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,111
and you recognize she's got a hot bod

190
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,156
like Cheetara in "Thundercats,"
but you're grossed out

191
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,783
by her avocado-shaped
head and blue skin,

192
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,536
and you think I want to put
a bag and a wig on her head.

193
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,414
After all the time and energy I spent

194
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,832
teaching you two about race...

195
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,500
...you ended up racist.

196
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,503
Soon your world will be rid of Varrix.

197
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,464
Tomorrow, we celebrate.

198
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,965
We could take the kids
to the water park.

199
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,967
We celebrate with a hunt!

200
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,011
Ooh. You kids want to hunt?

201
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,054
- Yes.
- Yes.

202
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,600
All kneel for King Tommy!

203
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,852
I'm not kneeling.
Suck my dick.

204
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,896
Well, hello, all!

205
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,190
I am the King of Froopyland,

206
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,734
but I go by another name, too.

207
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,903
- We know.
- It's Tommy!

208
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:25,904
- We know.
- We know.

209
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,074
I have lived here
since I was a mere child.

210
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,200
- We know.
- Got it.

211
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,870
I suppose you're wondering,
how do I sustain myself?

212
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,913
- Oh, boy.
- No, we aren't.

213
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,376
I always find the theater
is the best way to clarify things.

214
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,418
- Ugh.
- Seriously?

215
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,420
- Oh, my God.
- Players, go!

216
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,005
I am little Tommy.

217
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,050
I am tiny Beth.

218
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,803
Oh, come on.

219
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,721
Come with me to my magic world.

220
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,764
Don't do it!

221
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,102
This is my secret Froopyland
where I have no rules!

222
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,728
I am excited.

223
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,774
I am jealous of Tommy's
friends and his Nintendo

224
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,901
and his dad who likes him.

225
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,153
I take it Tommy wasn't
class playwright.

226
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,072
Do you want to see the Honey Swamp?

227
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,241
Yes! Let's do it!

228
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,368
Well, I want to see you dead.

229
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,370
Ow, help! I'm stuck!

230
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,913
I'm covered in honey.

231
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,456
Huh. Well, that's interesting.

232
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,791
Fake news.

233
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,295
Many nights have passed,
trapped in this strange land.

234
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:29,467
I am hungry, and all I can do
to pass the time is hump.

235
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,178
I will hump this rock.

236
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,015
I will hump this tree.

237
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,852
I will hump this beast of the land

238
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,812
and put my seed in it.

239
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,608
I am the first of Tommy's children.

240
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:49,279
Eat of my flesh so you may survive.

241
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,865
And so I did.

242
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,826
Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah.

243
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,162
Certified fresh. Good... Good job.

244
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,914
Perhaps a demonstration is in order.

245
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,250
No, that is the last thing
that is in order!

246
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,668
- Oh, my God.
- Poor Froopy character.

247
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,503
Leave him alone.

248
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,630
Ahh. Gather 'round, gang!

249
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,966
Dinner time.

250
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,844
All right, that's it.
I'm outta here.

251
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,596
What are you doing?

252
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,847
We're in the middle of an adventure.

253
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,599
Here's some things
an adventure needs, Beth.

254
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,726
Conflict, stakes,
a way for me to benefit,

255
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,144
and, clearly, Morty.

256
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,645
But Tommy's still in there,

257
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,481
raping Muppets and eating babies.

258
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,024
Yep. Luckily, that's not our problem.

259
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,150
Time to pull the plug.

260
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,485
Pull the plug?

261
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,153
We have to get Tommy
out of there, okay?

262
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,571
We... We need to do the right thing.

263
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,947
Do what you never did as a dad...

264
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,449
Put in a little effort.

265
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,575
All right, cut the high-road routine.

266
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,202
We both saw Tommy's shitty play.

267
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,828
You pushed him
in the Honey Swamp, Beth.

268
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,830
His very happy life is in your hands.

269
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,207
You go save him from it.

270
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,667
You're gonna believe a play
over your own daughter?

271
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,087
Yes, I am, Beth, because
you're not my own daughter.

272
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,380
Oh, God, yes.
I'm one of infinite Beths

273
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,382
with infinite fathers
in infinite universes.

274
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,218
It's called a hug, Dad.
It won't kill you.

275
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,344
Yeah, don't be so sure.

276
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,804
You know why all Ricks
made a Froopyland

277
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,013
for all their little girls?

278
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,264
Same reason I wasn't surprised

279
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,058
by Tommy's overwritten,
badly structured,

280
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,559
cheaply produced flashback.

281
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,686
You were a scary fucking kid, man.

282
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,021
Oh, my God.

283
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,898
I didn't make Froopyland
to get rid of you, Beth.

284
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,608
I did it to protect the neighborhood.

285
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,235
Not in a noble sense.

286
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,945
It was just more practical
to sequester you

287
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,447
before I had to start, you know,
cloning a replacement

288
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,866
for every less-than-polite
little boy or gullible animal

289
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,618
that might cross your socio-path.

290
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,620
You would rather believe I'm evil

291
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,372
than admit that you were a bad father?

292
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,414
Oh, dude, no.

293
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,333
No, bad father all the way
to the max over here.

294
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,709
I'm a fucking nutcase.

295
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,670
And the acorn plopped
straight down, baby.

296
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,879
Look at some of the shit

297
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,381
you were asking me
to make you as a kid.

298
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,674
Ray guns.

299
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,425
A whip that forces people to like you.

300
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,346
Invisibility cuffs, a parent trap,
a lightning gun,

301
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,932
a teddy bear with anatomically
correct innards,

302
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,727
night-vision googly-eye glasses,
sound-erasing sneakers,

303
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,939
false fingerprints, fall-asleep darts,

304
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,526
a lie-detecting doll,
an indestructible baseball bat,

305
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,280
a Taser shaped like a ladybug,
a fake police badge,

306
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,658
location-tracking stickers,
rainbow-colored duct tape,

307
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,453
mind-control hair clips, poison gum,

308
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,414
a pink, sentient switchblade.

309
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,999
Hi, Beth. You've gotten taller.

310
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,250
Shall we resume stabbing?

311
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,418
Has it occurred to you

312
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,711
that I asked you to make those things

313
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,546
because I wanted you
to spend time with me?

314
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,132
Has it occurred to you that
<i>if</i> I did try killing Tommy,

315
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,426
it might be because I was
jealous of his family?

316
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,343
Wait, what?
Why?

317
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,095
Wasn't his dad, like,
some kind of cannibal?

318
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,597
Seems like it must be hereditary.

319
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,098
Oh, my God.
This is your fault.

320
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,641
I am not a bad person.

321
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,893
I'm gonna go back in there.

322
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,145
I'm getting Tommy,
and I'm fixing this!

323
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,815
Whatever you say,
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

324
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,275
I don't know why I just said that.

325
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,736
Doesn't make a lot of sense,
but gotta stand by it.

326
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,197
Whatever you say,
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

327
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,489
I'm owning it.

328
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,288
No, Dad!
You're not doing it right!

329
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,332
Cutting off their heads
isn't doing it right?

330
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,626
They're clearly regenerative!

331
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,212
I-I think you have to stab them
through the heart or something.

332
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,296
You think or you know?

333
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,965
I thought you were the alien expert,
Isaac Asi-hole.

334
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,800
Don't snap at me!
I'm tired!

335
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,510
- Me, too!
- We're all tired!

336
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,557
That's the last of them.

337
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,100
Tonight, we celebrate.

338
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,227
With a hunt?

339
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,647
Yes, for tomorrow, we hunt.

340
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,991
I, uh, really have to get out
of this soul bond.

341
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,618
- What the fuck, Dad?
- Oh, my God! Duh!

342
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,661
- Obviously!
- Yeah, no kidding!

343
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,496
- Can you guys help me?
- What? How?

344
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,957
Can I just, uh, tell her
it's because of my kids?

345
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,501
You know, like, you don't like
the shape of her head, or...

346
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,628
That's you, Dad!
That's <i>you!</i>

347
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,505
You're a baby and an idiot!

348
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,757
I think that's been established, Summer.
Now help me!

349
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,133
First, I want you to admit

350
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,678
that you're a closet racist,
a beta-male sexist,

351
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,763
and you dragged everyone
into a horrible situation

352
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,181
by only thinking of yourself.

353
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,182
Okay.

354
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,934
I want to hear you say it.

355
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,815
Look, I'm a closeted racist,
and I'm sexist and selfish,

356
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,943
and I dragged us all into my sexist,
racist bad things

357
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,653
- because I'm stupid.
- Thank you.

358
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,904
Now you're gonna help me, right?

359
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,532
- She just did.
- Yeah, clean up your own mess.

360
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,950
Wait, wait, what?

361
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,119
Oh, man.

362
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,079
All right, everybody.

363
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,372
Next item on the docket...

364
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,541
I would like to have sex
with some of you

365
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,252
and then eat the babies.

366
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,336
I thought you'd like that.

367
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,463
I do keep rolling out the hits, don't I?

368
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,384
Oh! It's the Magic Crayon Lady!

369
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,928
Are you hungry?
I was just about to make dinner.

370
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,555
And by "make dinner," I mean...

371
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,308
Tommy, I'm going to take
you to the real world.

372
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,892
Well, this <i>is</i> the real world.

373
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,436
No, you don't understand!
Your dad...

374
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,229
Uh, people think your dad ate you!

375
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,023
So?
You doy-oy!

376
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,399
People should eat people.

377
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,942
Just leave me alone!

378
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,402
Tommy, you don't understand.

379
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,778
I have to make this right

380
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,822
because it's my fault
that you're in here.

381
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,033
I'm Beth.

382
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,909
Beth?
The destroyer!

383
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,911
Oh, suck it up, Princess Incest.

384
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,121
You fell into some honey.

385
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,499
Well, it tends to happen when
one is pushed into honey.

386
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,919
I respect your right
to believe I pushed you.

387
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,755
Oh, do I get to have that?

388
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,882
Is my reality like a little side of fries...

389
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,426
a little Kwanzaa you're
willing to slide my way?

390
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,387
Yes, because I'm focused
on saving your father's life

391
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,097
because I'm not a petty piece of shit.

392
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,224
So, then, it should be pretty easy

393
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,352
to say, "Sorry I pushed you."

394
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,853
Real easy and not necessary,

395
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,521
since you coming home
will save your dad's life

396
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,773
whereas nothing is changed

397
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,858
by anyone stroking
your batshit-crazy ego.

398
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,650
Sorry, forgive me.

399
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,611
Uh, I've been in Froopyland
for quite a while.

400
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,279
Have apologies changed?

401
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,907
Tommy, I'm sorry you think
you deserve an apology.

402
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,200
Oh, my God.
I'm my father.

403
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,994
Uh, will someone just kill this B-word?

404
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,622
Hi-ya!

405
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,041
Oh, my God.
I'm my father!

406
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,334
- Ya!
- Ooh! Froopy!

407
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,670
- Born to stab!
- Ooh!

408
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,299
And that's why one pussy
plus two pussies

409
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,176
makes a bunch of pussies.

410
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,303
Come on, y'all, I'm trying to make this

411
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,263
appealing to your
sex-addicted lifestyles.

412
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,849
Hi. I need to pull Morty out of school.
Come on, Morty.

413
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,726
Ha! You heard your daddy, Morty.

414
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,269
You have to leave school.

415
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,896
Wait, what are my values?

416
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,606
- Dad, what's going on?
- We're going to Alaska.

417
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,441
- What? Why?
- It's nice there.

418
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,568
Also, I broke up with Kiara,
and she didn't take it well,

419
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,861
and she wants to murder you two.

420
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,613
What? Th-Then why are we walking?

421
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,823
I'm walking because I'm tired.

422
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,074
You guys should definitely run.

423
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,078
Excuse me, I just...

424
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,080
You know what?
I'm... I'm just gonna go left.

425
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,790
No, okay, your left, that's fine.

426
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,876
Do you know what left is, 'cause...
Ugh!

427
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,170
What does your breakup
have to do with us?

428
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,922
Yeah, we chose Mom hands down.

429
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,674
I thought we made that clear
at the lawyer's office

430
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,135
and in the comments under
your weird rant on Facebook.

431
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,888
She kind of blames you
guys for the breakup.

432
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:31,889
- Why?
- Why?

433
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,599
Because I told her it was your fault.

434
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,517
- What?!
- What?!

435
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,519
Look, I'm not an evil person.

436
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,479
I'm just not very imaginative!

437
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,403

Um, hmm, so just, like,
out of curiosity,

444
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,668
if you were to make a clone of Tommy,

445
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,128
what would you need to get started?

446
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,880
I don't kn... Tommy's DNA?

447
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,673
Okay, 'cause he, um...

448
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,884
Yeah, he didn't want to come back,

449
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,386
so, um, he gave me this.

450
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,054
He gave you his finger?

451
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,389
Uh, well, what happened is...

452
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,475
- It's okay. It doesn't matter.
- Okay.

453
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,059
This'll take about three hours.

454
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,561
Okay.

Cool.

469
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,684
Dad?

470
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,020
I feel like I've spent my life

471
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,690
pretending you're a great guy
and trying to be like you.

472
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,359
And the ugly truth has always been...

473
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,903
That I'm not that great a guy
and you're exactly like me.

474
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,239
Am I evil?

475
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,907
Worse. You're smart.

476
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,284
When you know nothing matters,
the universe is yours.

477
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,453
And I've never met
a universe that was into it.

478
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,996
The universe is basically an animal.

479
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,498
It grazes on the ordinary.

480
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,625
It creates infinite idiots
just to eat them,

481
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,460
- not unlike your friend Timmy.
- Tommy.

482
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,045
Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie.

483
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,047
You know, smart people get
a chance to climb on top,

484
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,465
take reality for a ride,

485
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,175
but it'll never stop trying
to throw you.

486
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,426
And, eventually, it will.

487
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,136
There's no other way off.

488
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,682
Dad, I'm out of excuses
to not be who I am.

489
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,643
So who am I?
What do I do?

490
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,270
My advice... Take off.

491
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,689
Put a saddle on your universe.
Let it kick itself out.

492
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,731
I can't do that.

493
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,483
The kids, Jerry, my job,

494
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,569
and, as much as I hate to admit it,
ABC's "The Bachelor."

495
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,946
I can make a clone of you,
a perfect instance of you,

496
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,657
with all your memories,
an exact copy in every way.

497
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,325
It'll love and provide for the kids,

498
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,662
do your job, and consume
broadcast-network reality TV

499
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,164
on the same allegedly
ironic level as you.

500
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,374
You could be gone a day, a week,

501
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,751
or the rest of your life
with zero consequences.

502
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,044
The moment you decide to come back,

503
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,422
I flip a switch,
and the clone's job is done.

504
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,340
It feels no pain, it regrets nothing,

505
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,759
and has zero chance
of going "Blade Runner."

506
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,638
if nothing matters,
why would you do that for me?

507
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,182
I don't know, maybe you matter
so little that I like you.

508
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,268
Or maybe it makes you matter.

509
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,394
Maybe I love you.

510
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,604
Maybe something about your mother.

511
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,564
Don't jump a gift shark in the mouth.

512
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,608
I don't know if I can do it.

513
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,568
Then stay and luxuriate in a life

514
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,361
you can finally know you've chosen.

515
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,780
My secret bonus is that
no matter what you choose,

516
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,741
you're finally gonna chill the fuck out.

517
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,332
Okay.

518
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,542
I know what I want to do.

519
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,502
Aah!

520
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,587
Ow!

521
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,131
You can't run forever!

522
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,716
She's really pissed off.

523
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,217
I know. It's kinda hot.

524
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,552
Shut up!

525
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,888
The hunters!
They're back! Run!

526
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,514
- We're not hunters.
- We want to hide with you.

527
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,224
We're not hiding.
We're nesting.

528
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,225
Ooh la la.

529
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,897
The children must be destroyed
so that we can be together.

530
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,400
You need to break up with her, Dad...
Properly!

531
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,319
God damn it, Dad!

532
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,404
Dump her!

533
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,405
Okay, okay.

534
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,574
Kiara, let's just run away.

535
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,408
- Dad!
- Come on!

536
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,576
Just rip the Band-Aid off!

537
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,661
Okay!

538
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,163
Kiara, when I told you my kids
were bigoted racists

539
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,083
who were demanding
I break up with you, I lied.

540
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,377
If anybody deserves to be
telekinetically strangled,

541
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,378
it's me.

542
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,463
<i>I'm</i> the one who wants to break up.

543
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,758
I... I'm not an evil person.

544
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,426
I'm lazy, I'm cowardly,

545
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,553
and... and I do not know
what I'm doing.

546
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,931
Look, I got someone pregnant at 17.

547
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,100
We're getting a divorce.
None of this is on purpose.

548
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,227
I was excited to date someone cool

549
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,355
because it would make my ex notice me.

550
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,818
I would expect nothing
less from humanity...

551
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,654
a selfish, manipulative,
dishonest species that...

552
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,281
- Kiara?
- Trandor!

553
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,616
What are you doing here?

554
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,284
Just... hunting.

555
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,869
Do you really expect me to believe

556
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,996
it has nothing to do with us?

557
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,623
You knew Earth was my domain.

558
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,542
I don't like what you're insinuating.

559
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,627
- Dad, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

560
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,505
I'm starting to get the feeling
that <i>I</i> was the rebound.

561
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,340
Dad, you just got handed an ex machina.

562
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,466
You're taking it.

563
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,303
Varrix nests spread
across 300 galaxies,

564
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,973
and you just happened
to pick this planet to hunt?

565
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:27,059
That's Gorgon shit...
total Gorgon shit!

566
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,020
We're home!

567
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,772
- Hey, guys!
- What's for dinner?

568
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,315
- How was Jerry's?
- The usual.

569
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,651
- Can we have pizza?
- Pizza sounds great.

570
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,737
Hey, Rick, did you know
my dad was dating an alien?

571
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,905
No. Gross.
For the alien.

572
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,700
Aw, crap, I think Arnaldo's is closed.

573
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,201
Are you guys sure you want pizza?

574
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,664
Arnaldo's isn't closed in the dimension

575
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,374
where they didn't invent
Daylight Savings!

576
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,169
What would we do without you?
I love you, Dad.

577
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,920
Love you, too, sweetie.

578
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,757
By the way, that wasn't time travel.

579
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,341
There were just a couple
pizzas on the counter.

580
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,885
I grabbed them.

581
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,251
<i>Hey, Jerry, it's Kiara.</i>

582
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,545
<i>Listen, my boyfriend saw those
texts you've been sending me,</i>

583
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,130
<i>and he got pretty pissed off.</i>

584
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,632
<i>If he calls you, just ignore him!</i>

585
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,842
<i>This is Carmox.</i>

586
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,427
<i>I have intercepted
sexual communications</i>

587
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,221
<i>between you and my new
girlfriend, Kiara.</i>

588
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,431
<i>I am coming to kill you now!</i>

589
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,933
<i>Yo, Jerry, it's the Big R.</i>

590
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,060
<i>Uh, I killed that alien
that was coming after ya.</i>

591
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,437
<i>Looking out for ya, buddy.</i>

592
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,730
<i>Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.
Don't be mad.</i>

593
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,190
<i>I fucked your ex-girlfriend Kiara.</i>

594
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,274
<i>Who are you talking to, Rick?</i>

595
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,318
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

596
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,569
<i>Hey, Jerry, this is Michael</i>

597
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,029
<i>down at The Antique Phone rentals.</i>

598
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,781
<i>Um, I'm gonna go ahead
and let you off the hook</i>

599
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,324
<i>for the $70 late fee.</i>

600
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,867
<i>You can go ahead and keep
that answering machine.</i>

601
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,202
<i>Nobody really uses those anymore</i>

602
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,412
<i>except for exposition
on TV shows, anyways.</i>
