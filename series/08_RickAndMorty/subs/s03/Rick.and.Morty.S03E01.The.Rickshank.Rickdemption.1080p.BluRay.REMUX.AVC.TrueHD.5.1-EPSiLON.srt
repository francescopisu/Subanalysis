1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,629
Anyway, that's how I escaped
from space prison!

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,005
Oh! Scary place.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,925
Wow, Rick! That's... That's one...
one heck of a story.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,010
I sure do wish I could've been
there to see it happen.

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,054
Oh, come on. Who wants
to watch a mad scientist

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,222
use handmade sci-fi tools

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,015
to take out highly trained alien guards

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,351
when we can sit here and be
a family at Shoney's?

9
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,978
Dad, it's great to have you back,
no matter where we are.

10
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,355
But wouldn't you like to go home?

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,607
Emotionally speaking, honey,
Shoney's <i>is</i> my home.

12
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,234
Yeah, but you just got out of prison.

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,653
I mean, how much
of a step up from that is...

14
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,404
Jerry, get out of the booth,
take all your clothes off,

15
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,990
- and fold yourself 12 times.
- You got it.

16
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,413
Six folds, huh?

17
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,791
W-What, have you guys
got me in a Series 9000?

18
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,793
You cheap insect fucks
didn't think I was worth

19
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:43,794
your best equipment?

20
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,588
Man, I told the money bugs.

21
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,632
I said, "You know
who this guy is, right?

22
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,801
You want me to get intel
out of the smartest mammal

23
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,512
in the galaxy, you'd better
give me a decent brainalyzer."

24
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,264
Well, you might as well order
some pancakes,

25
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,266
because I don't see the need
to leave this part of my brain.

26
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,850
Oh, I think you do.

27
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,019
Eventually, you're either gonna
relax your cerebellum...

28
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:01,853
Shoney's.

29
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,273
...or the Series 9000 is going
to turn it into mush.

30
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,441
Relaxed enough?

31
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,943
I admire you, Rick.

32
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,612
When I...

33
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,197
Rick, here's...

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,244
- What's going on?
- It's hard to tell.

35
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,996
He may have manifested
some sort of butt.

36
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:19,997
He can do that?

37
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,833
He <i>is</i> the smartest man in the universe.

38
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,205
I tell you, the Galactic Federation
taking over Earth...

39
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,207
best thing that's ever
happened to this family.

40
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,917
I just got my sixth
promotion this week,

41
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,377
and I still don't know what I do.

42
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,962
Who cares how high they promote you?

43
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,714
Everyone just gets paid in pills.

44
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,674
Well, when you're not sure
what you do for a living,

45
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,134
<i>you</i> can make your own rules.

46
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,219
Summer, show your father some respect.

47
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,639
He's pulling down
a six-chewable-figure income.

48
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,766
I'll get that in a moment.

49
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,892
How are everyone's pills?

50
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,810
Oh, Morty, you've hardly
touched your pills.

51
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,812
I kind of had big pills
for lunch, and I...

52
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,731
wasn't gonna eat any more pills.

53
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,150
Thank you, Conroy.

54
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,735
You spoil us, Conroy.

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,445
Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this!

56
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,073
Stop saying his name.
He abandoned us.

57
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,366
Willem Dafoe!

58
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,826
T-That's the guy I couldn't
think of this morning.

59
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,119
Don't make my mistake, Summer.

60
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,996
Don't deify the people that leave you.

61
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,249
You'll end up a horse surgeon
in a world controlled by aliens

62
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,586
whose medicine keeps horses...
healthy forever.

63
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,047
Horses live longer than tortoises now!

64
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,215
Is that what you want for yourself?

65
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,093
Maybe I just want you to care
if I run away yelling!

66
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,053
Who saved room for pill brûlée?

67
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,513
Ooh!

68
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,848
I can see why you chose this
family-friendly restaurant

69
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,350
to represent your cerebellum.

70
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,603
So safe, so comfortable, so Shoney's.

71
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,856
But admit it, Rick...
You're going crazy cooped up in here.

72
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,317
- Let's go visit some memories.
- Oh, any particular ones?

73
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,610
You want to see my first boner

74
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,112
or should we go straight to the moment

75
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,531
I discovered interdimensional travel?

76
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,783
Ooh. Your little flappy
doodles are twitching.

77
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,618
Does that mean you're aroused,
or did you just get a signal

78
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,120
that one of your buddies found a grape?

79
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,371
It's arousal.

80
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,456
Yes, I'd like very much
to visit the memory

81
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,791
of you inventing your portal gun.

82
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,210
Yeah. Well, tough titties.

83
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,213
There's no tougher titty
than a psychotic break, Rick.

84
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,259
Well, that depends on who breaks first...
me or the titty.

85
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,304
Someone special you remember?

86
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,973
Is that your memory of her out there...

87
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,391
between where you were on 9/11

88
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,892
and your favorite sports blooper?

89
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,690
If we stay here, you'll die,
along with all your memories.

90
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,109
If you take me where I want to go,

91
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,527
she'll be there, too, won't she?

92
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,822
The day I invented the portal gun
is the day I lost her.

93
00:03:58,947 --> 00:03:59,823
Oh, that sounds cool.

94
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,117
I can get what I want
and you can say goodbye.

95
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,953
Fine, but I'm driving.

96
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,788
...as an excuse to strip
away our freedom.

97
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,793
Huh? What are you...
What are you doing?

98
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,379
Grandpa Rick must have
some secret lab, right?

99
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,257
With, like, laser guns and jets
packs and a space tank!

100
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,800
And we can go break him out of prison!

101
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,968
Look at these dead flies!

102
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,511
Maybe if we arrange them
in a certain order,

103
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,263
it plays a hologram or it
opens a secret door.

104
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,098
Summer, you're freaking me out!

105
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,225
I know things have changed a lot,
and I know you miss Rick,

106
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,352
but getting him back
wouldn't make things better.

107
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,979
And, you know, we're not doing so bad.

108
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,355
We're miserable, Morty!

109
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,734
There's a mandatory curfew,
their weird calendar made me 47,

110
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,652
and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!

111
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,197
I like being 35.
I-I can rent a car now.

112
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,281
Because you suck!

113
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,866
You've been keeping
your lip zipped about it

114
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,785
since Grandpa got arrested,
but the fact is,

115
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,661
you're freaking stoked to bail on him.

116
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,038
He bails on everybody!

117
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,664
He bailed on Mom when she was a kid!

118
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,374
He... He bailed on tiny planet!

119
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,168
And in case I never made
this clear to you, Summer,

120
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,336
he bailed on you.

121
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,254
He left you to rot
in a world that he ruined

122
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,297
because he doesn't care!

123
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,925
Because nobody's special to him,
Summer, not even himself.

124
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,761
So if you really want your
grandpa back, grab a shovel.

125
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,597
The one that won't let you down
is buried in your backyard!

126
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,681
You're right!

127
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,183
What?! No! I'm not right!

128
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,393
I-I was using ghoulish overkill!

129
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,895
Ghoulish overkill, Summer!

130
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,526
Oh, God! Oh, God!

131
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,568
Whoa, whoa!

132
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,615
- Where are we going?
- To the day it all began...

133
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,616
and ended.

134
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,576
The moment that changed everything.

135
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,247
Welcome to McDonald's.
Can I take your order?

136
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,873
Yeah, I'd like to get
a 10-piece McNugget

137
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,875
and, uh, a bunch of the Szechuan sauce.

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,544
Like, as much as you're
allowed to give me.

139
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,547
In 1998, they had this promotion
for the Disney film "Mulan,"

140
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,756
where they... where they...

141
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,591
they created a new sauce
for the McNuggets

142
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,094
called Szechuan sauce,
and it's delicious!

143
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,012
And then they got rid of it,
and now it's gone.

144
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,098
The only place we're gonna be
able to try it is in my memory.

145
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,058
Rick, you're doing this bit
while your brain is melting.

146
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,560
Okay. All right, all right.

147
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,397
Is that...

148
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,773
Me.

149
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,358
I used to wear blue pants.

150
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,824
When'd you make the leap
to interdimensional travel?

151
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,034
I didn't.
<i>I</i> did.

152
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,162
Well, well, well.
If it isn't us.

153
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,331
You know the worst part
about inventing teleportation?

154
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,000
Suddenly you're able to travel
the whole galaxy,

155
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,251
and the first thing you learn is

156
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,253
you're the last guy
to invent teleportation.

157
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,338
Fortunately, you're about
to invent something

158
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,590
much more powerful.

159
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,301
What?

160
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,018
Summer, nobody has to know about that.

161
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,186
We could put it right back
and pretend we never saw it,

162
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,605
like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.

163
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,149
Fine. Stay here.
I'll rescue Grandpa myself.

164
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,901
- How are you gonna do that?!
- I don't know yet.

165
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,486
I'll make it up as I go.
That's what Grandpa Rick does.

166
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,946
That's what heroes do.

167
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,406
You want to see what a hero Rick is?

168
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,617
I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer!

169
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,119
- Um...
- My goodness, children.

170
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,788
Relinquish the illegal technology

171
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,749
to the nearest Federation representative.

172
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:59,002
And then we'll all play Balderdash.

173
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,477
Oh, my goodness!

174
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,395
Oh! Oh! My goo...

175
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,233
Oh, my God.

176
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,611
I have that exact same top.

177
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,112
What is this place?

178
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,948
And what's with "Hunger Games" Summer?

179
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,868
That's my sister.
This used to be my home.

180
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,578
Imagine doing anything you want,

181
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,747
then hopping to a timeline
where you never did it.

182
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,667
Imagine going anywhere, anytime,
with nobody able to stop you.

183
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,627
- Sounds lonely.
- Lonely?

184
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,338
Dude, you have yourself...
your infinite selves.

185
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,381
It's a nonstop party

186
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,508
where all the guests
are the only person we like.

187
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,218
You think it's cool being
the smartest man on Earth,

188
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,678
but once we give you this technology,

189
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,806
you become the smartest thing
in every conceivable universe...

190
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,225
the Infinite Rick, a god.

191
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,309
Enh, pass.

192
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,312
Excuse me?
Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.

193
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,647
Who do you think you are?

194
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,816
A different kind of Rick, I guess.

195
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,651
Well, we'll see how long that lasts.

196
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,740
I heard sci-fi noises.
Did you make a breakthrough?

197
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,992
Sort of.

198
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,576
I just took a long look at myself,

199
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,579
and I don't think this
science thing is gonna pay off.

200
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,874
Well, why don't I get Beth
and we'll go out for ice cream?

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,043
That, Diane, is the last great idea

202
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,379
that will ever be had in this garage.

203
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,135
Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume.

204
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,596
Mom, you're looking... feral.

205
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,224
I can't believe Rick did this.

206
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,726
These are the parts
of Rick's adventures

207
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,270
you don't get to see...
the parts he leaves behind.

208
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,855
All right. It's been great, guys.

209
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,732
Um, I really only wanted
to stop by here

210
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,275
for a quick "I told you so."

211
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,485
- So, uh...
- Looking for this?

212
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,988
- What are you doing with that?!
- It stinks of Rick.

213
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,073
No! Why?!

214
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,074
Why would you do that?!

215
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,076
W-What is the matter with you people?!

216
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,245
You're a bunch of back savages...

217
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,247
backwood savage morons!

218
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,667
You can never leave.
She cannot remain.

219
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,627
She stinks of Rick.

220
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,296
- Aah!
- Aah!

221
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,341
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
I'm Morty C-137.

222
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,511
We detected a compromised portal gun.

223
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,055
- Where is your Rick?
- He's in prison.

224
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,805
Summer.

225
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,348
He got captured by the Federation,

226
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,767
and we were going to rescue him.

227
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,809
Very troubling.

228
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,186
We can't risk Citadel secrets

229
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,729
falling into the Federation's hands.

230
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,564
We'll dispatch S.E.A.L.
Team Ricks immediately

231
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,649
to break into the prison
holding C-137...

232
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,609
Boo-yah.

233
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,110
...and assassinate him.

234
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,279
Boo-nah?

235
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,572
Come on, girls!

236
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,783
The ice cream's gonna melt!

237
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,005
No-o-o-o-o-o-o!

238
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,925
Wow. This sauce is fucking amazing.

239
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,384
You said it was promoting a movie?

240
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,141
Carry the 3, add a 2.

241
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,309
I got it.

242
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,977
I fucking got it!

243
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,480
Whoa. I-Is that it... the portal gun?

244
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,314
Yeah.

245
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,942
That's the three lines of math
that separates my life as a man

246
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,944
from my life as an unfeeling ghost.

247
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,153
Awesome possum.

248
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,073
Mission Control, you getting this?

249
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,449
Holy shit, yes!

250
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,909
Yes! We got it!

251
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:18,910
- Yeah! All right!
- Thanks, Rick.

252
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,829
I'll try to remember
to shut off the brainalyzer.

253
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,206
Actually, I think it
shuts off automatically

254
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,415
once your brain is liquid.

255
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,750
Don't know, don't care.

256
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,794
Pull me out.

257
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,504
Hey, pull me out.
Can you hear me?

258
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,089
Nope, they cannot.

259
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,799
- Why not?
- Because the code you uploaded

260
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,551
wasn't actually my portal-gun formula.

261
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,262
It was a virus giving me
full control over the brainalyzer.

262
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,888
What are you talking about?
This is a memory.

263
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,849
Y-You can't alter details of a memory.

264
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,059
True, but you <i>can</i> alter
anything you want

265
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,770
about a totally fabricated
origin story.

266
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,273
It's a trap! Abort!
I'm still in his Shoney's!

267
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,275
Repeat... We never left his Shoney's!

268
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
Mission accomplished, boys.
Pull me out.

269
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,528
Roger that.

270
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,988
Have fun in what's left of my brain.

271
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,114
I'm gonna transfer to yours.

272
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,408
Oh, there's not enough room
for all my genius,

273
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,451
so I'm leaving you with my fear
of wicker furniture,

274
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,911
my desire to play the trumpet,

275
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,454
my tentative plans to purchase a hat,

276
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,039
and six years of improv workshops.

277
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,791
- Comedy comes in threes.
- It's a trap!

278
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,918
Abort! We never left his...

279
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,130
No!

280
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,259
Another day, another dollar.

281
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,011
Am I a great insect creature or what?!

282
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,220
Congratulations, Agent.

283
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,597
You'll be highly commended for this.

284
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,140
Always wait for permission to

285
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,600
Feel accomplishment... That's my motto.

286
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,185
One thing still perplexes me...

287
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,020
Why would Rick Sanchez turn himself in?

288
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,606
Well, I'm just a dumb-ass bug,
but it's possible Rick knew

289
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,149
he'd be interrogated at this facility,

290
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,775
where we not only keep our most wanted,

291
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,027
but our most sensitive data.

292
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,196
Anyone here with level-9 access could

293
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,989
I don't know.
Collapse the government.

294
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,407
I'm just gonna go take a dump.

295
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,284
Is it cool if I use
the level-9 bathrooms?

296
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,828
W-What's the level-9
master access code again?

297
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,830
Oh, that's easy... 8-3...

298
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,498
Oh, yeah!

299
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,083
S.E.A.L. Team Ricks in the house!

300
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,670
Hi, Rick.

301
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,755
Bye, Rick.

302
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,886
D-99, y-you okay?

303
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,515
I'm bummed I didn't get to give
that insect dick a test drive.

304
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,267
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
T-The Council of Ricks sent us.

305
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,602
We have your Morty and Summer.

306
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,062
They're prisoners on the Citadel.

307
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,146
Great.

308
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,690
Security breach in room 6755.

309
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,524
Lovely.

310
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,486
Not only is my plan screwed up,
I also forgot how to improvise.

311
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,529
All security people approach.

312
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,698
Security breach.

313
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,456
A city of Grandpas?

314
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,958
It's the Citadel of Ricks.

315
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,085
All the different Ricks
from all the different realities

316
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,795
got together to hide here
from the government.

317
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,630
But if every Rick hates the government,

318
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,881
why would they hate Grandpa?

319
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,883
Because Ricks hate themselves the most.

320
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,511
And our Rick is the most... himself.

321
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,679
Not anymore, homey.

322
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,389
S.E.A.L. Team Ricks turned his unibrow

323
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,516
into two brows... with a bullet.

324
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,812
Your Rick's dead!
Your Rick's dead!

325
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,526
Sir, Rick D-99 is returning
from the mission alone.

326
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,153
Apparently, S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
suffered heavy casualties.

327
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,154
Bring him in.

328
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,491
He says he'll only talk to a Rick
with higher clearance.

329
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,535
La-di-da.
Give me that.

330
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,997
D-99, this is the commander
in chief of the Citadel's militia.

331
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,290
Go... Good enough.

332
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,586
He's a spy. Blow him up.
I'm gonna go take a shit.

333
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,714
Operating an unregistered portal gun,

334
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,382
radicalizing a Summer,

335
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,092
conspiring with a traitorous Rick.

336
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,093
How do you plead?

337
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,553
How is this a fair trial?

338
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,179
O-Our lawyer is a Morty!

339
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,515
It's not fair, you have no rights,
and he's not a lawyer.

340
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,225
We just keep him here because he's fun.

341
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,476
Look at him go.

342
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,728
Yeah!

343
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,188
We'll be lenient if you
renounce your Rick.

344
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,690
What say you, Summer?

345
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,609
I say fuck you!
My grandpa was my hero.

346
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,361
You killed him because
you were jealous of him.

347
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,113
That's pretty obvious
from the haircuts.

348
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,407
So do what you want to me,
but let my brother go.

349
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,950
He already renounced Rick.

350
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:46,701
Morty?

351
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,578
What?

352
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,164
N-No, I don't want to see
your pog collection.

353
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,541
I don't renounce Rick,
and I never have.

354
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,044
I was just trying to protect my sister.

355
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,712
I wanted you to have a normal life.

356
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,672
That's something you can't have
when Rick shows up.

357
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,467
Everything real turns fake.
Everything right is wrong.

358
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,886
All you know is that you know nothing
and he knows everything.

359
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,972
And, well...
Well, he's not a villain, Summer,

360
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,766
but he shouldn't be your hero.

361
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,102
He's more like a demon
or a super fucked-up god.

362
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,229
Let's not suck the ghost
of his dick too hard.

363
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,231
He was a terrorist, and now he's dead.

364
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,108
Oh, yeah? If you think
my Rick's dead, he's alive!

365
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,943
And if you think you're safe,
he's coming for you!

366
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,910
Hey! Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing in here?

367
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,329
This area is for teleporting
the entire Citadel

368
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,915
to somewhere else using
only buttons and dials.

369
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,583
Yeah? Well, it's a bad idea

370
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,503
to have it designed
that way then, isn't it?

371
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,593
What the fuck?

372
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,096
We just teleported into
a Galactic federal prison!

373
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,640
I'm gonna go take a shit.

374
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,517
Order in the court!
Whoa! What the hell?!

375
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,518
Oh, my God!

376
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,397
Aah!

377
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no!

378
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,986
Whoa!

379
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,863
Whoa!

380
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:17,250
The Citadel has been teleported
to Federation space.

381
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,961
It's doomed.
This has to be C-137, you guys.

382
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,421
- What are we gonna do?!
- You know he's coming for us.

383
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,673
All right! Calm down!
We have his Summer as a hostage.

384
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:24,924
Obviously, I get her.

385
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,343
You guys play Rick, Laser,
Scissors for the Morty.

386
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,304
W-What the hell is that?

387
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,390
Payback.

388
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,977
Grandpa Rick!

389
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,728
- Duh.
- You're alive!

390
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:38,938
- Rick!
- Morty, take this.

391
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,315
You're gonna need it later.

392
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,195
Hold on. Hold on.
Whoa!

393
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,072
That's enough, Rick.

394
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,824
What... What's this
supposed to accomplish?

395
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,075
We have infinite grandkids.

396
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,661
You're trying to use Disney bucks
at a Caesars Palace here.

397
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,122
That's a bluff.
He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.

398
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,791
You're a rogue Rick...
irrational, passionate.

399
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,544
You love your grandkids.
You came to rescue them.

400
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,463
I came to kill you, bro.

401
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,006
That's not even my original Summer.

402
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,716
Oh, my God. He's not bluffing.
He's not bluffing!

403
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,676
- R-Rick?
- Why not shoot through her?

404
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,928
Twenty yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol.

405
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,473
My first shot would liquify
her insides and injure you,

406
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,765
second shot adds recoil.

407
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,185
The risk to me is minimized
if I wait for you to shoot her,

408
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,603
which I'm encouraging you to do.

409
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,188
- What the fuck?!
- Or let her go,

410
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,856
which I will reward
with a quicker death.

411
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,065
Because you love her!

412
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,319
Because it's incentive for you
to give me my cleanest shot,

413
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,112
which will be your least painful death.

414
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,740
But if you want to die slower
than that, I'm super into it.

415
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,366
All you got to do to get
that started is kill the girl.

416
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,785
- I hate you!
- Not an issue, sweetie.

417
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,829
That's enough!
Drop the gun, Rick!

418
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,581
Morty, I know you're
too stupid to get this,

419
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,208
but you're really fucking
this up right now.

420
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,876
I'm not letting you let my sister die!

421
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:42,877
Drop the gun!

422
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,795
I wasn't gonna let her die,
you fucking moron!

423
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,838
- Ha!
- Aww.

424
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,715
The point is he <i>thought</i> I was going to.

425
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,510
I totally did, by the way.
You're a fucking moron, Morty.

426
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,886
Morty, you fucking idiot!

427
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,721
You're a serious fucking idiot, Morty!

428
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,847
You basically killed us all!

429
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,641
- You're the worst!
- You're dumb as a bag of sand!

430
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,232
Who's stupid now, bitch?!

431
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,025
Morty! We just got him back!

432
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,611
That was amazing, Morty.

433
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,112
Oh, my God. Wow.

434
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,822
Okay. Let's wrap this...

435
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,909
Good job, Morty.
Let's go, kids.

436
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,285
What?! What happened?

437
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,912
Oldest Rick trick in the book.

438
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,956
"Fake gun. Shoot me in standoff."

439
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,541
- Brilliant!
- Ha! Yeah.

440
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,001
G-Good thing I saw that note.

441
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,884
Couldn't we just portal home?

442
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,386
Not until I finish what I started.

443
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,682
And <i>that</i> is how you get level-9
access without a password.

444
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,642
Freeze!

445
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,852
Employee of the month,
ladies and gentlemen.

446
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,021
So what are you doing
with level-9 access anyways?

447
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,815
Destroying the Galactic government.

448
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,941
- Awesome!
- Whoa! Cool!

449
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,985
Are you going to set all their nukes
to target each other?

450
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,736
Ooh, or... or reprogram
their military portals

451
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,321
to disintegrate their
entire space fleet?

452
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,365
Good pitches, kids.
I'm almost proud.

453
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,659
But watch closely as Grandpa
topples an empire

454
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,870
by changing a one... to a zero.

455
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,251
Mr. President, the Blemflarck's
value just dropped to nothing.

456
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,502
What do you mean?

457
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,754
I mean our single centralized
Galactic currency

458
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,633
just went from being worth
one of itself to zero of itself.

459
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,468
- Dear God, no.
- Calm down, people.

460
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,596
Deploy the Galactic militia
and declare martial law.

461
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,597
Yes, sir.

462
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,432
Uh, what should I pay them with?

463
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,518
Their payment is the honor
they'll feel to serve their...

464
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,645
Wait. Who's paying me
to yell at this guy?

465
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,064
I can answer that... for money.

466
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,566
I never thought I'd live
to see this day.

467
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,900
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

468
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,486
There's a solution here
you're not seeing.

469
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,533
- Give me your jacket!
- Give me those pants!

470
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,335
I want more jackets!

471
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,004
He who controls the pants
controls the galaxy!

472
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,230
No longer will the insects have
domain over surface world!

473
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,449
Jerry, what the hell is happening?!

474
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,284
The Galactic government collapsed.

475
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,744
- Are you okay?
- Look.

476
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,329
I'm not proud to share this,
but the truth is,

477
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,247
I just kept crawling,
and it kept working.

478
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,208
Oh, I'm glad you're okay.

479
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,087
Are we ever going to stop paying
for indulging your father?

480
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,923
Our children, our planet, our jobs.

481
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,549
Is there anything left to lose?

482
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,885
Just each other,
and I'll never let you go.

483
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,013
And I'm so sorry I ever did this to us.

484
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,808
Guess who dismantled the government.

485
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,935
- Please don't leave me again.
- I never will, baby.

486
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,812
I was right!
He turned himself in on purpose!

487
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,397
It was all part of his plan!

488
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,815
Jerry, is there any light beer left?

489
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,608
It's insane what you miss in prison.

490
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,485
Um, okay. No.

491
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,570
No, no, no.
Foot-down time.

492
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,114
No. You're right.
Where's the vodka?

493
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,783
Beth, it's him or me!

494
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,330
Seems like you guys need some privacy.

495
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,457
I'll, uh, I'll be in the garage.

496
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,004
What the fuck?!
Not cool, Jerry!

497
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,424
A man's garage is his castle.

498
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:28,436
Jerry's going to spend
some time... divorced.

499
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,396
Oh. Oh, I-I'm sorry
to hear that, sweetie.

500
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,106
I hope I had nothing to do with that.

501
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,608
Oh, God. Dad, that is not
your burden to bear.

502
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,445
I feel terrible that I misjudged you.

503
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,155
This is gonna be good for Jerry.

504
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,198
- For everybody.
- For everybody.

505
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,410
I better tend to Jerry

506
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,079
before he changes his mind
and doesn't move out.

507
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,165
I will leave you two
to your adventures.

508
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,082
Oh, my God.

509
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,376
Nancy says they're drawing
and quartering aliens

510
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,544
in the school courtyard,

511
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,838
and it technically counts
as patriotism.

512
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,799
Geez! Are my parents seriously
gonna get divorced?

513
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,134
All right, Rick.
I'm gonna go to my... Gah!

514
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,969
Not so fast, Morty.
You heard your mom.

515
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,638
We've got adventures to go on,
Morty, just you and me.

516
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,682
And sometimes your sister
and sometimes your mom,

517
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,725
but never your dad.

518
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,852
You want to know why, Morty?
Because he crossed me.

519
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,687
Okay. Take it easy, Rick.
T-That's dark.

520
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,980
Oh, it gets darker, Morty.

521
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,065
Welcome to the darkest
year of our adventures.

522
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,275
First thing that's different...

523
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,526
- no more Dad, Morty.
- Oh, geez.

524
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,069
He threatened to turn me in
to the government,

525
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,946
so I made him and the government
go away.

526
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:21,864
Oh, fuck.

527
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,825
I've replaced them both
as the de facto patriarch

528
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,660
of your family and your universe.

529
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,828
Your mom wouldn't have accepted me

530
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,371
if I came home without you
and your sister,

531
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,290
so now you know the real
reason I rescued you.

532
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,708
I just took over the family, Morty,

533
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,543
and if you tell your mom
or sister I said any of this,

534
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,212
I'll deny it, and they'll take my side

535
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,296
because I'm a hero, Morty.

536
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,507
Now you're gonna have to go
and do whatever I say, Morty,

537
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,341
Forever!

538
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,218
And I'll... I'll go out and I'll find
some more of that

539
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,095
"Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki
dipping sauce, Morty.

540
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,430
- What are you talking about?
- Because that's...

541
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,765
that's what this is all about, Morty!

542
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,350
- Szechuan?
- That's my one-armed man!

543
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,310
I'm not driven by avenging
my dead family, Morty!

544
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,311
That was fake!

545
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,396
I-I'm driven by finding
that McNugget sauce.

546
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,148
I want that "Mulan"
McNugget sauce, Morty!

547
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,858
- That's my series arc, Morty!
- What the hell?

548
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,069
If it takes nine seasons,
I want my McNugget dipping sauce...

549
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,029
- Szechuan sauce, Morty.
- What are you talking about?

550
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,072
That's what's gonna take us

551
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,115
- all the way to the end, Morty.
- What are you talking about?!

552
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,367
Nine more seasons, Morty.

553
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,911
Nine more seasons until I get
that dipping Szechuan sauce.

554
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,663
- What is that?!
- For 97 more years, Morty!

555
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:11,664
What are you talking about?!

556
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,749
I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!

557
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:49,952
Is it ready?

558
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,745
Yes. We can bring it online now.

559
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:52,955
Do it.

560
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,295
I am Phoenix Person.

561
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,963
Phoenix Person?
Is that what we settled on?

562
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,965
I thought we all agreed on Cyber Bird.

563
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,925
Y-You said you didn't care
what he was called

564
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,343
as long as we brought him back.

565
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,803
Yeah, but Phoenix Person?

566
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,263
Fine. Fuck it.
Who cares?

567
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,143
Ka-kaw!
