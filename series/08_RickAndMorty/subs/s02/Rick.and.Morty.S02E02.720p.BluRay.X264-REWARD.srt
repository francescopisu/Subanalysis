1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,044
Learning to fly this thing, Morty,

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,087
is gonna be really liberating.

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,588
You know, you're gonna be free

4
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,006
to go on all kinds of errands for me.
Cool.

5
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,257
See that planet right there?

6
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,884
Don't fly too close
to that planet.

7
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,344
Someone will come out and
try to wash your windshield.

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,430
Hold on.

9
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,890
Yeah? Yeah, I have it.

10
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,225
Where do you want to meet?

11
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,393
All right, cool.

12
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,852
All right, Morty, lesson's over.

13
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,187
We got some business
to attend to

14
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,480
a few light minutes
south of here.

15
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,981
Oh, you still use
south in space?

16
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,066
Whoa! Jesus, Jerry!

17
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,651
What the hell
are you doing here?!

18
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,819
What are you talking about?

19
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,487
We agreed a boy's father
should be present

20
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,571
when he's learning to drive.

21
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,073
I guess I remember that.

22
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,908
Wow. And you've just been
back there this whole time?

23
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:34,992
Amazing.

24
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,078
Well, we don't have time
to take him to Earth, Morty.

25
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,247
Head for 3924917.

26
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,623
Cool!

27
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,042
Looks like I'm coming along
for an adventure!

28
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:44,419
Yep.

29
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,463
This is where we're going?

30
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,548
Nope.

31
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,258
This is.

32
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,926
You can park in
a handicap spot, Morty.

33
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,344
Anything with
less than eight limbs

34
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,722
is considered disabled here.

35
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,354
Well, look at this fella.
Aren't you handsome?

36
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,522
Thank you.

37
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,066
- I'm Jerry.
- Oh, I know you are.

38
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,527
Did you come here
in a spaceship?

39
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,071
I'm traveling with my son
and father-in-law.

40
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,406
W-wait. Are they coming?

41
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,615
Oh, they'll be back soon.

42
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,783
What?!

43
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,580
I don't know how this works!

44
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,539
Help me!

45
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,291
What the hell?!

46
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,625
I know, right?

47
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,127
Oh, what the hell?!

48
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,462
I know, right?

49
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,671
Jerryboree!?

50
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,465
You created
a day care for my Dad?

51
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,467
Are you kidding?
I wish I had this idea.

52
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,135
Well, I did have this idea,

53
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,429
but I wish I was the version
of me that owned it.

54
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,139
That guy's rich.

55
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,724
Don't forget to check
the reason for your drop-off.

56
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,351
Trust me, Morty, I've heard
stories from other Ricks.

57
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,021
Jerrys don't tend to last
five minutes off of earth.

58
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,732
This is a totally unregistered
cross-temporal asteroid.

59
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,401
Here, they can romp and
play with other Jerrys.

60
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,527
He couldn't be safer.

61
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,154
Hey, Morty, hang on to this.

62
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,655
That number's your dad.

63
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,699
If you lose it, we're not gonna
be able to get him back.

64
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,450
- Okay, wait here.
- I want to come with.

65
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,160
Don't come with. It's boring.

66
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,537
It's... it's business stuff.

67
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,247
What kind of business
do you do in a garage?

68
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,540
You know, this seems
a little shady.

69
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,500
Right, yeah, like nothing
shady ever happened

70
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,668
in a fully furnished office?

71
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,378
You ever hear
about Wall Street, Morty?

72
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,587
Y-you know what those guys do

73
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,339
in... in...
In their fancy boardrooms?

74
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,341
They take their balls
and they dip them in cocaine

75
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,676
and wipe them
all over each other.

76
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,927
You know, Grandpa goes around,

77
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,804
and he does
his business in public,

78
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,556
because Grandpa isn't shady.

79
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,974
Aw, crap.

80
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:03,975
Hey, what's up?

81
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,601
Hey, Rick!

82
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,436
Here you go... 3,000 flerbos.

83
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,688
Do you have the weapon?

84
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,814
C-can we please?

85
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,566
This is my grandson, Morty.

86
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,317
Oh, hi, Morty.
I'm Krombopulos Michael.

87
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,486
I'm an assassin.
I buy guns from your grandpa.

88
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,737
Here. Go away.

89
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,406
Ooh! Yeah, this looks deadly.

90
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,824
So, this shoots antimatter?

91
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,285
My target can't be killed
with regular matter.

92
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,578
Nice to meet you, Morty.

93
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,704
Listen, if you ever need
anybody murdered,

94
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,497
please give me a call.

95
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,540
- I'm very discreet.
- You're g-giving him a card?!

96
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,791
I have no code of ethics.

97
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,585
I will kill anyone, anywhere...

98
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,337
Children, animals, old people...
Doesn't matter.

99
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,630
I just love killing.

100
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,883
You sell weapons
to killers for money?

101
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,302
You've got what
the intergalactic call

102
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,803
a very planetary
mind-set, Morty.

103
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,680
It's more complicated out here.

104
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,973
These are flerbos.

105
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,933
Do you understand what
two humans can accomplish

106
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,977
- with 3,000 of these?
- Uh, what?

107
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,481
An entire afternoon
at Blips and Chitz!

108
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,858
Oh, this place is the best.

109
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,610
It's got beer, games, prizes,

110
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,737
and you can never tell
what time it is.

111
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,656
You sold a gun to a murderer
so you could play video games?!

112
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,618
Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend
all day shuffling words around,

113
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,578
you can make anything
sound bad, Morty.

114
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,455
Here, check this out.

115
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,124
Aah!

116
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,417
Roy, what's wrong?

117
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,793
I had a nightmare.

118
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,879
I was with an old man.

119
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,756
He put a helmet on me.

120
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,008
It's just a fever.
Get some sleep.

121
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,093
I don't want you
missing school on Monday.

122
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,014
I want you kids
to look around you today

123
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,933
and think about your future.

124
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,769
Now is the time in your life
when anything is possible.

125
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,895
Spiraling perfectly!

126
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,521
It's gonna be caught
by Roy Parsons!

127
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,648
Roy Parsons is at the 20!

128
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:34,774
Now he's at the 10!

129
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,609
Nothing can stop
Roy "The Rocket"!

130
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,611
Touchdown!

131
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,738
I just think
it's time to get realistic.

132
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,491
Have you talked to my father
about the Carpet Store?

133
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,575
Roy?

134
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,915
Had we caught it sooner...
Well, hindsight is 20/20, Roy.

135
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,417
What's important
is that we move quickly.

136
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,796
I'm not ready to die.

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,047
You're not going to.

138
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,844
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

139
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,599
Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy.

140
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,813
Hey, Roy, you pulled
those Persian off-white shags

141
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,189
for the clearance sale?

142
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,944
Whoa. Sh... shit!

143
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,070
Oh!

144
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,114
Whoa! What the hell?!

145
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,657
W-w-where am I?!

146
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,158
- What in the hell?!
- 55 years. Not bad, Morty.

147
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,827
You kind of wasted
your 30s, though,

148
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,161
with that
whole bird-watching phase.

149
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,204
W-where's my wife?!

150
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,580
Morty, you were just
playing a game.

151
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,540
It's called "Roy."

152
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,416
Snap out of it. Come on.

153
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,334
I'm Morty. You're Rick.

154
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,211
Hey! You sold a gun
to a guy that kills people!

155
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,796
Look at this... you beat cancer,

156
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,756
and then you went back
to work at the carpet store?

157
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,757
Boo!

158
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,175
D-don't dodge the issue, Rick!

159
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,845
Selling a gun to a hit man is
the same as pulling the trigger!

160
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,430
It's also the same
as doing nothing.

161
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,306
If Krombopulos Michael
wants someone dead,

162
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,267
there's not a lot
anyone can do to stop him.

163
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,768
That's why he does it
for a living.

164
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,563
Now excuse me. It's time
to thrash your "Roy" score.

165
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,440
You know, you could stop this
killing from happening, Rick!

166
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,275
You know, you did a bad thing
selling that gun,

167
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,110
but you could undo it
if you wanted.

168
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,278
Uh-huh, yeah,
that's the difference

169
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,696
between you and me, Morty.

170
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,114
I never go back
to the carpet store.

171
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,323
Holy shit!

172
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,616
This guy's taking
Roy off the grid!

173
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,995
This guy doesn't have a
social security number for Roy!

174
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,127
Hi. I'm sorry.

175
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,545
I think there was
a misunderstanding.

176
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,547
I'm an adult and would like
to go home, please.

177
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,884
Well, of course.
Right through that tube.

178
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,469
Unbelievable.

179
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,513
You're doing great.

180
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,265
I know how to crawl in a tube.

181
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,684
Come on.

182
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:34,727
Oh.

183
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,936
This is harder than it looks.

184
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,021
Whoa!

185
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,066
- Marco?
- Polo!

186
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,400
Marco?

187
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,902
Come find me.

188
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,070
Marco?

189
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,362
You guys are enjoying this?

190
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,406
Don't you feel
a little patronized?

191
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,365
How so?

192
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,950
- Jerry!
- Beth.

193
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,744
Oh, come on. This is ridiculous.

194
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,080
I love you, Jerry.

195
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,748
Aw, Beth.

196
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,417
Who wants to come watch
"Midnight Run"

197
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,961
with Director's commentary on?

198
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,463
- Yeah!
- Definitely.

199
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,382
First one there gets to adjust
the picture setting!

200
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,718
The factory tint setting
is always too high!

201
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:08,803
Out of my way.

202
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,012
The tint setting
is always too high.

203
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,029
Oh, boy.
Here I go killing again.

204
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,952
Aah!

205
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,080
Aah!

206
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,377
Arh!

207
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,297
Aah!

208
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,927
Aah!

209
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,567
You have arrived
at Krombopulos Michael.

210
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,277
Your destination is below.

211
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,696
We're all out
of off-white Persian.

212
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,615
Oh, man! W-w-what have I done?!

213
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,325
- Drop the gun.
- You don't understand!

214
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,660
This guy was gonna kill someone!

215
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,453
I guess that makes two of us.

216
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,581
Aah!

217
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,624
What are you doing, Morty?

218
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,084
This is a Galactic
Federation outpost!

219
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,378
Look, I don't have time
to tell you my entire backstory,

220
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,046
but Grandpa and government
don't get along.

221
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,715
He saved my life.

222
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,300
- What?
- Huh?! Whoa!

223
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,760
Are you
Krombopulos Michael's target?

224
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,970
W-what's your name?

225
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,972
My kind has no use for names.

226
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,601
I communicate through what
you call "Jessica's Feet"...

227
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,352
No, "Telepathy."

228
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,478
Oh, good job, Morty.

229
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,022
Y-you killed my best customer,

230
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,940
but you saved
a mind-reading Fart.

231
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,859
I like this name... Fart.

232
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,903
Morty, would you
kindly release me

233
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,572
by pulling that lever
to the left of my cell?

234
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,490
I am in great pain.

235
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,534
Morty, don't do it.

236
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,619
Morty...

237
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,746
Morty, you idiot.

238
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,414
Oh, crap.
Let's get you out of here!

239
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,041
We can't get him out of here.
He's gaseous.

240
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,959
He's not gonna make it
through a portal, Morty.

241
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,878
Well, then, I guess we're all
getting in the car.

242
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,296
- Right, uh...
- Fart.

243
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,089
No! Just...
J-just get in the car!

244
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,174
Morty, come on.

245
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,592
I want to go back
to Blips and Chitz.

246
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,718
I don't want to deal with this.

247
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,969
Rick, you've been clear
on the fact

248
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,638
that you don't want to help,
so just go away.

249
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,348
More are coming.

250
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,308
Screw this. I'm out.

251
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,189
Whoa! Come on, come on!

252
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,150
Get out of the vehicle made
of garbage or we will open fire!

253
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,527
Um, um, um, um!

254
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,904
Open fire!

255
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,239
Aah!

256
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,794
Stupid-ass, Fart-saving,
carpet-store motherfucker. Move!

257
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,545
Wait, did you fuck
with my seat settings?

258
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,925
More are coming.

259
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,261
Rick!

260
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,470
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,647
Your geldon convertor
is pretty dinged up.

262
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,608
That's because my grandson
drives like a male Obravadian.

263
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,194
Yeah, I said it... some
stereotypes are based in fact.

264
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,613
Actually, it's because
of years of neglect.

265
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,032
You really need to respect
your gears, Rick.

266
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,575
To you, they're just
wheels with teeth,

267
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,786
but in my culture,
wars have been fought...

268
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,579
So I've heard. Just fix it.

269
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,581
I don't think the Gromflamites
can track us now,

270
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,625
but it looks like we're gonna
be here for a while.

271
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,378
Or, you know, if you still have
that gun K. Michael dropped,

272
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,255
we could finish the job
and go home.

273
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,048
You do understand
I'm telepathic, right

274
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,341
I'm being polite.

275
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,218
Rick, we're taking him back
where he belongs.

276
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,678
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

277
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,263
Are you going on a quest
to find he who smelt it?

278
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,724
I came here
accidentally through a wormhole

279
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,893
located in what you call
"Get out of my head, Fart.

280
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,187
I know you're in here.
La-la-la-la..."

281
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,982
No, in what you call
the Promethean Nebula.

282
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,152
Oh, great. Just a hop, skip,
and an 800-light-year jump.

283
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,654
You know, you can leave
anytime you want, Rick.

284
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,531
Whatever you want to do, you
little punk-ass little bitch.

285
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,907
Thank you, Morty.

286
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,744
You are not like other
carbon-based life-forms.

287
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,204
You put the value of all
life above your own.

288
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,748
It's how things should be.

289
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:06,874
It's how they could be.

290
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,084
I could not agree more.

291
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,879
# The worlds can be
one together #

292
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,673
# Cosmos without hatred #

293
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:18,427
# Stars like diamonds
in your eyes #

294
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,640
# The ground can be space #

295
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,019
# Space, space, space, space #

296
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,441
# With feet marching towards
a peaceful sky #

297
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:38,697
# All the moon men
want things their way #

298
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,411
# But we make sure
they see the sun #

299
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:51,418
# Goodbye, moon men #

300
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:58,342
# You say goodbye, moon men #

301
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,761
# Goodbye... #

302
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,137
Shut the fuck up about moon men!

303
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,430
This isn't a musical number.

304
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,099
This is a fucking operation.

305
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,434
We got to be cool
and fucking lay low.

306
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,064
Duck, duck, birdie?

307
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,525
That's very funny!

308
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,069
Here comes another funny.

309
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,782
Oh, this place is great.

310
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,076
I almost wish I could stay
longer than one day.

311
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,411
You just might.

312
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,537
W-what do you mean?

313
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,874
These are the Jerrys whose Ricks
and Mortys never came back.

314
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,089
They live here now.

315
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,173
Uh.

316
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,396
No gear-turnings as of yet
in the curious case

317
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,440
of these unidentified
humanoid fugitives,

318
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,984
reportedly at large somewhere
within the gear system.

319
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,235
Son of a...

320
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,195
Why were the Gromflamites
holding you prisoner?

321
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,947
What the fuck
is so valuable about you?

322
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,408
I am no more valuable
than life itself.

323
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,536
However, I am able to alter
the composition of atoms,

324
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,829
like this.

325
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,540
That was oxygen.

326
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,542
I added 71 protons to it.

327
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,545
Terrific.
The Fart that pooped gold.

328
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,797
No wonder every cop in
the system is looking for us.

329
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,591
Any species that gets
ahold of this thing

330
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,426
is gonna use it
to take over the galaxy.

331
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,553
You know how inconvenient
that's gonna be to my work?

332
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,725
Somebody dropped the dime on us.

333
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,767
Gearhead!

334
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,019
I'm sorry, Rick.

335
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,354
The reward on your head
is too high.

336
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,731
And like you always say,

337
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,858
you got to look out
for number one.

338
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,568
Number one is me, asshole!

339
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,986
You're supposed to be my friend!

340
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,239
Friend?!
Do you even know my real name?

341
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,034
It's Revolio Clockberg Junior.

342
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,661
I belong to an entire
species of gear people.

343
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,996
Calling me "Gearhead"

344
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,166
is like calling
a Chinese person "Asia face."

345
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,459
No! Not twigs!

346
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,257
Two things I want to make clear
to everybody in this room...

347
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,384
Never betray me,
and it's time to go.

348
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,390
Nobody move!

349
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,977
Oh, my god. Are those...

350
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,208
Hey, Morty, remember
when you said

351
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,252
selling a gun was as bad
as pulling the trigger?

352
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,586
How do you feel
about all these people

353
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,630
that are getting killed today
because of your choices?

354
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,131
I did the right thing, Rick!

355
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,509
- Tell that to Gearhead's gearsticles.
- You did that!

356
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,928
Wrong! I'd be playing
"Roy" right now.

357
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,305
At a certain point,
my hands are tied, Morty.

358
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,060
I can't believe Rick did this.

359
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,229
This is the eighth to the last straw.
Ante up.

360
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,730
You know what? Screw it!

361
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,649
I have a better gamble
for you guys.

362
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,652
I say we escape.

363
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,029
If you want to leave, you can
just go out the front door.

364
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,115
You think we're kept here
against our will?

365
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,825
That would be illegal.

366
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,911
But if you can leave,
then why are you still here?

367
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,372
Same reason as you.

368
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,873
We're Jerrys.

369
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,168
I'm leaving.

370
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,921
Okay, then.
That was always allowed.

371
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,054
Morty, take the wheel!

372
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:32,973
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

373
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,141
Geez! Damn it, Morty!

374
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,392
Who taught you
to fly this thing?

375
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,269
I'm kidding.
I know that's on me.

376
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,146
Um, Rick!

377
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,188
Shit.

378
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,315
Well, I guess this is it.

379
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,317
Morty, crack the window.

380
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,409
I wonder why Greg is always
so critical of my girlfriend.

381
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,120
Well, he'd probably like
to have me to himself.

382
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,496
That's how friends are.

383
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,042
Or does he want her to himself?

384
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,878
# The worlds can be
one together #

385
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,964
# Cosmos without hatred #

386
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,843
# Stars like diamonds
in your eyes #

387
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,012
My life is a fucking joke!

388
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:17,100
# Goodbye, moon men #

389
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:24,399
# You say goodbye, moon men #

390
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:30,989
# Goodbye, moon men #

391
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,078
All right. Let's proceed.

392
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,204
Damn.

393
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,164
Can't blame that on the dog.

394
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,582
Talk about silent but deadly.

395
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,334
I-I've seen some nerve gas,

396
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,628
but that... this gas got nerve!

397
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,088
You know what I'm saying?

398
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,631
- Are you done?
- I'll let you know, Morty.

399
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,341
Gone with the wind! Am I right?!

400
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,093
If you don't like
that one, Morty,

401
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,470
an alt on that could be, like,
if I said "Gasablanca"!

402
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,638
All right, I'm done.

403
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,391
Let's get
to the Promethean Nebula,

404
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,226
so my grandson can
finish saving a life!

405
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,403
Glagga blag blag.

406
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,488
Um, Earth, please?

407
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,118
Is this... do I pay?

408
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,244
Agga blag blag blag!

409
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,331
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry!

410
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,127
Ohh.

411
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,670
Hmm.

412
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,671
Mm, hey.

413
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,089
Aah!

414
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,508
Agga blag blag?

415
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,676
Oh, uh, hey. What?

416
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,386
- Agga blag!
- Uh, what do you want?

417
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,304
- Agga blag blag...
- Ohh!

418
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,431
Uh...

419
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,665
Hey. Are you the one that left?

420
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,543
I get it.

421
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,503
It's a...
It's a hassle out there.

422
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,173
Right? And who needs that?

423
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,466
- Right?
- Right?

424
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,301
- Not me.
- Who needs that?

425
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,302
Ho, ho! Not us.

426
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,720
Uh, who are you?

427
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,306
Oh, excuse me. Paul Fleischman.

428
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,766
Infinite timelines.

429
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,309
In some of them, Beth remarries.

430
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,393
- Geez.
- Don't worry.

431
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,770
I treat Beth very well,

432
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,855
and I do not overstep
my bounds with Morty.

433
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,733
Every kid needs a dad,
but there's no replacing you.

434
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,443
Hey, you want to
give us a hand with this?

435
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,278
We're trying to figure out
how to get the sound

436
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,821
coming through the stereo
instead of the TV.

437
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,490
I-I-It's very difficult.

438
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,825
Oh! Uh, well,
is there an aux input?

439
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,161
We tried that, but there's
two different colors.

440
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,621
But there's
two different colors.

441
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,837
The wormhole is
70 of what you call "meters"

442
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,340
what you call "North"
of what you call "Here."

443
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,343
Fine. Morty, take your Fart to
his hole and say your goodbyes.

444
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,304
I'm gonna find some fuel
and take a big, fat Morty.

445
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,807
That's my new word for shit
because of today's events.

446
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,689
Here it is.

447
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,359
This should take me
back to my kind.

448
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,903
I'm gonna miss you, um, Fart.

449
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,655
I'm really sorry
your name became Fart.

450
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,324
- I will be back soon, Morty.
- Really?

451
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,952
After I return to the others
with this location,

452
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,912
we will be back
for your cleansing.

453
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,705
Um, cleansing?

454
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,708
Carbon-based life
is a threat to all higher life.

455
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,253
To us, you are
what you would call a disease.

456
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,296
Wherever we discover you,
we cure it.

457
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,715
You said yourself
that life must be protected,

458
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,509
even though sacrifice.

459
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,803
You haven't changed your
mind about that.

460
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,013
I can sense your thoughts.

461
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,098
Morty?

462
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,395
Um, before you go,
could you sing a...

463
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,688
C-could you sing for me again?

464
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,606
Yes, Morty.

465
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,609
# Cosmos without hatred #

466
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,904
# Diamond stars
of cosmic light #

467
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:02,742
# Quasars shine
through endless night #

468
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:08,957
# And everything is one
in the beauty #

469
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,751
# And now we say goodbye #

470
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,836
Aah!

471
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:18,049
Morty, why? Why?

472
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Goodbye.

473
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,685
So, did you guys make out
a little bit?

474
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,645
Is he gonna send you a postcard?

475
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,607
Man, that guy hit the lottery
when he crossed paths with you.

476
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,484
Morty, I know I picked on
your core beliefs

477
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,903
and decision making a lot today,

478
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,029
but I am glad that you insisted

479
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,739
on getting that Fart home.

480
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:41,948
You know, at least
all the death and destruction

481
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,825
wasn't for nothing, you know?

482
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,494
You miss your Fart friend, huh?

483
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,079
Well, I got a little surprise
for you, buddy.

484
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,831
While you were gone,
I found a new wormhole

485
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,791
with millions of beings just
like him on the other side,

486
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,001
and they're all coming to visit.

487
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,628
What?! Rick, no! You can't!

488
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:55,879
Too late, Morty.
The hole's opening.

489
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,339
No, Rick! You don't understand.

490
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,176
There's... there's a lot more
where that came from, too.

491
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,140
Hey, hey, bro, how many people

492
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,059
was your Morty responsible
for killing today?

493
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,102
None. We chilled
at Blips and Chitz all day.

494
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,520
Ain't that right, homey?

495
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,773
Darn right, bro! "Roy" rules!

496
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,192
Must be nice.

497
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,611
Hey, Morty, there's our Jerry.

498
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,072
Mm! I missed you. Hey, Rick.

499
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,281
Glad you're safe, Jerry.

500
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,992
What do you say we go home?
I'd like that.

501
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,078
Hey, wait. Uh, do you have 5126?

502
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,664
Uh, I'm not sure. Morty.

503
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,624
Uh, that's
a Blips and Chitz ticket.

504
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,501
- What?!
- Way to go, Morty.

505
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,752
Eh, whatever.

506
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,754
- Uh, w-wait. What?
- Uh, w-wait. What?

507
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,381
Come on, Jerry. All right.
Come on, Jerry.

508
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,123
Are you tired
of the same daily droll?

509
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,417
Well, get on over
to Blips and Chitz!

510
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,377
We got, uh, one game.

511
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,795
We got a whole bunch
of games here.

512
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,339
You can... we got
Chabos and Flobos,

513
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,674
and you can shoot things!

514
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,884
Get over here! Play the games!

515
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,845
Uh, use your flerbos
to get tickets!

516
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,097
"Roy 2" just got here.

517
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,391
Get over here at Jitz and Chitz!

518
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,101
It's the coolest place
in the world.

519
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,478
Uh, I get to be
in the commercial!

520
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,066
Did you get any of that?

521
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,235
It's a good show.
