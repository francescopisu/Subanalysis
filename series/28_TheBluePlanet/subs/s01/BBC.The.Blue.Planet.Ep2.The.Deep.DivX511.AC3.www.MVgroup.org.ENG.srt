1
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:36,198
0ver 60 per cent of our planet

2
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,961
is covered by ocean
more than a mile deep.

3
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:40,606
That, the deep sea,

4
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,725
is by far the largest habitat
on Earth

5
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:45,878
and it's largely unknown.

6
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:52,800
join us on a journey

7
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,083
to the very bottom of the deep sea,

8
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:58,444
to an alien world
never revealed before.

9
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:03,759
it's home to some
of the strangest animals on Earth.

10
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,922
Fish flash in the darkness.

11
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:14,682
New species are discovered

12
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:16,644
on almost every dive.

13
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:20,401
More people have travelled
into space

14
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,558
than have ventured this deep.

15
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:33,645
Come on a journey

16
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:35,286
into the abyss.

17
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,198
A sperm whale takes a breath,

18
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,722
its last for over an hour.

19
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:54,357
it's about to leave
the warm, well-lit surface waters

20
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:56,518
and dive far down

21
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:59,599
into the cold, dark depths
of the deep ocean.

22
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:01,526
At the surface

23
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:05,236
it took in air at the same pressure
as we breath it.

24
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:12,318
But it's going to look for food

25
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:14,478
at more than 1,000 metres down,

26
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:17,719
where pressure is 100 times
that on the surface,

27
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,684
crushing the whale's lungs

28
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,156
to just one per cent
of their volume.

29
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:25,918
For us to follow the whale,

30
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:28,476
we need the very latest submersible.

31
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:33,123
A reinforced acrylic sphere

32
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:37,485
with walls 12 centimetres thick
protects a pilot and our cameraman

33
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,877
from the enormous pressure below,

34
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,481
and allows the submarine to dive

35
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:44,524
to just over 900 metres.

36
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,120
(PILOT) 900 feet,

37
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:48,084
With every passing metre,

38
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:49,680
pressure increases

39
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:51,803
and sunlight diminishes.

40
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,162
(PILOT) 1,000 feet,

41
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:57,676
By 300 metres,
it's already very dark

42
00:02:57,847 --> 00:03:00,042
and the temperature of the water

43
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,925
is dropping fast.

44
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:09,327
We are entering the twilight zone,

45
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,478
a weird world of gloom

46
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:15,196
where many animals have become
completely transparent.

47
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:21,926
in this twilight,

48
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:23,759
and animal needs to see,

49
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:27,158
and yet, as far as possible,
must avoid being seen.

50
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,965
A giant amphipod,

51
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:37,597
12 centimetres long
and almost perfectly transparent.

52
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,997
its head is completely filled

53
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:41,839
by two huge eyes

54
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:44,726
with which it strains
to detect its prey.

55
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:50,721
Another twilight monster, phronima,

56
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:53,720
the inspiration
for the Alien movies.

57
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:58,359
She and her developing
pink offspring

58
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:01,678
live like parasites
in the stolen body of a jelly.

59
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:07,203
This impressive cutlery set

60
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,800
and its huge eyes

61
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:11,401
make phronima a powerful predator.

62
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,558
Even really complex animals

63
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,719
have become transparent
in the twilight zone.

64
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:27,237
Squids are among
the most advanced of invertebrates,

65
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:31,082
but this one never meets
a hard surface in its entire life,

66
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:35,604
so its body need not be as robust
as that of its shallow water cousins.

67
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,516
There's a rich variety of jellies

68
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:44,440
that live nowhere else
but in the deep sea.

69
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:55,565
Thousands of tiny cilia propel them
through a world without walls.

70
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:05,804
invisible in the gloom,

71
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,401
they grope blindly for their prey.

72
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:18,917
Comb jellies let out long sticky
nets to catch passing copepods.

73
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:26,681
But the most extensive death trap

74
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,838
is set by siphonophores.

75
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:33,278
This pulsating bell
is the head of a colonial jelly

76
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:35,438
that can be 40 metres long.

77
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,237
Millions of tiny stinging cells

78
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,398
drifting through the sea.

79
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:52,926
500 metres down,

80
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:56,238
and in even
the clearest tropical waters

81
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:59,717
only the faintest vestige
of the sunlight remains -

82
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:03,436
so little that our eyes
can't detect it, but others can.

83
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:11,363
Survival in the twilight zone

84
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,279
is all about seeing,

85
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,119
yet not being seen.

86
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:19,686
Hatchet fish

87
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,407
are masters of the game
of hide and seek.

88
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:26,401
They have the large, sensitive eyes
needed for seeking prey

89
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,683
but their bodies are flat...

90
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:34,121
and their sides are highly silvered.

91
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:42,357
Head on, they are just visible,
thin though they are,

92
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,518
but as soon as they turn,

93
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,166
their mirrored sides

94
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:49,717
reflect the remnants of blue light
from the surface,

95
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:52,117
and they disappear into the gloom.

96
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,836
Viewed from the side,
whole shoals can hide in this way,

97
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,237
but what about from below?

98
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,560
The tubular eyes

99
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:07,446
of many of the predators,
even in this gloom,

100
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,837
are able to distinguish their prey

101
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:13,636
silhouetted against the faint
glimmer of light from above.

102
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:19,323
Hatchet fish, however,
have a way of confusing any eyes

103
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:22,160
that might be searching for them
from below.

104
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:25,797
Their bellies carry rows
of light-producing cells

105
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,480
called photophores.

106
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:30,446
They can use these

107
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:35,317
to exactly match the changing colour
of light from the surface far above.

108
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:47,757
This counter shading
breaks up their silhouette,

109
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:50,760
making them almost invisible
from below...

110
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:52,766
almost.

111
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:01,798
But these are no ordinary eyes.

112
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:09,080
The enormous yellow lenses
enable their owner to distinguish

113
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:12,762
between light produced
by photophores and sunlight.

114
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:17,245
So, one device for escape

115
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,002
is countered by another
equally subtle one for attack

116
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,921
in an evolutionary arms race that
has been waged for millions of years.

117
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:32,444
Descend below 1,000 metres,

118
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,598
and you enter the dark zone.

119
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:38,646
No sunlight whatsoever
penetrates this deep.

120
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:42,880
The temperature of the water
is below four degrees Centigrade.

121
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:46,483
The pressure is more than 100 times
that at the surface.

122
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,402
Life becomes ever more sparse.

123
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,081
it's a dark, dangerous world.

124
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,046
Relative to body size,

125
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,721
these are the largest teeth
in the ocean.

126
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:06,366
They are so big

127
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:09,041
that their owner
can't close its mouth.

128
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,361
They belong to the fang tooth.

129
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:21,838
Unlike most deep sea fish,

130
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,998
this has powerful muscles

131
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,158
and is an aggressive hunter.

132
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,960
With food in such short supply
at this depth,

133
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:42,279
dark zone predators have to be able
to deal with a meal of any size.

134
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,437
Many animals here are dark red,

135
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,404
like this deep sea jelly.

136
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,875
Caught in the lights
of the submersible,

137
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:08,005
it's a spectacular firework display
of colour.

138
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:16,841
Normally, no red light
penetrates as deep as this,

139
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:21,080
so animals with red pigment
appear completely black down here,

140
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,726
perfectly concealed.

141
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:30,277
Predators here, however,
don't just rely on vision -

142
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:31,926
many have tiny eyes.

143
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:34,521
instead, their thin, rod-like bodies

144
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:38,760
are lined with organs sensitive
to tiny movements in the water.

145
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:51,877
This monster, half a metre across,

146
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,038
is a hairy angler.

147
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:56,596
This is the first time
it's been seen.

148
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:01,357
it's covered with hundreds
of sensitive antennae,

149
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,245
which detect the movements

150
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:06,319
of any prey careless enough
to stray too close

151
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:09,160
to this motionless predator.

152
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:21,286
But this, surely,

153
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:25,360
must be the strangest of all
the deep sea fish yet discovered.

154
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,878
A highly sensitive metre-long tail

155
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:33,642
hangs down from the head
that makes up a quarter of its body.

156
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:35,604
its eyes are tiny,

157
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,758
but its mouth is truly enormous.

158
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,437
it's called the gulper eel

159
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:47,599
because it can engulf a meal
of almost any size.

160
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:55,926
Hanging motionless in mid-water,

161
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:59,477
its enormous gape enables it
to deal with passing prey,

162
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:01,000
whether it's small,

163
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,964
or large.

164
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:10,518
Gulper eels can swallow prey
as big as themselves,

165
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,678
which is very useful in a world

166
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:16,396
where you never know
when the next meal is coming along.

167
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,963
Even in the dark zone,
there is S0ME light.

168
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,201
Turn off the submersible headlights,

169
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,757
and you see a pyrotechnic display
outside.

170
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,042
These lights are created by animals.

171
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:39,437
This is bioluminescence.

172
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:45,595
A deep sea angler fish
flashes in the darkness.

173
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:50,317
The light is generated by bacteria

174
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:53,160
that live permanently
inside the lure

175
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:56,797
which attracts prey
to these murderous teeth.

176
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,404
There are all sorts of lures
out in the darkness.

177
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:14,236
Come into my mouth, little fish!

178
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,362
And what is the purpose
of THiS lure,

179
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,324
suspended on a long rod,

180
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:27,479
way below its owner's
terrifying set of teeth?

181
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,005
it's difficult to be sure,

182
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,237
but then, this monster does have

183
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,318
another giant flashing lure

184
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,159
much closer to its mouth.

185
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,364
These fish are called anglers

186
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,599
because they use their lures
in much the same way

187
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:54,600
as fly fishermen
use their imitation flies.

188
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:02,161
For a hunting squid with huge eyes

189
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:04,716
this glimmer is intriguing.

190
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:11,600
it might just be food.

191
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,606
A satisfying meal

192
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:24,600
for a fish
with a highly extendible stomach.

193
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,646
Attracting a mate

194
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:37,604
in this endless darkness

195
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,406
can be even harder
than finding food.

196
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,762
Flashing lures may be helpful;

197
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,078
certainly, only female anglers
have them.

198
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:59,757
The tiny males are just a tenth
the size of the females.

199
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:03,636
Their only purpose is somehow
to find a mate in the darkness.

200
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:07,275
She releases chemicals
into the water

201
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:11,918
which the males scent with a special
white organ in front of their eyes.

202
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,285
Having found a partner,

203
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:21,235
the male bites at her belly
with specially designed teeth.

204
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:29,160
He needs to get
permanently attached.

205
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,800
Within a matter of weeks,

206
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,640
the male is completely fused
to the female,

207
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:40,560
and there he will stay
for the rest of his life.

208
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:42,877
Her blood circulating in his body

209
00:15:43,047 --> 00:15:46,039
provides him
with all the sustenance he needs.

210
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:50,041
in return, she gets a continuous,
reliable supply of sperm -

211
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:53,597
a brilliant solution to the problem
of finding a mate

212
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,156
in the vast emptiness
of the deep sea.

213
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:10,441
To help in the constant battle
between predators and prey,

214
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:12,598
some fish in the dark zone

215
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,758
have developed headlights.

216
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:24,476
These light-producing photophores
beneath their eyes

217
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,719
may be used to search out prey
in the darkness.

218
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:32,999
Most bioluminescence in the deep sea

219
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,158
is blue or greenish-blue,

220
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,318
but a very few predatory fish

221
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:39,478
produce red light.

222
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,766
With this,

223
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:48,600
red prey becomes obvious
in the darkness.

224
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:53,003
Red light is rare down here

225
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,920
and most animal eyes can't see it.

226
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:57,759
0nly these fish can do so.

227
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,558
This gives them a sniper scope -

228
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,639
a headlight invisible
to their targets.

229
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:10,878
This copepod, unalarmed,

230
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,038
takes no avoiding action.

231
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:21,960
Bioluminescence

232
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:23,640
is useful in escape

233
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:25,286
as well as attack.

234
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,838
A shrimp senses a threat.

235
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:39,800
it spins in the water,

236
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:42,197
releasing a bioluminescent glue.

237
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:47,443
This acts like a burglar alarm,

238
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,598
startling the attacking fish

239
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:52,281
and leaving it illuminated
in the dark,

240
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,836
and vulnerable to its own predators.

241
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:00,601
These twinkling lights
in the darkness

242
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,485
are produced by copepods.

243
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:09,080
They probably flash like this
to communicate with one another

244
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,124
and confuse their predators.

245
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,043
The most sensitive eyes in the ocean

246
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:18,879
belong to an ostracod

247
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:20,958
called gigantocypris.

248
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,086
it's the size of a pea,

249
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:25,726
but that's enormous

250
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,366
for an ostracod.

251
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,802
Copepods are a favourite prey,

252
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:34,755
and it actively searches
for their flashes in the darkness...

253
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:43,123
but this copepod has a way of
confusing a hunting gigantocypris.

254
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,678
it discharges a packet
of bioluminescent liquid.

255
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:56,085
The flash is delayed,
like a depth charge.

256
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:02,881
Spinning, confused, in the water,

257
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:06,039
gigantocypris chases
after the flashes...

258
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:14,966
and the copepod

259
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:16,765
slips away unseen

260
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,440
into the darkness.

261
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:30,358
The ultimate bioluminescent
defence mechanism

262
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,040
has to be the light show

263
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:35,438
created by the deep sea jellyfish,
periphylla.

264
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:49,882
That, presumably, is the way
it scares away its enemies.

265
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:09,596
These bright lights
are all produced by firefly squid.

266
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:13,203
Normally, they live way down
at around 300 metres,

267
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,962
beyond the reach of
these japanese fishermen's nets...

268
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:21,405
but for a few months each spring,
they come to the surface each night.

269
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:28,963
The brightest lights
come from the bioluminescent tips

270
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,004
of their two front tentacles,

271
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:33,681
but it's only in the dark
of the deep sea,

272
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:38,398
that you can really appreciate
the full complexity of their displays.

273
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,558
it's not just their tentacles

274
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:44,322
but their whole bodies
that are covered in photophores.

275
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:48,678
The exact function is not clear.

276
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:52,237
The bright tentacle tips
may be for attracting mates

277
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:53,886
or dazzling predators.

278
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,998
The rest may be camouflage,

279
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:59,761
providing counter shading
for the squid

280
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,600
as they journey up
into the twilight zone.

281
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,079
Every night in the season,

282
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:09,238
hundreds of thousands of squid

283
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:12,160
journey up into the shallow water
to spawn.

284
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:19,879
Before dawn,
they will return to the depths,

285
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:23,039
leaving their eggs
to develop in the shallows.

286
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:35,479
The daily cycle of the sun

287
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:38,878
has a profound influence on life
in the deep ocean.

288
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:42,958
As the sun sets,
it triggers the largest migration

289
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:45,402
of living organisms on our planet.

290
00:21:46,287 --> 00:21:48,676
0ne thousand million tonnes
of animals

291
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:50,803
travel up from the dark zone

292
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:54,118
into richer, shallower water
every night.

293
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,958
Tiny grazers are first up,

294
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:02,561
searching for the microscopic plants

295
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:05,400
that only grow
in shallow, sunlit waters.

296
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:09,162
Predators follow the grazers.

297
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:14,478
An enormous variety
of different animals

298
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:16,126
join the convoy

299
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:18,278
or feed off it as it passes.

300
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:27,761
Many will travel up hundreds
of metres towards the surface,

301
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:31,602
and, at dawn, finding themselves
at risk from predators,

302
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,362
the visitors return
to the safer darkness of the depths.

303
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:45,561
The sun's rays
only have a direct effect

304
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:48,446
in the top 100 metres
or so of the ocean.

305
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:52,478
it's only here that photosynthesis
can take place

306
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:54,638
and coral reefs can flourish.

307
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:57,037
Leave this thin, rich slice of life

308
00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:59,801
and travel over the outer face
of the reef

309
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:03,198
and you quickly enter
a far more demanding world.

310
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,880
Below 150 metres,

311
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:16,845
photosynthesis becomes impossible.

312
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:20,560
You find no plants,

313
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:22,206
just animals.

314
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:27,997
Here, the animals are adapted
to catch marine snow -

315
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:32,319
particles of dead animals and plants
that drift down from above.

316
00:23:32,487 --> 00:23:36,480
So they depend second-hand
on the energy captured from the sun

317
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,956
by organisms in the surface waters.

318
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,477
Travelling close to the sea floor,

319
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:54,639
we're going to take a journey
to the very bottom

320
00:23:54,807 --> 00:23:56,206
of the deep sea...

321
00:23:57,287 --> 00:24:01,041
to a world completely separate
from the mid-water above.

322
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:12,437
At around 300 metres,

323
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:16,998
the drop-off levels out, and we move
out onto the continental slope.

324
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:22,361
This stretches for about 150 miles

325
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,085
from the coast,

326
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,124
sloping in a gentle gradient,

327
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:28,801
down to a maximum depth
of 4,000 metres.

328
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,318
Water temperatures down here

329
00:24:33,487 --> 00:24:35,796
drop below four degrees Centigrade

330
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:39,880
and the pressure can reach
up to 400 times that of the surface.

331
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:49,601
Without the lights
of the submersible,

332
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,758
it would be completely dark.

333
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:57,078
The water is crystal clear because
there's so little organic matter.

334
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:00,557
0nly three per cent of any food
in the surface waters

335
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:02,797
reaches the continental slope.

336
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:09,999
At first sight,
it appears a lifeless desert,

337
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,283
but take a closer look

338
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:15,245
and you notice a network
of tracks and trails.

339
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:18,160
There is life even down here.

340
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:23,922
These animals would die immediately

341
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:26,237
if brought to the surface in nets,

342
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:29,160
so you can only see them
behaving normally

343
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,840
from submersibles.

344
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,998
Many are new to science.

345
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:38,957
The deep sea floor is dominated

346
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:40,685
by echinoderms -

347
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:43,122
sea cucumbers, brittle stars

348
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:44,766
and sea urchins.

349
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:47,487
There are literally millions
of them,

350
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,638
marching across the sea bed,

351
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:52,037
hoovering up any edible particles

352
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:53,686
in the sediment.

353
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,237
They come in all shapes and sizes,

354
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,160
and though they are thinly spread,

355
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:03,000
these are among
the most numerous animals

356
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,919
on the planet.

357
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:09,598
Their spikes are good
for locomotion and defence,

358
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:13,157
but perhaps not quite so good
when it comes to mating.

359
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:19,723
Finding a mate
in this largely empty sea floor

360
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:21,366
could be a problem,

361
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:24,087
so some urchins
stay together in herds

362
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:28,240
to be sure that they're never
too far from a potential partner.

363
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:32,881
Rocky outcrops
provide good anchorage

364
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:36,357
for animals that rely on food
that might drift past.

365
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:40,199
These crinoids or sea lilies
look like plants,

366
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:42,358
but are, in fact, animals.

367
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:49,759
Their long stalks ensure that
their umbrella of feeding tentacles

368
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:52,839
are positioned to best effect
in the current.

369
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:55,237
Particles are swept onto the arms,

370
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:59,002
and carried down to a mouth
in the middle of the umbrella.

371
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:03,316
These sudden movements swat away

372
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:07,765
tiny amphipods that try to steal
the sea lily's captures.

373
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:20,602
Coral reefs are not supposed
to exist in total darkness,

374
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:22,803
but recently, a new kind of coral

375
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,561
was found as deep as 2,000 metres.

376
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:29,685
in the cold waters
of a Norwegian fjord,

377
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:33,601
there was a deep sea reef
30 metres high and 200 metres long.

378
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:39,960
This coral gets no energy from
the sun, so it has to be very efficient

379
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:41,526
in catching food.

380
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:45,441
its polyps are far larger
than those of shallow water corals.

381
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:53,446
These are, in fact,

382
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:56,519
the largest coral polyps
in the ocean.

383
00:27:57,447 --> 00:28:01,201
They belong
to the deep sea mushroom coral.

384
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,120
Their three-centimetre-long
tentacles

385
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:06,845
can catch far larger prey

386
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:08,520
than other corals can.

387
00:28:11,687 --> 00:28:14,679
This necessity to capture
every particle of food

388
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:17,600
that comes within reach
in this near desert

389
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,156
has radically changed many animals.

390
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:22,966
Most tunicates

391
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:24,606
are filter feeders,

392
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,917
but this one has become a predator

393
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:29,237
and its greatly enlarged siphon

394
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,398
has been converted into a trap.

395
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:44,365
Most sea cucumbers

396
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:46,597
stay firmly on the bottom,

397
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,043
but not this extraordinary
deep sea species.

398
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,080
its skirts of skin

399
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:58,477
allow it to swim hundreds of metres

400
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:00,126
above the sea floor.

401
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:17,160
Eventually, it will descend

402
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:18,806
and, with luck,

403
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,276
will land on fresh feeding grounds.

404
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:32,041
This has to be the most
extraordinary animal design of all.

405
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:33,720
it's a polychaete worm

406
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:37,562
and, normally, you would expect
the long, pulsating body

407
00:29:37,727 --> 00:29:40,002
to be stick firmly in the sediment.

408
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,446
This worm,

409
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:46,086
alone in its group,

410
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:47,726
swims in the open water.

411
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,880
Propelling itself
with its yellow frill,

412
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:56,526
it moves about

413
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:58,757
and so finds new sources of food,

414
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:01,999
or maybe succeeds
in escaping from a predator.

415
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:10,799
This is chimaera,
a close relative of the sharks,

416
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,446
less than a metre long.

417
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:18,036
Sensory pits on its chin
help it hunt prey on the bottom,

418
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:22,678
while its surprisingly large eyes
may help it spot bioluminescence.

419
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:33,081
Large fish are rare down here -

420
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:36,159
there's not enough live prey
to sustain them.

421
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:38,318
Most have become scavengers.

422
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:41,638
A dead tuna has attracted
a deep sea conger eel...

423
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:45,839
and a six-gilled shark.

424
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:47,645
These monsters grow

425
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:49,604
to eight metres long.

426
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:06,721
Six gills are living fossils.

427
00:31:06,887 --> 00:31:10,277
For 150 million years,
they've existed unchanged,

428
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:14,360
living in water
as deep as 2,500 metres.

429
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:22,722
Very few people have glimpsed
these sharks from submersibles,

430
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:26,118
and we know almost nothing
about their behaviour.

431
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:36,484
The body of a tuna
is a substantial meal,

432
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:38,239
but just occasionally,

433
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:39,999
a really gigantic corpse

434
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,317
drifts down to the deep sea floor.

435
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:49,242
This is the freshly dead carcass

436
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,398
of a 30-tonne grey whale.

437
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:54,320
it's resting on the sea floor
a mile down.

438
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:58,199
it's only been on the bottom
for six weeks,

439
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:01,598
but already it has attracted
hundreds of hagfish.

440
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:05,199
These ancient scavengers

441
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:08,996
are nearly always the first
to discover a fallen body,

442
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,556
and are attracted from miles around.

443
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:19,565
They lack jaws and rasp at the flesh
with two rows of horny teeth

444
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:22,560
on either side
of their sucker-like mouths.

445
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,038
Next to arrive,

446
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:33,677
a sleeper shark -
a real deep sea specialist.

447
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:36,156
They grow to over seven metres long,

448
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:39,478
and have never been filmed
at such a depth before.

449
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:47,484
The gaping wounds
in the whale's flank are its work.

450
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:57,999
Unlike the hagfish,
it has powerful jaws,

451
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:01,204
so is able to rip off
huge chunks of meat.

452
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:10,006
Sharks, hagfish

453
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:13,557
and a whole succession
of different deep sea scavengers

454
00:33:13,727 --> 00:33:17,800
will feast on the carcass for years
before all its nutriment is gone.

455
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:22,086
Eighteen months later,

456
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,238
when we returned to this whale,

457
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:27,956
all that was left was
a perfect skeleton stripped bare.

458
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:38,436
it was almost
as if a museum specimen

459
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:41,326
had been carefully laid out
on the sea floor.

460
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:48,404
At first, the skeleton
seemed totally abandoned,

461
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:52,799
but even after so long, there was
still some flesh left in the head.

462
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,882
Hagfish have a skeleton
of cartilage and are so flexible

463
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:05,356
that they tie themselves into knots

464
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:08,917
and so get a better purchase
on the flesh they feed on.

465
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:17,681
But smaller organisms had fed here.

466
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:20,118
A thick band of white bacteria

467
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:21,686
had formed on the mud

468
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:24,839
outlining the original shape
of the whale,

469
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:26,838
and on the skeleton itself,

470
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:29,316
colonies of specialised bacteria

471
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:32,797
were extracting energy
from the bones themselves.

472
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,599
Most remarkably,
and in huge abundance,

473
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:42,760
polychaete worms were collecting
the last edible fragments.

474
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,406
These are a new species

475
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:48,560
that so far have only been found
on the fallen bodies of whales.

476
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:54,037
Scientists have discovered
178 different animals

477
00:34:54,207 --> 00:34:56,198
on a single whale vertebra,

478
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:59,120
most of which have been found
nowhere else.

479
00:34:59,287 --> 00:35:01,676
This whale, lying over a mile down,

480
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:06,125
was not filmed from a submersible
with an acrylic sphere.

481
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:08,801
Such craft can't go as deep as this.

482
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,357
To withstand the pressure here,

483
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,916
you need a far stronger submersible.

484
00:35:15,087 --> 00:35:16,566
This is Alvin,

485
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:19,924
a two-metre-wide sphere
with just enough room in it

486
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:22,078
for a pilot and two observers.

487
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:24,124
its walls are made of titanium.

488
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:26,926
The viewing ports have to be tiny -

489
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:30,079
any larger,
and the submersible would implode

490
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:32,886
under the enormous pressure
down here.

491
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:35,725
Alvin can dive

492
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:37,843
to 4,500 metres,

493
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:39,998
three miles below the surface.

494
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:48,798
Around 3,000 metres, the continental
slope finally flattens out

495
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:51,083
and joins the abyssal plain.

496
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:54,679
This covers over half
the earth's surface.

497
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:56,838
Mostly it's completely flat,

498
00:35:57,007 --> 00:36:00,079
but in places
it's gashed by massive trenches

499
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:02,238
hundreds of miles wide.

500
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:11,080
The deepest of these
is the Mariana Trench,

501
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:14,637
which drops to over seven miles
below sea level.

502
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:25,716
There are just five manned
submersibles world-wide

503
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:28,037
that can reach the abyssal plain,

504
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:29,765
and between them so far,

505
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:32,919
they have explored
less than one per cent of it.

506
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:38,076
There are a thousand times
fewer large animals down here

507
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:40,238
than on the continental slope,

508
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,886
but in places,

509
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:46,006
hundreds of brittle stars
cross the sea bed in search of food.

510
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:52,598
Fish have been found right down to
the bottom of the deepest trenches.

511
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:54,758
Most come from one family -

512
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:56,918
the aptly named rattails.

513
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:02,078
They forage near the sea floor

514
00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:04,602
and use their battery
of sensory pits

515
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:07,884
to follow odour trails
from rotting carcasses.

516
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:10,242
Rattails can travel long distances

517
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:11,999
across the abyssal plain

518
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,646
in search of food,

519
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:16,844
but others down here
prefer to sit and wait.

520
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,159
This is a tripod fish.

521
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:25,717
it supports itself
on two specially adapted fin rays

522
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:28,640
and can sit motionless
for hour after hour.

523
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:32,446
it does have tiny eyes,

524
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:34,598
but it's almost totally blind.

525
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,758
it locates potential prey

526
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:39,077
with a pair of fins behind its head

527
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:42,523
which are sensitive
to even tiny movements.

528
00:37:48,687 --> 00:37:51,155
We know more about the surface
of the moon

529
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:53,443
than we do about the abyssal plain.

530
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:57,682
Every dive still produces
complete surprises.

531
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:05,446
This deep sea octopus

532
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:07,598
is about the size of a beach ball

533
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:09,883
and has been nicknamed Dumbo.

534
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:23,245
An umbrella of skin
between its tentacles

535
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:25,796
and its extraordinary flapping ears

536
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,197
allow Dumbo to hover effortlessly

537
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:29,846
over the sea floor

538
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,043
as it searches for food.

539
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,681
Right in the middle
of the abyssal plain

540
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:55,476
lie the largest geological
structures on our planet...

541
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:04,483
the mid-ocean ridges.

542
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:13,965
Rising almost two miles
off the sea floor,

543
00:39:14,127 --> 00:39:17,199
the ridges extend
for over 28,000 miles,

544
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:19,927
the largest mountain chain on Earth.

545
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:28,847
When submersibles finally succeeded

546
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:31,316
in reaching the ridges in the 1970s,

547
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,717
they found an extraordinary world

548
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:36,321
with mile upon mile
of once molten rock

549
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:40,719
that had welled up from the deep
in the past and had now solidified.

550
00:39:44,327 --> 00:39:47,285
They discovered towering chimneys,

551
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:50,359
pouring out water
as hot as molten lead.

552
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:21,760
At the surface, water becomes steam
at 100 degrees Centigrade,

553
00:40:21,927 --> 00:40:25,158
but here, under the immense pressure
of the ocean,

554
00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:29,718
it remains liquid at temperatures
as hot as 400 degrees Centigrade.

555
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:37,359
The submersible
has to move carefully.

556
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:40,564
Disaster is very close
when surrounded

557
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:43,560
by such enormous temperatures
and pressures.

558
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:46,801
And here,
where the very water is loaded

559
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:50,960
with hydrogen sulphides
poisonous to normal life processes,

560
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:53,118
they found living creatures.

561
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:00,966
Some of the chimneys
were encrusted with white tubes.

562
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:02,879
The tubes were inhabited

563
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:05,277
by a new species of polychaete worm

564
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:09,759
that was exposed to temperatures
as high as 80 degrees Centigrade.

565
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:16,478
No other animal on Earth was known
to tolerate such high temperatures,

566
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:20,322
so the scientists called
these creatures Pompeii worms.

567
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:24,877
But this was just the beginning.

568
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:27,038
Nearby, there were chimneys

569
00:41:27,207 --> 00:41:30,961
covered by whole communities
of different organisms.

570
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:34,756
The bottom of the vent
was encrusted with large mussels.

571
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:39,637
There were swarms of white crabs,

572
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:41,638
and, most spectacular of all,

573
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:45,766
dominating the chimney were
hundreds of bright red tubeworms,

574
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:48,999
each two metres long
and four centimetres wide.

575
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,561
Until these creatures
were discovered,

576
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:57,276
all life on Earth was thought
to be dependent on the sun,

577
00:41:57,447 --> 00:42:00,439
but here, in the complete darkness
of the deep,

578
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:03,326
they had discovered
a rich density of life

579
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,842
that derived no energy from the sun.

580
00:42:12,647 --> 00:42:14,638
So what do they live on?

581
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:18,356
The answer was found
within the tubeworms themselves.

582
00:42:18,527 --> 00:42:21,519
They were packed full
of specialised bacteria

583
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:23,962
that are able to derive energy

584
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:27,164
from the sulphides
that pour from the vents.

585
00:42:30,887 --> 00:42:34,197
The worms' plumes were bright red
with haemoglobin

586
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,962
that carries sulphides and oxygen
down to the bacteria.

587
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:40,398
These bacterial colonies

588
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:44,242
are the primary source of energy
for all that lives here.

589
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:46,637
The mussels were packed with them.

590
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:48,286
just as green plants

591
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,678
are the basis of life
for animals living in the sun,

592
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:54,156
so these bacteria and other microbes

593
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:56,318
are at the foot of the food chain

594
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:58,876
on which over 500 species depend.

595
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:08,005
Crabs and shrimps feed off bacteria

596
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:11,398
and even try to steal pieces
of tubeworm plumes.

597
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:21,557
Since the vents were first visited
by biologists in 1979,

598
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,276
a new species has been described
every ten days.

599
00:43:27,287 --> 00:43:31,599
At the top of the food chain, fish
that never stray far from the vents,

600
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:35,604
but they or their descendants
will move eventually,

601
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:39,316
for we now know that
individual vents are rarely active

602
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:41,364
for more than a few decades.

603
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:56,925
Such a density of life

604
00:43:57,087 --> 00:43:59,647
living in such harsh conditions

605
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:03,641
in the middle of a vast
and otherwise barren abyssal plain

606
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,924
astounded the biologists
who first saw it.

607
00:44:10,087 --> 00:44:14,319
it seemed to them that here was
evidence of how life on this planet,

608
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:17,923
which certainly started in the sea,
might have begun.

609
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:25,084
Deep sea submersibles

610
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:29,126
made an even more
extraordinary discovery in 1990.

611
00:44:40,087 --> 00:44:41,566
0ver half a mile down,

612
00:44:41,727 --> 00:44:44,161
at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico,

613
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:47,922
they came across what appeared
to be an underwater lake,

614
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:49,600
over 20 metres long,

615
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:51,723
with its own sandy shore.

616
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:56,397
Around its edge,
there even seemed to be a tide line,

617
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:58,637
but this couldn't be, of course,

618
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:00,798
this was underwater.

619
00:45:01,927 --> 00:45:04,316
in fact, the lapping edge
was created

620
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:06,876
by a thick soup of salty brine

621
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:09,880
far heavier than
the surrounding sea water,

622
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:11,526
and the sand was made up

623
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:14,076
of hundreds of thousands of mussels.

624
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:19,246
0nce again, in the midst
of a totally barren sea bed,

625
00:45:19,407 --> 00:45:21,841
an extraordinarily
rich oasis of life

626
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:24,680
totally independent
of the sun's energy.

627
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:31,764
The source of energy this time
was not sulphides

628
00:45:31,927 --> 00:45:35,476
but methane bubbling
out of the sea bed, and once again,

629
00:45:35,647 --> 00:45:38,400
the mussels carried special bacteria

630
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:41,559
capable of fixing
the methane's energy.

631
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:43,718
just like the hot vents,

632
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:47,846
a complete ecosystem had developed
based on the bacteria.

633
00:45:48,007 --> 00:45:52,523
There was an enormous variety
of completely new species - shrimps,

634
00:45:52,687 --> 00:45:55,042
weird squat lobsters,

635
00:45:55,207 --> 00:45:56,606
and bright red

636
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,359
polychaete worms.

637
00:46:07,287 --> 00:46:10,085
These oases were called cold seeps

638
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:13,319
and were surprisingly similar
to the hot vents.

639
00:46:18,287 --> 00:46:22,360
The geological processes
in the sea floor that produce methane

640
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:26,202
also tend to result in the release
of hydrogen sulphides.

641
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,437
it was hardly surprising, then,

642
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,757
when, not far from the brine pool,

643
00:46:30,927 --> 00:46:32,565
they found tubeworms...

644
00:46:34,047 --> 00:46:36,607
extensive fields of tubeworms

645
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:39,156
that stretch for hundreds of metres.

646
00:46:39,327 --> 00:46:41,887
This new species also uses bacteria

647
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:44,038
to fix energy from sulphides,

648
00:46:44,207 --> 00:46:47,199
but it extracts them directly
from the ground.

649
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:52,959
Their beautiful gills

650
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:56,642
are only used to supply oxygen
to the bacteria.

651
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:03,805
Amazingly, these tubeworms
are over 200 years old.

652
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:06,165
While hot vent tubeworms

653
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:09,637
may be the fastest-growing
invertebrates in the sea,

654
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:11,684
these appear to be far slower -

655
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:15,806
all the more reason to protect
your gills from biting amphipods.

656
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:24,123
The energy sources exploited
by the hot vent animals

657
00:47:24,287 --> 00:47:25,766
may suddenly fail,

658
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:29,522
but here, life can enjoy
a more stable geological future.

659
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:37,920
To discover within ten years
two completely new ecosystems,

660
00:47:38,087 --> 00:47:41,079
both totally independent
of the sun's energy,

661
00:47:41,247 --> 00:47:43,238
has been quite extraordinary.

662
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:47,366
So far, we have explored just one
per cent of the deep ocean floor.

663
00:47:47,527 --> 00:47:51,076
Who knows what is still out there
to be discovered?
