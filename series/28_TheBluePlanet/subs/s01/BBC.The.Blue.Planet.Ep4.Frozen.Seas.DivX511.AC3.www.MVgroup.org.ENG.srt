1
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:48,285
The frozen seas
are worlds unto themselves.

2
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:51,007
Beneath their ceiling of ice,

3
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:54,159
they have an eerie,
almost magical stillness,

4
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:57,239
cut off from the storms
that rage above.

5
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:05,525
in the winter, the feeble slanting
rays of the sun bring little warmth

6
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:10,158
and the temperature seldom rises
above minus 50 degrees Centigrade.

7
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:12,318
(H0WLiNG, WHiSTLiNG WiND )

8
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:27,395
For much of the year,
it is dark and cripplingly cold.

9
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,843
Yet, there iS life here
at B0TH ends of the earth -

10
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,317
the Arctic and the Antarctic.

11
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:47,437
For most animals, whether
they live in or out of water,

12
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,440
the winters,
when much of the sea is frozen,

13
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:52,484
bring the greatest challenge.

14
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:58,278
The northern hemisphere.

15
00:01:58,447 --> 00:01:59,926
it's February,

16
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,317
and as the earth tilts on its axis,

17
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:05,001
the sun's rays
creep slowly northwards

18
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,079
and the Arctic emerges
from its harsh winter.

19
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:15,322
The Arctic is a frozen ocean
surrounded by continents,

20
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:18,763
and when the surface of the sea
between the continents

21
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:20,679
freezes from shore to shore,

22
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:23,236
land predators walk out onto it

23
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:24,840
to hunt.

24
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:32,198
it's early March,

25
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,881
and the sea is still covered
with ice...

26
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:38,519
But there are patches
of open water - polynyas -

27
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:40,325
that never freeze over.

28
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:44,719
Here, where tidal currents
are squeezed between islands,

29
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:48,562
the water movement is so strong
that ice cannot form.

30
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,799
Walruses spend the winter
in polynyas.

31
00:02:57,847 --> 00:03:00,600
Here they have permanent access
to the air,

32
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:04,680
but they can also retreat
to the sea to shelter, to hunt.

33
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:21,846
0ther sea mammals overwinter
in polynyas as well - in this one,

34
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:23,998
a young bowhead whale.

35
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:35,677
Here, the current is really fast

36
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:37,838
and the shifting ice is dangerous.

37
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,278
This whale became trapped

38
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:48,041
when ice encircled it last autumn.

39
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,958
There is no food here,

40
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:59,357
but a whale must breathe,

41
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:04,396
and the only place it can do so
for miles around is in this tiny hole.

42
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:10,400
it's living entirely
on its reserves of fat,

43
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,956
but now, they're dangerously low.

44
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,119
it will be some months yet
before it can escape.

45
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,918
Elsewhere, other whales
have also been trapped.

46
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:34,805
These are belugas.

47
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:36,958
Their tiny hole in the ice

48
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:39,357
has been kept open not by currents,

49
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:42,246
but by the belugas'
continuous movements

50
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,125
as they rise to breathe.

51
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:52,724
0pen water is now
some 20 miles away.

52
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:56,364
it will be two months yet
before the ice melts.

53
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:10,557
The belugas are extremely thin

54
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,321
and most of them
are horribly scarred.

55
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:25,484
But their wounds
were not inflicted by the ice.

56
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:38,242
A whale would be a huge prize
for any meat-eating hunter,

57
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:40,967
and these belugas,
trapped by the ice,

58
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:43,163
are within reach of polar bears.

59
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:58,203
Well aware of the danger,

60
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,677
the belugas stay submerged
as long as they can,

61
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:05,442
but they can only hold their breath
for about 20 minutes.

62
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:27,962
Catching a four-metre-long whale
that weighs one tonne

63
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:29,640
is no easy task,

64
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:33,482
even if that whale
is weakened by starvation.

65
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:48,117
But a beluga
is well worth waiting for.

66
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,362
Day by day,
as the hole gets bigger,

67
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:17,600
it becomes increasingly difficult
for the bear to land a whale.

68
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:24,597
Keeping its fur in good condition
and free from salt

69
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,564
is important for warmth,

70
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:29,685
and the bear uses snow
like blotting paper.

71
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,965
These belugas have been attacked
by many bears

72
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,719
over the last six months,

73
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:47,878
and some have been caught.

74
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:54,198
it may have taken a long time
and a lot of patience,

75
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,996
but a catch when it's made
brings abundant rewards

76
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,885
of energy-rich blubber.

77
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:14,002
Gulls rely on bear kills
at this time of the year,

78
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,681
and the colour of blood
staining the ice

79
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:19,077
attracts them from a long way away.

80
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,840
The remaining belugas
still have a long wait

81
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,760
before they're released
from their prison

82
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,804
and the threat of slaughter.

83
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,006
Arctic foxes
also rely on the polar bears

84
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,078
to hunt on their behalf.

85
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:05,522
They're the jackals of the north,

86
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:09,043
and scavenge from bear kills
whenever they can.

87
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:19,198
in winter and early spring,

88
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,961
they're wholly dependent on bears.

89
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,800
0nly in the summer,
when the sea ice melts,

90
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:28,039
will they regularly catch prey
for themselves.

91
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:38,164
They're not strong enough
to tackle adult seals,

92
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,842
but can certainly take
new-born pups or birds.

93
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:56,925
This canny individual

94
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:59,078
is going to bury its prize.

95
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:02,319
it may need it
during the uncertain times ahead.

96
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:07,599
The presence of bears

97
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:12,158
affects the behaviour of almost all
the animals here, big and small.

98
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:15,637
The bears tend to avoid
the fringe of fragmented ice

99
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:17,525
bordering open water

100
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:20,281
where travelling
can be very laborious,

101
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:23,519
but that very fact
makes this area - the pack ice -

102
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,564
a particularly good place

103
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:27,558
for seals to pup.

104
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,565
Harp seals breed here.

105
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:40,036
Their pups are born with white coats

106
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:43,961
which camouflage them
very effectively against the snow.

107
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:48,880
Harp seals have
a very short nursing period -

108
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,686
a necessity
on this unstable pack ice -

109
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,600
but suckling is intensive.

110
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:57,486
The pup feeds for just 12 days

111
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,797
on milk that is 45 per cent fat.

112
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,481
Then it's abandoned

113
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:04,638
and has to fend for itself.

114
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:09,406
A male hooded seal.

115
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:16,078
This impressive nasal display

116
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:19,205
is used to warn away other males...

117
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:27,006
and to win a mate.

118
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:30,316
Hooded seals also breed
on pack ice.

119
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,956
Their pups suckle
for only four days,

120
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:36,358
the shortest nursing period
known for any mammal,

121
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:39,883
and all because
the threat of polar bears

122
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,959
caused them to breed
on the unstable ice.

123
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:02,565
Another Arctic seal opts
for the solid ice further north.

124
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,041
Because it's easy for bears
to hunt here,

125
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:09,438
these ringed seals
must be particularly vigilant

126
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,598
and have to hide their pups.

127
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:17,961
Ringed seals
are comparatively small,

128
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:20,357
so they can give birth
to their pups

129
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:23,041
in little caves or lairs
under the snow.

130
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,679
Here, a pup is out of sight

131
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:27,917
and protected from bad weather.

132
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,318
in late March and into April,

133
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,366
female bears emerge from
winter dens with their new cubs.

134
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,599
The mother has not eaten
for at least five months

135
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,883
and she's hungry - very hungry.

136
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:57,475
if she doesn't succeed in catching
a regular supply of seals,

137
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,046
her milk will fail

138
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,925
and her cub will die.

139
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,682
Bears have an extraordinarily
sensitive sense of smell

140
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:13,645
and can detect seal pups
hidden in the snow

141
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,684
from two kilometres away.

142
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:30,798
But a female ringed seal
uses several lairs

143
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,561
and a bear will have
to break into a number

144
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:36,764
before it finds one
that is occupied.

145
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:48,117
This is a crucial time for the cub.

146
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,278
By watching its mother hunt

147
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:54,838
and by copying her actions, it's
beginning to acquire the rudiments

148
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:56,998
of its own hunting skills.

149
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,159
Play is also important
for developing muscles

150
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,238
and improving co-ordination.

151
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:27,246
As the days go by,

152
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:31,320
the sun rises higher and remains
above the horizon even at night.

153
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,960
The female bear continues to hunt

154
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:46,085
until her cub is too tired
and can't keep up.

155
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,524
She's smelt something.

156
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:19,319
The pup escapes
through a hole in its lair

157
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,478
that leads to the sea below.

158
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:47,440
0nly one in 20 hunts is successful,

159
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,241
but this mother
must find a seal pup soon

160
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,921
if her cub is not
to starve to death.

161
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:14,597
As spring turns into summer, the sun's
heat begins to melt the sea ice.

162
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:20,684
Now, the ocean is accessible

163
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,805
and the Arctic's summer visitors
return.

164
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,400
Migrating birds

165
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,080
arrive from the south

166
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:30,796
to nest and feed on the seafood
now within their reach.

167
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,525
Brunnich's guillemots

168
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:35,360
are the northern equivalent
of penguins,

169
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,200
but they have retained
the power of flight

170
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,927
for they need to reach cliff ledges

171
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:45,080
where their nests will be safe
from predatory bears and foxes.

172
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,400
Nonetheless, they are as at home
in the water as in the air.

173
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,925
They dive down
to a depth of 50 metres or more

174
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,520
to catch fish.

175
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:23,201
in june, the ice begins to fracture.

176
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,358
The cracks - or leads -

177
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,836
form useful corridors of open water

178
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,998
for air-breathing animals.

179
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:37,039
Belugas, migrating
to their feeding grounds,

180
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:41,200
use these leads to penetrate
the ice-covered seas and reach areas

181
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:45,360
where their preferred food,
Arctic cod, has spent the winter.

182
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:56,797
The males regularly dive
to about 500 metres to find fish.

183
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:00,523
The females and young,
which have smaller lungs,

184
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:03,201
only go to about 350.

185
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:18,682
in late june and july,
narwhals arrive.

186
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,085
The females,
who usually lack tusks,

187
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,397
come first with their new calves.

188
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,603
The males follow a little later.

189
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:43,202
They also move up the leads

190
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,676
in search of fresh feeding grounds.

191
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:59,596
Bowheads. Up to 18 metres long

192
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,723
and weighing 100 tonnes.

193
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,598
These are the only large whales

194
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:07,201
that stay in the Arctic
all year round.

195
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:24,805
They are not after fish.

196
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:27,276
They're seeking smaller prey.

197
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:32,162
Despite having the largest mouths
in the animal kingdom -

198
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:34,318
the size of a small garage -

199
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,921
they eat tiny crustaceans -
copepods -

200
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:39,438
straining them from the water

201
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:42,280
with the four-metre-long strips
of baleen

202
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,517
that hang from their upper jaws.

203
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:55,281
in the summer,
they store enough energy

204
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:58,120
to last them
through the following winter

205
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:00,357
when food will be less abundant.

206
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,485
As the ice melts away,

207
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:07,400
the polar bears are forced
to head for land.

208
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:11,838
They are excellent swimmers,

209
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:16,159
and can cover 100 miles
of continuous open water if need be.

210
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:53,958
0ff east Greenland,

211
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,676
there is little ice left by August,
so walruses haul out

212
00:20:57,847 --> 00:20:59,565
to rest on land.

213
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:02,116
At this time of year,
they are moulting,

214
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:06,200
getting rid of their old,
scarred, parasite-ridden skin.

215
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:20,606
A bathe in cold water brings
some relief from the itching...

216
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,798
but even there,

217
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,527
the odd scratch is irresistible.

218
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,723
They make daily excursions
out to deeper water.

219
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:17,360
Down at 20 metres,

220
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:19,677
they root around in the sediment,

221
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:21,917
using their sensitive bristles

222
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,317
to search out soft-shelled clams.

223
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:45,084
0nce they find a clam,

224
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,397
they suck its flesh from the shell

225
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,081
with their powerful,
muscular mouths.

226
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:56,683
Walruses can feed for
about five minutes at this depth

227
00:22:56,847 --> 00:23:00,237
before they have to return
to the surface to breathe.

228
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:11,879
Elsewhere in the Arctic, belugas are
gathering in their thousands.

229
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:15,596
They congregate
in just a few large estuaries.

230
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:21,279
Belugas of all ages and sizes
come here.

231
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,837
There are even young calves.

232
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,160
Some are so young -

233
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:39,318
born only a week or so ago -

234
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,079
that they need help.

235
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:43,397
They swim on their mothers' backs

236
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,956
so that they can breathe
more easily.

237
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:58,877
As the tide moves up the estuary,

238
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:00,560
the belugas follow,

239
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:03,560
swimming into surprisingly
shallow water.

240
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:12,206
Like walruses,

241
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,244
they also need to moult.

242
00:24:22,287 --> 00:24:24,517
A combination of warm fresh water

243
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:28,475
and vigorous rubbing
against the gravel does the trick.

244
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,444
They remain here for days

245
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,086
or even weeks,

246
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:45,636
so it's likely that socialising

247
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:47,843
is also important to them.

248
00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:57,396
After moulting,
they head back out to sea to feed.

249
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,800
it's now autumn,

250
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:08,004
and the sea begins
to freeze over once again.

251
00:25:13,687 --> 00:25:16,155
Thin sheets of ice form
at the surface

252
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:18,204
and pile up, layer upon layer,

253
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:21,359
gradually creating
an impenetrable barrier.

254
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:35,319
By late November, the Arctic ocean
is sealed once again by ice.

255
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:51,523
The lights of the aurora

256
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:53,643
play in the winter sky.

257
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:07,557
And at the other end
of the planet - in the Antarctic -

258
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:09,718
there is the southern aurora.

259
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,761
Antarctica is now
emerging from winter.

260
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:31,798
This is the coldest,
windiest place in the world.

261
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:35,801
Temperatures are still hovering
at a numbing minus 50,

262
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:38,959
and the returning sun
has virtually no warmth.

263
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:43,800
Very few animals can survive
such extreme conditions...

264
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:48,245
but Emperor penguins can.

265
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,398
(H0WLiNG, R0ARiNG WiND )

266
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:55,998
Standing on the frozen sea,

267
00:26:56,167 --> 00:26:59,477
they endure the full force
of the Antarctic storms.

268
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:10,523
0nly by huddling together

269
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:13,963
can they survive
the appalling winter months.

270
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:23,840
They take it in turns
to bear the brunt of the gales.

271
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,758
They can only live here at all

272
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:31,920
because Antarctica is surrounded
by the great Southern 0cean

273
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:34,999
and no land predators
have been able to reach it,

274
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,158
so, unlike Arctic animals,

275
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:39,921
they're not threatened
by polar bears.

276
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,005
The sea is still frozen,

277
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:48,398
but one seal, nonetheless,
manages to stay here,

278
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:51,804
even throughout the winter -

279
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:56,445
the Weddell seal.

280
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:14,596
Underwater, it's protected
from the storms above,

281
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:17,361
but it must have access
to the air all year

282
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:19,404
in order to breathe.

283
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:33,279
And they keep
their breathing holes open

284
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,039
with their teeth.

285
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:48,120
0nly by continually
scraping away at the ice

286
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,642
can they maintain access
to the air,

287
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:54,117
but that means that their teeth
get badly worn down.

288
00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:57,837
Then, they can no longer hunt
and eat effectively.

289
00:28:58,007 --> 00:29:00,567
Weddell seals die young.

290
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,522
The continent of Antarctica

291
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:13,678
is so isolated and so high -

292
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:16,315
almost 5,000 metres in places -

293
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:19,559
that it's considerably colder
than the Arctic.

294
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:25,597
ice slides slowly down
from its centre

295
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:28,156
towards its rim
in immense glaciers.

296
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,600
During winter, the continent
effectively doubles in size

297
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:36,359
as the sea freezes over.

298
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:39,121
ice forms around its shores

299
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:42,040
and extends outwards
for hundreds of miles

300
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:44,198
around the entire land mass.

301
00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:53,760
Under the sea ice live small
shrimp-like creatures - krill.

302
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:56,885
They have been here all winter.

303
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,282
During these dark months,

304
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:04,359
they feed by scraping algae
from the ice.

305
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:09,476
Remarkably, they also shrink in size

306
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:12,798
and revert to their juvenile form
to save energy.

307
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:22,567
As the temperature rises in spring,

308
00:30:22,727 --> 00:30:24,479
the ice begins to melt,

309
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:28,037
and little air bubbles
trapped within it are released.

310
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:31,005
Microscopic algae grow
around these bubbles

311
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:33,158
and the krill now graze on them,

312
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:36,160
gathering them up
with their beating legs.

313
00:30:52,527 --> 00:30:54,518
As the sun's rays grow stronger

314
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,247
and penetrate deeper
into the water,

315
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:59,716
floating algae begin to flourish,

316
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,917
and krill leave the dwindling ice

317
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:05,124
and gather in swarms

318
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:07,278
as they harvest this new crop.

319
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:18,526
Far to the north,

320
00:31:18,687 --> 00:31:20,678
beyond the blanket of sea ice,

321
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:22,360
chinstrap penguins

322
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:25,360
have been overwintering
in the open ocean.

323
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:34,518
The occasional iceberg

324
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:36,757
gives them the chance of a rest -

325
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:38,918
if they can get onto it.

326
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:10,678
But at this time of year,
where they really want to be

327
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,246
is on land.

328
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:15,843
it's just getting there
that's tricky.

329
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:37,321
it's spring, and the penguins
are returning to breed.

330
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:47,636
Their need to get ashore
is now urgent and imperative.

331
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:03,287
Doing so is all a matter of timing,

332
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:05,438
and picking the right wave.

333
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,881
But their journey
has only just begun.

334
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,961
Most of them will have to walk
many miles

335
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:00,357
before they can find a nest site.

336
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:11,796
(TREMEND0US DiN)

337
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,483
This is Zavodovski island,

338
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:20,878
which has the largest
penguin colony in the world.

339
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,840
About two million chinstraps
breed here,

340
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:28,124
and they come to THiS island
for a good reason.

341
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:35,678
it's an active volcano.

342
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:38,998
The heat from the crater
and the fumeroles

343
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:41,920
keeps the slopes
free from the ice and snow,

344
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:45,682
allowing these chinstraps
to start breeding earlier

345
00:34:45,847 --> 00:34:47,644
than those further south.

346
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:51,726
But then again,

347
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:55,596
living on an active volcano
is not without its risks.

348
00:34:57,407 --> 00:34:58,920
Unlike the Emperors,

349
00:34:59,087 --> 00:35:02,716
these penguins are able to lay
their eggs on the bare ground.

350
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:06,675
Little wonder so many choose
to brave the mountainous waves

351
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:08,326
in order to get here.

352
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:17,196
Further south, near the continent,

353
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,359
the blanket of sea ice
is beginning to break up.

354
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:27,601
icebergs are gigantic fragments
of ice

355
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:31,680
that have broken away into the sea
from the front of glaciers.

356
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:35,237
During the winter,
they were frozen into the sea ice,

357
00:35:35,407 --> 00:35:37,682
but now they're set adrift
once more.

358
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:17,319
As the bergs break up,

359
00:36:17,487 --> 00:36:19,398
they form brash ice.

360
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:23,916
it litters the backwaters
of the Antarctic peninsula.

361
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:47,598
Minke whales make their way
into these placid waters in summer.

362
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:51,362
This is the most abundant whale
in the Southern 0cean.

363
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:06,446
Minkes are one of the smallest
of all the baleen whales,

364
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:09,519
and like all others,
they come here to feed.

365
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,398
The majestic humpback whales

366
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:26,364
are also summer visitors.

367
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,481
They have travelled
thousands of miles

368
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:40,878
from their winter breeding grounds
in the tropics

369
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:44,722
to gather the food that becomes
available here in summer.

370
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:01,479
in just four months,

371
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,638
they accumulate enough fat

372
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:07,766
to provide them with energy for
the whole of the rest of the year.

373
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:28,836
All these animals have come here
in search of one thing -

374
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,486
the krill.

375
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:33,638
Krill is the mainstay

376
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:35,798
of the Antarctic food web.

377
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:45,922
it occurs in phenomenal quantity -

378
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:48,920
billions of individuals
in a single swarm,

379
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:51,677
and swarms can stretch for miles.

380
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:00,999
Fur seals also collect
this rich, super-abundant food.

381
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,998
Krill swarms are very patchy,

382
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,646
but once found,

383
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:07,286
feeding is easy.

384
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:37,480
Humpbacks engulf
hundreds of thousands of them

385
00:39:37,647 --> 00:39:40,115
in a single gargantuan mouthful.

386
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,086
When the going is good,

387
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:55,124
the whales feed continuously,

388
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:57,676
each eating
up to two tonnes of krill

389
00:39:57,847 --> 00:39:59,405
in 24 hours.

390
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,082
Further south, near the continent,
the sea ice is still sound.

391
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:10,478
Here, where the ice remains
for most of the summer,

392
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:12,877
Emperor penguins make their home.

393
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:16,475
These have been feeding out at sea,

394
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,957
and are now ready to make
their way back to the colony

395
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:21,765
to feed their chicks.

396
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:27,442
instead of heading
straight for the ice edge,

397
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:30,519
the penguins hesitate
some distance from it.

398
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:32,846
They're nervous.

399
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:46,400
They dive down

400
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:49,081
and investigate the ice edge...

401
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:05,279
And for good reason.

402
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:08,325
Leopard seals patrol this border.

403
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:20,844
Leopard seals are the Antarctic's
equivalent of polar bears.

404
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:22,804
They're the top predators,

405
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:25,879
but they hunt most successfully
in the water,

406
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:27,560
so by and large,

407
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:30,799
the animals they prey on
are safer out on the ice.

408
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:42,123
They have a lazy grace
that belies their ferocious nature.

409
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:58,517
Confident that the coast is clear,

410
00:41:58,687 --> 00:42:01,281
the Emperor penguins
head for the ice...

411
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,437
but they certainly don't linger.

412
00:42:45,687 --> 00:42:49,726
Now they have a long walk back
to the colony.

413
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:58,520
Emperor penguin colonies are
some way back from the ice edge.

414
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,837
in winter, they may be
as much as 100 miles from it,

415
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:05,999
but as the summer progresses
and the ice melts,

416
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,761
the edge comes ever closer
to the colony.

417
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,395
So by the time the chicks
are fledged

418
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:13,797
and ready to take their first swim,

419
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,446
the water is close by.

420
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:26,405
This colony is in the lee
of a headland,

421
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:29,479
and that prevents the ice
from being broken up

422
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:31,205
by ocean currents.

423
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:34,247
The returning adults
are so full of food

424
00:43:34,407 --> 00:43:36,125
that they can barely walk,

425
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:39,006
but with no predator
to threaten them now,

426
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,158
they can take their time.

427
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:53,966
Somehow, in this melee
of 60,000 or so penguins,

428
00:43:54,127 --> 00:43:56,322
a parent has to find its chick.

429
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:09,603
it returns to the place
where it last left its chick

430
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:12,645
in the hope
that it might still be close by...

431
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:17,601
but chicks tend to wander,

432
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:20,201
so the adult has to call to it.

433
00:44:22,687 --> 00:44:25,201
(ADULT MAKES L0W TRiLLiNG CALL)

434
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:30,517
(CHiCK MAKES HiGH-PiTCHED PEEP)

435
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:36,000
The chick responds,

436
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:38,476
and they slowly
home in on one another.

437
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:41,036
The plaintive entreaties
of the chick

438
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:44,882
stimulates the adult
to regurgitate a mouthful of fish.

439
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:57,438
With the return of one parent,

440
00:44:57,607 --> 00:45:00,519
the other is free to go to sea
to feed for itself.

441
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:18,116
Aware of the leopard seal's
presence,

442
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:21,359
the penguins press together
at the ice edge

443
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:24,644
unwilling to be the first
to risk diving in.

444
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:43,324
0ccasionally,
the seal comes out onto the ice

445
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,478
and attempts to grab one...

446
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:03,359
But its most successful strategy
by far

447
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,006
is to lie in wait.

448
00:46:12,487 --> 00:46:14,921
it hides behind a corner of ice.

449
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:19,878
The Emperors gain confidence

450
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:21,560
and make a dash for it.

451
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,961
The first wave of penguins escape.

452
00:46:38,687 --> 00:46:41,076
0nce in open water,
they will be safe.

453
00:46:46,047 --> 00:46:48,277
But the seal is alerted
by the noise,

454
00:46:48,447 --> 00:46:51,678
and through the mass of bubbles,
it makes its attack.

455
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:05,120
Almost invariably, it makes a kill.

456
00:47:12,447 --> 00:47:14,881
Encouraged by the absence
of the seal,

457
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:18,517
the remaining penguins
make a break for the open sea.

458
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:40,202
in time, their chicks will fledge,

459
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:43,279
and when the Antarctic autumn
is near its end,

460
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:46,678
these adults will walk
across the newly-formed ice

461
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:48,838
to endure yet another winter

462
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:51,237
on the frozen sea.
