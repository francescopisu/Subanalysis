1
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:38,405
There is a force sufficiently
powerful to move the oceans

2
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,683
of this world.

3
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:07,724
it is a force not of this Earth.

4
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:16,200
The Moon is large enough
to generate gravity

5
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:22,283
and with sufficient force to pull
on the Earth 230,000 miles away.

6
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:25,676
As the Moon orbits the Earth,

7
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:29,965
its gravity sweeps across
the face of our planet.

8
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:34,837
its power drags a great bulge
of oceanic water in its wake...

9
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,643
..the rising tide.

10
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:51,876
The River Amazon in Brazil.

11
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:56,723
0n some special days,
the gravitational forces

12
00:01:56,887 --> 00:02:00,562
of the Moon and the sun combine,
to extraordinary effect.

13
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:13,158
A growing tidal wave from the ocean
is being forced 200 miles inland.

14
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:17,399
This is a tidal bore.

15
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:57,441
Fortunately, tidal bores are rare,

16
00:02:57,607 --> 00:03:02,886
but the Moon does create strong tides
out in the world's oceans

17
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:05,163
on every day of the year.

18
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:14,765
The Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia.

19
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:20,685
The tides here
are the largest in the world,

20
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,884
and have a profound effect
on marine life,

21
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:26,242
creating a rich feeding ground.

22
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:35,844
A feast that attracts some
of the largest diners on the planet...

23
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,598
..humpback whales.

24
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:52,560
But they are not the biggest threat
to the herring.

25
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:09,606
These are finback whales.

26
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:13,760
At 70 tonnes, they are the second
largest animal on Earth,

27
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:18,842
but so streamlined they are
the fastest of the great whales.

28
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:24,040
This combination of speed
and immense size

29
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:28,120
makes the finback a voracious hunter
of schooling fish.

30
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:32,637
The Bay of Fundy
can attract so many fish

31
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:35,196
that, during the summer,

32
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:41,363
as many as 500 of these magnificent
whales hunt here every day.

33
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:46,516
The feeding is best
where the tides run strongly.

34
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:50,878
So the whales
move further into the bay,

35
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:54,835
following tidal rips
and searching for fish.

36
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:06,199
Their movements are closely watched
by flocks of Cory shearwaters.

37
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:15,204
As the whales dive down towards
the fish, more and more birds gather,

38
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:18,165
anxious to pick up scraps.

39
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:32,719
The flowing tide

40
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:38,120
may provide a feast,
but, before long, it will turn.

41
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:44,162
in just six hours,
100 billion tonnes of water

42
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,318
will flow out of the bay,

43
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:51,515
the sea level falling
by as much as 15 metres

44
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:55,600
and exposing vast tracts
of mud and sand.

45
00:05:55,767 --> 00:06:01,319
At first sight, a barren place,
entirely devoid of life.

46
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:10,485
in fact, the damp sand
is packed with microscopic life,

47
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:14,196
the meiofauna,
feeding in a sandy underworld,

48
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:18,201
quite unaffected
by the departure of the sea.

49
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:24,558
But life is not all roses
in this miniature world.

50
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:31,046
A sand bubbler crab
in Northern Australia.

51
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:32,845
it hunts meiofauna.

52
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:35,885
just a centimetre across,

53
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:39,357
the sand bubbler
works at breakneck speed,

54
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:44,078
filtering out the meiofauna
and kicking aside the waste.

55
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,599
The crab will clean

56
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:54,726
every grain of sand
within a metre of its burrow.

57
00:06:54,887 --> 00:07:00,405
Endless practice for the best
backheel in the natural world.

58
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:23,040
The crabs work fast

59
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:26,677
because they can only sieve
when the sand is damp.

60
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,886
Remarkably, they work
the entire surface of the beach

61
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,801
within a couple of hours
of the tide retreating.

62
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:44,398
Then they simply return to their
burrows and await the next tide.

63
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:55,356
Underwater,
the falling tide is the cue

64
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:57,757
for some bizarre activity.

65
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:03,956
These slow-moving clams
use their muscular feet

66
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:06,516
to bury themselves under the sand.

67
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,918
if they fail to get under cover,

68
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:14,922
the tide will leave them exposed
to the air and they will perish.

69
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:21,276
But once underground,
they can wait,

70
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:24,086
safe beneath the beach,

71
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:29,962
And not a moment too soon.

72
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:37,077
june in south east Alaska.

73
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:41,843
in just four hours, a vast beach
is exposed by the falling tide.

74
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,558
The bears are hungry.

75
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:56,757
At this time of year, the pickings
on land are few and far between.

76
00:08:56,927 --> 00:09:02,479
But any food here has long since
buried itself deep under the sand.

77
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:09,846
To a hungry adult bear,
that is no barrier.

78
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:14,683
They smell the clams through
the sand and simply dig them out.

79
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:18,999
For such large animals,

80
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,840
they show
quite extraordinary dexterity

81
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:24,601
at opening
the unfortunate shellfish.

82
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:47,883
Cubs try their luck, too,
none too successfully.

83
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,006
But for the adults,
the shellfish feast

84
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:59,126
lasts as long
as the tide remains out.

85
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:06,445
Table Mountain in South Africa.

86
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:15,519
Every day, the retreating waves
leave flotsam on the beach.

87
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,838
And this creature
is scenting the currents

88
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,999
for the odour of rotting fish.

89
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:27,195
The tide carries the scent
far into the surf zone.

90
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:34,677
Responding to the smell,
snails emerge from the sand.

91
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:43,563
This is a race against the tide.

92
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,764
The snails need to find their meal

93
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:49,566
before the tide
leaves it beyond reach.

94
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,356
But snails are slow
and the tides fall rapidly.

95
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:59,280
These, however,
are no ordinary snails.

96
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,803
They can surf!

97
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,120
They ride the waves up the beach

98
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:35,803
but, all too soon, the tide leaves
the fish beyond the surf zone.

99
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:46,917
Without the sea, there's a danger
the snails will lose the scent,

100
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:49,840
but as long
as the sand remains damp,

101
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:53,238
they can still follow
a faint trail to the food.

102
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,763
0nce there,

103
00:11:56,927 --> 00:12:00,317
they tuck in with macabre relish.

104
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:11,323
Good things come to those who wait.

105
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:28,562
Soon, the heat of the sun
forces them to retreat into the sand

106
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,480
to await the return
of the next tide.

107
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:38,038
February in Britain.

108
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:42,917
The falling tide is eagerly awaited
by these knot.

109
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:10,842
As the water retreats,
countless small invertebrates

110
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,043
seek shelter under the mud.

111
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,526
And with good reason.

112
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,319
Waders are specialists
at probing in the mud,

113
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,398
their variety of beak shapes

114
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,957
designed for reaching
different invertebrates -

115
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:47,756
keys that unlock the safety
of the tidal flats.

116
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:02,478
But within a few hours,
the tide will turn again.

117
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:17,159
Soon, the waders
are out of their depth.

118
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:20,080
The creatures of the mud
are safe once more.

119
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:29,683
Underwater, incoming tides
can create a strong current,

120
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:35,444
and flounder are experts
at hitching a tidal lift.

121
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:38,599
They are shaped
rather like a kite,

122
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,759
a perfect design
for gliding on the tide.

123
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:48,445
in Newfoundland
on the east coast of Canada,

124
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:52,964
large numbers of flounder ride
the currents up into the shallows.

125
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,596
They've come to hunt invertebrates

126
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,645
that will emerge
now that the water is back.

127
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:24,005
The pickings in the shallows
can be very good.

128
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:29,923
The activity
has not gone unnoticed.

129
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:37,159
But ospreys can't dive deeply.

130
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:46,881
As long as the water is more than
a metre deep, the flounder is safe.

131
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:59,967
Going too far inshore

132
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,402
can be a risky business.

133
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,721
This fish buries itself
completely in the sand

134
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:16,923
at any sign of danger.

135
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:22,523
But when the tide floods in again,
as long as the coast is clear,

136
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:25,042
these sand lancet will re-emerge.

137
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:35,766
After a wait of six hours
under the sand,

138
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:37,918
they are desperate for food.

139
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:41,318
Unlike flounder,
they head out to sea,

140
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,603
looking for shallow, open water

141
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:49,524
where the tidal currents will
concentrate their food - plankton.

142
00:16:54,847 --> 00:17:00,797
in untold thousands, they stream
towards the best feeding grounds,

143
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,878
where they simply pick up

144
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:06,437
tiny planktonic creatures
from the water.

145
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:20,956
But, if they swim too far off-shore
in search of food,

146
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:26,042
they risk meeting large predators
that live in deeper water.

147
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,401
Dogfish - small sharks.

148
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:37,840
The sand lancet have strayed
out of their safe depth.

149
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,235
The effect of the turning tide

150
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:42,117
can be totally different
on a rocky shore.

151
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:50,123
Here, on the coast
of Vancouver island in Canada,

152
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:54,041
the sun bakes the exposed rock.

153
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:58,439
it's almost impossible to dig
underground when the sea retreats,

154
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:04,284
so these mussels and barnacles
are fully exposed to the sun's heat,

155
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:07,359
literally cooking
in their own shells.

156
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:14,002
And the seaweed
simply dry to a crisp.

157
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:22,362
it can be a wait of many hours
before the water returns.

158
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:30,325
Throughout each month, the size
and strength of the tide changes.

159
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:34,166
The biggest tides of all happen

160
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:37,797
when the gravities of the sun
and Moon pull in unison.

161
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:41,198
That happens immediately
after the new moon...

162
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:46,039
..and again after the full moon.

163
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:53,677
These are called the spring tides.

164
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:59,205
They reveal vast tracts of seabed
that would normally be covered.

165
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:06,360
For these racoons, it's a chance
to look for a seafood feast.

166
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:11,326
A mother ventures forth
with her kits.

167
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:14,957
With the spring tide,
they've come further down

168
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,846
than smaller tides
would normally allow.

169
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:31,399
Searching
with their sensitive paws,

170
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,398
they look for suitable prey.

171
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:37,719
With the extreme low tide,
they could find something special.

172
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:57,636
And what could be better
than a red rock crab?

173
00:20:57,807 --> 00:21:03,279
That is, if it weren't
for the risk of a painful pinch.

174
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:11,117
With crabs, there's no substitute
for experience.

175
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:14,245
The mother
makes an expert's catch.

176
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:25,439
But the kits learn fast.

177
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:36,321
And for those that don't,
begging is always worth a try.

178
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:43,445
All too soon, the returning tide
will cover the racoon's table.

179
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:55,119
For the invertebrates,
it's a welcome relief,

180
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:59,075
but in rough weather,
they are exposed

181
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:00,885
to the worst of the waves.

182
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,522
Even when there are no waves,

183
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:47,442
the incoming tide can create
considerable forces underwater.

184
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:51,839
The gaps between these islands
on the east coast of Vancouver island

185
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:53,599
channel the tidal flow.

186
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:58,840
As the tide keeps rising,
gradually the water flows faster,

187
00:22:59,007 --> 00:23:02,044
and soon these 30-metre-long
bull kelp plants

188
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:05,165
bend to the current.

189
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:20,918
They are sufficiently flexible
to cope without too much damage,

190
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:26,445
but there are some spots where
the currents are especially powerful.

191
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:29,956
This is the Nakwakto Rapids.

192
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:35,804
At the turn of the tide, water from
almost 700 miles of coastal fjords

193
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:40,040
will have to empty through a gap
half a mile wide.

194
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:45,156
Within a few minutes, the current
is already picking up speed,

195
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:49,002
until water roars by
at over 17 miles an hour.

196
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,838
Tidal currents
are not always damaging.

197
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:35,042
Here, in the Poor Knight islands
of New Zealand,

198
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:40,076
weak tides run through rock arches,
making it an ideal resting place

199
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:41,885
for stingrays.

200
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:55,325
These rays congregate here
in huge numbers every March.

201
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,523
They've come to breed.

202
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:08,318
The arches funnel the current,
which the rays can ride

203
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:12,799
with the minimum of effort,
so saving energy.

204
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:21,599
Nearby, out in open water,

205
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:26,124
a school of two spotted demoiselle
fish are feeding on plankton,

206
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:32,044
and the current is perfect
for sweeping their food past them.

207
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:46,875
0nce the current starts to weaken,

208
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,038
there is insufficient food

209
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:52,324
to warrant the risks
of swimming out in the open.

210
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:56,116
So, the demoiselles head off
to find shelter en masse.

211
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,403
Safety is in numbers.

212
00:26:07,407 --> 00:26:11,844
More and more demoiselles
pour towards the cave entrances

213
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:14,965
that riddle the Poor Knight islands.

214
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:47,122
Safe at last. inside the cave,
they are less exposed

215
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:49,198
to attack from predators.

216
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:55,360
Thousands of demoiselles
and blue mao mao

217
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:59,679
wait for the return of the current,
when, once again,

218
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:02,759
they will head out
into the open to feed.

219
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:11,196
The Moon's gravitational pull
is weaker

220
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:14,245
nearer to the Earth's equator.

221
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:19,117
So, the more equatorial the location,
the smaller the tides.

222
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:24,486
0ut in the Caribbean Sea,
the tidal movements are slight.

223
00:27:24,647 --> 00:27:26,797
Even so, they are sufficient

224
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:30,437
to push free swimming plankton
in their path.

225
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,923
These are thimble jellyfish.

226
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:40,518
They swim towards sunlight,

227
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:44,202
and invisible boundaries
formed by the tidal motion

228
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:50,158
help to herd them together,
until they gather in immense swarms.

229
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:53,205
They put the tropical sunshine
to good use.

230
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,597
Their brown colour comes from algae

231
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:58,486
that live inside
the jellyfish's body

232
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:01,764
and photosynthesise
energy from the sun.

233
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,317
in open water they are fairly safe,

234
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:17,799
but the tide is sweeping the whole
swarm gently towards the Bahamas,

235
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:21,277
where hungry mouths are waiting.

236
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:30,319
Although the sea level
doesn't change much,

237
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:35,242
the tides are still pushing
an enormous volume of ocean water

238
00:28:35,407 --> 00:28:39,480
through the small gaps
between the island cays.

239
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:53,641
Underwater, the tidal currents
race past soft corals...

240
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,727
..and on over
the sandy banks themselves.

241
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:10,404
it is an immense area of coral sand

242
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:14,321
that is only just submerged
at high tide.

243
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:20,722
This incoming tide is bringing in
a fresh supply of oceanic plankton.

244
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:23,037
Razorfish gather at the best spots

245
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:27,246
to catch the pick
of the microscopic feast.

246
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:34,080
Although there's plenty here
for these small fish to eat,

247
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:36,078
gathering in one place

248
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:40,126
makes it easy
for their predators to find them.

249
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:46,163
A nurse shark is little threat.

250
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:51,519
(CHiRPS AND CLiCKS)
But this sound...

251
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:54,520
heralds a quite different danger.

252
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:09,240
A bottlenose dolphin.

253
00:30:12,807 --> 00:30:18,916
it's using its sonar
to locate razorfish beneath the sand.

254
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:30,675
0nce it finds a suitable target,
it simply digs out its prey.

255
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:11,681
The buried fish have no defence
against this attack.

256
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:15,681
They simply have to wait
and hope they aren't found out.

257
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:33,643
This dolphin appears to have
a razorfish craving.

258
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:35,798
Well, she is pregnant.

259
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:48,002
Success at last.

260
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:04,156
The incoming tide
sweeps on towards America,

261
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:07,444
flooding across vast flat
plains of seagrass.

262
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:09,996
They are so shallow
that, at low tide,

263
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:14,399
all large fish are forced
to retreat into deep water channels,

264
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:17,320
like these nurse shark...

265
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,163
..and stingrays.

266
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:25,717
Both predators hunt crustaceans
on the seagrass beds,

267
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:28,401
but until the tide
brings enough water,

268
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,922
they will have to wait.

269
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:41,997
So now, for this tulip snail,
it appears safe

270
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:45,603
to patrol the shallows
in search of a meal.

271
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:47,883
But is it?

272
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,277
This is a rather bigger snail.

273
00:32:57,447 --> 00:33:03,238
At five kilograms in weight,
the giant horse conch

274
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:09,198
has little to fear from any shark,
and it has a taste for tulip snail.

275
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:18,404
Sensing the approaching danger,

276
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,523
the snail flees.

277
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:25,117
But, in a world of snail paces,

278
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,926
the conch
is something of a Ferrari.

279
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:30,647
it calls for desperate measures.

280
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:38,801
Exhausted by the effort
of its last-ditch attempt,

281
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,561
the tulip snail
is slowly gunned down.

282
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:50,206
The tide has to rise
for another hour

283
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:53,837
before the big predators can feed.

284
00:33:54,007 --> 00:33:59,286
But out on the flats, the scent of
dying snail wafts away on the tide.

285
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:06,565
it's a scent these hermit crabs
are particularly partial to.

286
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:13,762
it's vital that the crabs
have the best possible protection

287
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:17,317
from the heavy teeth
of the waiting sharks and rays.

288
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:21,400
For that, they need the shell
with the perfect fit.

289
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:24,718
Today, there is new real estate
on offer -

290
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:28,926
and competition
in this housing market is fierce.

291
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:57,315
The action becomes
even more desperate

292
00:34:57,487 --> 00:35:01,321
when the shell of the devoured
snail is ready for release.

293
00:35:10,127 --> 00:35:13,756
This crab simply can't wait
any longer.

294
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:21,276
But it's a decidedly risky
acquisition.

295
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:27,156
The risk paid off handsomely.

296
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:31,400
The new shell is both lighter
and stronger than the old home.

297
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:36,880
it's not a moment too soon,
because the tide is flooding the plains.

298
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:42,920
At last, the predators are free
to start their foraging.

299
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:55,722
Both stingrays and shark
have an electrical sense

300
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:00,165
which they use to search
for buried invertebrates.

301
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:03,763
They can sense minute movements
beneath the sand.

302
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:11,437
Finding a promising signal,
this ray digs out its meal.

303
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:15,759
An unprotected hermit crab
would have no chance.

304
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,601
Within a few hours,
the tide ebbs out once more

305
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,282
and all the predators
are forced to leave.

306
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:38,598
They will have to wait
until the next high tide

307
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:41,486
before making
another feeding foray.

308
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:48,557
At certain times of the year,
called the equinox,

309
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:53,960
spring tides are exceptionally large
and rise higher than normal.

310
00:36:55,887 --> 00:37:01,200
Predators can reach the shallowest
fringes of the seagrass flats.

311
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:06,157
These two-metre-long tarpon
are going further inshore still.

312
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:09,000
They are heading for the mangroves.

313
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:15,800
These flooded forests cover
huge areas of the coastal shallows.

314
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:22,960
Extraordinarily, the roots of
the mangrove can live in salt water,

315
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:26,483
and they make a perfect nursery
for small fish.

316
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:39,838
Silversides and snapper
find sanctuary in the maze of roots.

317
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,636
Big predators
seldom find a way in here.

318
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:53,756
And now the tide
is falling once more.

319
00:37:56,287 --> 00:38:00,041
The water starts losing
what little oxygen it contained,

320
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:02,846
and quickly becomes stagnant.

321
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:09,123
Most predators
have abandoned the mangroves,

322
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:14,361
but the tarpon are still here,
trapped by the falling tide.

323
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:22,004
Dissolved oxygen
is fast running out,

324
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:26,206
but they have a vital survival
technique...

325
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:30,086
..they can breathe air.

326
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:42,878
Pumped up with fresh oxygen,

327
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:46,676
they can easily out-manoeuvre
the dozy silversides.

328
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,962
The tide has turned again.

329
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,883
And this is no ordinary tide.

330
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:21,357
Since it is the equinox,
the tide is rising fast,

331
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,324
but now, out to sea,

332
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:27,799
a hurricane is on its way,
forcing the tide yet higher.

333
00:39:57,367 --> 00:40:03,317
The passing storm leaves large
areas of the coast flooded.

334
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:09,357
Low-lying islands,
like the Bahamas,

335
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:14,043
are particularly prone
to the storm flooding.

336
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:17,722
The sun's power here is immense.

337
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:22,726
As the tide recedes and the
remaining flood water evaporates,

338
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:26,357
a remarkable transformation
takes place.

339
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:41,442
The mud is coated
with a magical world of salt.

340
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:54,046
Any remaining water
is extremely salty.

341
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:57,085
Very few creatures
can survive here...

342
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,045
except brine shrimp.

343
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,442
And, on the water's edge -

344
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:10,677
brine flies.

345
00:41:10,847 --> 00:41:17,320
Both are the favourite food
of an extraordinary animal.

346
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,400
The Caribbean flamingo.

347
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:28,804
Remarkably, they actually seek out
such briny places.

348
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:33,006
They are the best spots
for them to find their food.

349
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:49,126
They also provide the protection

350
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:52,643
the flamingos need
to raise their young.

351
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:56,800
Nesting sites like this
are surrounded by corrosive brine.

352
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:59,401
it's a formidable barrier

353
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:04,402
to any predator
seeking to dine on flamingo chicks.

354
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:13,158
The flamingos take the precaution
of building raised nests

355
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:15,966
just in case of further flooding.

356
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:27,159
Strangely, it's actually
the power of the storm tides

357
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:32,924
that gives the flamingos food and
a perfect habitat in which to breed.

358
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:48,564
The breeding of many animals
in the ocean

359
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:52,117
is closely co-ordinated
with the tidal cycles.

360
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:57,600
The half moon in November.
it's the time of small tides.

361
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,522
Christmas island in the Pacific.

362
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:09,603
Strange happenings are afoot.

363
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:18,884
it's one of only
a few nights each year

364
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:22,039
when female Christmas island crabs

365
00:43:22,207 --> 00:43:25,756
risk heading down towards the sea.

366
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:30,645
They number in tens of thousands

367
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:36,006
and all of them are laden
with hundreds of eggs.

368
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:40,556
They have to shed them
into the ocean

369
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:43,480
if the eggs are to develop
into baby crabs.

370
00:43:47,847 --> 00:43:49,758
But these are land crabs

371
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:54,125
and they can neither swim
nor breathe underwater.

372
00:44:04,047 --> 00:44:06,242
There's a great risk of drowning.

373
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:11,720
That is why they pick the smallest
tides, to minimise the danger.

374
00:44:38,087 --> 00:44:40,806
The eggs will develop far offshore.

375
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:43,720
And, in exactly one month's time,

376
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:49,120
a swarm of baby crabs will return,
again choosing the perfect tide.

377
00:44:55,687 --> 00:44:59,043
Whether it's the daily
or monthly cycle,

378
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:03,166
tides are the rhythm of the ocean -

379
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:04,919
its pulsing clock.

380
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:07,806
For every tide brings opportunity

381
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,039
to marine life
somewhere in the world.

382
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:19,004
Now, a spring tide
is flooding the shallows,

383
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:21,397
and hunters are on the prowl.

384
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:24,559
A small group of bottlenose dolphin

385
00:45:24,727 --> 00:45:26,922
are working their way inshore

386
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:31,478
to start a quite extraordinary
hunting campaign.

387
00:45:56,647 --> 00:46:02,517
After one successful pass,
the dolphin move off to start again.

388
00:46:02,687 --> 00:46:06,680
0ne animal peels off from the group
and swims in a circle,

389
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:12,956
stirring up the mud and driving
the mullet towards the other dolphins.

390
00:46:14,447 --> 00:46:19,760
it's a remarkable team effort
and it's extremely effective.

391
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:28,406
The dolphin will feed like this

392
00:46:28,567 --> 00:46:34,119
for as long as the tide grants them
access to the shallows.

393
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,044
Eventually,

394
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:25,837
the falling tide will force
the dolphin to leave the flats

395
00:47:26,007 --> 00:47:31,445
and the mullet will be safe
once more, until the next high tide.

396
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:38,398
Because, in the ocean,
every turn of the tide

397
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:43,402
spells the difference
between life and death somewhere.
