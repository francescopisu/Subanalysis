1
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,340
I received this notification

2
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,220
There's nothing for you

3
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,300
But I've been notified

4
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,420
There's nothing

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,060
Check it yourself if you wish

6
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,460
When shall I come again?

7
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,100
When you get another
"notification, perhaps"

8
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,340
Enough of this nonsense!
Who is it?

9
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,060
"I can hear you breathe, you skunk"

10
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,420
I'm sorry

11
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,420
I'm off to empty the dust-bin

12
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,260
The chute's out of order

13
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,060
"I know, I know"

14
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,020
My milk hasn't been delivered

15
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,860
They only deliver every second one

16
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,500
Want to be the milk woman?

17
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,580
I'm too busy

18
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,660
So is the one who used to deliver milk

19
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,420
Yes?

20
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,260
Good morning

21
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,140
What can I do for you?

22
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,580
I heard you were looking for
someone to deliver milk

23
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,580
How old are you?

24
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Nineteen

25
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,740
You still at school?

26
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,220
"No, I'm employed at the post office"
I live in the neighborhood

27
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,980
Do you realize a milkman
get up at five...

28
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,220
in the morning every day?

29
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,820
I get up early anyway

30
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,300
This is the gas-works
emergency service

31
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,580
I have a gas leak to report

32
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,140
Are you sure?

33
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,860
"Yes, You see, I can smell it"
"I can hear it, too"

34
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,100
Where is that leak?

35
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,820
In my gas stove

36
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,620
Have you turned the gas off?

37
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,500
"Your address, please?"

38
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,620
"No. 4, Piratow street"
Flat No.376

39
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,140
Our man will be there soon

40
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,380
Who is it?

41
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,660
The milkmen

42
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,900
You forgot to put the empty bottle out

43
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,940
Yes

44
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,540
Tomek...

45
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,340
Have you got a girl-friend?

46
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,660
No

47
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,900
I suppose nobody's ever told you

48
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,900
"You see, girls pretend to be"
"unceremonious, they kiss boys..."

49
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,860
But actually...

50
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,660
prefer them to be subtle

51
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,540
Should you ever want to
"bring somebody to the flat,"

52
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,860
you're quite free to

53
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,380
I haven't a girl-friend

54
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,900
Tomek!

55
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,140
Tomek!

56
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,260
Good morning?

57
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,140
"I talked to you the last time,"
didn't I?

58
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,020
Yes

59
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,180
I've received another notification

60
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,020
"Well, I don't know"

61
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,500
This is my second visit here

62
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,820
"I know, Madam"
But there's nothing

63
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,820
And the second notification which
seems to be false...

64
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,380
"Quite a mess you have here, eh?"

65
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,580
I'd like to talk to an older person

66
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,540
Pardon?

67
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,780
An older person
The postmaster or somebody

68
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,980
I'll be back

69
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,660
"Yes, Madam?"

70
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,380
This is the first one
It's several days old

71
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,900
And this is the second one
"Two notifications about money orders,"

72
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,620
but there's no money
"And no order, either"

73
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,420
These are notification all right
What's wrong?

74
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,380
But there's no money

75
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,500
I'd like to see the orders

76
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,140
Who's the sender supposed to be?

77
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,940
I don't know
It says twenty-four thousand

78
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,820
Then how do you know the money
was sent to you at all?

79
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,020
"Why, this is the second notification"I got

80
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,820
But the official's told you
"there's nothing, hasn't he?"

81
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,460
That's impossible
I keep getting those...

82
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,500
Mr. Wacek!

83
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,260
"Yes, Madam?"

84
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,700
Take a look at these!

85
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,140
Ordinary notifications

86
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,260
They're from your area
Did you write them out?

87
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,580
"No, it wasn't me"

88
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,420
I always write with a pencil

89
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Don't you hear?
They aren't from our office

90
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,620
I found these in my own post-box!

91
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,420
And there's the stamp of
you office on them

92
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,380
The post office isn't mine
It's national

93
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,380
You must have wrote them out yourself
You'd better inform the police about it

94
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,300
"Yes, you're right"
"May I have the notifications, please?"

95
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,060
"Oh no, you're not getting them"
They're forged

96
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,740
"Just look at her,"
tried to swindle money!

97
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,860
Want anything from me?

98
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,980
I'd like you to know
There wasn't any money

99
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
And the notifications?

100
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,580
That was my doing

101
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,540
Why?

102
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,020
I wanted to see you

103
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,380
To see me?
You wanted to see me

104
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,980
"You cried yesterday, didn't you?"

105
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,500
How do you know?

106
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,220
I've been peeping at you...

107
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,660
I've been peeping at you
through the window

108
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,180
Get out!

109
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,100
"Get out of here, but quick!"

110
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,300
I'm counting three

111
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,540
One...

112
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,500
Two...

113
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,620
Are you looking at me now?

114
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,660
Yes

115
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,980
I moved the bed for you
Can you see it?

116
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
Have a good time

117
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,100
Hey!

118
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,180
You there!

119
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,580
You bum!

120
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,500
Come here!

121
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,180
Come right down!

122
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,820
You're a coward

123
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,940
"Ah, so it's you, baby, eh?"

124
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,100
Now put your hands up!

125
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,940
And never try that trick again

126
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,900
"At you age, it isn't good for you"

127
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,140
I thought it was you

128
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,220
Want to come in? I'm alone

129
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
You're looking swell

130
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,660
"Hardly a fighter, eh?"

131
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,900
"Tell me, why are you peeping at me?"

132
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,700
Because I love

133
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,780
I really do

134
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,260
And what do you want?

135
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,220
I don't know

136
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,940
To kiss me?

137
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,940
No

138
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,980
Or perhaps...

139
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
to go to bed?
"I mean, to make love to me?"

140
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,660
No

141
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,500
Then what do you want?

142
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,620
Nothing

143
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,340
Nothing?

144
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,100
Nothing

145
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,740
Could I ask you to a coffee-shop?
Buy you some ice-cream?

146
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,740
Sorry

147
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,100
How long have you been watching me?

148
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,540
One year

149
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,940
Remember what you said that morning?

150
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,740
Repeat it

151
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,580
I love you

152
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,020
There's no love

153
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,820
There is

154
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,780
No

155
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,500
Got any friends?

156
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,620
"Just one, but he's away"
for the present

157
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,540
Where is he?

158
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,260
In Syria
Serving in the Polish UN troops

159
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,260
I'm living at his mother's now
It's across the street from

160
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,460
I can guess that

161
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,780
"He used to peep at you, too"

162
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,980
Did he tell you about it?

163
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,580
"When he was leaving, he gave me his
"binocular and showed me your window

164
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,860
What did he say?

165
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,460
Well...

166
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,300
Out with it

167
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:42,660
A nice...

168
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:43,580
Go on

169
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,140
A nice chick... Likes a screw...

170
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,060
I know now

171
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,900
"All right, so you love me and work"
"at the post office, what else?"

172
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,780
I learn foreign language

173
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,460
And how many have you
learned already?

174
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,620
Bulgarian...

175
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,860
"That's nice, but what for?"

176
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,180
We had two Bulgarian kids back
at the orphanage

177
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,140
Then I learned English
"Right now, I'm learning Portuguese"

178
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,380
You're a funny kid

179
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,820
"No, I just have a good memory"

180
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,780
I remember everything
From the very beginning

181
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,100
Do you remember the moment
"you were born, too?"

182
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,820
I sometimes seem to remember it

183
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,940
And your parents?

184
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,700
Do you remember a boy...

185
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,780
A slender one...
Used to visit me last autumn...

186
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,420
"I remember him, he brought you milk
and"bread rolls, and collected some parcels"

187
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,060
"That's him, he went abroad"
and never came back

188
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,820
I liked him

189
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,140
"I liked him too, I guess"

190
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,860
"Well, he went to Austria"
and then to Australia

191
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,420
To Australia?

192
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,260
I used to steal you letters

193
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,020
I didn't know they were from him

194
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,980
I work at the post office

195
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,460
You've encircled me

196
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,940
"Delivering my milk,"
summoning me to the office...

197
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,180
"sending gas-fitters to pester me,
"stealing my letters

198
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,380
"Ah well, it doesn't really matter"

199
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,180
Give me your hand

200
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,500
Now stroke me

201
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,580
Look

202
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,620
Experienced men do it this way

203
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,100
Our bus...
Let's make a deal

204
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,060
"If we manage to catch it, you'll visit me"
"If we fail, you won't, O.K.?"

205
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,860
Then give me your hand

206
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,220
What else do you know about me?

207
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,420
Tell me what you see from your window
when I'm having company

208
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,620
It's called making love
I once watched you do it

209
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,420
I don't anymore

210
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,620
It's got nothing to do with love

211
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,420
Tell me what I do on such occasions?

212
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,940
You take your clothes off...

213
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,980
and theirs...

214
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,020
"you take their clothes off, too"

215
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,820
Then you both lie down on the bed

216
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,540
"Sometimes on the floor, too"

217
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,460
Where else?

218
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,500
In the kitchen...

219
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,660
You close your eyes...

220
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,180
then you raise your arms

221
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,620
Can you imitate it?

222
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,820
Ever had a girl?

223
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,260
No

224
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,700
Do you play with yourself while
looking me do it?

225
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,540
Not anymore... I used to

226
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,980
Know it's a sin?

227
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,180
Yes

228
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,100
"But now, I only..."

229
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,220
think about you

230
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,300
Don't say anything now

231
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,860
"You know I'm naked underneath,"
don't you?

232
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,700
A woman who wants to be with a man...

233
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,780
gets wet inside...

234
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,420
And that's what I am right now

235
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,740
You have gentle hands

236
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,420
Don't be afraid

237
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,580
Finished?

238
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,380
"Well, did you like it?"

239
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,300
"See, this is what love is"

240
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,220
You can go to the bathroom
Wipe it away with a towel

241
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,500
"I'm sorry, please come back"

242
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,540
I'm not home

243
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,700
I'm sorry

244
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,540
Did I wake you up?

245
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,460
No

246
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,420
I'm looking for...

247
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,220
He forgot his coat at my flat

248
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,780
Come on in

249
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,100
You'd better lie down

250
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,580
Is he out?

251
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,340
No

252
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,580
He's in a hospital

253
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,380
What happened?

254
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,380
Nothing serious

255
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,100
"He'll be out in several days,"
a dozen maybe

256
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,740
I'd like to visit him there

257
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,860
"You know, he only just left"
my flat...

258
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,780
I know

259
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,740
I'm afraid...

260
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,420
I...

261
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,780
I harmed him

262
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,940
"No, please don't go in there"
He'll be back

263
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,500
Please tell me what happened

264
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,260
You'll think it's funny

265
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,220
He fell in love with you

266
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,340
This is his field-glass
He used to peep at you through it

267
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,580
"Must have stolen it somewhere,"
I guess

268
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,540
"He had binoculars before that,"
about a year long

269
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,980
"And here's his alarm clock,"

270
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,820
set on half past eight

271
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,660
"You come home about that time,"
don't you?

272
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,940
More or less

273
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,700
"He's fallen on the wrong person,"
hasn't he?

274
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:56,540
Yes

275
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,860
I take care of him

276
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,740
"You have a son of your own, don't you"

277
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:05,980
He's away

278
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,580
And he's sure to go away again
as soon as he's back

279
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,740
He's been running away all his life

280
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,700
Never wanted to stay with me

281
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,260
I'm an old woman
I neither need nor want anything

282
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,980
But I'm afraid to be alone
I like to have somebody next to me

283
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:30,940
Good night

284
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,340
May I perhaps phone you...
ask about his health?

285
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,660
There's no phone in this flat

286
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,140
"Excuse me, Madam"

287
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,020
What is his name?

288
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,460
Tomek

289
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,940
Closed

290
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,100
What are these deletions
supposed to mean?

291
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,540
Please never delete anything

292
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:11,700
Excuse me

293
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,900
The number of your flat?

294
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,980
I've got nothing for you

295
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,940
Do you know what happened
to that boy?

296
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,940
Used to work at a counter
in your post office

297
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,180
He cut his veins
"Unhappy love, they say..."

298
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,100
Do you know his name?

299
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,820
"Sorry, you'll have to"
ask the postmistress

300
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,980
Hello?
"Is that you, Tomek?"

301
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,980
Say something

302
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,140
I've been looking for you everywhere

303
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,340
I went to several hospitals

304
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,540
I wanted to find you...

305
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,060
to let you know you were right

306
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,500
"Do you hear, Tomek?"

307
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,300
You were right

308
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,180
I don't really know what to say

309
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,220
How to say it

310
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,700
"That you, Magda baby?"

311
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,740
Yes

312
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,540
This is Wojtek speaking
"Good morning, I mean, Good evening"

313
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,100
Was it you who phoned
just a moment ago?

314
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,300
"Yeah, but I couldn't get through"
Damn it

315
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,220
Did you hear what I was saying?

316
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:32,980
No

317
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,420
Excuse me

318
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,060
Is he back?

319
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,260
Not yet

320
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,340
I don't peep at you anymore
