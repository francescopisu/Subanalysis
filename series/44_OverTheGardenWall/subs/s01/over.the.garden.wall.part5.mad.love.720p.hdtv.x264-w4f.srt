3
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:24,079
Yes, tea! That's my trade!

4
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:27,416
- Quincy Endicott's health tea.
- Your tea sounds good.

5
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:29,385
Ugh. Never touch the stuff myself.

6
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,837
- Bleh. Me either.
- Ha ha! Yes!

7
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:35,307
It's all for the money! Yes,
the money takes my mind off

8
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:38,427
my troubles ... the deep
soul-crushing loneliness.

9
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:41,313
Yes, the more money I make, the

10
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:44,266
bigger my mansion gets,
the more lost I feel.

11
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:46,986
Why, this house is so big,

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,939
I sometimes don't even
know where or who I am!

13
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:52,975
Yeah, well, I'm glad your

14
00:00:53,043 --> 00:00:55,978
nephews here were able to pay a visit.

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,947
- Yeah, yeah!
- Yes, what a ... what a

16
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:00,816
pleasure it is to have company ...
a perfect pleasure.

17
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:03,419
A perfect pleasure, lads!
A per... yes, yes. Yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:07,256
- Ha ha! Yeah! Ha ha!
- # Perfect pleasure, Heather...#

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,845
Um, Beatrice, w-why
are you pretending I'm

20
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:11,760
- this guy's nephew?
- We need money.

21
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:14,296
- You're scamming him?
- I was thinking more like

22
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:16,882
- flat-out stealing from him.
- What? No way.

23
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,268
Why not?
We already stole a horse.

24
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:21,003
- Hey, guys.
- No, we didn't.

25
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:23,405
Fred's a talking horse.
He can do whatever he wants.

26
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:25,774
I want to steal.

27
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:29,111
- What?! You guys are bonkers.
- If we're going to Adelaide's,

28
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:30,880
- we need two cents.
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:33,115
Well, you guys do
what you ... two cents?

30
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:35,484
- Only two cents?
- Yeah, we need two pennies

31
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:37,486
to take the ferry
to Adelaide's pasture.

32
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:41,156
Ha ha! Come everyone!
Let us retire to the parlor

33
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:44,376
and enjoy my unnecessary
excess of wealth and luxury.

34
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:46,879
Well, maybe he just has some

35
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:49,164
loose change somewhere he
wouldn't mind us taking.

36
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:52,001
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-Hmm.
- Hmm.

37
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:56,537
Behold, nephew, the majesty of wealth!

38
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:57,473
<i>Ooh!</i>

39
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:59,174
What was that?! Uh ...

40
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:02,061
What's wrong unkie Endicott?
Your forehead is all sweaty.

41
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:03,929
M-My nerves. My ...
my ... my ner...

42
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,098
my nerves are a bust these days.

43
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:08,434
How come?

44
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:10,686
Uh, yes, yes. Maybe
it would be ... be good to ...

45
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,305
to talk to someone. Well, y...

46
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,288
Actually, it all began one day

47
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:17,159
when I was exploring
my exceedingly large and

48
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:19,945
labyrinthine manor here.
I happened upon a section of

49
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,914
the house I didn't even recall building.

50
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:23,249
Isn't that funny?

51
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,285
Must've been the old wing.
But it was lit in a rather sort

52
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:29,838
of eer... eerie ... eerie light.
And I pressed on, and then I-I

53
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:33,042
saw the painting of the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen,

54
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:38,013
and that's when things
took a rather strange turn.

55
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:41,383
From that day on, I was obsessed
with the woman in the portrait.

56
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,852
She con...
consumed my every thought.

57
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:46,522
I'd fallen in love ...
... with a ghost.

58
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:49,108
Ohhhh.

59
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:51,727
- It's too big. Get a grip.
- Oh, I must sound crazy,

60
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,688
mustn't I?
Perhaps it's time for you all

61
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,398
to leave my treasure-filled home.

62
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,701
- No!
- Yeah, unkie!

63
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:01,870
- I want to see the ghost!
- Ohh, how I long to see her

64
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:04,907
- just once again, as well, yes.
- To the painting!

65
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,825
Yes. Yes.

66
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,407
- Ooh, boy! Ghost hunt!
- Fred, go with them.

67
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:13,415
- Buy me some time.
- While I'm at it, I'll steal

68
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,959
other stuff, too.

69
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:19,171
We're supposed to just be

70
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:22,057
- looking for loose change.
- That's what I'm ...

71
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,059
Oops. That's what I'm doing.

72
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:26,428
Well, let's try not
to break any more ...

73
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:28,931
- Gah!
- Oh, hey.

74
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:31,071
Hey, you didn't check the armoire.

75
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:33,986
Endicott's back. Hide!

76
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:40,159
- Is that the portrait?
- No.

77
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,944
- Is that the portrait?
- No.

78
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:44,278
Look, w-w-why don't I-I
just tell you when we

79
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:46,915
- reach the portrait.
- Okay, what's the matter, unkie?

80
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,200
You seem tense.

81
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:51,909
You know me well, nephew.
Yes, the truth is

82
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:54,857
- I'm frightened.
- Of a ghost?

83
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:58,127
- Ghosts are just floaty things.
- Oh, no, no, not afraid

84
00:03:58,194 --> 00:03:59,428
of the ghost.
I mean I'm afraid what ...

85
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:02,047
What ... what if there is no ghost?

86
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:06,201
What if I'm on the ... on the ...
on the ... on the brink of ...

87
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,138
hmm ... madness.
Maybe the doctors were right.

88
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,939
Come along, boys!
Back to the parlor.

89
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,941
The parlor?
What would anyone go

90
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:15,861
the parlor for?
There's nobody in the parlor ...

91
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:18,230
certainly nobody after your money.

92
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:20,899
Yeah, no giving up now, old man.

93
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:24,319
- It's got to be a ghost!
- But h-how can you

94
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:26,989
- be so certain?
- 'Cause I really, really want

95
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,742
- to see a ghost ... really bad.
- Oh.

96
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:33,328
- Whew.
- Okay, I think they're gone.

97
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:36,215
- Beatrice? You there?
- Bah! Yes, smart guy.

98
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:38,080
Start searching for change.

99
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,753
Uh, I can't see anything in here.

100
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,288
Well, I-I don't think
these coats have pockets.

101
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,991
Check the lining. Maybe
somebody sewed money

102
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:47,326
- into the fabric.
- Nope.

103
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:50,495
- Do people even do that?
- I've done it on my clothes.

104
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:51,781
You wear clothes?

105
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:54,249
Like a little bird vest
or something?

106
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,468
- Or little bows?
- When I was a human, fool.

107
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:58,470
You used to be human?
Did I know that?

108
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,889
- I-I don't think I knew that.
- Jiminy Cricket!

109
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:04,509
Let's just find some coins, all right?
Open the door.

110
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:08,013
It's stuck. Well,
guess we have to spend

111
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:10,349
- some quality time together.
- Help!

112
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,568
The greenhouse.

113
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:17,356
This is where I grow my
camellia for testing new teas.

114
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,633
Perhaps we should savor the ...

115
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:24,596
the quiet tranquility of this ...
this place.

116
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,336
 Ghost!

117
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:33,288
 I can't do it!

118
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:36,208
Uncle Endicott, it's
just a funny chicken.

119
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:39,244
Yes, o-one of my
prize-winning roasting peacocks.

120
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:41,880
Yes, with all this love
in my brain, I, uh, forgot

121
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,548
to feed them.
It's almost as though

122
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:47,302
- I've lost my mind.
- We can look for that after we

123
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,304
find our ghost. Heave-ho!

124
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,224
Yes, yes. Heave-ho.

125
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:56,194
Into the abyss...
never to return.

126
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,898
 Um, anyone want
to go back to the parlor?

127
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:07,572
- Hey. Are you still there?
- Yes, Wirt. I'm still here.

128
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:12,077
- So, how did you become a bluebird?
- Hey, what's that?

129
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,379
- Don't change the subject.
- Hmm.

130
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:17,382
There's a breeze coming

131
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:20,419
- out of here.
- Oh, yeah.

132
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:21,553
- Whoa!
- What?!

133
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:24,973
A secret entrance!
So, about your dark secret.

134
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:28,310
Hey, how about you tell me
your dark secrets instead, huh?

135
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:31,096
My secrets are too secret.
Hey, look. Light.

136
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:33,565
Whoa. Now who's
avoiding the question?

137
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,599
- You.
- Fine.

138
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:37,819
I threw a rock at a bluebird,
and it cursed me and my family,

139
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:42,357
and now we're all bluebirds.
Happy? Now you go.

140
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,242
Whoa. Y-Your whole family?

141
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,528
- Yeah.
- Is that why you're going

142
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:50,165
- to Adelaide's ... to fix things?
- That was the plan, but ...

143
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,534
Yeah, that was the plan.

144
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:55,287
- It'll all work out.
- All I know is I am never

145
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:57,622
going back till I can
make them human again.

146
00:06:57,674 --> 00:07:00,459
I'd do pretty much anything.

147
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:02,794
All right.
My turn, huh? Okay.

148
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,965
Well, it's weird to admit it,
but, well, I-I have this

149
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,967
- crush on this girl.
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:11,103
- That's all.
- That's all?

151
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:13,889
And I think about her a lot,
and I play clarinet.

152
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,675
- Wirt! You got to be kidding me.
- And I secretly whisper

153
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:18,477
poetry to myself in my room at night.

154
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:20,862
Wirt, that stuff's not weird.
Those are just ...

155
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,814
well, the poetry thing is weird.

156
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,983
But those are just character traits.

157
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:26,868
- You played clarinet?
- Sort of.

158
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:29,154
- What else do you do?
- I don't know.

159
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:32,500
Uh ... hey. Does this
room look different to you?

160
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,128
- Uh, how so?
- It's like French-rococo style.

161
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:38,914
That doesn't really seem in
line with Endicott's

162
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:40,332
- Georgian sensibilities.
- How ... what?

163
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:42,167
Who on Earth am I talking to right now?

164
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:43,969
Should I not know that sort of stuff?

165
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,338
Endicott probably just built
it without thinking, right?

166
00:07:46,406 --> 00:07:50,170
Or ... whoa. Yeah.
W-What if the ghost he was

167
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:52,224
talking about was actually...

168
00:07:55,515 --> 00:08:00,068
This is the room where ...
the room where I first saw her.

169
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:06,567
- Whoa! Just a bedroom?
- Just a bedroom, my nephew?

170
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:08,944
This is the chamber of mine own

171
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:13,365
true love, and here she stands,
hovering above us

172
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:18,370
- like the blinding sun.
- Hmm. No ghost?

173
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:23,341
- No ghost? Then I am... mad.
- Don't be mad.

174
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:25,877
Hey. What's this suspicious

175
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:27,846
- mess over here?
- It looks like there was

176
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:32,083
a struggle ... a violent struggle.

177
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:35,387
What are you implying,
my equine friend?

178
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:38,123
Nothing, nothing. I'm just ...
Endicott is a crazed lunatic

179
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:40,475
who did away with the
lady of the house and is now

180
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,310
- pretending to own the place!
- What?!

181
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:45,530
Who do you think you are,
making accusa... I see it now.

182
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:49,263
You're after my money.
Do you know what I did

183
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:53,323
for this money ... t-the things
these filthy hands have done

184
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:56,074
- to make this money?!
- I'll never steal again,

185
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,576
I swear. I'll get an honest job.

186
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,380
- And what say you, nephew?
- Uh, I'm confused.

187
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,166
Well, then ...

188
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,053
She comes for me!

189
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:11,089
Wait, unkie! Face your fears!

190
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:17,429
Mr. Endicott? Are you all right?

191
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:20,565
Psst! Ghost.

192
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,101
What do you want with me, spirit?

193
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:25,270
Spirit? But you're the ghost.

194
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:28,356
My lady, I assure you
I am flesh and blood and I ...

195
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:31,109
I welcome you to my home.

196
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,113
Your home? Good
sir, you're in my home.

197
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:39,000
- Impossible!
- Look here. You see?

198
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:43,505
This is my camellia
garden for my tea company.

199
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:47,008
Margueritte Grey?!
Why, with all due respect,

200
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:50,996
- madam, this is my tea garden.
- Quincy Endicott?!

201
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:54,900
Your guys' mansions are so
huge they're actually connected.

202
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:58,270
So you ... you mean that
beautiful ghost

203
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:02,361
- was really just...
- That dashing specter was really just...

204
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:05,393
<i>My business competitor?</i>

205
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:08,480
Well, Greg, my boy, I can't

206
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:11,900
thank you enough for
helping me to face my fears.

207
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:15,320
You're a ... you're a
sweet boy with good sense.

208
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:18,323
Take this penny and start your fortune.

209
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:21,042
And here's one from me, as well.

210
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,879
Hey, nice.
Now we can ride the ferry.

211
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:26,331
Well, everybody, I think
it's time we head to

212
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:29,251
Adelaide of the pasture,
the good woman of the woods.

213
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,336
Uh, what about you, Fred?
Are you coming with us?

214
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,205
No, thanks. I've got
a real job now as

215
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:37,242
- an official tea horse.
- Well, then I guess that's it.

216
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,511
- Off you go, the lot of you.
- Goodbye.

217
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:41,129
<i>- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.</i>

218
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:44,215
And don't forget to
buy Endicott brand tea.

219
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:48,052
Hey, Wirt.
You did good back there.

220
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:49,888
- Yeah?
- You got a lot more going

221
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:52,774
for you than I thought. Huh?

222
00:10:57,613 --> 00:11:00,131
Greg! Our pennies!
Why did you do that?!

223
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:03,532
'Cause uncle Endicott
pegged me all wrong ...

224
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:08,064
I've got no "cents,"
no "cents" at all.

225
