00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:24,014
Oh!

4
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:26,016
Huh?

5
00:00:30,638 --> 00:00:32,973
<i>- Greg?
- Did you fetch for me</i>

6
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:34,691
<i>- the Golden comb?
- Will that work?</i>

7
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,235
<i>- This is a honeycomb.
- Golden comb of honey.</i>

8
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,697
Greg! Oh!

9
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:42,449
Oh!

10
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:44,784
- Gre-e-g!
- Huh?

11
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:48,488
<i>Never mind that, Gregory.
You've brought me the first two items ...</i>

12
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:51,741
<i> a golden comb and
a spool of silver thread.</i>

13
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:53,710
It's just spider web on a stick.

14
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:57,397
- Now I want the sun.
- The sun?

15
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:00,667
<i>Here.
Lower the sun out of the sky </i>

16
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:04,634
- and into this China cup.
- Uh, well, that sounds impossible.

17
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:06,556
<i>Anything is possible if you</i>

18
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:09,259
<i>set your mind to it, right?
But hurry, the sun will</i>

19
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:11,761
- be setting soon, and ...
- Hey, yeah, that's it.

20
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:13,980
* Duh dih-dunh *
* dunh-dunh din-dunh *

21
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:17,817
* duh din-din dunh *

22
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:22,439
See, that old sun's going
right down into this old cup.

23
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:25,859
<i>You have figured it out, and
I thought you might give up.</i>

24
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,829
Give up? I'll never give up.

25
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:32,582
Just got to wait, just got to wait.

26
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:36,786
<i>Yes, just sit there
in the cold and wait.</i>

27
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,303
Huh?

28
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:46,012
- Ohh.
- What the...

29
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:47,881
- Ohh. Ohh.
- Beatrice?

30
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:49,849
- Wirt!
- Beatrice!

31
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:52,519
- What are you doing out here?!
- I saw Greg!

32
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:54,387
- What?!
- I saw Greg.

33
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:57,023
He was w-with someone.
This way!

34
00:01:57,058 --> 00:02:00,694
- Or wait. Um...
- Beatrice, you should go home.

35
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:04,447
I can't ... not yet.
Not until Greg is safe.

36
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:07,734
- Okay.
- We should hurry.

37
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:11,404
- I ... I think it was that way.
- Thank you, Beatrice.

38
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:21,965
Ohh.

39
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,418
Here! Edelwood!

40
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:29,119
You see? This will give
us some oil, won't it?

41
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:31,424
Yes, we'll keep that light of

42
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:35,495
yours shining, won't we?
Come on.

43
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:37,697
Ohh!
Aw! You...

44
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:43,503
Oh! Oh!

45
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,889
<i>* ...darkness *</i>

46
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:54,158
<i>* there is a light for
the lost and the meek *</i>

47
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:59,269
<i>* hard woe and fear *</i>

48
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,979
<i>* are easily forgotten *</i>

49
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:11,381
<i>* when you submit
to the soil of the Earth *</i>

50
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:16,052
<i>Woodsman, I knew you would come.</i>

51
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:18,888
<i>I have something for you.</i>

52
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:22,725
Oh! Oh!
What have you done?!

53
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:25,094
<i>Why, I've given you another edelwood.</i>

54
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:27,930
<i>- No!!
- He will burn nicely in the lantern.</i>

55
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:31,134
No! I won't do this!

56
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:34,203
<i>You've been grinding up lost
souls for years.</i>

57
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,640
I didn't know!
I didn't know this is where

58
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,342
the edelwood trees came from!

59
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:40,977
<i>And would it have mattered?</i>

60
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:44,080
<i>Would you have just let your
daughter's spirit </i>

61
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:47,316
<i>burn out forever?
Feed the lantern.</i>

62
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:50,219
<i>- No.
- I suppose, after all these</i>

63
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:52,755
<i>years, you just don't
care for her anymore.</i>

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,758
Hold your tongue, or I'll
remove it from your mouth!

65
00:03:55,809 --> 00:04:00,513
Do not speak of my daughter.
She would not wish this.

66
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:04,567
- Let's get you free.
- Ahh.

67
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,102
No.

68
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:09,289
<i>I only wish to help you, woodsman.
You need oil,</i>

69
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,859
- or else your daughter will ...
- I told you to hold your tongue!

70
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:22,869
<i>Greg?</i>

71
00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:27,256
<i>- Greg!
- I thought it was this way.</i>

72
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,593
- A light.
- A lantern.

73
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:33,167
It looks like the woodsman's.

74
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:39,535
- Whoa. What happened here?
- Greg!

75
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:41,554
Greg! Are you...

76
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:44,006
- Wirt?
- Oh, Greg!

77
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:46,959
Wirt, I did it.
I beat the beast.

78
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:50,813
Aw, geez, the leaves are even

79
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:53,015
- growing inside of him.
- No.

80
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,986
I was just eating leaves.
I'm sorry, Wirt.

81
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:59,906
No, no, Greg.

82
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,209
It's my fault we ended up here.
Everything's been my fault.

83
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:06,064
- I-I should have been more ...
- No, I mean

84
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:08,831
- my rock facts rock.
- What?

85
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,801
I ... I stole it, Wirt.

86
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,538
I stole it from Mrs. Daniel's
garden. I'm a stealer.

87
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,741
- And that's a rock fact.
- What?

88
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:21,978
- No, Greg, that doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

89
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:26,065
You have to return it for me, okay?

90
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,785
No, you can give it to her yourself.
Come on, we got to get

91
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:32,855
Jason Funderberker home, right?

92
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:38,194
Jason Funderberker ...
the perfect... frog name.

93
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:42,582
- Greg? Greg?!
- Let's get him out of this! Come on!

94
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:46,202
Yeah. Yeah...

95
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:48,804
- Come on!
- It's gonna be fine, Wirt.

96
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,878
<i>Give me my lantern.</i>

97
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:58,014
- Your lantern?
- No way. We need this thing.

98
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:00,216
Yeah, I'm keeping this.
I have to get Greg home.

99
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,635
<i>Your brother is too weak to go home.</i>

100
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,888
<i>He will soon become part of my forest.</i>

101
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,092
- I won't let that happen!
- Well, then, perhaps we

102
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,628
- better make a deal.
- Deal?

103
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:16,132
<i>- Ohh.
- I can put his spirit in the lantern.</i>

104
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,979
<i>As long as the flame stays lit,
he will live on inside.</i>

105
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,366
<i>Take on the task of lantern bearer...</i>

106
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:28,066
<i>or watch your brother perish.</i>

107
00:06:28,912 --> 00:06:32,665
<i>Come here.</i>

108
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:35,229
- Okay.
- Wirt!

109
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:39,255
Wait. That's dumb.

110
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:40,890
- What?
- That's dumb.

111
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:43,092
I'm not just gonna just wander
around in the woods

112
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,595
- for the rest of my life.
- I'm trying to help you.

113
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:46,830
You're not trying to help me.

114
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:49,982
<i>You just have some weird obsession
with keeping this lantern lit.</i>

115
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,768
<i>I-It's almost like your soul is
in this lantern.</i>

116
00:06:57,824 --> 00:07:00,910
<i>Are you ready to see true darkness?</i>

117
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:10,104
Are y...
Are you?

118
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:15,207
<i>Don't! Don't!</i>

119
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,010
Here, woodsman.

120
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:20,630
I've got my own
problems to take care of.

121
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:22,214
This one's yours.

122
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:25,443
My brother and I are going home.

123
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:30,690
She was never in the lantern,
was she, beast?

124
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:34,694
<i>Listen, woodsman.
Listen to me.</i>

125
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:38,981
- Wirt...
- Come with us.

126
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,467
I ... I got to go home, too,

127
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:46,706
admit to my family it's my fault
they're bluebirds.

128
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,708
- What?!
- The scissors that'll make

129
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,661
- your family human again.
- You had them all along?!

130
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:55,047
I-I used them to escape
Adelaide, and then ... then...

131
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,249
Yeah, I-I was sort of mad at you.

132
00:07:57,584 --> 00:08:01,253
Oh, you...
wonderful mistake of nature!

133
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:05,107
<i>You see, woodsman?
All who perish here will become</i>

134
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:09,612
<i>trees for the lantern.
Cut them down with your ax.</i>

135
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,306
<i>Go! Now!</i>

136
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,932
No!

137
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:16,018
<i>Stop!</i>

138
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,071
<i>You'll never see your daughter
again, woodsman.</i>

139
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:22,191
<i>Are you really ready to go back
to that empty house?</i>

140
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:26,903
<i>No! Woodsman!</i>

141
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:32,335
<i>- Goodbye, Beatrice.
- Goodbye, Wirt.</i>

142
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:34,587
<i>* One is a bird *</i>

143
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:37,587
<i>* two are the trees *</i>

144
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:43,529
<i>* three is the wind in the leaves *</i>

145
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,082
- Help. 
- Wirt!

146
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:49,618
<i>* Four are the stars *</i>

147
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,789
<i>- # Five with the moon #
- Wirt? You ok?</i>

148
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:57,526
- Can you see me, Wirt?
- Hmm. Where am I?

149
00:08:57,594 --> 00:08:59,995
- The hospital.
- Hosp... ital?

150
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:03,449
- Greg! Where's Greg?!
- And then... Wirt!

151
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,818
I was telling them about the
time we almost got ...

152
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,739
Yeah, and you were there, too,
Jason Funderberker.

153
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:13,876
- Me?  - Not you.
Jason Funderberker, my frog.

154
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,661
Our frog.

155
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:18,214
- Our frog.
- Our frog?

156
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:23,969
<i>- No, not your frog.
- Hey, so... uh... about this...</i>

157
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:29,475
Yeah, so, I don't have a
tape player, so...

158
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,595
- Uh, yeah.
- So maybe we can listen to this...

159
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:36,098
You can listen to it at my
house. Yes.

160
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:39,971
Maybe ... Maybe we should listen
to some other tapes first,

161
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:42,279
though, and sort of
work our way to this one.

162
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:45,441
This one is a little bit...
Uh, yeah, I mean, y-you can listen to it...

163
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:46,776
And so the story is complete,

164
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,828
<i>and everyone is
satisfied with the ending.</i>

165
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:53,199
<i>And so on and so forth, and yet,
over the garden wall...</i>

166
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,885
<i>* How the gentle wind *</i>

167
00:09:55,886 --> 00:10:00,973
<i>* beckons through the leaves *</i>

168
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:07,505
<i>- # as autumn colors fall #
- Father?</i>
