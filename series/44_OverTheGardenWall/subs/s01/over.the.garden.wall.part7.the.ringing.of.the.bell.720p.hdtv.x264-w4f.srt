3
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,897
- What are we doing?
- We're walking, Greg.

4
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:43,640
- But where?
- A place to wait out this rain.

5
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,691
Oh. But...

6
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:47,837
shouldn't we wait for Beatrice?

7
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:50,039
I don't need Beatrice.

8
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:53,429
- I-I'll figure this out on my own.
- Oh, that's good.

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,111
I'm glad you have a plan.

10
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,489
- Hey, Wirt?
- What?

11
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,366
So, what's the plan?
'Cause you're not saying any

12
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:02,969
- details, so it's hard for me ...
- Greg, I do have a plan.

13
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,405
And if you don't trust
me, then you don't have

14
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:07,067
to follow me, okay?
If you want to go look for

15
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:09,407
Beatrice, go ahead.
You can do anything you want.

16
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:13,930
Anything?
That's a lot of power.

17
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,860
Wirt! Oh, no!
Did I knock down that tree

18
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:20,102
with my powers?
Sorry. Are you okay?

19
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:21,807
Yeah. That tree just came at me

20
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:23,029
out of nowhere.

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,241
Greg, look ... ax marks.

22
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:29,245
- Someone chopped it down.
- Indeed. It was I.

23
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:30,658
 Ohh!

24
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:33,851
Stop! Listen!
The beast knows your presence!

25
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,805
Ready to claim you as part
of his dark forest, but

26
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:41,090
only if you give up! Keep
hearty in both body and spirit

27
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:44,260
and you shall be safe from him.

28
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:48,998
Fall ill or lose hope and your
life shall pass into his

29
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,534
crooked hands. 
Children!

30
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:54,929
<i>Please, heed my warning!</i>

31
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,940
Boys, beware the beast!

32
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:59,909
<i>- Woodsman.
- Huh?</i>

33
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:03,433
<i>We should talk.</i>

34
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:09,869
- I think we lost him.
- Ha ha! You got him with the

35
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:12,405
- old kickeroo!
- See? I got it under control.

36
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:15,241
I don't need Beatrice.
Now, to find someplace

37
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:17,744
- to wait out this rain...
- As long as it's not that old,

38
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,716
- broken-down ...
- Whoa. Shh!

39
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:23,549
It's perfect! Come on, Greg!

40
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:27,754
Uh, Wirt...
ain't that just the way?

41
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:31,557
This place isn't so bad.

42
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:32,925
- Huh?
- Maybe.

43
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,511
* dum dum-dum dum-dum
dum dum *

44
00:02:35,596 --> 00:02:38,540
- Get that frog out of your pants.
- He can do what he wants.

45
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,851
Hey, what's in these old
baskets? Whoa!

46
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:43,519
- What?
- We're rich!

47
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:44,771
- What?
- Look!

48
00:02:44,822 --> 00:02:47,523
It's full of black turtles!
We're turtle rich!

49
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:52,445
You know, it's kind of funny,
finding a basket of turtles in

50
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:54,580
- an abandoned house, huh?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:57,500
Greg, not that kind of funny.

52
00:02:57,584 --> 00:02:59,369
- Huh? Oh.
- Auntie?

53
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:01,954
<i>Auntie, I finished sorting ...</i>

54
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,589
Who are you?!

55
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:05,458
- We're burglars!
- No, no. No, no.

56
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:07,877
We're ... we're not. We
just needed to get out of the

57
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:10,546
rain, and we thought this
place was abandoned, so we ...

58
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,548
So we came here to burgle
your turts.

59
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,467
- No, it's not true.
- It is true!

60
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:17,770
<i>Oh, okay. I give up.</i>

61
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:20,556
- Ha! See?
- I believe you, but, please

62
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:22,892
hide yourselves at once.

63
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:25,978
- Auntie Whispers is coming soon.
- Uh, what?

64
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:36,622
Hide, quickly!
Welcome home, Auntie.

65
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:41,043
Lorna, my sweet child.

66
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:46,749
- Hmm. Has anyone come here today?
- Nay, auntie ... not a soul.

67
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:50,887
Then no one shall be
devoured alive tonight?

68
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:54,340
<i>- Nay, I pray not, mum.
- Devoured alive?</i>

69
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:57,343
You're a good girl,
Lorna, but you deceive me.

70
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:59,679
I speak the truth, Auntie.
I swear.

71
00:03:59,763 --> 00:04:02,515
Deceive me not, child.
I can smell them.

72
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,351
I can smell the children

73
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:06,819
- in this house.
- What? Children?

74
00:04:06,854 --> 00:04:09,739
- I'm, like, in high school.
- Yeah, well, you still stink.

75
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:11,023
- Shh!
- You "shh."

76
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:13,910
Tell me where you are
hiding them, precious one.

77
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:16,662
- I ...
- The ringing of the bell

78
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:18,998
commands you.

79
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:25,538
Look...
in the basket.

80
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:30,927
<i>You have entered the house
of doom, children ... your doom.</i>

81
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:34,630
Oh. My dear, why, all along,

82
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:38,851
you meant it be the
turtles that smell so ripe.

83
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:41,437
A-A-Aye.
That is what I meant.

84
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:43,890
Mm.

85
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:47,443
Then you have no evil secrets to keep?

86
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:52,448
- Nay. I have none.
- Then off to bed go I,

87
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:56,637
and you, Lorna ... you shall
sort the bones of those who

88
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:59,872
- have been eaten here before.
- I have finished already.

89
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:02,458
Then clean this
floor until it shines.

90
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:05,791
The ringing of the bell commands you.

91
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:09,786
Yes, Auntie Whispers.

92
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:12,952
You know I do this for you, child.

93
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:17,089
Keeping you busy is the only
way to keep evil spirits from

94
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:20,459
- driving you to wickedness.
- Do not worry,

95
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:23,796
Auntie Whispers.
The work shall keep me busy.

96
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,966
Good night, my dear.

97
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,861
<i>And dowse that fire.
I did not ask you to light it.</i>

98
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:43,649
Come out, my turtles.
She sleeps.

99
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,234
- You sure?
- Aye.

100
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:47,787
Uh, are you all right?

101
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:50,956
- You've been coughing a lot.
- It's my illness.

102
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:53,626
It's the reason Auntie
Whispers is so hard on me.

103
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,912
Gosh! That lady is so bad.
You should go see a doctor.

104
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:59,465
Auntie does not allow visitors here.

105
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:02,585
She believes outsiders will
lead me to become wicked.

106
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,708
Yeah.
See? That's superweird.

107
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:07,605
I don't mean to insult
your family, but ...

108
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,059
- Oh, she's not my real aunt.
- Oh, my gosh. See?!

109
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:12,912
Hey, where'd Dr. Cucumber go?

110
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:16,482
- Hey, I'm gonna get you!
- So, you got to keep sweeping

111
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,150
- till you're done?
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:21,237
The work never ends. By the
time this task is complete,

113
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:23,611
she will return and order
me to a new task,

114
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,592
- and so it goes.
- If I help and we get the work

115
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,164
- done fast, maybe you can...
- Escape? With you?

116
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:35,568
- Yeah.
- Can we escape with you, too?

117
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:39,404
- Greg...
- Hmm. Yes. Perhaps this ...

118
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:42,022
this time it could be different.

119
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,910
Here.

120
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:52,789
- Uh, I'll take that side.
- Mm, something weird is going on.

121
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:54,387
Where are you going?

122
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:55,855
<i>* Here we are *</i>

123
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:59,942
<i>- # two of us, like ships #
- # like ships #</i>

124
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:03,612
<i>* upon a winding river *</i>

125
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:05,531
<i>- # and yet #
- # and yet #</i>

126
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:09,668
<i>* somehow we found each other *</i>

127
00:07:09,736 --> 00:07:13,739
<i>* like strangers, you and I *</i>

128
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:19,795
Hey! You can run and you
can hide! Paging Dr. Cucumber!

129
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,225
You're needed in the
operating ro-o-o-o-o-o-o-om!

130
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,218
Well, looks pretty good.

131
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:28,804
I think we're done.

132
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,673
- Why have you come here?
- Oops!

133
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:33,092
You shan't remain alive
for long in this house.

134
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:35,845
I'm warning you, children ...

135
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,750
keep away from my Lorna,

136
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:40,482
or you shall be hastily gobbled up!

137
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,651
We ... we don't
want no trouble, lady.

138
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,603
Let's just talk it out.
I'm Wirt.

139
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:47,606
- Lorna, come here.
- Uh... uh...

140
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:50,609
The ringing of the bell
comman... uh, where ...

141
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:52,912
Did I put the bell on my nightstand?

142
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:56,699
- Follow me.
- Noooooooo!

143
00:07:56,783 --> 00:08:01,725
<i>Come out before it is too
late. Unlock this door.</i>

144
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,457
- She will devour you.
- What is she talking about?

145
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:11,096
- More bones to sort.
- No!

146
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:14,567
I told you boys to stay away
from her, but now you've gone

147
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:16,719
- and made her wicked again.
- Oh-ho!

148
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:19,317
For some reason, I
thought that old lady was

149
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:21,832
the people-eater, but
it was Lorna all along.

150
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,644
It just goes to show you stuff.
Now I have a plan that'll ... Ugh!

151
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:30,983
- Your plan was better.
- I'm sorry, my turtles...

152
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:33,652
...but I must feed!

153
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:41,126
- Greg!
- Let's try my plan now.

154
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:44,630
The ringing of the bell commands you.

155
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:46,749
What the ...

156
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,969
Oh. He ate the witch's
magic bell when we were ...

157
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:53,072
- Fine! Do something.
- Oh. I command you to...

158
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:55,994
- The spirit compels me.
- ...transform into

159
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:58,594
- a magical tiger.
- The ringing ... the ringing of

160
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:00,765
the bell commands you!
Stop making Lorna

161
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:02,715
do bad stuff, spirit!

162
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:04,717
And also go away
and don't come back.

163
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:10,606
Lorna! Lorna!

164
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,760
Wirt, look!

165
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:16,762
Lorna!

166
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:20,532
- Wirt, you saved me.
- Lorna? Lorna?

167
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,669
- Oh, my Lorna.
- Auntie Whispers!

168
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,804
I thought they'd stolen you away.

169
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:28,941
No, Auntie. They saved me.
They banished the evil spirit

170
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,011
- with the power of the bell!
- You can have it back after

171
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:36,015
- Greg Jr. goes to the bathroom.
- Oh, Lorna...

172
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:40,122
- that's wonderful, dear.
- Auntie Whispers, what's wrong?

173
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:41,887
Well, now that you're cured,

174
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:45,858
you won't be needing old
Auntie Whispers any more

175
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,894
- to look after you.
- Oh, Auntie, no.

176
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:51,113
- Ohh.
- I would never leave you.

177
00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:55,597
- You are my family.
- Ah. Ohh.

178
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:59,045
- Thank you so much, Wirt.
- And a bit of advice ...

179
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:03,709
beware of my sister, Adelaide.
She lives in the pasture.

180
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:08,047
- She must not be trusted.
- Perhaps I'll see you

181
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:11,918
again someday. I hope so.

182
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,173
Smell you later.

183
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:17,037
Wow, Wirt!

184
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:20,134
- You saved the day twice today!
- Yeah, I guess.

185
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,687
But so what? We're
still not any closer to

186
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,847
getting home. I just
don't know what I'm doing

187
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:27,244
out here anymore.
I don't know if we'll ever

188
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,568
- get back home.
- Sure, we will!

189
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:31,937
What can stop us?
You got a plan, remember?

190
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:34,023
- I lied.
- Aw, come on.

191
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:36,859
Let's go, captain!
Lead the way!

192
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:39,111
You can do it!

193
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:42,481
<i>Yes. Yes.
All hope will soon be lost.</i>

194
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:46,151
<i>We're lucky the boy had
the pluck to best you.</i>

195
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:48,237
<i>Your play could have cost us both.</i>

196
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:50,989
<i>Don't you care about
keeping the lantern lit?</i>

197
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:53,492
<i>Don't you care about
your daughter's soul?</i>

198
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:56,795
One cannot trade the souls of children

199
00:10:56,796 --> 00:11:01,530
as if they were tokens!
There has to be another way.

200
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:05,337
<i>No. There is only me.
There is only my way.</i>

201
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:09,725
<i>There is only the forest,
and there is only surrender.</i>

202
