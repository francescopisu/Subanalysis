1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,506
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,217
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:13,347
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,519
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,285
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,706
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,599
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,321
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:17,286
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,006
DECISION

17
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,311
I relinquish ownership
of this notebook.

18
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,648
Take care of Misa.

19
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,169
<i>Mister Stalker...</i>

20
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,380
<i>Hey, Mister Stalker,
where are you?</i>

21
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,342
<i>Let's stop playing this game...</i>

22
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,845
"Stalker?" What does this mean?

23
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,222
Her attitude completely
changed all of a sudden...

24
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,731
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

25
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,401
<i>So as long as I have Ryuk's notebook,
even if! relinquish Rem's notebook,</i>

26
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,321
<i>my memory of Rem doesn't disappear...</i>

27
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,200
<i>But Rem, all these troubles are
happening to me because...</i>

28
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,703
<i>you brought another notebook
to the Human World...</i>

29
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,415
You really sure about this, Light?

30
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,084
Yeah...

31
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,588
I never thought that the notebook
I gave you

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,007
would end up buried in the ground...

33
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,303
Listen Ryuk, I'm just hiding it
there in the ground.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,473
I won't get rid of it until...

35
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,267
the next time I say, "get rid of it. "

36
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,937
When I say it,
regardless of the context,

37
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,482
assume it means I want to
get rid of the notebook.

38
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,192
Got it...

39
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,071
<i>Mister Stalker, this is illegal. Stop it.</i>

40
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,323
<i>Please, Mister Stalker!</i>

41
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,158
She's been acting like this

42
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,244
ever since she passed out and
regained consciousness...

43
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,331
Honestly. Does she think
she can act dumb like this?

44
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,083
<i>Okay, I know.</i>

45
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,128
<i>Could you at least take off
my blindfold?</i>

46
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,547
<i>I really want to see
what you look like...</i>

47
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,718
Mr. Matsuda...
Give Mr. Mogi a call.

48
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,927
Huh?

49
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,303
Oh...

50
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,723
Here...

51
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,684
When you apprehended Misa Amane,

52
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,019
you told her that we suspect
that she's the Second Kira, didn't you?

53
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,355
Yes... I did as you told me.

54
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,191
I covered her eyes and mouth from
behind and told her so she could hear,

55
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:57,362
"You're under arrest on suspicion
of being the Second Kira. "

56
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,531
She didn't seem to struggle

57
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,158
even when I put handcuffs
and the eye mask on her.

58
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,492
She seems to have given up.

59
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,246
<i>I'll give you an autograph or
shake your hand...</i>

60
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,249
<i>That's it! I'll give you
a kiss on the cheek!</i>

61
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,085
<i>Please! I won't run away...</i>

62
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,298
<i>We'd made so much progress with her.</i>

63
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,967
<i>Why is she suddenly talking
about a stalker?</i>

64
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,137
<i>Misa Amane.</i>

65
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,349
What, Mister Stalker?
Are you planning to release me?

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,102
<i>You were quiet before you fell asleep.</i>

67
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,773
<i>You asked us to kill you.
Are you trying to give us trouble now?</i>

68
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,983
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,528
You're the one who knocked me out
and brought me here, aren't you?

70
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:43,992
So what? Do you want to
play "investigation"? Is that it?

71
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,955
Do you know why
you're tied up right now?

72
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,792
<i>Why? Because I'm an idol?</i>

73
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,671
You're the first stalker
who's ever gone this far.

74
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,967
Hey?! Amane, quit fooling around!

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,429
This is scary... W-What is this?

76
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:08,433
I can't stand it anymore!
Let me go! Let me go...!

77
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,019
Oh yeah... I have to go to
the bathroom again.

78
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,188
I want to go to the bathroom...!

79
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:18,276
<i>It's been only four minutes since
you last went. Please bear with it.</i>

80
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,030
What's with that?!
That's the only way you'll untie me!

81
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:27,702
You'll get to see me pee again.
Isn't that what you want? You pervert!

82
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,539
I'm... a pervert?

83
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,419
Amane, let's seriously talk more about
what happened before you went to sleep.

84
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,715
Do you know Light Yagami?
Why did you approach him?

85
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,053
Huh? There's no way
I wouldn't know my own boyfriend...

86
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,889
<i>She was so tight-lipped
about it earlier,</i>

87
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,100
<i>but now, she nonchalantly
says that he's her boyfriend?</i>

88
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,601
What's going on?

89
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,772
It's from Light.

90
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,733
Please turn the AV off.

91
00:05:58,942 --> 00:05:59,943
<i>Yes.</i>

92
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:07,450
Yes... Yes... Yes, I understand.
We're in room K2801.

93
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,828
My son's coming here?

94
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,761
Ryuzaki, I told you
over the phone, but...

95
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,598
I think I might be Kira.

96
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,895
That's impossible!
Light, what are you talking about?!

97
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,564
What's wrong?! Tell me!

98
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,942
<i>There's no proof that
Light Yagami is Kira,</i>

99
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,362
<i>but... for him to say that
he may be Kira?</i>

100
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,031
<i>It's all an act...</i>

101
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,658
<i>It's not that you "might be" Kira,
but that you are Kira...</i>

102
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,161
<i>What are you planning?</i>

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,331
Dad, if Ryuzaki is L,

104
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,000
then he is unquestionably
the best detective in the world.

105
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:02,297
If L has decided that I am Kira.
Therefore, I must be.

106
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,592
What are you talking about, Light?!

107
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,345
The people Raye Penber,
the FBI Agent in Japan,

108
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,723
was investigating before he died...

109
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,601
The people that went to
Aoyama on May 22nd...

110
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,563
And the first person
the alleged Second Kira, Misa,

111
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,690
approached in the Kanto region...

112
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,609
It's all me.

113
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,031
If I were in L's place,
even I would say that I'm was Kira...

114
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:34,454
See... I may be Kira.
I just might not know it.

115
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,206
Light...

116
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,876
<i>I see... You're not conscious of it, huh?</i>

117
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,505
I'm not sure of anything anymore...

118
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,882
Even if I have no memory...

119
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,845
there could be another me
who's killing people as I sleep.

120
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,847
That would be impossible.

121
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,433
What do you mean, Ryuzaki?

122
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,103
Actually, there was a time when

123
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,523
I put surveillance cameras
in your room for five straight days.

124
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,149
Cameras?

125
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,237
Yes. You slept normally at night...

126
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,534
Criminals who were broadcasted,
that you didn't know about were dying.

127
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,869
But I decided that,
even if you were Kira,

128
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,041
you wouldn't give yourself
away on camera.

129
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,421
"Won't give myself away," huh?

130
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,215
That may be true...

131
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,009
Well, up to a certain point,

132
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,846
I believe that some
major criminals should die...

133
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:38,226
I think that anyone who has
such thoughts could become Kira.

134
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,563
Light! I believe the same thing!

135
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,608
I've thought it would be better
if quite a few people were dead.

136
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:49,738
But, even so,
we can't really kill people, right?

137
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,783
Besides, criminals were dying
while you had no knowledge of them.

138
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,661
The surveillance cameras proved that!

139
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,288
N- No...

140
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,582
We were short of investigators then

141
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,333
and we only watched him
when he was at home...

142
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,129
It's also not as if we were watching him
every hour during those five days...

143
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,175
There might have been a way for him
to kill while he wasn't at home.

144
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,307
<i>Is this all part of your plan,
Light Yagami?</i>

145
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:23,396
<i>But if we restrain you for
a long period like Amane,</i>

146
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,566
<i>and criminals
still continue to die...</i>

147
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,612
<i>Is Yagami Light no longer
Kira at that point?</i>

148
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,364
<i>Is this what you're aiming for?</i>

149
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,541
I don't like where
this is going but...

150
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,627
Fine.

151
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,091
Light Yagami will be restrained
and placed under confinement.

152
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,884
W- What..?!

153
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,386
You're going to detain... Light?

154
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,556
If we're doing this,
we have to do this now.

155
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,477
You will not be allowed to
leave my sight before then.

156
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,314
T- This is crazy.
There's no way that my son is Kira...

157
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,525
My son wouldn't...

158
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,651
It's fine, Dad.

159
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,027
Light...

160
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:18,535
There's no way I'll be able to
pursue Kira if I suspect myself.

161
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:23,081
In exchange, Ryuzaki,
until you decide that I'm not Kira

162
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,874
or you agree that I'm not Kira,

163
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,796
don't let me go, no matter what I say
or whatever condition I'm in.

164
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,048
Understood...

165
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,051
Mr. Yagami, are you able to
come up with an excuse

166
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,096
for Light's absence for your family?

167
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,014
Actually, please just do it.

168
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,976
Well, I'm not too sure
I can so suddenly...

169
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,562
But why does my son have to be
thrown into a prison?

170
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,147
You're being stubborn, Dad.

171
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,983
I can't be fully satisfied with myself
unless I do this.

172
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,944
Are you serious, Light?

173
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,198
Yeah. By taking away
my freedom,

174
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,451
I'll be able to defeat the fear of
Kira that lies within me.

175
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,122
Mr. Aizawa, I leave him to you.

176
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:05,999
Yes...

177
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,902
FIRST DAY OF CONFINEMENT

178
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,698
Does this mean I won't
be able to eat apples again?

179
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,752
Ryuzaki...

180
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,088
Please take me off
of the investigation.

181
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,340
Chief!

182
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,719
We're holding my son as
a suspect in this case...

183
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,388
I shouldn't be here.

184
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,891
Regardless of whether
we should investigate him,

185
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,310
when we were talking
about confining him,

186
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,188
I let my personal feelings
get in the way...

187
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,359
That's true.
Personal feelings shouldn't be involved.

188
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:19,822
A- And, if my son really is Kira...

189
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,617
I don't know what kind of
actions I may take.

190
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:29,749
Yes. I can imagine that you would...
kill your son and then kill yourself.

191
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,379
I agree that we shouldn't
have you here.

192
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,340
Ryuzaki!

193
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,467
Could you confine me as well?

194
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,844
I'm calm now, but...

195
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,681
I don't know what I'll do
when my feelings for my son...

196
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,600
I thought you might
say something like that,

197
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,769
so I've had Watari make arrangements.

198
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,983
However, even though
you'll be under confinement...

199
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,860
please keep your cell phone on as usual.

200
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,947
Maintain regular contact with your family
and people from the outside.

201
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,033
We won't tell Light about this.

202
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,077
And if Light wants to talk to you

203
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,080
we'll have you talk to him as if
you're right here, inside HQ.

204
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,959
Also, we will give you
continuing updates

205
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,878
of the what's going on
in the investigation.

206
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,299
Is that okay?

207
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,468
I am indebted to you, Ryuzaki...

208
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,473
THIRD DAY OF CONFINEMENT

209
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,480
<i>Mister Stalker,
I want to take a bath.</i>

210
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,444
<i>You know where I live, don't you?
Bring me a change of clothes...</i>

211
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,155
This has gotten crazy...

212
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,158
I feel so sorry for the Chief...

213
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,454
<i>Ryuzaki, what's happening?</i>

214
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,832
<i>Have any new criminals
been broadcast</i>

215
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,084
<i>that Kira would target
in the last couple days?</i>

216
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,920
<i>Did Kira kill anyone?</i>

217
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,967
Quite a few criminals have
been broadcast,

218
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,847
but since you've been detained,
none of them have been killed.

219
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,351
No one's been killed? Really?

220
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,810
<i>Yes.</i>

221
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:17,273
I see... Maybe I am Kira...

222
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,817
Oh man, I wanna eat an apple...

223
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,153
<i>What's going on?</i>

224
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,533
<i>I thought that the murders would continue
even with Light Yagami confined,</i>

225
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,994
<i>but in reality,
they've completely stopped...</i>

226
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,582
<i>It seemed like Light Yagami
wanted to be confined, but...</i>

227
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,711
<i>this would mean that
Light Yagami is Kira...</i>

228
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,424
<i>Now the question is whether
he was conscious of being Kira...</i>

229
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,052
<i>If he is Kira..</i>

230
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,304
<i>Does he think he can
get away with saying</i>

231
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,348
<i>That he wasn't conscious
of what he was doing?</i>

232
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,187
<i>It's not like Light Yagami...
No, it's not like Kira...</i>

233
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,150
FIFTH DAY OF CONFINEMENT

234
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,905
I can't take it, Light...
If I don't eat an apple soon...

235
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,449
Anyway, I just have to
get through it...

236
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,159
even if there's nothing to do...

237
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,623
Mister Stalker, your video won't sell
if I'm just sitting...

238
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,047
Mr. Yagami looks even worse
than Light or Amane..

239
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,301
Of course. It's been five days
since Light's been imprisoned.

240
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,431
During that time, not a single criminal
who's been broadcast has died.

241
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,766
In times like this,
I suppose it's harder

242
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,977
for the parents than
the suspects themselves...

243
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:40,356
Especially since now, it's almost
definite that Light is Kira.

244
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:42,984
Mr. Yagami.

245
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,902
What is it? Is it good news?!

246
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,028
Bad news?!

247
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,283
Uh, no... Try not to work
yourself up too much...

248
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,578
You won't accomplish anything
by mulling over things.

249
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,037
The outcome will remain the same.

250
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,291
Perhaps you should rest...

251
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,585
<i>somewhere more comfortable.</i>

252
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,794
Out of the question!

253
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,547
There's no place anywhere
that would be relaxing in this situation.

254
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,884
In the state I'm in now,
this is the best place for me.

255
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,470
<i>No matter what the result,</i>

256
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,097
<i>when I get out of here
I'll leave with my son!</i>

257
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,641
I understand...

258
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,729
SEVENTH DAY OF CONFINEMENT

259
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,158
<i>Light, it's only been one week,
but you're looking worn out...</i>

260
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993
Are you all right?

261
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,001
<i>I've come this far,
I think it's about time...</i>

262
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:52,637
Yeah... I know I probably look
pretty bad in here, but...

263
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,181
this pride, I'll just have to...

264
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,600
get rid of it...

265
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,824
Got it.

266
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,541
Later.

267
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,679
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

268
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,014
Ryuzaki...

269
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,477
<i>I know I agreed to be detained
and chose to do this...</i>

270
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:46,315
<i>But now I just clearly realized that
doing this is meaningless!</i>

271
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,026
<i>It's because I'm not Kira!</i>

272
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,736
Get me out of here quickly!

273
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,323
<i>I can't do that.</i>

274
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,659
<i>We promised that no matter
what you said,</i>

275
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,579
<i>I wouldn't let you out until we decided
on whether or not you were Kira.</i>

276
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,456
There was something wrong
with me then!

277
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,334
Do you really think that
Kira would be able

278
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,962
to operate without being
conscious of it?

279
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,757
I don't remember committing
Kira's crimes, so I'm not him!

280
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,802
I also don't believe that

281
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,430
Kira has been acting without
self-awareness all this time.

282
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,976
But if you are him
everything matches up.

283
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,647
As soon as you were detained,
murders by Kira stopped...

284
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,900
Listen Ryuzaki, hear me out...

285
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:34,322
I am not lying... I'm not Kira...

286
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,450
I can only think
that I've been framed!

287
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,745
<i>What's wrong... Light Yagami?</i>

288
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,663
<i>What you're saying doesn't
make sense...</i>

289
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,875
<i>But... for some reason it feels
like it's the truth...</i>

290
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,170
Hurry and get me out of here.
We're wasting time!

291
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,631
<i>No. / can '1' let you out'.</i>

292
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,009
Damn it... How did this happen?

293
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,304
What's going on?
This isn't like Light...

294
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,391
He's taking back what he said earlier.
It's not logical.

295
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,104
We can't release him now
that the murders have stopped...

296
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,815
Even I know that.

297
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,068
Well, whatever anyone says...

298
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,112
can't we just decide that
Light Yagami is Kira,

299
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,198
and that the case is solved?

300
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,870
FIFTEENTH DAY OF CONFINEMENT

301
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,459
Two weeks worth of criminals
were murdered all at once yesterday!

302
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,087
Yeah... Kira is back.

303
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,005
Did you tell the Chief?

304
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,715
No, not yet...

305
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,594
Chief, Kira has started killing again!

306
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,054
What?!

307
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:44,350
Kira was just taking a break.
He's started punishing criminals again!

308
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,394
Is that true, Matsuda?!

309
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,854
Then my son...

310
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,525
I shouldn't be happy that
the murders have occurred, but...

311
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,777
now, suspicion of my son will be...

312
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,029
No, knowing Ryuzaki...

313
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,739
He won't say he's completely
cleared just yet...

314
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,370
Well then...
He's in the grey.

315
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,122
Did you hear that, Chief?!

316
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,833
<i>Yeah, he was pretty much
guilty up to now...</i>

317
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,251
<i>Thank goodness...</i>

318
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,087
It's probably a grey that's
one shade closer to being clear.

319
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,380
Then I'll tell Light, too.

320
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,591
Matsuda! I mean, Mr. Matsuda,
please stop.

321
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,093
"M-Matsuda?"

322
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,470
Don't tell Light.

323
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,514
W- Why?

324
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,683
Light.

325
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,518
What is it, Ryuzaki?

326
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:32,356
It's already been over two weeks.
There haven't been any new killings.

327
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,068
Won't you just give up and
confess that you're Kira?

328
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,154
<i>Don't say stupid things
like that, Ryuzaki.</i>

329
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,572
You're wrong.

330
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,118
I can understand why you deduced from
the investigation that I'm Kira,

331
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,286
but it's a trap.

332
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:50,541
I'm not Kira! Zoom in or something
and look at my eyes!

333
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,586
Are these the eyes of
someone who's lying?

334
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,802
Amane... You're really sure that
you don't know who Kira is, do you?

335
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,973
<i>Huh? That again?
That's what I want to know!</i>

336
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,642
<i>Kira is a hero of justice who</i>

337
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,605
<i>punished the burglar who
killed my parents.</i>

338
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,155
<i>I don't understand what's going on...</i>

339
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:26,202
TO BE CONTINUED

340
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:31,624
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

341
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:37,004
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

342
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,591
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

343
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:46,013
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

344
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:52,436
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

345
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,024
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

346
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:02,696
<i>I can't hold back
the flooding impulses</i>

347
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,492
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

348
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:10,162
<i>To accomplish</i>

349
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:21,048
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

350
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:26,095
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

351
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:31,892
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

352
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,731
PREVIEW

353
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,488
If I die here,
we'll never uncover the truth!

354
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,991
Do you believe L over me?

355
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,659
Dad!
