PERFORMANCE

21
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,801
Hey, why are we having
more meetings?

22
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,720
I thought we're supposed to meet
every other week?

23
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,513
We have no choice...

24
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:41,351
Coil reported that Misa Amane
might know L.

25
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,440
According to this,
it means L questioned Amane...

26
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,525
So here's the problem...

27
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,988
He says he's "deduced that
Amane worships Kira. "

28
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,241
"Furthermore, Yoshida Productions is

29
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,661
"trying to promote Amane
as the face of Yotsuba. "

30
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,205
"| suggest that Yotsuba use Amane
for its commercials..

31
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,875
"to extract information about L."

32
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,005
I can't accept this idea...

33
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,675
Why not? I think it's a great plan.

34
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,303
No, what Ooi is trying to say is...

35
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,598
It's ultimately Coil's job
to reveal L's identity.

36
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,602
So it's illogical for him
to leave this to us, isn't it?

37
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,939
Yeah. We hired him
to reveal L's identity.

38
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,568
Shouldn't we ask Coil
about his stance?

39
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,695
That's true...

40
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:40,243
Mr. Kida. I thought we'd agreed
you wouldn't contact me directly.

41
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,828
Is it an emergency?

42
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,749
I understand.

43
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,294
If that's the case,
I have a good plan.

44
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,923
Even though the meeting's over,

45
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,050
I still have to punish criminals
when I get home.

46
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,511
It's tough being Kira...

47
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,806
But it's getting interesting...

48
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,768
There's no doubt that Misa Amane
is the Second Kira.

49
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,895
And L caught her at some point.

50
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,107
If he's letting her
move about freely...

51
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:15,112
It means that she's forfeited ownership
and lost all her memories.

52
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,073
I can't leave her alone.

53
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,369
I'm going to make
Misa Amane my wife.

54
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,753
Money, power, and a beautiful wife...

55
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,006
That's enough to make anyone jealous!

56
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,261
Once we're married...

57
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,596
I'll take out a lot of
life insurance on her...

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,435
<i>Impossible... he's disgusting.</i>

59
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,273
Rem, hide the notebook
in the usual place.

60
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,368
<i>Right now,
this is the only thing I can do...</i>

61
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,704
<i>for Misa's sake...</i>

62
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,543
All right! Let's take it from there.

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,839
Misa, you said that you came
to Tokyo to meet Kira.

64
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,382
- What?!
- Hey!

65
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,053
Misa, please stop overacting.
It looks cheesy.

66
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,056
What? But that's what's called
a realistic performance...

67
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,975
Just do it over...

68
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,561
Yes, yes, oh Great Director Ryuzaki...

69
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,314
If you don't take this seriously,
I'll kick you.

70
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,986
M- Misa-Misa...

71
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,613
You're so tense.

72
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,406
You can just call me "Misa," Mochi.

73
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,825
<i>I'm not suited for this.</i>

74
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,412
<i>But it's still part of
the mission to catch Kira...</i>

75
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,997
Misa-Misa!

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,749
What is it, Mochi?!

77
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,378
We're having an interview with Yotsuba
to see if they'll use you in their ads.

78
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,964
But it's also an infiltration.

79
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,467
I know, you don't have to tell me!

80
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,720
Of course,
don't blow your cover either, Mochi!

81
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,390
You're supposed to be my energetic
and enthusiastic manager!

82
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,101
Yes, I'll do my best! All right!

83
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,271
Sorry to keep you waiting.

84
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,148
Good morning!

85
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,110
I'm Misa-Misa's manager, Mochi,
also known as Kanichi Moji.

86
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,278
Mr. Ooi,
Mr. Shimura...

87
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,113
- nice to see you again.
- I'm very pleased to meet you.

88
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,865
Good luck, Misa-Misa!

89
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,535
<i>- You're really nailing it, Mochi!
- I'll start planning the party</i>

90
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,287
to celebrate when you
land this commercial!

91
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,960
<i>I'm not cut out for this... am I?</i>

92
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,300
Well... This is our first time meeting,
isn't it, Misa?

93
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,137
I'm John Wallace, the executive advisor
for the marketing department.

94
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,639
Pleased to meet you.

95
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,141
Pleased to meet you, too.

96
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,145
This is a bit sudden,
but I'll tell you honestly.

97
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,275
We're pretty much certain
we're going to hire you.

98
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,987
But before we do, there's just
one thing we have to clarify.

99
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,405
Yes?

100
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,866
We did a little background
check on you...

101
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,827
A burglar killed your parents.

102
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,997
You worship the criminal Kira because he
killed the man who murdered your family.

103
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:16,376
You said that you came to Tokyo
to meet Kira.

104
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,755
Wh-Who did you hear that from?

105
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,632
We can't tell you our source.

106
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,052
But this is reliable information.

107
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,222
We can see it written
all over your face.

108
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,852
<i>Coil, I never thought
you investigated that far...</i>

109
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,604
Also...

110
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,607
You're still hiding something,
aren't you?

111
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,693
Something that you
don't want anyone to know...

112
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,118
<i>I've got to sweat a lot
and pause here...</i>

113
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,580
Misa Amane was detained by L...

114
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,334
Please tell us about
what really happened.

115
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,546
It would be a problem
if the face of Yotsuba was Kira.

116
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,382
Yes. Please tell us truthfully.

117
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,263
A- All right.
I'll tell you everything...

118
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,767
I was indeed detained...

119
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:19,105
I don't think it was L,
but he did ask me about Kira...

120
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,900
But I'm not the Second Kira.

121
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,488
I'm here because he found out
I have nothing to do with Kira.

122
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,033
Did you see
who was detaining you?

123
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,243
I was blindfolded...

124
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,580
But, you heard his voice,
didn't you?

125
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,375
Only through a speaker, so...

126
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,793
Hey...

127
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,546
This is more like an interrogation
rather than an interview.

128
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,215
How long do you plan
on doing this?

129
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,175
I'm going to the restroom.

130
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,096
Indeed, it seems the interview
has veered off track...

131
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,185
Excuse me...
May I also go to the restroom?

132
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,439
<i>This is so stressful!</i>

133
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,443
But it's going well.
I've got to try hard...

134
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:18,331
<i>Touching her With a piece of the Death Note
Won't return her memories. -.</i>

135
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:22,502
<i>But at least now,
Misa can see me again...</i>

136
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,548
<i>W- What is this?! A monster?</i>

137
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:33,555
Misa, you're in a dangerous situation.
The people from Yotsuba may kill you.

138
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,932
I came to tell you that.

139
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,976
Calm down and listen to me.

140
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,894
<i>Calm down?</i>

141
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,731
<i>This monster looks like
it's going to kill me!</i>

142
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,650
I am your ally.

143
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,237
<i>My... ally?</i>

144
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,532
I wonder if Misa-Misa is all right...

145
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,202
We should have at least wired her!

146
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,205
<i>It's just as I thought...
They're deﬁnitely different people...</i>

147
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:04,669
<i>The Kira before and after
I was detained... are clearly different.</i>

148
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,546
<i>The current Kira is
killing off every criminal...</i>

149
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,757
<i>as soon as they've had
their crime broadcast,</i>

150
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,675
<i>regardless of the situation...</i>

151
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,095
<i>The previous Kira
would never punish...</i>

152
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,098
<i>those who didn't have
any intention to kill,</i>

153
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,978
<i>those who killed by accident, or those
with extenuating circumstances...</i>

154
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,357
<i>If I were Kira,
that's what I would do...</i>

155
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,611
<i>The previous Kira's
criteria for killing...</i>

156
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,155
<i>are disturbingly close
to my own ideals...</i>

157
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,786
<i>What am I thinking?</i>

158
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,497
<i>I'm not Kira.</i>

159
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,250
<i>I must be crazy to be
comparing myself to Kira...</i>

160
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,045
Light Yagami is Kira.

161
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,174
What is Light doing now?

162
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,726
What are you?

163
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,856
I know you're not a stalker,
but you don't look human at all...

164
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,860
Of course. I'm a Shinigami.

165
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,782
Misa, we once worked together.

166
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,576
I don't know what
you're talking about...

167
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,746
You met me? Light is Kira?

168
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,415
The Death Note...

169
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:32,549
If you write a person's name in it,
that person dies...

170
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,051
With that notebook,

171
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,431
Light Yagami punished criminals
and became known as Kira.

172
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:49,566
And you had the same... no,
greater power than Kira.

173
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:55,947
With that power you succeeded in
getting close to Light Yagami.

174
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,201
Light is Kira...
and I'm the Second Kira?

175
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,830
That's right...
No, more correctly, you were.

176
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:09,210
This should all be going
according to Light's plan.

177
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,714
<i>So Ryuzaki's right!</i>

178
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,969
Misa... Do you still love Light
more than anything?

179
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,475
Shinigami, you really are
the real thing.

180
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,020
You know everything about me.

181
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,480
I'll believe everything you say...

182
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,860
Yes... I love him... more than anything.

183
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:41,326
Besides, it's really awesome
that Light and I were both Kira.

184
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,785
I believe you!

185
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,830
You haven't changed at all, Misa...

186
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,084
Those feelings towards Light will
probably never change, will they?

187
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:57,342
I now believe that you'll find
happiness by staying with Light.

188
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,677
Thank you, Shinigami.

189
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,179
It's Rem.

190
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,349
The current Kira is a crooked
and pathetic human.

191
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,353
You don't know what he'll do.
Be careful.

192
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,688
Be careful of
the other Yotsuba men, as well.

193
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,234
<i>Trust Light and let him do
whatever he feels necessary.</i>

194
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,030
<i>All right, I just have to
act normal, right?</i>

195
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,365
<i>That's right.</i>

196
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,076
<i>When you go back to the interview,</i>

197
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:28,289
<i>you should be able to tell who's Kira.
Do not trust him...</i>

198
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,210
Sorry I took so long in the restroom.

199
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,754
I fixed up my makeup.

200
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:42,553
<i>All right, when you return, the man
who's sitting in front of me is Kira.</i>

201
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:43,930
<i>Rem...</i>

202
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,516
<i>The person in front of Rem is Kira...</i>

203
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,986
<i>Higuchi is Kira.</i>

204
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,862
<i>That's horrible...</i>

205
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,126
Misa-Misa sure is late...

206
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,380
They're back!

207
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,548
Hey!

208
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,218
I am so tired.

209
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,636
Hey...

210
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,762
How was it?

211
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:29,017
Yotsuba has hired Misa
to appear in their ads.

212
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,894
I see. That's great.

213
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,731
Once I told them
my cell phone number,

214
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:39,360
I got asked out
by three of the seven already.

215
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,611
What?

216
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,740
I just have to accept
and investigate them, right?

217
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,325
It's going exactly as planned.

218
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,452
No, the plan has been cancelled.

219
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,414
Why? It's been going so well...

220
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,875
You'll be in danger if we do this.

221
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,961
I won't stop you from appearing
in any of their commercials,

222
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,048
but from now on, deny that you were
suspected of being the Second Kira

223
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,008
and that you were
detained by L.

224
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,761
Mogi will be your bodyguard...

225
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,846
and you will just be
an entertainer.

226
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,478
If that's what you say,
then that's what I'll do...

227
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,067
Well, I'm tired and tomorrow's shoot
is early in the morning,

228
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,234
so I'm going to bed.

229
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,782
<i>Thank you for worrying
about me, Light...</i>

230
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,743
<i>But I've come up with a good plan!</i>

231
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,829
<i>I'm gonna be of use to you!</i>

232
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,085
Light, want to come to bed
with me?

233
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,796
What are you talking about, Misa?

234
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,549
I understand... That's for after
we catch Kira, isn't it?

235
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,802
You don't have to be so shy, Light.

236
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,055
You don't have to be so shy, Light.

237
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,598
I'm not being shy.

238
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,101
Why are you answering
so seriously, Light?

239
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,728
Cut!

240
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,855
That's good!

241
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,357
Great job, everyone.

242
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,109
Great job, everyone.

243
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,985
Great job, Misa-Misa!

244
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,947
I can use the restroom
in this hospital, right?

245
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,240
Yes!

246
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,202
Wait for me a moment.

247
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,791
All right!

248
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,585
Great job today, Senpai!

249
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,172
Wow! Nori, you look good
in that nurse outfit!

250
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,799
You think so?

251
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,890
TO-OH WOMEN'S MEDICAL CENTER

252
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,900
Just as I expected, an amazing car.

253
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,235
If you like it,

254
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,904
I'll let you ride it any time...
or, I'll buy you one.

255
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,074
By the way, that nurse's outfit
is pretty nice, Misa.

256
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,951
You like it?

257
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,496
You sure took long.

258
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,797
Where's Misa?!

259
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:05,923
She's on a date.

260
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,133
Damn it!

261
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,272
<i>Kyosuke Higuchi...</i>

262
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,233
<i>- He is the annoy/rig pervert. - -
- Misa, you're really my type.</i>

263
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,735
<i>who's been constantly sending texts...</i>

264
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,695
<i>- ever since that party.
- Hey Higuchi! Quit hogging her!</i>

265
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,867
<i>It's horrible that this guy is Kira...</i>

266
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,829
Misa, shall we get something to eat?

267
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,375
Don't take me anywhere weird, okay?

268
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,920
Well, even if you try something...

269
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,672
It's all right because
I can kill people.

270
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,636
<i>What are you thinking, Misa?</i>

271
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,223
<i>Is this what Light Yagami
wants you to do?</i>

272
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,934
<i>No, is Misa just saying</i>

273
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,312
<i>that she wants me to kill Higuchi,
if something happens?</i>

274
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,400
That's a funny thing to say, Misa.
You can kill people?

275
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,612
It's true. Because I'm...

276
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,822
the Second Kira.

277
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,951
<i>It can't be...</i>

278
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,747
<i>Even if this girl was the Second Kira
in the past, she can't be right now.</i>

279
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,707
<i>She shouldn't have
any memory of it...</i>

280
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,292
<i>What's going on?</i>

281
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,296
Misa, it's all right,

282
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,465
you don't have to lie like that
to protect yourself.

283
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,551
I'm actually quite the gentleman.

284
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,638
Well, I don't really feel like
proving I'm the Second Kira

285
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,098
to anyone other than Kira...

286
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,351
You'll only show Kira?
What do you mean?

287
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:47,233
It's my dream to become Kira's bride.
I know Kira needs me by his side.

288
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,946
<i>If she's the Second Kira, then it's
clear from the Sakura TV incident</i>

289
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,699
<i>that she has the Shinigami eyes...</i>

290
00:17:55,032 --> 00:18:00,246
<i>If it's true,
I have to have her by my side...</i>

291
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,999
<i>I'll test her...</i>

292
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:10,172
Well, I'm Kira, so...
Marry me, Misa!

293
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,930
Really?!

294
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,765
Y- Yeah...!

295
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,475
Really.

296
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,271
What? Then prove it!
Let's show each other proof!

297
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:30,318
That's impossible.
It would be risky to show how I kill.

298
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,736
You think?

299
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,324
I would show someone
if they might be Kira.

300
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,159
Nothing would happen
if I didn't.

301
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,120
Then kill someone.

302
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,414
I may be Kira.

303
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,417
Fine. But I only kill bad people.

304
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,545
That's right. A bad person, huh?

305
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,216
Ginzo Kaneboshi...

306
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,302
He's the president of a major
consumer financing company.

307
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,846
He's a crook who's famous
for his cruel collection methods.

308
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,974
Sometimes, he makes people
pay with their insurance money.

309
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,476
How about him?

310
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,936
Can you immediately check
if he died?

311
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,688
I can tell if I make a phone call.

312
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,316
Then turn around for a moment.

313
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,780
<i>Misa...</i>

314
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,616
<i>I have to kill
Ginzo Kaneboshi, don't I?</i>

315
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,827
<i>Then Higuchi will trust you...</i>

316
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,663
<i>Fine.</i>

317
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,374
GINZO KANEBOSHI

318
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,709
All right. He should be dead now.

319
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,047
This is Higuchi from Yotsuba.

320
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,384
<i>Sorry! Our president collapsed and
isn't breathing... Call back later!</i>

321
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,059
See?

322
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,689
<i>She killed a person
that I chose, fight' here- -.</i>

323
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,401
<i>That would have been impossible
unless she had the powers!</i>

324
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,736
<i>It's decided!</i>

325
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,954
So if I'm Kira,
you'll marry me, right?!

326
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,916
W- Why are you getting
so serious all of a sudden?

327
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,918
Because I'm Kira.

328
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,545
Then prove it.

329
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,507
I can't kill until I go home.

330
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,883
You understand, right?

331
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,636
Well, that's no good then...

332
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,765
It might be a plan to
lure me into your house.

333
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,685
Oh, I know.

334
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,605
Then stop killing criminals.

335
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,024
If you're Kira,
I'm sure you can do it.

336
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:39,655
Then begin killing when I tell you to.
Then I'll believe you.

337
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:44,034
Killing criminals... is something
that only Kira could do.

338
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,246
I see. That's a good idea.

339
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:49,999
All right.

340
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,711
<i>I'm Kira, so in order
to get you to trust me,</i>

341
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,046
<i>I'm going to stop killing criminals
starting from now.</i>

342
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,800
<i>And when you know I'm Kira,
we'll get married!</i>

343
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,929
And so...

344
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,348
Higuchi is Kira.

345
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,019
Now we know Kira's identity

346
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,938
and the killings that have been
bothering the Chief, will stop!

347
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,523
You're amazing, Misa-Misa!

348
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:26,285

PREVIEW

364
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,526
It's been three days
since I stopped killing criminals.

365
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,735
That should be good enough.

366
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,572
Now, if I marry Misa Amane,
the Second Kira,

367
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:50,202
I'll have the Shinigami eyes.
And I'll control everything Yotsuba has!
