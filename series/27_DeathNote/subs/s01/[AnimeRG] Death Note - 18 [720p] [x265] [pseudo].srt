1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,506
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,217
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:18,519
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,285
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,706
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:48,382
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,599
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:02,521
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,321
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:17,286
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,964
ALLY

17
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,879
Oh yeah! I gotta take off the belt.

18
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,303
<i>What? Again?</i>

19
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,516
He'll just have to get used
to our security system.

20
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,352
<i>Enough!</i>

21
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,146
How's this?!

22
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,483
Good morning!

23
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,238
What happened to your forehead?

24
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,823
Oh... this?

25
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,035
Well, I had a fight with
my wife and...

26
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,998
my kid is still young...
so it looks like I'll be commuting.

27
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,418
Yeah. You should live at home.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,504
What a waste...

29
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,756
These rooms are amazing.

30
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,883
You should move here
with your whole family.

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,303
Don't lump me in with
a carefree bachelor like you.

32
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,389
Where's Ryuzaki?

33
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,476
He's on a date, the three of them
are in Misa-Misa's room.

34
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,562
Surveillance cameras, huh?

35
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,898
Well, I guess it can't be helped

36
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,984
since we believe that Amane
might be involved with second Kira...

37
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,363
And Matsuda,
stop calling her Misa-Misa!

38
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,823
Oh... yes.

39
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,367
Hey... this...

40
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,661
doesn't feel like a date.

41
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,664
Pay no attention to me...

42
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,166
Anyways, are you going to
eat that piece of cake?

43
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,669
Sweets are fattening,
so I try not to eat them too much.

44
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,462
If you use your head,

45
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,006
you can still eat sweets
without gaining weight.

46
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,217
Hey! You're making fun
of me again!

47
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,177
I'll give you the cake.

48
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,513
So will you leave me
alone with Light?

49
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,640
Even if I leave you two alone,

50
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,559
I'll be watching with
the surveillance cameras.

51
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,727
It's the same thing.

52
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,021
You pervert!
Will you stop doing sick things?

53
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,316
Call me whatever you like.
But I'm taking your cake.

54
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,903
Fine! I'll just close the curtains
and turn off the lights.

55
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,364
We also have infrared cameras.

56
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,867
Changing the subject...

57
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,661
Despite moving into fully
equipped headquarters,

58
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,539
you don't seem
very enthusiastic, Ryuzaki.

59
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,041
Enthusiasm, huh?

60
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,504
I don't have any
Actually, I'm kind of depressed.

61
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,047
You're depressed?

62
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,716
Yes...

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,096
All this time I thought
that you were Kira...

64
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,892
I'm just shocked that
my deduction was wrong.

65
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:33,231
But, I'm still suspicious of you,
hence these.

66
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,402
Kira can control people's actions...

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,571
In other words,

68
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,074
Kira was controlling you to
make me suspect that you were Kira.

69
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,412
<i>You and Misa were both
controlled by Kira.</i>

70
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,666
<i>When I think about that,
everything matches up...</i>

71
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,712
By that reasoning,
Misa and I were controlled,

72
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,131
but doesn't that still mean
that we're Kira?

73
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,593
Yes, I don't think
I'm wrong about that.

74
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,720
You're both Kira.

75
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,769
I think that when you were confined,
you were Kira.

76
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,607
And while you were confined,
criminals stopped dying.

77
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,778
You were Kira until then,
so it works out.

78
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,864
But after two weeks,

79
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,449
criminals began dying again.

80
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,537
Based on that evidence,

81
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,957
I think Kira's power can pass
from person to person.

82
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,210
That's an interesting idea.

83
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,880
But if that's true,
it won't be easy to catch Kira.

84
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,633
Yes. That's why I'm at a loss.

85
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,594
Even if we catch those
under Kira's control,

86
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,971
Kira's powers will be
passed on to others

87
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,639
and the former will have no memory
of their actions.

88
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,475
Which means that it's useless
to catch anyone...

89
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,397
But that's not definite yet.
So show some energy!

90
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,315
"Energy?"

91
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,987
I'm not feeling it. Why bother?

92
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:07,450
Trying hard to go after him
just puts us in danger.

93
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,120
Don't you think so?

94
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,582
Ryuzaki...

95
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,466
Nooo!

96
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,057
That hurt.

97
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,559
Stop messing around.

98
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,937
You don't feel like doing anything
just because I wasn't Kira...

99
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,522
and because
your deduction was wrong?

100
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,318
I may have phrased it wrong.

101
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,946
I meant it would be a waste for us
to make a move, so we shouldn't...

102
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,741
There's no way we can catch him
if we don't chase him!

103
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,701
Do you know how many
innocent people

104
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,703
you've involved in this case?!

105
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,123
Besides that, you're the one
who confined Misa and me!

106
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,250
I know...

107
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,463
But whatever the reason...

108
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,052
An eye for an eye.

109
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,818
It's not that my deduction
was wrong.

110
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,695
The fact is, the case isn't
going to be solved simply as

111
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,574
"Light Yagami is Kira" and
"Misa Amane is the Second Kira. "

112
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,826
So I'm a little disappointed.

113
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,746
I'm human. That isn't allowed?

114
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,414
No, it's not.

115
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,416
The way you talk...

116
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,795
it's almost like you won't
be satisfied unless I'm Kira...

117
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,340
"| won't be satisfied
unless you're Kira?"

118
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,093
That may be true...

119
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,179
I just realized...

120
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,683
I wanted you to be Kira.

121
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,314
An eye... for an eye.

122
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,110
I'll have you know
I'm quite strong.

123
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,156
Let's call the room and stop them!

124
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,120
<i>- Yes?
- Please listen, Ryuzaki,</i>

125
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,038
Misa-Misa is number one

126
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,374
in Eighteen Magazine's
reader popularity poll!

127
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,209
<i>Yes, I see...</i>

128
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,044
<i>That means that it's been
decided that</i>

129
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,630
<i>she'll be starring as the heroine in
the next ﬁIm by the director, Nishinaka!</i>

130
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,049
What's going on?

131
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,968
Matsuda's being an idiot again.

132
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,138
<i>Well, Matsuda is a natural at that.</i>

133
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,724
I can hear you...

134
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,187
TWO MONTHS LATER

135
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,234
Ryuzaki...

136
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,611
Ryuzaki, I know you're not into this
but come over here for a second.

137
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,780
Take a good look at this.

138
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,991
Isn't it unbalanced?

139
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,664
All three of them were prominent
Japanese businessmen.

140
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,083
They all died of heart attacks.

141
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,336
As a result,
Yotsuba's stock prices rose

142
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,047
but the other companies'
have plummeted.

143
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,967
In other words, they are deaths
that are in Yotsuba's favor...

144
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,261
Checking back,

145
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,680
there've been as many as thirteen
such cases in the past three months.

146
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,766
What do you think?

147
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,269
I can only conclude that
Kira is supporting Yotsuba.

148
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,856
Yes... But if that's true,

149
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,276
then punishing criminals
is not this Kira's true intent.

150
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,113
Yeah. He's punishing criminals
as a front and

151
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,034
killing people for
the benefit of this company.

152
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,287
What do you think?

153
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,580
Do you feel a little
more enthusiastic now?

154
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:56,596
It's amusing how well this has gone,
without arousing any suspicion...

155
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,184
Yotsuba's benefits and stock prices have
been increasing slowly, but steadily.

156
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,563
Yeah. It's all proceeding
according to our calculations.

157
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,943
I'm just worried about one thing.

158
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,655
Why did the three people
we decided to kill last week

159
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,281
die of heart attacks?

160
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,534
I thought we decided that one of them
was going to die from an accident?

161
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,078
That was probably because

162
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,081
we chose the accident to
occur on the Coastal Bay Route.

163
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,875
At the appointed time,
he wasn't at his home,

164
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,670
but had snuck off to Italy
with a woman.

165
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,841
In other words,
if the request is impossible...

166
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,636
Kira kills the person by heart attack.

167
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,013
It's like I told you last week.

168
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,724
If you request only accidental deaths
and death by disease,

169
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,228
they're finished in a natural way
in the shortest amount of time.

170
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,731
Anyway, the police should be
too busy

171
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,109
investigating the deaths of criminals.

172
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,738
If someone could trace the deaths
of those others back to us,

173
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,490
he would be a god.

174
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,451
Besides, we've already
taken precautions.

175
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,167
Chief! Oh, you too, Mogi!
Thanks for all your hard work today!

176
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,668
It's amazing!

177
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,253
With Light's help,

178
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,591
the theory that Kira is involved with
the Yotsuba Group has become stronger.

179
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,134
Yotsuba?

180
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,261
Yes...

181
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,513
That's probably the case, Matsuda.

182
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:27,061
We just heard from the Director that
Kira's offered bribes to politicians.

183
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,773
Kira said...

184
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,194
As long as the police
don't chase him...

185
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,529
he won't lay a hand
on any politicians.

186
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,201
The police caved in to Kira.

187
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,955
Mogi has already made up
his mind, but...

188
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,875
Aizawa, Matsuda...

189
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,044
if you really still
want to pursue Kira, then...

190
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:55,882
turn in your letters of resignation
to the NPA along with Mogi and me.

191
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:01,471
We can't seriously pursue Kira anymore
unless you quit the NPA.

192
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,223
What do you mean?!

193
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,141
It's simple.

194
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,979
We were told that we would be
fired if we were to pursue Kira with L.

195
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,065
So then, Chief, you really...

196
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,568
In a few hours,
I'm no longer going to be your chief.

197
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,072
But you all have your own lives.

198
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,241
Please think hard before
you make your decision.

199
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:26,037
That's right. Especially those who are
married and have children.

200
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,292
I think you all should
remain police officers.

201
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,629
I was alone to begin with...

202
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,424
and I'm grateful to all of you
for sticking with me this far.

203
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,552
But I can do this by myself.

204
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,764
I'll be sure to visit you all
at the police department

205
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,017
and bring you Kira's head as a gift.

206
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,397
Ryuzaki! As long as I'm here,
you won't be alone.

207
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,399
You have my promise!

208
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,526
That's right.

209
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,863
I'll have Light working
with me until I catch Kira.

210
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,285
But everyone else should
go back to being police officers...

211
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:10,081
But you told us that you needed
the help of the police in this case.

212
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,709
That's because the police
as an organization,

213
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,128
didn't bow to Kira and
hoped to arrest him.

214
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:19,590
I don't really think the help
of two or three civilians

215
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,968
who quit the police force can
really count as the police.

216
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,179
Also, the police have decided

217
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,974
that they don't want to
catch Kira, so that's enough.

218
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:35,231
It's true we wouldn't be of
much help not being police officers.

219
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,651
But what about our feelings?

220
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,987
We've risked our lives to catch Kira.

221
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,739
We at least have the right to decide

222
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,576
whether we stay here or
go back to the NPA!

223
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,286
I suppose you're right...

224
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,080
Then decide which you want to do.

225
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,374
But Chief,

226
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,336
if you quit the police force,
you'll be unemployed.

227
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:01,007
Even if we catch Kira,
what are you going to do afterwards?

228
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,301
Afterwards, huh?

229
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,680
I haven't thought about it,
but after we catch Kira...

230
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,517
I guess I'll be
looking for another job.

231
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,228
I've decided!

232
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,731
I'm going to quit the police force
and pursue Kira!

233
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,609
I still have to do my job
as Misa-Misa's manager!

234
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,779
Besides, if I went back to the NPA,
I'd feel like a loser...

235
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,073
Watch what you say, Matsuda.

236
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,044
How about if I stayed a police officer
and helped you in my spare time?

237
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,921
That's no good.

238
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,924
If you return to the NPA,
please don't come back here.

239
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,968
I won't leak information...

240
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,388
I won't give you any information.

241
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,643
As detectives,
you are free to pursue Kira.

242
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,398
But I don't think it's right
to give up your livelihoods

243
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,235
and harm your families
just to pursue Kira.

244
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,779
It's as Ryuzaki says.

245
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,407
No one will blame you if you quit.

246
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,743
That's right.
No one will think of you as a traitor!

247
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,413
But Chief, you have a family, too...

248
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,791
Our situations are different.

249
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,002
That's not fair.

250
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,338
I want to stay here, too.

251
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,592
I was prepared to die
at any moment.

252
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,139
And if I quit here,
how will I be able to face Ukita...

253
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,852
Damn it! Why can't a detective with
the NPA remain and pursue Kira?!

254
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,646
<i>Ryuzaki.</i>

255
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,651
<i>In case anything happened
to a member of the task force,</i>

256
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,737
<i>even if they were ﬁred from the NPA,
you entrusted me to make preparations</i>

257
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,699
<i>so that ﬁnancial support would
be offered to their families,</i>

258
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,744
<i>so that they would never be in need
for the rest of their lives.</i>

259
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,998
Why aren't you mentioning that?

260
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,209
Who asked you, Watari?

261
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,003
<i>Pardon me.</i>

262
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,132
Oh, so we've already been
taken care of financially?

263
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,676
Isn't that wonderful, Aizawa?

264
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:19,395
Ryuzaki... Were you watching to see if
I would quit the force to join you?

265
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,647
It's not like that, Aizawa.

266
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,359
Ryuzaki just doesn't like to
say things like that himself.

267
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,944
That's right.

268
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,196
No.

269
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,240
I was testing you.

270
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,868
I was watching to see
which you would choose.

271
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,120
Ryuzaki...

272
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,045
All right! I'll quit and
return to the NPA!

273
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,254
Aizawa!

274
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,634
I couldn't make a decision quickly
like you all and

275
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,345
I was leaning towards staying
a police officer.

276
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,472
Don't be so stubborn.

277
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,973
No! I quit!

278
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,184
This just made things clear for me!

279
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,520
I hate Ryuzaki!

280
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,813
I hate the way Ryuzaki
does everything!

281
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,444
But I like people
like you Mr. Aizawa.

282
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,534
I also can't stand

283
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,702
how he can say things like this
so shamelessly!

284
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,120
I quit!

285
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,248
Thank you very much for
your hard work.

286
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,387
I found another.

287
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,932
The branch manager of
Yotsuba's biggest rival bank,

288
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,894
died on September 7th when
he slipped on the steps of his home.

289
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,439
September 7th
was a Friday...

290
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,943
I checked once more and discovered
that the deaths

291
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,197
that are beneficial to Yotsuba
are concentrated around the weekend.

292
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,907
What? Really?!

293
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,995
At first, the times of death
were random...

294
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,414
but gradually,
they became concentrated

295
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,165
around Friday nights through
Saturday afternoons.

296
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,668
It's amazing you noticed that, Chief!

297
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,337
I told you,
I'm no longer the Chief.

298
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,465
No, you'll always be
the Chief to me!

299
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,093
This should be some sort of hint, Dad.

300
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,180
I haven't lost to you and Ryuzaki yet.

301
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,683
I don't want to be
dead weight here.

302
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,893
"Dead weight...?"

303
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,271
Is Kira someone from Yotsuba?

304
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,815
Or is Kira using Yotsuba?

305
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,775
I haven't figured that out yet,

306
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,612
but let's investigate this with
the assumption that this is Kira's doing.

307
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,406
Let's thoroughly investigate Yotsuba!

308
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,328
I've compiled a list of all domestic
employees in the Yotsuba Group.

309
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,246
Thank you very much.

310
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,290
Over 300,000, huh?

311
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,584
I'm impressed you compiled
the list so quickly...

312
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,002
That's amazing, Mr. Mogi.

313
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,005
Mr. Mogi's been amazing
since the very beginning.

314
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,882
Ryuzaki!

315
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,011
Is there anything I can do
besides being a manager?

316
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,847
You want to be useful?

317
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,349
Yes!

318
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,225
Then could you get me
another cup of coffee?

319
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,852
What?

320
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,313
And also for our guests over there.

321
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,401
Who are they?
When did they get in...?

322
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,489
They are our new members.

323
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,995
I'm Aiber. A con-man.
Pleased to meet you.

324
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,165
Wedy. I'm a thief by trade.

325
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,959
A con-man and a thief?

326
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,503
Yes.

327
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,923
Aiber has excellent social skills.

328
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,426
He's a con-man who can
cozy up to our target.

329
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,387
We'll use him for
infiltrative investigations.

330
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,850
Wedy is a thief who can crack
any lock, safe, or security system.

331
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,647
As proof, she entered without
any of us noticing.

332
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,900
We're going to be working together
with criminals?

333
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,402
They're criminals,

334
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,905
but not the type who
will surface and be killed by Kira.

335
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,866
Think of them as pros of
the underworld.

336
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,910
I see.

337
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,122
If we want to investigate Yotsuba,
we need people like them.

338
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,583
Let's all work together
and give it our all!

339
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,044
- Yes!
- Uh, yes.

340
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,643
Oh! It's Papa.

341
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,895
Papa!

342
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,273
Yumi...

343
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,607
Eriko...

344
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,026
What are you doing here?

345
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,029
At least tell me
if you're coming home.

346
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,741
I didn't buy enough
for your dinner.

347
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,493
I'll give you half of my croquette!

348
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,663
Sorry. I haven't had a break
for quite a while now,

349
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,123
so I got some time off.

350
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,168
Huh? Is a "time off" a vacation?

351
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,836
Yeah. That's what it is.

352
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,337
All right!

353
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,591
From now on,
I'm off every week.

354
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,094
So I can take you to the park...

355
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,473
or the zoo...

356
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,350
or even the amusement park...

357
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,564
What's wrong?

358
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,361
Mama, Papa's crying...

359
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:26,202
TO BE CONTINUED

360
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:31,624
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

361
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:37,046
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

362
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,591
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

363
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:46,055
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

364
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:52,436
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

365
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,024
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

366
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:02,696
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

367
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:06,492
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

368
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:10,162
<i>To accomplish</i>

369
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:21,048
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

370
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:26,095
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

371
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:31,934
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

372
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,065
PREVIEW

373
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,859
A secret meeting?

374
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,445
It sounds like they have one
every Friday night.

375
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,364
All right!

376
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,325
I'm on a roll today!
