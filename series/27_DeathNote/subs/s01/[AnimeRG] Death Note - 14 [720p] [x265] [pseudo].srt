<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,675
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,805
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,977
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,786
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:40,165
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:48,799
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,052
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,058
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,938
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:08,318
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,697
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,744
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,340
FRIEND

17
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,598
I understand...

18
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,018
I can't be your boyfriend,
but I can play the part...

19
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,648
Thank you...
I'll work hard to make you love me.

20
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,404
<i>I'll have her meet L to ﬁnd out
his name</i>

21
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,865
<i>and eliminate
the entire task force HQ</i>

22
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,451
<i>I'll kill her afterwards...</i>

23
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,411
<i>That's right.</i>

24
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,248
<i>She's the only person who knows
Kira's identity.</i>

25
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,209
<i>I can't let her live for long.</i>

26
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,629
So you'll just act
like my boyfriend, huh?

27
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,047
That's a good start.

28
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,551
So then, could you show me
your Shinigami?

29
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,721
<i>I suppose it's necessary
to make her trust me...</i>

30
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,723
Yeah. All right.

31
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,850
Could you turn around?

32
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,934
Okay.

33
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,360
You can turn around now.

34
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,694
Okay.

35
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,572
Hi!

36
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,282
Ooh...

37
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,661
He's a completely different type
of Shinigami from Rem, isn't he?

38
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,788
I already know your name. Ryuk.

39
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,081
Pleased to meet you!

40
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,415
Yeah, pleased to meet you.

41
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,753
Oh yeah, Light, do you know
how to kill a Shinigami?

42
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,714
You're already calling me
by my first name?

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,093
Then could I call you "Knight" instead?

44
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,762
Because you're like Misa's knight
in shining armor!

45
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,347
Light is fine.

46
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,893
Are you planning to check all
the videos of Aoyama

47
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,728
on the 22nd by yourself?

48
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,313
Yes.

49
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,648
It is very likely that Kira
and the Second Kira

50
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,359
made contact with each other there
on that day.

51
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,736
I want to check them all.

52
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,905
Also, Mr. Yagami...

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,198
Yes?

54
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,119
I would like Mr. Mogi to keep
watch over Light's activities.

55
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,954
"Light's activities?"

56
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:29,209
In the event that Light is Kira,
the Second Kira might try to contact him...

57
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,669
...in some way.

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,921
I understand.

59
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,967
So when does Ryuzaki sleep?

60
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,637
I saw him sleeping in that
exact same position the other day.

61
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,849
No, I'm serious...

62
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,187
So when a Shinigami has feelings
for a certain person...

63
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,483
and kills someone in order to
extend that person's life,

64
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,193
the Shinigami dies, huh?

65
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,695
Yes.

66
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,950
I can't imagine there's
a Shinigami who would do that.

67
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,371
That's right. It doesn't seem like
the kind of thing that you would do.

68
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,791
By the way, from where have you
been sending your tapes

69
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,126
to the television stations?

70
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,380
Umm... The first time was Osaka.
Then it was Tokyo.

71
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,257
This other time was from Nagano.

72
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,219
I used the Bullet Train so
my location couldn't be pinpointed.

73
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,805
So you still have videotapes
and envelopes

74
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,767
with your friend's fingerprints
on them, right?

75
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,893
Yeah.

76
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,646
Then you should dispose of
everything used to create the videos...

77
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:37,694
But only after sending one last video
from another location tomorrow...

78
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,488
You should say...

79
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,074
"| will stop trying to meet Kira. "

80
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,536
"I'd like to thank the police
for their advice. "

81
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,041
"But I'm going to help Kira
erase evil from the world. "

82
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,586
"I'm going to cooperate with him
and gain his acceptance. "

83
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:00,717
"| will begin by punishing criminals
that Kira hasn't punished yet. Also..

84
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,137
"| plan to make this world
a better place"

85
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,683
"by sharing this power
among those who are worthy. "

86
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,685
"Share the power?"

87
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,480
It's a line to throw off
the investigation.

88
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,566
There are already two people
with this power.

89
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,069
It's not too far of a stretch
that there may be more.

90
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,738
And if they believe that they'll multiply,
it will create panic.

91
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,281
Can you do it?

92
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,076
You don't have to ask.
Just tell me to do it.

93
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,787
I'll do whatever you say.

94
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
Also, one more important thing.

95
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,415
Okay!

96
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,793
If you're caught by the police...

97
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,254
if you're arrested as a suspect,

98
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,257
don't say anything about us
or the notebook.

99
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,716
There's no proof against you

100
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,135
as long as they don't get
a hold of the notebook and verify it.

101
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,847
Can you promise to do that?

102
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,431
I promise!

103
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,977
So then, we're officially boyfriend
and girlfriend, right?

104
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,020
Well, I guess so.

105
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,231
Now for my conditions.

106
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,942
Go on a date with me
at least once a week.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,529
<i>She really doesn't get it...</i>

108
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,905
That's impossible.

109
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,532
W- Why?

110
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,451
It doesn't seem like
you'll understand unless I tell you.

111
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,746
L already suspects that I'm Kira.

112
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,542
What? L's pretty amazing...

113
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,043
Everyone's saying that

114
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,422
he doesn't understand or...
that he's stupid.

115
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,591
So he's actually figured out
that much...

116
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:27,679
But thanks to that,
I've also been able to get close to L.

117
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,057
Huh? L and Kira are
in contact with each other?

118
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,770
You're both amazing.
It's making me kind of excited.

119
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,939
Even if I'm Kira,

120
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,609
L thinks he's safe as long as
he hides his name.

121
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,904
He came out and told me he was L
in order to directly investigate me.

122
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,575
But he's only positive because

123
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,745
there isn't anyone else
who could possibly be Kira.

124
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,830
And if I play it right,

125
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,959
he'll trust me and
we'll investigate together.

126
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,631
So all you have to do is
take me to where L is, right?

127
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,883
It's not that simple.

128
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,595
It was difficult enough
for me to get close to him.

129
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,139
Besides, if suddenly,

130
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,099
someone close to me
steps into the picture,

131
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:17,020
and the actions of Kira and
the Second Kira change...

132
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,190
that person will be suspected
of being the Second Kira,

133
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,652
and I'll end up casting
more suspicion on myself.

134
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,196
It would be bad if we get together,

135
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,616
and he makes the connection
that we're intimate...

136
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,409
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

137
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,956
Kind of... So does that mean
we can't go on dates?

138
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,250
We can't meet in public because
you're afraid that he'll suspect you more?

139
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,460
No.

140
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,463
We should take some time
to think of a plan

141
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,466
so that you can see L
without him knowing about you.

142
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,634
Yeah.

143
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,220
I need you
in order to eliminate L.

144
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,473
I want to be able to keep
in direct contact with you.

145
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,016
Thank goodness...

146
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,184
So...

147
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,145
In order to make sure that
our meetings don't stand out,

148
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,731
I'm going to see other girls.

149
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,777
Huh? What do you mean by that?
You're going to date other girls?

150
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,529
Well, pretty much...

151
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,697
No way!

152
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,244
If I see you with another girl,
I'll kill her.

153
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,079
Scary...!

154
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,081
Listen, Misa sweetie...

155
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,749
"Sweetie," huh?

156
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,584
This isn't a game...

157
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,046
We're both risking our lives
to change the world, aren't we?

158
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,135
Yeah, but...
I love you more... than the world...

159
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,220
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,099
I thought your feelings towards me
were those of just a Kira admirer.

161
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,310
Besides...
This is the first time we've met.

162
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,771
Haven't you ever experienced
love at first sight?

163
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,023
Never...

164
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:48,862
Well, yes, I wanted to meet Kira out of
gratitude and approval, not out of love.

165
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,948
But, when I first laid eyes on you...

166
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,950
<i>What's with this girl?</i>

167
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,411
Popular as usual...

168
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,081
Then if you love me,
you'll obey me.

169
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,043
You told me before that
you didn't mind being used

170
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,587
and just earlier, you insisted that
you'd do as I say, right?

171
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,466
But I won't allow you to
date other girls.

172
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,634
Those are two different things.

173
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,305
I have both notebooks.

174
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,433
If you won't obey, I'll kill you...

175
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,312
I won't let you do that,
Light Yagami.

176
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:29,569
If you try to kill her,
I'll write your name in my notebook...

177
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,488
And kill you.

178
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,992
I can see her lifespan.

179
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:41,998
If she dies before that date,
I'll assume that you killed her.

180
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,669
Wouldn't you die if you
used your notebook to save her?

181
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,839
That's right! Then you'll die, Rem!

182
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,092
That's true...

183
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,178
But I don't care.

184
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:00,934
<i>Is this Shinigami serious?
Then that means, from now on...</i>

185
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,103
Light?

186
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,189
What is it, Mom?

187
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,109
It's already 11:30.

188
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,528
It's not nice to have
a girl stay out so late...

189
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,613
Yeah, you're right.

190
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,156
We ended up having
a long conversation...

191
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,826
Sorry, Mrs. Yagami.

192
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,705
I'm sorry for staying so late.

193
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,707
Light, see you later.

194
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,750
Yeah.

195
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,461
Light, walk her to the station.

196
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,173
<i>It won't be good to walk
outside with her now...</i>

197
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,386
It's all right! Good night!

198
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,724
She's cute.

199
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,729
Oh yeah. I was a bit worried at first,
but she sure is cute.

200
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,981
I like her!

201
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,859
<i>That Shinigami is going
to kill me if I kill the girl?</i>

202
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,737
<i>Does that mean I have to deal
with her until she dies?</i>

203
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,656
<i>Not just that,</i>

204
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:01,536
<i>I'm forced to protect her so
she doesn't get caught by the police.</i>

205
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,585
Thanks to you,
Light really became my knight.

206
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,086
<i>So it seems.</i>

207
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,966
But don't kill him for real, okay?

208
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,732
<i>In order to kill a Shinigami,</i>

209
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,734
<i>that Shinigami
has to use the Death Note</i>

210
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,571
<i>to save a human's life that
it has fallen in love with...</i>

211
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,492
<i>I can't kill Rem
by using the Death Note</i>

212
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,495
<i>to control someone to attack Misa...</i>

213
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,918
<i>If Misa's put in danger,
I'll be suspected and killed.</i>

214
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,589
<i>Right now, she's an even
bigger nuisance than L is.</i>

215
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,092
<i>Sh-She's...</i>

216
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,428
<i>She does something
this conspicuous?</i>

217
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,890
<i>What'll happen if it's discovered
that I met up with someone like this?</i>

218
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,518
<i>Damn it! She's in the way
no matter how I think about it.</i>

219
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,895
<i>What do I do?</i>

220
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:14,317
<i>No... that aside, I should think
of a way to use Misa's eyes to kill L.</i>

221
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,111
<i>If I just eliminate L...</i>

222
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,158
Good morning, Light!

223
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,534
Good morning.

224
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:28,623
Mom, Sayu, could you keep Misa
a secret from Dad?

225
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,500
All right.

226
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,419
I also want you to keep it secret,
not just from Dad,

227
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,171
but from everyone.

228
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,049
She's an up-and-coming model,
actually,

229
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,801
so it would be problematic
if people found out about us.

230
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,636
What?! Is that so?

231
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,972
I thought she was cute...

232
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:49,310
Just what I'd expect for your girlfriend...
I'll keep it a secret... for 5,000 yen.

233
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,645
Silly...

234
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,524
TO-OH UNIVERSITY

235
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,818
On page 246...

236
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,529
<i>Misa's ﬁnal message
will arrive today.</i>

237
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,949
<i>Instead of going to
the television station,</i>

238
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,118
<i>it should be routed to
the task force headquarters.</i>

239
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,579
<i>I have to go to headquarters
in order to see L's reaction...</i>

240
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,165
Yagami... Yagami...

241
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,961
You told me that you'd
go outwith me, right?

242
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,005
Yeah, I did.

243
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,009
That's why I'm sitting next
to you at this lecture.

244
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,093
Yes.

245
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,054
But you don't seem happy at all.

246
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,015
You've been completely
ignoring me.

247
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,725
That's not true at all.

248
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,396
I was just thinking about the Way
everyone's going to be talking about us.

249
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,941
To think that I'm going outwith you,
the famous Miss To-oh University...

250
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,736
It's obvious,
you really are beautiful.

251
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:48,411
Please don't think about such things.
I don't like being called Miss whatever.

252
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,079
Yeah. You're right.

253
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,166
<i>What's with this woman?
She loves it.</i>

254
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,754
Miss Takada, let's just take
things at our own pace.

255
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,130
Okay.

256
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,427
Hello.

257
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,805
Light, good timing.

258
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,601
A video message from
the Second Kira just arrived.

259
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,562
Another one? That was fast.

260
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,565
Yes. I think this is the last one.

261
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,817
Well, take a look at this.

262
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,654
<i>I will stop trying to meet Kira.</i>

263
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,408
<i>I'd like to thank the police
for their advice.</i>

264
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:32,955
<i>But I'm going to help Kira
erase evil from the world...</i>

265
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,707
<i>I'm going to cooperate with him
and gain his acceptance.</i>

266
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,753
<i>I will begin by punishing criminals
that Kira hasn't punished yet. Also...</i>

267
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,174
<i>I plan to make this world
a better place</i>

268
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,510
<i>by sharing this power
among those who are worthy...</i>

269
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,847
Watching this...

270
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,226
makes me feel that Kira and
the Second Kira have joined forces.

271
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,437
How do you know that
they've joined forces?

272
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,231
Didn't you sense it?

273
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,111
I thought you would
get the same impression.

274
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,034
First of all, his attitude towards
meeting Kira completely changed.

275
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,538
Also, he now says that he wants
to punish criminals

276
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,791
that Kira didn't punish
in order to gain his acceptance.

277
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,129
Why didn't he do this before?

278
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,549
He probably never thought
that far ahead, so...

279
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,469
It's likely that he's working with Kira,
and was told to say that.

280
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:34,267
He was also ordered to hide
the fact that they're working together.

281
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,476
I see.

282
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,188
That probably means that Kira isn't
thinking about his actions very much.

283
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,606
Yes.

284
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,153
Did Kira encounter something
he couldn't overcome?

285
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,239
He probably was trying to scare us
by making it obvious

286
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,491
that he'd recruited the Second Kira.

287
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,994
Their union is really threatening.

288
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,540
But this lessens the suspicion
I had of Light.

289
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,001
What do you mean, Ryuzaki?!

290
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,420
If Light was Kira,

291
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,631
then he wouldn't have sent
in a video like this.

292
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:11,220
He would have tried to threaten me, L,
into appearing on television again.

293
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,223
Maintaining that lie that
they aren't working together,

294
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,851
he would have placed all
the responsibility on Second Kira...

295
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,229
And this is what he'd have him say:

296
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,817
"| stopped because
Kira told me to,"

297
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,112
"but I don't think that warning
would come from the real Kira. "

298
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,115
"Kira would be happy if L died. "

299
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,534
"There's no way he'd stop me. "

300
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,162
Ryuzaki...

301
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,330
Yes?

302
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,625
I would never do that
if I were Kira.

303
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,168
Why?

304
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,670
I know your personality.

305
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:51,469
L would never go on TV,
no matter how he was threatened.

306
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,388
He wouldn't want to die
in someone else's place.

307
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,308
He would think of
some way to escape.

308
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,436
You figured it out.

309
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,649
Light, stop saying,
"if I were Kira. "

310
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,400
I don't like hearing it,
even hypothetically.

311
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,319
Oh, sorry, Dad...

312
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,907
But I want to tell Ryuzaki
what I think.

313
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,993
I have to pose the scenario
hypothetically

314
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,663
in order to solve this case quickly
and to clear my name.

315
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:23,834
Besides, it's because
I'm not Kira that I can talk in that way.

316
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,878
You're right.

317
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,214
You're not Kira.

318
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,384
Rather, it would be a problem
if you were Kira.

319
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,513
Because you're...

320
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,349
my very first friend...

321
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,945
Yeah, Ryuzaki, I consider you a friend too.
We have so much in common.

322
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,406
Thank you.

323
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,286
It's been lonely since you've been
taking breaks from school.

324
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,414
I'd like to play tennis with you again.

325
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,958
Yes. By all means.

326
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:17,305
Friend? Friend, huh?
Aren't you glad, Light?

327
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,765
That damn Ryuzaki
immediately noticed

328
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,602
the connection between
Kira and the Second Kira...

329
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,479
I've got to eliminate him quickly...

330
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,315
Oh I see...

331
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,359
<i>This makes it all the more dangerous
for me to see Misa.</i>

332
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,445
Light!

333
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,866
I just couldn't wait
two weeks...

334
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,660
I was just about to go
to your house!

335
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:46,459
<i>T- This is the ﬁrst time
I've really wanted to hit a woman...</i>

336
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,670
|- | just wanted to see you
so badly...

337
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,007
Well... Come over to my house.

338
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,342
Okay!

339
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,680
Another girl?

340
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,228
Welcome, Misa! I saw you in
a whole bunch of magazines!

341
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,730
Welcome.

342
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,274
Sorry for the intrusion.

343
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,485
Mom, please get some tea ready...

344
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,906
Rem.

345
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,451
You're Misa's ally, aren't you?

346
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:25,539
Yeah. I've watched her many times
from the Shinigami Realm.

347
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,210
I've developed a bit of
affection for her.

348
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,587
Affection, even though
you're a Shinigami?

349
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,091
You don't seem to like that

350
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,260
I said that I'd kill you
if you tried to kill her.

351
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,682
Does this mean that if
Misa's happy that you'll feel fine?

352
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,142
Well, you could say that.

353
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,687
I just don't want
to see her unhappy.

354
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,563
Misa is...

355
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,401
in love with me.

356
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,527
Light...

357
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,903
Misa.

358
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,987
Yes?

359
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,032
Would my happiness
make you happy?

360
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,575
Yes.

361
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,247
Then could you ask Rem
to kill L?

362
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,000
Rem wants you to be happy.

363
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:14,755
If L catches one of us,
we'll both be unhappy.

364
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:21,220
A Shinigami can't tell a person's name
to someone who has a notebook,

365
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,849
but there's no restriction
against Rem killing anyone.

366
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:30,688
Yeah. If you kill L,
I think I can love Misa more

367
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,398
and I would be very grateful.

368
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,942
Above all, it'll make us both happy.

369
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,652
Rem...

370
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,906
I want Light to love me.
Light and I will be grateful.

371
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,325
That would be... my happiness.

372
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,255
Fine.

373
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:02,052
Fine, Light Yagami.
I don't like you.

374
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:06,140
Even if this ends up lengthening
your lifespan, I won't die.

375
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,768
I'll kill L for you.

376
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,772
L means nothing to me.

377
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,648
All right!

378
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,817
Thank you, Rem!

379
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,986
That's my Rem!

380
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,614
<i>L will die,</i>

381
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,908
<i>this easily?</i>

382
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,788
TO BE CONTINUED

383
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:34,293
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

384
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:39,673
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

385
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,219
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

386
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:48,682
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

387
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:55,105
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

388
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:59,693
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

389
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:05,366
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

390
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,078
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

391
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,832
<i>To accomplish</i>

392
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:23,717
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

393
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:28,722
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

394
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:34,061
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

395
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,442
PREVIEW

396
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,114
This is all a wager now.

397
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,994
Tomorrow will be L's,
no Ryuga/Ryuzaki's,

398
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,370
...final day.

399
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,789
WAGER
