1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,506
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,217
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:13,347
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,519
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:35,244
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:39,706
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:48,340
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,599
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,321
<i>The bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:17,286
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:31,883
Because you're
my very first friend...

17
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,723
- Misa.
- Yes?

18
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,143
Could you ask Rem to kill L?

19
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,645
Rem...

20
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,480
I want Light to love me.

21
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,025
Light and I will be grateful.
That would be my happiness.

22
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,989
Fine. I'll kill L for you.

23
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,158
<i>L will die,</i>

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,410
<i>this easily?</i>

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,623
WAGER

26
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,833
So when should I kill him?

27
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,421
If you take me to wherever he is,
I can kill him immediately.

28
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,381
It should be done
as soon as possible.

29
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,091
Tomorrow if you can.

30
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,386
But it's still too soon to
make a decision now...

31
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,433
I'll give you an answer after
I think of a way to kill him tonight.

32
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,018
All right.

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,606
No matter what,
don't kill him until I say so, got it.

34
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,608
No matter what! Got it?

35
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,736
All right, I promise...

36
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,988
Only in regard to L.

37
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,659
Misa, give me
your cell phone number.

38
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,120
It's about time!
Give me yours too, Light!

39
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,873
No, I can't give you mine.

40
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,460
Why not?! We're lovers!

41
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,797
I told you,
I'm under police surveillance.

42
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:56,134
The police now can listen in
on phone conversations.

43
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,972
In that case, here.

44
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,808
I'll give you one of
my own cell phones.

45
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,769
I just ended up with three after
getting them for different jobs...

46
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,562
That's a good idea.

47
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,606
Using your phone would
probably be all right.

48
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,691
All right!

49
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,693
I'll call you every day.

50
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,985
I'll also send you a lot of texts!

51
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,196
No, I'll be keeping it off.

52
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,032
I'll be the only one
making calls,

53
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,367
and I'll only tell you what
you need to know.

54
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,369
What? No way...

55
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,788
When are you going to call?

56
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,665
Probably tomorrow...

57
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:31,128
I'll call once even if I decide
not to execute L.

58
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,879
What? Tomorrow?

59
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,841
It doesn't sound like something
a boyfriend would call about,

60
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,592
but we can talk
about love afterwards.

61
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,220
Well Misa,
go home for today.

62
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,973
What? Why? It's only 7:00.

63
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,016
The time for love
has just begun, hasn't it?

64
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,644
We can go get dinner,
look at the night sky,

65
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,313
and after that, the main event...

66
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,190
Misa.

67
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,994
Got it?

68
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,662
Go home for today.

69
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,748
Yes...

70
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,792
Also, when you're talking
outside with Rem,

71
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,171
whisper and make sure that
no one's around.

72
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,465
That's what Ryuk and I do.

73
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,883
Yes...

74
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,968
Thanks for having me over...

75
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,180
Misa, come again tomorrow!

76
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,186
That kiss was so sudden,
it surprised me.

77
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,023
I need to keep
Misa deeply in love with me.

78
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,566
Oh?

79
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,694
Besides that, I need to decide
if I should kill L tomorrow or not.

80
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,573
L hasn't made himself public yet.
So if Ryuga dies...

81
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,286
I have to be prepared to become
an even greater suspect...

82
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,621
I see.

83
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,998
I thought you were hesitating

84
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,876
because he said that
you were his friend.

85
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,338
Friend? I was just playing along.

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,133
From the beginning, I've said
that if it's friendship he wants,

87
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,384
then I'll give it.

88
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:06,681
Ryuga is Light Yagami's friend,
on the surface... But L is Kira's enemy.

89
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,235
<i>Yes, L is my enemy...</i>

90
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,947
<i>Since Ryuga's revealed that he's L,
I must kill him...</i>

91
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,783
<i>If L dies in an accident,</i>

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,119
<i>almost nobody will suspect me...</i>

93
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,413
<i>Even if they do,
there's no evidence.</i>

94
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,334
<i>I can only imagine
what will happen after L dies.</i>

95
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,419
<i>This is all a wager now.</i>

96
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:44,594
<i>Tomorrow will be L's...
no, Ryuzaki/Ryuga's ï¬nal day.</i>

97
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,018
Hair.

98
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,439
Snack crumbs.

99
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,777
Hair.

100
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,947
Mr. Yagami.

101
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,285
If I die within the next few days,
your son is Kira.

102
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,705
Another hair.

103
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,292
What did you just say?!

104
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,836
Yeah. What are you
talking about?!

105
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,047
I'll make sure that you
have ready access to Watari,

106
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,799
I'm counting on you...

107
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,217
Ryuzaki...!

108
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,721
You said he was almost entirely cleared,
but I want the truth.

109
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,764
How likely is it that he's-?!

110
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,893
Even I don't know how I truly feel.

111
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,730
This has never happened before...

112
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,108
If Kira and the Second Kira
are working together...

113
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,985
I'm in big trouble.

114
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:47,824
So I might not be analyzing
the situation calmly...

115
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:55,165
I might be considering him a suspect
just because there's nobody else...

116
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,666
Despite that...

117
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:01,338
If I'm killed now,
please assume that your son is Kira.

118
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,093
<i>I have no choice
but to make a surprise attack.</i>

119
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,178
<i>It can't be helped.</i>

120
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,722
<i>This is all a wager now.</i>

121
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,362
That's not true.

122
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,530
I'm just good at
dealing with things...

123
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,746
What's wrong?

124
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,503
Oh, Yagami.

125
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,296
Hello.

126
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,094
Miss Takada,
I'd like to talk to him for moment.

127
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,178
Could we continue this later?

128
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,721
What? All right.

129
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,352
Was that okay?

130
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,229
More importantly,

131
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,982
didn't you say that you were afraid
to appear in front of people?

132
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,191
Are you all right out here?

133
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,653
I realized that as long
as you're not Kira, it's okay.

134
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,573
You're the only one on
the outside who knows I'm L...

135
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,577
So, I've told everyone at headquarters
that if I die in the next few days...

136
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,915
to assume that you're Kira.

137
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,960
<i>Damn him...</i>

138
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,172
You told me that
you've been lonely

139
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,508
because I've been taking
breaks from school,

140
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,261
so I came out for a change of pace.

141
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,305
As long as you don't die,
college is a fun place.

142
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,850
Yeah. When you're not here,
it's so boring

143
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,602
because there's no one who can
match my level of conversation.

144
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,730
So that explains why
you're with the "brilliant" Takada.

145
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,732
Well, something like that.

146
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,945
<i>Should I really kill him today?</i>

147
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,615
<i>No... As soon as I
decided to kill him,</i>

148
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,952
<i>he suddenly appears, as if to
distract me from my resolution...</i>

149
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,788
<i>to prevent me from killing him...</i>

150
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,292
<i>This is exactly what he wants!</i>

151
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,587
Shall we have some cake
in the cafeteria?

152
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,882
Sure... My next lecture was cancelled.

153
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,425
That's good.

154
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,636
I wonder if they have shortcake?

155
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,972
Well... who knows.

156
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,892
Light! There you are!

157
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,520
I came because I had
a photo shoot nearby!

158
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,481
<i>Misa! You idiot!</i>

159
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,483
Is this a friend of yours?

160
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,526
He's so unique and cool...

161
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,404
<i>No... I've won!</i>

162
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,491
<i>Misa can see Ryuga's real name!</i>

163
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,870
I'm Light's girlfriend, Misa Amane.
Pleased to meet you.

164
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,663
I'm Hideki Ryuga.

165
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,041
Huh? Hideki Ryuga?

166
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,128
Yeah, he has the same first name
and last name as that idol.

167
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,838
Isn't that funny?

168
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,217
<i>But, it's diferent from
the name I'm seeing...</i>

169
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:57,180
<i>Ryuga, coming outside like this
was a big mistake!</i>

170
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,022
<i>Why's he laughing?
Does this mean he noticed?</i>

171
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,484
<i>But if he's guessed that
she's the Second Kira,</i>

172
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,569
<i>there's no way
he would be laughing...</i>

173
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,988
Yagami...

174
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,700
I'm jealous.

175
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,205
I've been a huge fan of yours
since the August issue of "Eighteen. "

176
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,791
What? Really? I'm so happy...

177
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,001
Hey, that girl.
Isn't she Misa-Misa?!

178
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,295
It's true. It's Misa-Misa!

179
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,755
- Misa-Misa?!
- The real one?!

180
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,340
I should have guessed
that I'd be discovered

181
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,466
if there were
a lot of young people around.

182
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,051
I look forward to
seeing you every month.

183
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,719
Keep up the good work.

184
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,055
Yeah. Thank you.
I'll do my best...

185
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,890
<i>What's going on?</i>

186
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,309
Hey! Who touched my butt?!

187
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,313
How disgraceful!

188
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,732
I won't forgive anyone who would
take advantage of this situation.

189
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,110
I'll find the culprit.

190
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,738
Ryuga! You're so funny!

191
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,158
- I want to touch her, too.
- Stupid!

192
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,786
<i>At any rate, I want to ask Misa what
L's name is as soon as possible,</i>

193
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,080
<i>but these people are in the way.</i>

194
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,748
Misa!

195
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,667
It's time!

196
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,085
Are you planning on
being late again?!

197
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,045
Oh, sorry, Yoshi...

198
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,339
- Let's go!
- Oh, yeah!

199
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,508
<i>Good...</i>

200
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,177
<i>Once Misa's out of here,</i>

201
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,013
<i>I just have to give her a call
and ask her for L's name.</i>

202
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,017
See you after work, Light...

203
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,025
Now then, shall we go, Yagami?

204
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,443
Yeah...

205
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,863
Sorry, could you go on ahead?
I need to go to the restroom.

206
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,282
I see. See you there...

207
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,505
<i>It's over...</i>

208
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,509
<i>It's been fun... L.</i>

209
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,934
<i>I'm glad that I could discover
your name and kill you myself.</i>

210
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,490
<i>It's been fun L.</i>

211
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,661
<i>I'm glad that I could discover
your name and kill you myself.</i>

212
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,109
Yes, hello?

213
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,945
What do you mean, "Hello"?

214
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,323
Oh, this cell phone must have
been dropped

215
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,534
by someone in
that commotion earlier.

216
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,453
<i>Bastard... he must have...
back then...</i>

217
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,959
Hello?

218
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,712
<i>Yeah... That's Misa's cell phone, so...</i>

219
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,255
I'll give it back to her.

220
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,133
I see. I understand.

221
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:31,894
<i>Ryuga probably thinks he's won,
but Misa has another phone.</i>

222
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,730
<i>If I call that one...</i>

223
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,775
Oh, this time...
it's my cell phone.

224
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,570
Yes?

225
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,033
Yes. I see. We did it.

226
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,452
I understand.

227
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:54,000
This may come as good and
bad news to you, but...

228
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,794
Misa Amane has just been
taken into custody

229
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,087
under suspicion
of being the Second Kira.

230
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,759
<i>When in the world
did he ï¬nd out about Misa?!</i>

231
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,595
<i>I never thought he'd
catch her this quickly...</i>

232
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,641
There were hairs and fibers,
among other things,

233
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,187
attached to the masking tape
sealing the tapes the Second Kira sent.

234
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,315
We discovered many matching samples
of evidence in her room.

235
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,111
There will probably be a riot if
we charge her with being the Second Kira,

236
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,155
so we're telling the public that
she's voluntarily coming with us

237
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,407
because her manager is
suspected of drug possession.

238
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,035
The truth will probably
never go public...

239
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,873
<i>I was careless...</i>

240
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,628
<i>That video. I should have
destroyed all the evidence...</i>

241
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,964
<i>In the end,
Ryuga chose to protect himself</i>

242
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,384
<i>by being with me instead of hiding.</i>

243
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,135
<i>He confronted
the heart of the matter...</i>

244
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,640
<i>This wager... is my...</i>

245
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,558
<i>My...</i>

246
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,394
<i>My...</i>

247
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,312
<i>No!</i>

248
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,524
<i>Not yet...</i>

249
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,653
<i>The challenge is just beginning, L...</i>

250
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,123
Watari, has she said anything?

251
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,208
<i>No, she hasn't said anything yet.</i>

252
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,585
Get me a visual of her.

253
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,129
<i>Are you sure?</i>

254
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,296
Yes, quickly.

255
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:31,973
R- Ryuzaki!

256
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,391
What's the meaning of this?!

257
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,477
I've apprehended her
as the Second Kira.

258
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,229
This, at the very least,
is necessary.

259
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,607
Indeed, there was enough evidence
in Amane's room...

260
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,777
to mark her as
the Second Kira, but...

261
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,697
Yes. There's no mistake.

262
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,074
Now all we have to do is
make her tell us how she kills...

263
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:55,163
Whether she knows Kira,
and if she knows who he is.

264
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,374
Watari. Take the proper precautions,

265
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,918
but do whatever needs to be done,
I don't care what,

266
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,420
to get her to confess.

267
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,713
<i>Yes.</i>

268
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,214
Also, Mr. Yagami...

269
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,718
I'm probably going to
call Light in...

270
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,678
as a prime suspect.

271
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,513
Please be prepared for that.

272
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,578
<i>Ryuzaki, Amane's talking.</i>

273
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,498
Give me visuals... and sound quickly!

274
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,919
Finally after three days, huh?!

275
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,215
<i>I can't take it any more...</i>

276
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,885
Kill me.

277
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,764
<i>Kill me... Hurry up and kill me!</i>

278
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,851
I guess it was too much
for a young girl...

279
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,562
She must be at her limit...

280
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,899
<i>Misa Amane, can you hear me?</i>

281
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,196
I can hear you...
Please kill me now...

282
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,659
Is this because you admit
to being the Second Kira?

283
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,620
<i>No! I don't know anything
about the Second Kira!</i>

284
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,750
I can't take this anymore...!
I'd rather die...

285
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,795
Just hurry up and kill me!

286
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,881
You should be able to
kill me immediately, right?!

287
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,594
Misa... do you mean-?

288
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,638
Yes, kill me.

289
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,391
You want me to kill you?

290
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,393
Yes... Kill me...

291
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,565
I can't take it anymore... Kill me...

292
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,485
If I kill you, I'll kill Light Yagami.

293
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,362
This all happened because of him.

294
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,241
No! No...
Kill me...

295
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,287
<i>Misa... You want so badly...
to die for him?</i>

296
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,916
That's it! If you won't kill me...!

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,043
This is not good, Watari...
Don't let her bite her tongue!

298
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,928
Could it be that these are
just actions

299
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,014
controlled by Kira before death?

300
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,891
Oh Rem.

301
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,476
What's this all of a sudden?

302
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,230
Light Yagami...

303
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,276
I offered to help Misa escape,
but she refused.

304
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,988
She probably thought it would
get you in trouble

305
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,949
since the police think that
she has special powers...

306
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,287
And when she was
at her wit's end,

307
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,165
she started asking me to kill her.

308
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,544
This is all because
she wants you to love her.

309
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,467
No matter how much she asked,
I couldn't kill her...

310
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,385
I couldn't bear watching her...

311
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,681
There was only one way
to save her from that suffering.

312
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,060
Forfeiting ownership
of the Death Note.

313
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:05,811
That's right.

314
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,731
If she forfeits ownership
of the Death Note,

315
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,360
all memories related to
the Death Note will disappear.

316
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,404
All memories of murders
she committed with her notebook,

317
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,158
and the fact that you are Kira,
will disappear.

318
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,495
Misa will not reveal your secret.

319
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,125
Also, Misa will no longer
be able to see Ryuk or me.

320
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,879
SEVERAL HOURS EARLIER

321
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,759
You will forget
everything about Shinigami.

322
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:44,141
It's all right. The human
you love is Light Yagami.

323
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,061
Those emotions will remain.

324
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:54,652
So Misa, forfeit ownership
of the notebook

325
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,154
and leave everything to Light Yagami.

326
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,065
Misa no longer owns the Death Note.

327
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,401
You did well, Rem...

328
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,863
I was beginning to think
that was the only way.

329
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,615
If her memories of
the Death Note are erased,

330
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,326
then it's not impossible
to get Misa released.

331
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,372
Light Yagami, I proposed this
to Misa

332
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:54,003
because I knew this is the method
you would have desired the most.

333
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,258
If you don't save Misa, I'll kill you.

334
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,393
I understand, Rem.

335
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,688
I think I have a good idea
of what L is going to do next.

336
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,065
I have a plan.

337
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,695
This is good bye, Ryuk.

338
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,864
What?

339
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,534
TO BE CONTINUED

340
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:30,915
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

341
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:36,337
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

342
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,798
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

343
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:45,346
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

344
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:51,727
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacrifice</i>

345
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:56,315
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

346
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:01,987
<i>I can't hold back
the ï¬‚ooding impulses</i>

347
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,865
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

348
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:09,453
<i>To accomplish</i>

349
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,296
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

350
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,386
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

351
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:31,225
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

PREVIEW

353
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:42,361
Yeah... I know I probably look
pretty bad in here...

354
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,447
but this pride...
I'll just have to...

355
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,700
get rid of it!

356
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,494
