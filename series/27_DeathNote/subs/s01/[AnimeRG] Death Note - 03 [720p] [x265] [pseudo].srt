<i>there's a strong possibility

19
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>Kira, I have a pretty good idea behind
your motive and why you're doing this.</i>

20
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,149
<i>But what you're doing is... evil!</i>

21
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,900
W- Why that...!

22
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,319
<i>Try and kill me!</i>

23
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,945
- I am justice!
- What's going on?!

24
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,947
- I'm saving the meek that fear evil!
- This is unreal!

00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,618
I'm the man who will become
the god of the ideal, new world!

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS HQ

33
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,349
Until now, there have been
3,029 responses

34
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,309
about the murders from
telephone calls, etc.

35
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,145
Most of them are from
curious members of the public...

36
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,105
But there are fourteen people
who say that

37
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,816
they either "know the killer"
or "have seen the killer. "

38
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,779
Each account was followed up
and recorded carefully.

39
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,033
But no one had information that hasn't
already been released to the public.

40
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,538
There are also 21 people
who claim they are Kira.

41
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,505
We didn't want to rule out
any possibilities...

42
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,175
So all 21 people
were put on record and filed.

43
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,177
Okay.

44
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,012
Next, the victims.

45
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,430
Sir!

46
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,142
Upon further investigation, we have
confirmed that information

47
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,144
of the heart attack victims was, in fact,

48
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,691
publicly available in Japan
prior to their deaths.

49
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,360
Also...

50
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,696
Concerning L's request
that we investigate

51
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,614
the times of death for each victim...

52
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,785
<i>We found they occurred between 4 p. m.
until 2 a. m. on weekdays Japan's time.</i>

53
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:26,206
68% of them occurred between
8 p. m. and 12 midnight.

54
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,167
Furthermore, we have
a wide variation of times

55
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,504
on Saturdays, Sundays,
and holidays.

56
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,674
<i>That information is very interesting.</i>

57
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:42,389
<i>Judging from those times of death...
the culprit may be a student.</i>

58
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,226
<i>I have other grounds for this belief.</i>

59
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,979
<i>The perpetrator is probably driven by
their own idealistic sense of justice.</i>

60
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,482
<i>He's probably driven by
his own idealistic sense of justice.</i>

61
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,278
<i>They may even be trying
to become a god.</i>

62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,240
<i>It is a deduction from
a very childish mentality.</i>

63
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,908
I can't believe that...

64
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,286
<i>This is just a mere possibility.</i>

65
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:09,499
<i>But please get rid of the fixed idea
that the culprit couldn't be a student.</i>

66
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:15,547
<i>Considering various possibilities
is the shortest route to arresting Kira.</i>

67
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,550
<i>Please continue
your investigative report.</i>

68
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,677
Y- Yes...

69
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,638
Has anyone else noticed anything?

70
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,390
Um, yes...

71
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,184
What is it, Matsuda?

72
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:33,565
Umm... I'm in no way saying this
to give credit to Kira's actions...

73
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,111
but for the past few days, worldwide...
and especially in Japan...

74
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,115
the number of violent crimes more serious
than robbery has dropped drastically.

75
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,620
Well...

76
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,831
I suppose that's to be expected...

77
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,583
AFB/thing else?

78
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,590
L, that about sums up
our investigative report for today.

79
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,220
<i>Thank you, everyone. I feel as if
we're closing in on the culprit.</i>

80
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,932
<i>Please forgive me,
but I'd like to make another request.</i>

81
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,019
<i>I want the teams investigating
the victims, news and internet</i>

82
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,230
<i>to examine closely once more</i>

83
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:18,235
<i>how the victims' identities
were made public in Japan.</i>

84
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,989
<i>I want to know if pictures of
the victims' faces were shown.</i>

85
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,075
<i>I leave it to you.</i>

86
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,579
Chief...

87
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,457
You seem very tired...

88
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,376
Thanks...

89
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,504
I've been pulling all-nighters lately.

90
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,343
What I said about crimes
dropping drastically...

91
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,680
Now that I think about it,
everyone knows that already.

92
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,515
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,517
What are you talking about?

94
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,854
Keep speaking the truth...

95
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,023
Especially when it's about things
people hesitate to bring up.

96
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,320
However, if you had gone
on to say that...

97
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,990
we should commend Kira for admirably
reducing crime rates,

98
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,450
now that might have been a problem.

99
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,203
I- Impossible! Support that murderer?

100
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,789
I'm just kidding.

101
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,917
Just as I expected, Light!

102
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,129
Hey! Did you understand any
of that by yourself?

103
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,923
Huh? Yeah, kind of...

104
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,677
Oh, it seems like Dad's home.

105
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,305
Welcome home, Dear.

106
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,807
He's home early!

107
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,519
Hey! At least figure out
the last problem by yourself.

108
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,855
I will after dinner!

109
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,398
Really...

110
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,860
Helping your little sister
do her homework...

111
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,361
you sure have confidence.

112
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,365
Yeah. There's one thing that gives me
an advantage against the police

113
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,367
if they move against me.

114
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,581
Welcome home... Dad.

115
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,625
Good to be home.

116
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,761
Light, how are your studies going?

117
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,221
Hmm? They're okay.

118
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,474
He's at the top of his grade as usual.

119
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,309
I'm very proud of my big brother!

120
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,770
I'm very proud of my son!

121
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,606
Dad, you seem a bit tired.

122
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,857
Yeah...

123
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,737
I can't tell you any details,
but this current case is very difficult.

124
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,114
<i>I see...</i>

125
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,202
Your father is with the police...

126
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,413
That must be the reason why
you're so confident.

127
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,248
Yeah.

128
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:42,963
I can hack into my father's computer
from my own without leaving a trace.

129
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,299
I can always keep track of
the investigative situation.

130
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,218
Here it is.

131
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,987
The police are beginning to
suspect that the culprit is a student.

132
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,824
Light, doesn't that mean
you're in trouble?

133
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,333
If the cause of death is written within
40 seconds of writing the person's name,

134
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,710
it will happen.

135
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,004
If the cause of death
is not specified,

136
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,006
the person will simply die
of a heart attack.

137
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,549
After writing the cause of death,

138
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:32,846
details of the death should be written
in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

139
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,681
Is that correct, Ryuk?

140
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,349
Yeah, so?

141
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,894
In other words, if I write "heart attack"
as the cause of death,

142
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:44,357
I can write down the circumstance
and time of death.

143
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,862
Looks like I may be able to provide you
with a little more entertainment, Ryuk.

144
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,559
Number 148, what's wrong?!

145
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,685
Get ahold of yourself!

00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:43,583
<i>T- There were another
23 heart attack victims yesterday?!</i>

148
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,796
Yes. The day before, there were
23 more victims.

149
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,924
One every hour...

150
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,803
The fact that this has continued for
two weekdays straight...

151
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,223
Means our sketch of the culprit
has become doubtful.

152
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,101
No, anyone could skip
school for two days...

153
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,519
<i>That's not it!</i>

154
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,272
<i>It does appear less likely now
that the culprit's a student...</i>

155
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,442
<i>But that's not the message
Kira's trying to send!</i>

156
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,028
<i>Why one every hour?</i>

157
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,697
<i>And why are all the victims
in prisons,</i>

158
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,118
<i>where they can be easily found?</i>

159
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,620
<i>Kira is trying to say that...</i>

160
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,333
<i>he can freely control...
the time of death.</i>

161
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,880
<i>But something's not right...</i>

162
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>As soon as we began to suspect that
Kira was a student,</i>

163
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,346
<i>the timing of the killings changed as
if to contradict our theory.</i>

164
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:43,268
<i>Is it a coincidence?
No, the timing is too convenient...</i>

165
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,647
Does that mean that Kira knows
what the police know?

166
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,777
This is obviously
a direct challenge from him!

167
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,699
L is probably panicking by now.

168
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:02,912
I still have fifty criminals left
especially for times like this.

169
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,205
Oh...

170
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:09,586
<i>Right now, L should be starting to suspect
someone involved with the police.</i>

171
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,923
<i>Kira has found a way to obtain information
from the task foroe headquarters.</i>

172
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,885
<i>I cannot ignore this fact.</i>

173
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:26,352
<i>What is Kira's real objective?
What is he trying to do?</i>

174
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,856
But I don't get it.

175
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,358
By getting rid of the student theory,

176
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,862
aren't you at a bigger disadvantage if
L thinks you're connected to the police?

177
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,697
My reason is...

178
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,367
It's in order to find L
and finish him off.

179
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,036
What do you mean?

180
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:49,334
In human society, there are only a few
people who actually trust each other.

181
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,836
That's true even among police.

182
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:57,342
In particular, L and the police
don't trust each other at all.

183
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,012
Could you trust someone
whose name and face you don't know?

184
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,557
When L discovers that information
from the investigation was leaked...

185
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,895
he's bound to search for leads
on me within the police force.

186
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,525
When he does, it's only a matter of time
before the police get really mad.

187
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,819
On the surface,

188
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,240
L and the police are working
together to try to catch me.

189
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,200
But in reality...

190
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,287
L is investigating the police
and the police will start investigating L.

191
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,582
I'm not the one who's
going to find L.

192
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,210
The police will track him down.

193
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,213
And I will eliminate him!

LETTER OF RESIGNATION

196
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,855
As you can see, these are
our letters of resignation.

197
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,359
Transfer us to a different case.

198
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,861
If you can't, we will
quit the police force.

199
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,030
B- But why?

200
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,659
Why? Because we value our lives, sir.

201
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,369
By L's deduction,

202
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:11,541
Kira can kill people indirectly
through supernatural powers, right?

203
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,251
If I were Kira,

204
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,379
I would try to kill anyone
who tried to catch me.

205
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,048
That's because he'll be
executed if he gets caught.

206
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,219
Earlier, in that media stunt,
L challenged Kira.

207
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,930
"Try and kill me," he said.

208
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,685
But L never showed
his face or revealed his name.

209
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,272
Just recently, L ordered us
to find out

210
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:42,405
if the victims' faces and names
were broadcast in Japan.

211
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,741
That's right!

212
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,284
All the victims were people

213
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,203
whose faces were broadcast
to the Japanese public!

214
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,830
We...

215
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,874
unlike someone we know,

216
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:57,253
carry around our personal identification
as well as our photos in our police IDs.

217
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,131
We don't hide our faces,
we're out in the open!

218
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,091
We...

219
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,594
could be killed at any time by Kira...

220
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,264
This is why we wish to be
removed from our post.

221
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,099
Please excuse us.

222
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,144
H- Hey you!

223
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,771
Wait a second!

224
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,238
Here's the solution to this problem.

225
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:30,620
Take x squared equals... large x.

226
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,625
You can think of large X's
quadratic equation...

227
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,961
as the multiple of two integers.

228
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,471
<i>FBI agents entered Japan four days ago.</i>

229
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,641
<i>They are currently investigating
the police involved.</i>

230
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,643
This is the list, isn't it?

231
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,811
<i>Yes.</i>

232
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,647
<i>There are 141 people within
the police force alone</i>

233
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,983
<i>who have access to classified
information on the Kira investigation.</i>

234
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:06,489
<i>But one of the 141 people
or someone close to them...</i>

235
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,701
<i>Kira is definitely among them!</i>

00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,708
Light, you gotta second?

238
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,170
Didn't I tell you not to talk to me
as much as possible when we're outside?

239
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,297
How many times do I have to tell you?

240
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,800
Well then, I'm just gonna tell you.

241
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,678
Cover your ears if
you don't want to hear.

242
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,973
I don't have anything
against you, Light.

243
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,975
I think the notebook couldn't
have been picked up

244
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,685
by a better person.

245
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,521
And I have to stick around with you

246
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,357
until the notebook is finished
or you are.

247
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:46,195
But, I'm not on your side or L's side.

248
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,199
Ryuk, I know that much already.

249
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,536
That's why I'll never say
anything about

250
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:58,207
whether what you're doing is
right or wrong.

251
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,712
But I'm going to say this
as your roommate.

252
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,547
What's wrong, Ryuk?

253
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,549
Why are you telling me
this all of a sudden?

254
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,342
This isn't like you.

255
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,053
I'm going to tell you this,

256
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:16,559
not because I'm an ally of Kira,
but because it's creeping me out...

257
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,561
Get to the point already...

258
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,609
Someone's been following
you all this time.

259
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,419
He's been getting on my nerves.

260
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,088
He can't see me, but...

261
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:52,595
because I'm always hovering behind you,
I feel like I'm being watched.

262
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,764
That's a problem.

263
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,808
I'll get rid of him soon, Ryuk.

264
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,730
<i>Just who is he?</i>

265
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,443
<i>Does that mean that L has
begun to suspect the police?</i>

266
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,449
<i>He must need quite a large number
of people to investigate them.</i>

267
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,285
<i>Even if he had
50 people investigating...</i>

268
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,789
<i>there is no chance that
I'd be suspected of being Kira.</i>

269
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,834
<i>I should seem like an ordinary
high school student.</i>

270
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,004
<i>But, if I leave it alone
for several months,</i>

271
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,799
<i>that possibility won't remain at zero.</i>

272
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,802
<i>I have to learn my shadow's name.</i>

273
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,680
<i>When I find that out,
I can get rid of him...</i>

274
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:38,975
Light...

275
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,019
I'll let you in on something good...

276
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,855
There are two big differences
between...

277
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,651
Shinigami and humans
who have a Death Note.

278
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:54,991
Do you know why Shinigami have to
write peoples' names in the Death Note?

279
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,326
How would I know that?

280
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,997
You're really talkative today, Ryuk.

281
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,001
It's because Shinigami receive
the human's remaining life span from them.

282
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,628
"Receive their remaining life span"?

283
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,507
Let's say that there's a person who
will live 'til 60 in the Human World.

284
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,343
You write that he'll die
at forty in the Death Note.

285
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,389
Sixty minus forty equals twenty.

286
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:23,853
Those twenty years in the Human World
are added on to a Shinigami's life span.

287
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,690
As long as we don't slack off,

288
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:32,236
even if we're shot in the head
or stabbed in the heart with a knife,

289
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,988
Shinigami will not die.

290
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,242
But, no matter how many names
you write in the Death Note,

291
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,411
your life span will not lengthen.

292
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,707
That's the difference between Shinigami
and humans who have a Death Note.

293
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,542
Hmm...

294
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,503
To humans, that's very kind
of the Shinigami.

295
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,213
That's kinda interesting.

296
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:56,093
The second difference might even be
more interesting to you.

297
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,389
Instead of lengthening life,
it's about cutting it short.

298
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,516
Cutting it short?

299
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,856
When a Shinigami sees a person's face,
they know their name.

300
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,025
Do you know why?

301
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,402
A Shinigami's eyes...

302
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:19,533
...can see a human's name and lifespan above
their heads when we look at you.

303
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,244
Name... and lifespan?

304
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,039
LIGHT YAGAMI

305
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,254
If I convert it to human time,
I'll know how exactly how many years it is.

306
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,800
Of course, I wouldn't tell you even if
you stretched my mouth open...

307
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,595
Even if my mouth is
stretched out as it is.

308
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,101
Shinigami never have
problems knowing

309
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,395
the names of the people they kill.

310
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,817
They also know how much life
they're going to receive.

311
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,944
Our eyes are different.

312
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,280
That's the biggest difference
between you and me.

313
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:05,121
Shinigami can also turn the eyes
of whoever picked up their Death Note

314
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,165
into Shinigami eyes.

315
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,753
But only if a deal is made, one that's
been with us since ancient times.

316
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,630
A deal?

317
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,467
The price for a Shinigami's eyes...

318
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,807
is half of that human's
remaining lifetime.

319
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,352
Half of my remaining lifetime...

320
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,645
Yeah.

321
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,021
In other words,

322
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,316
if you were to live another 50 years,
you'll have 25 years left.

323
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,986
If it was one year more,
you'll have half a year.

324
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,490
And since you're neither
Kira's ally nor L's,

325
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,201
you won't tell me the name
of someone I want to kill,

326
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,453
even if you see their name.

327
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,498
In other words...
I can't count on your help.

328
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,625
Is that what you're trying to say?

329
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,960
Yeah.

330
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,880
It's also part of the Shinigami code.

331
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,674
I'll say this once more.

332
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:03,345
Give me half your remaining life
and I'll give you the Shinigami eyes.

333
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:09,059
If I do that...
I'll know everyone's name.

334
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,314
That will make it easier
to use the Death Note.

335
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,357
So...

336
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,651
Light, what'll it be?

337
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,576
TO BE CONTINUED

338
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:32,416
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

339
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,880
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

340
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,258
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

341
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:46,889
