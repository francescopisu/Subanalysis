1
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,580
You forgot something.

2
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,960
A-As you can see,
I’m just some old man.

3
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,820
Unfortunately, I don’t have
any children, either…

4
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,860
I never said it was yours.

5
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,920
Oh, was it a customer’s?
I will hold it, then…

6
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,670
How about it?

7
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,270
Wanna go somewhere?

8
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,570
It’s a little to early to go to bed…

9
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,870
I’m an early riser… I sleep early.

10
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,740
If you want a prim and proper life,
I have just the place for you.

11
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,080
A hotel where you get three meals
and a bodyguard, all for free.

12
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,150
I’m sure that’s impossible
without a reservation.

13
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,190
I’m talking about
Hotel prison, Teddy Bomber.

14
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,990
I’d rather not, Spike Spiegel.

15
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,960
Oh, you know me?

16
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,970
It’s a popular story among criminals…

17
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,100
…that we never want to be
caught by you, or by Andy.

18
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,760
Andy?

19
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,470
I will fulfill my objective!

20
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,920
It won’t blow up.

21
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,290
I took out the ignition pin.

22
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,370
3 million woolongs,
graciously accepted.

23
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,370
That’s not the only bear.

24
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,780
You’ll die, too.

25
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,680
I love them to death.

26
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,610
Why do you want to
blow stuff up so much?

27
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,580
Ya wanna know?
I am giving a warning.

28
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,550
I am ringing a bell of warning!

29
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,290
All right, be mindful of what I say!

30
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,870
Andy!

31
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,310
Andy?

32
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,140
Call me Wyatt Earp.

33
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,120
You! Teddy Bomber, serial bomber!

34
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,490
Me?!

35
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,890
The fact that you’d plant
a bomb here today was easy…

36
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,460
…for me to figure out after
calculating your criminal cycles.

37
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,160
You don’t think that’s him?

38
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,530
He’s a security guard!

39
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,730
Just look at his face!

40
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,370
In this day and age,
a face means nothing.

41
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,570
Then what is the basis of your theory?!

42
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,810
That is…

43
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,540
…my gut instinct. Yes, inspiration!

44
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,380
Hey, wait!

45
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,290
Wait!

46
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,670
Oh shit!

47
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,170
That’s why I said Teddy Bomber
was that guy, you idiot!

48
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,230
Dangerous!

49
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,290
That was a close one.

50
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,820
Giddyup!

51
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,920
COWBOY FUNK

52
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,370
A horse?

53
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,310
Yeah, a horse.

54
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,310
A horse, huh?

55
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,650
I thought something was
fishy when you said you…

56
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,680
…would nab that guy as
part of your foraging trip.

57
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,910
What do you mean by that?

58
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,150
You used up the food money for
all four of us, didn’t you?

59
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,880
Oh, come on…

60
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,980
What did you use it on?

61
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,120
If you think I’m lying,
explain this on my back!

62
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,660
All right, I hear ya.

63
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,590
—The horse I can believe.
—You can?

64
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,220
But, you have to be more creative
than a cowboy in a cowboy outfit.

65
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,100
Is that the problem?

66
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,970
Now if he was dressed like a samurai…

67
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,900
…that would be more plausible.

68
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,440
Here he is… little Andy!

69
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,610
Little Andy is a guy in the YMCA…

70
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,670
A Christian?

71
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,810
Nope. Young Men’s Cowboy Association!

72
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,050
Oh? Such a thing exists?

73
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,450
But, he got kicked out
soon after joining.

74
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,460
The reason?

75
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,360
Because he caused others trouble!

76
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,590
Of course!

77
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,500
Andy von de Oniyate…
the noble son of Oniyate Ranch.

78
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,330
Hey, he’s pretty cute.

79
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,570
123 cases of property damage. 89 cases
of destruction of public property.

80
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,110
Many, many people injured.

81
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,800
A good match for someone we know.

82
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,870
I told you he existed!

83
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,280
All right, I hear ya.

84
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,580
Any reactions?

85
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,210
<i>None yet.</i>

86
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,660
However…

87
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,960
We can’t let it explode
with all these people around.

88
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,560
<i>His only target is the building.</i>

89
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,500
<i>He’s not one for murder.</i>

90
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,030
You think we can trust him?

91
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,200
<i>Guys like him are often concerned</i>
<i>with their sense of style.</i>

92
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,910
Well, this is the perfect
party to hide yourself…

93
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,880
Did you know that a serial
bomber is gonna come here?

94
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,710
To tell the truth, I didn’t know.

95
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,180
Well, he’s coming.

96
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,790
Hey!

97
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,250
The world is about love and peace!

98
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,720
Yo.

99
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,160
H-How did you know it was me?

100
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,030
This lead the way to its papa.

101
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,440
I think I woulda known in either case.

102
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,600
You guys just don’t quit, do you?

103
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,800
Speak for yourself.

104
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,570
Why do you want to blow
things up so much?

105
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,440
Ya wanna know?

106
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,000
I am giving out a warning.

107
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,850
Listen, in this world,
the root of all evil…

108
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,520
A horse…

109
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,930
A cowboy…

110
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,100
Hey, you! Teddy Bomber!

111
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,400
M-Me?!

112
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640
See, I told you.

113
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,200
Or is it you over there?

114
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,140
Do you have no memory?

115
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,810
We met just yesterday!

116
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,210
I have no recollection.

117
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,650
You!

118
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,820
Um, sir, your horse
is an inconvenience…

119
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,020
It does prove rather troublesome
for our other customers…

120
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,990
Oh! My beloved steed Onyx
is no ordinary horse!

121
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,430
At times, she sets my troubled mind at
ease; at others she is my chess partner.

122
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,920
Like horses play chess!

123
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,760
It doesn’t matter either way…

124
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,430
I detest being ignored!!

125
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,450
What happened to his sense of style?!

126
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,510
Calm down!
I’m telling you to calm down!

127
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,950
Love and peace, man!

128
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,860
Such a lovely horse.

129
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,060
Do you like her?

130
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,330
Would you like to be my escort?

131
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,030
Now, get behind me…

132
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,780
You little!

133
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,600
In my life, I’ve never seen such a…

134
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,430
…tasteless room.

135
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,470
Now, I present you with my
special Son of a Gun Stew.

136
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,010
I’m sure you’ll find
it extremely delicious.

137
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,220
Um… So, why are you a bounty hunter?

138
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,430
If you’re so rich, uh, I mean if you
have so much comfort in your life…

139
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,200
Why… Let’s see…

140
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,170
Because… it suits me.

141
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,830
That feeling a cowboy gets
when he corners a bull.

142
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,010
Oh… but you don’t have to go after
such a dangerous bounty, do you?

143
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,090
I know why nobody wants
to go after Teddy Bomber.

144
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,150
Nobody wants to get a
piece of the explosion!

145
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,820
You think we can worry about that?

146
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,060
Yes! I don’t worry about
things like that!

147
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,590
Once I set my mind on something,
I can see nothing else!

148
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,030
I think I’ve seen this
personality somewhere before…

149
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,370
Oh, nothing…

150
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,430
Now!

151
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,370
Here’s lookin’ at…

152
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,350
…my reflection, kid.

153
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,040
Cheers…

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,190
Hi, I got a souvenir.

155
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,870
Yippie! A souvenir! A souvenir!

156
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,600
I ain’t gonna eat that!

157
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,140
Guess this is for dinner…

158
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,140
I will not eat that!

159
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,040
Your stomach will suffer.

160
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,510
But, what about him
makes you so hotheaded?

161
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,420
They’re too similar.

162
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,720
You know how similar
people hate each other.

163
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,320
What part of me is similar
to that shit-headed idiot?!

164
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,790
The part that makes
you damn troublesome.

165
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,230
Oh, Big Shot has already started.

166
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,800
<i>Well, the last thing we have to tell</i>
<i>you is info about TB, Teddy Bomber.</i>

167
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,210
<i>Can you believe it? We got a message</i>
<i>from him, just for this show!</i>

168
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,610
<i>What? Is that for real?</i>

169
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,370
<i>Um, let’s see…</i>

170
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,940
<i>Warning. “This is for those</i>
<i>that have made fun of me.”</i>

171
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,490
<i>“My next job is your last chance.”</i>

172
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,050
<i>“This time, I’ll blow you up</i>
<i>as well, like fireworks.”</i>

173
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
<i>My, my, he doesn’t sound calm.</i>

174
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,390
<i>“That is, if you know</i>
<i>where I will set up next.”</i>

175
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,520
<i>“Heh, heh, heh.”</i>

176
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,830
<i>“And lastly, I will tell</i>
<i>you my true intent…”</i>

177
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,400
<i>Whoops! Looks like time is up for us.</i>
<i>That’s all for today,</i>

178
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,670
<i>I’m sorry I couldn’t</i>
<i>read all of it, TB.</i>

179
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,640
<i>Well, until next time…</i>

180
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,470
<i>Good luck!</i>

181
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,650
The next one’s in City Hall…

182
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,120
You figured it out already?

183
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,620
TB is blowing up tall buildings
starting with the tallest one…

184
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,620
The reason was that simple?

185
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,460
What are you gonna do?
I’m getting outta this one!

186
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,920
I’m gonna pass, too.

187
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,930
Spike, what are you going to do?

188
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,590
Like you have to ask?

189
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,100
Late!

190
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,480
Dammit! If they think they can get away
with this, they are sorely mistaken…

191
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,880
You alone?

192
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,080
How dare you take so
much time to get here!

193
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,350
Wait!

194
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,560
Wrong guy…

195
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,120
I have never intended
humans as targets!

196
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,490
But, you guys are different!

197
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,830
Guys like you deserve…

198
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,040
He’s here…

199
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,850
You! It was you!

200
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,650
So you finally remember me.

201
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,820
—You always…
—You always butt in and get in my way!

202
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,790
You’re the one that’s in the way!

203
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,920
Now that I have both of
you here, I will tell you.

204
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,460
The reason why I continue to
blow buildings up. That is because…

205
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,500
Today, we are going to settle
the score once and for all.

206
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,570
What?! That’s my line!

207
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,370
Listen to what I have to say!!

208
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,500
Shut up!

209
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,470
And you are? Who are you?!

210
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,080
C-Can’t you guys put some
effort into your work?!

211
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,090
We have to catch him first!

212
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,750
Wait!

213
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,930
<i>You guys take me too lightly,</i>

214
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,800
<i>That elevator’s doors</i>
<i>will never open again.</i>

215
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,970
<i>And once it starts moving,</i>
<i>that’s the end. It will never stop.</i>

216
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,070
At the top floor, my cute
little bears will greet you.

217
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,250
So, the moment that the elevator
reaches the top floor…

218
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,080
Boom!

219
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,020
<i>Well, live what little you have</i>
<i>of your life left without regret!</i>

220
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,220
<i>Farewell, and good luck.</i>

221
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,870
Rest assured.

222
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,460
I understand…
I know how he does things.

223
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,210
Don’t worry. I know how he does…

224
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,840
This afternoon, I reverted
the secret emergency…

225
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,780
…code that had been changed. Yeah!

226
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,380
<i>I reverted it this afternoon!</i>

227
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,590
Change after change…

228
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,890
…means it’s back to
where it started!!

229
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,560
Stop, you idiot!

230
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,570
What do we do, what do we do?!
Oh, no!!

231
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,050
Wah, stop, shit, it’s too tight!

232
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,450
You are in the way!

233
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,980
What?! Get outta the way, dammit!!

234
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,280
Farewell…

235
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,250
Come to think of it,
they were brave young men…

236
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,370
They’re climbing…
those two monkeys…

237
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,080
They like high places.

238
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,350
So they are similar…

239
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,920
Let’s just go back…

240
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,950
Then I’ll go turn him in.

241
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,360
You don’t even deserve
to be called a cowboy.

242
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,570
I will never forgive you.

243
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,810
Wow!

244
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,550
I lose…

245
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,330
That was some punch!

246
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,990
You are a true cowboy.

247
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,030
As of today, I will
no longer be a cowboy.

248
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,870
This really is a hats-off!

249
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,870
So… what are ya gonna do now?

250
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,470
I will no doubt find
a new way of life…

251
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,150
See you, Space Cowboy!

252
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,330
Well, it was only a rich boy’s hobby.

253
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,960
His level… no… rank…
was really no match for me.

254
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,210
Hey, are ya listening?

255
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,640
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,240
So, he just wasn’t any enemy of mine.

257
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,940
Of course, I never had
him in my line of sight.

258
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,910
—Hey, are ya listening?
—Yeah, yeah.

259
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,860
But anyway…

260
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,990
Why did you want to blow
stuff up so much?

261
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,590
I wanted to give a warning…

262
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,930
…against all the unnecessary waste
created by capitalism lacking philosophy.

263
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,370
Planets that needlessly get colonized.

264
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,340
Media that needlessly get circulated.

265
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,070
And buildings that are needlessly
tall to symbolize all of this!

266
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,640
And by destroying them,
I wanted to raise…

267
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,620
…the question of how
a true pioneer should be.

268
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,050
Wait, wait, wait!

269
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,750
Andy!

270
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,220
Call me… Musashi!

271
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,220
Go, Jiroumaru!

272
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,160
But…

273
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,460
It was all a waste, wasn’t it?

274
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,360
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

275
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,700
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

276
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,400
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

277
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,140
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

278
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:15,390
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

279
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,400
The real folk blues.

280
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:28,810
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

281
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:36,440
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

282
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,940
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

283
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:49,860
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

284
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,860
COMING EPISODE

285
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,640
So, did you pay close attention
to me and my wonderful role?

286
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,680
Hey, wait a minute…

287
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,620
Now, the next episode,
the next story…

288
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,150
Why are you doing the preview?

289
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,120
Once again, it’s time for me, Andy,
to have an active role in the story!

290
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,890
Your turn on the stage is already over!

291
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,890
Now that I’m a space samurai, watch me
completely crush cowboys left and right!

292
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,360
You’re not appearing
in the show anymore!

293
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,020
Next episode of Cowboy Bebop:
“Andy Strikes Back”!

294
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,330
The title is nothing like that!

295
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,880
Please look forward to it!

296
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,890
BRAIN SCRATCH
Please look forward to it!
