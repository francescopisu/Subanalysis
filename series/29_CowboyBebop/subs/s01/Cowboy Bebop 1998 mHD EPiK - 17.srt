1
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,200
This was the most
special of the special.

2
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,270
It was an emergency ration
for true emergencies…

3
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,900
…that was saved for the
last of the last resorts.

4
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,860
All I’m asking is who ate this.

5
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,970
Grudges over food sure are scary.

6
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,780
Spike, by perchance, was it you?

7
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,410
If I was the culprit, I wouldn’t leave
the empty box lying around like that.

8
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,350
Ed is hungry.

9
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,450
Maybe you ate it yourself,
but are pretending…

10
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,650
…to be upset because
we found the empty box?

11
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,060
What?!

12
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,030
We haven’t had anything to
eat for two whole days!!

13
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,230
Don’t you call a situation
like this an emergency?!

14
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,400
I wanna eat stuff like
fried beefun noodles…

15
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,570
We’re outta gas!
We can’t do anything about it!

16
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,470
If you could hold out
like this a bit longer…

17
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,910
…we’ll reach Europa soon
thanks to inertia.

18
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,640
Tummy’s caving in!

19
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,640
If only we could use that
energy to propel ourselves…

20
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,450
You keep mouthing off like that and
I’ll toss you out into absolute zero.

21
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,420
And a stir-fry of liver and
chives would be good, too…

22
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,790
Sounds good.

23
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,280
At least it’s better than aimlessly
floating around this place.

24
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,920
That was some collision…

25
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,150
Hey! Can you hear me? Answer me! Hey!!

26
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,190
Isn’t this…

27
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,630
…a hit-and-run?!

28
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,870
This is bad! The shock from that
collision changed our trajectory!

29
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,140
What did what to who?

30
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,410
What’s going on?!

31
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,800
MUSHROOM SAMBA

32
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,710
Huh?

33
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,090
Wow… Where is this place?

34
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,490
This is so uncivilized!

35
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,680
I don’t think that’s our problem…

36
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,160
We have to start by checking the ship.

37
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,030
Can you go get some food?

38
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,660
What?

39
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,630
I suddenly feel… a stabbing pain…

40
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,360
What are you trying to pull?

41
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,540
This expired a year ago…

42
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,780
I’m glad I didn’t eat it.

43
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,380
Serves you right.
This is divine retribution!

44
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,490
Let’s get to it…

45
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,030
Whatcha gonna do?

46
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,940
Ed will help, too!

47
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,940
We’re fine here, so go outside
and find us some food.

48
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,740
Okay!

49
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,780
Gotta wear my socks…

50
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,620
…to go out, to go out…

51
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,480
Nothing here…

52
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,360
It’s that hit-and-run ship!

53
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,100
Wait, wait!

54
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,100
Wait, wait!!

55
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,060
Wait, wait!!!

56
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,170
Smell…

57
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,510
Smell… food…

58
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,660
Food!

59
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,490
Gimme!

60
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,630
1,000 woolongs each, including tax.

61
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,800
Cash only. No money cards
or cash cards allowed.

62
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,530
I don’t have money.

63
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,410
Then hurry home, kid.

64
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,650
Can I have one?

65
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,560
1,000 woolongs each.
Cash only. Cards are…

66
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,820
Kid, no use staring.

67
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,230
If you want food,
go someplace like the town.

68
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,460
I don’t need change.

69
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,760
In exchange…

70
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,900
If you see this man, gimme a call.

71
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,910
Thanks!

72
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,680
Excuse us.

73
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,060
We would like to check your baggage.

74
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,390
Something wrong?

75
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,450
Apparently, a broker on
the wanted list for…

76
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,790
…illegal mushroom sales
made a getaway to this town.

77
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,090
What a coincidence.

78
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,290
I’m after that bounty as well.

79
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,890
A cowboy?

80
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,460
We’re gonna check out your trunk.

81
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,200
Go ahead, feel free.

82
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,310
Hey!

83
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,500
All right! Freeze!

84
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,640
—Now, wait a minute…
—All right, stay still…

85
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,940
—I don’t know anything about this!
—Turn around! Hands on the ground!

86
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,970
—What are you doing?!
—Now put your hands on the ground!

87
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,540
—Let go of me!!
—Hurry up!

88
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,610
Food, food, do you have any?

89
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,650
Oh, you don’t? Oh, you do?

90
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,520
Boy, am I hungry…

91
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,770
Meanie!

92
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,040
What?

93
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,070
Gimme!

94
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,140
Gimme something!

95
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,380
Dammit, stop hanging all over me!

96
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,780
Hey!

97
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,290
I won’t let you tell me you
forgot who I am, Domino!

98
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,550
Let’s see…

99
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,220
Come on! Remember, dammit!

100
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,460
I’m the younger of the Shaft brothers
that bought mushrooms from you!

101
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,020
I really can’t recall…

102
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,730
You do want to know why I drag an
empty coffin around like this, don’t you?

103
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,670
It’s because…

104
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,470
…I’m going to go home after
putting your corpse inside…

105
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,080
Pieces… All in pieces!

106
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,450
What was what to who?

107
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,080
My big bro ate a mushroom
he bought from you…

108
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,250
…and laughed and laughed,
and twisted his intestines to death!

109
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,760
A happy way to die.

110
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,120
Shut up!

111
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,290
Speaking of which,
it’s all your fault!

112
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,350
That’s what I call
an unjust resentment!

113
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,230
Ed is hungry, too!

114
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,120
Take this!

115
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,970
Wait, you bastard! Dammit!

116
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,240
Food!

117
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,040
Aah! Don’t, Ein! We have to share!

118
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,020
Ein?

119
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,820
Bad mushroom?

120
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,320
This for real?

121
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,560
Delicious!

122
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,930
This really can’t be happening.

123
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,270
Really…

124
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,680
This really has no way of happening.

125
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,910
Hey… You know, the world
really is a great place…

126
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,550
Did I just say something?

127
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,700
Hey, mister.

128
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,660
This is a stairway to heaven.
You know that, right?

129
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,900
An obnoxious little frog…

130
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,570
I don’t care anymore.
I warned you!

131
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,630
Yeah, yeah, that’s it.

132
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,610
I now know the secrets of the universe.

133
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,580
By the way…

134
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,420
…who was I?

135
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,860
So these mushrooms are
inedible after all…

136
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,960
<i>So, as you can tell, it’s time</i>
<i>for another episode of Big Shot!</i>

137
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,830
<i>We’ll introduce you to more</i>
<i>and more bounties this week!</i>

138
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,530
<i>So, batting first for us today…</i>

139
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,370
<i>… is this man, Domino Walker.</i>

140
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,210
<i>He’s currently wanted for</i>
<i>selling illegal mushrooms.</i>

141
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,610
—That’s the guy we just saw!
<i>—The bounty is a conservative 1.2 mil.</i>

142
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,740
That’s cowgirl, Ein.

143
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,340
We earn money, and buy food!

144
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,360
Ein, you’re a cow-woofwoof!

145
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,520
Here we go!

146
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,290
One!

147
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,030
Two!

148
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,760
Five!

149
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,630
Four!

150
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,930
Hello!

151
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,670
Hey, don’t underestimate the police!

152
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,710
I really don’t know anything!

153
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:29,280
Then why did you have a strange kid
and a dog in the trunk of your car?!

154
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,480
Hello… Yes?

155
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,890
Oh, it’s you, Sally.
Really… You’re so hopeless…

156
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,620
I told you so many times
not to call me at work…

157
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,530
And? Yeah yeah, and that’s it?

158
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,230
I mean, I didn’t mean it that
way when I said “that’s it?”…

159
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,570
Yeah, yeah, like that.
I love you, Sally.

160
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,870
Got it. Tonight at 7 it is. Bye-bye!

161
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,810
Hey!

162
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,390
What’s wrong, young’un?
Lookin’ like that…

163
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,860
Did your woman run off without you?

164
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,950
What to say…

165
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,620
None of your business, old geezers.

166
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,170
Oh, man… that’s for
eating all at once.

167
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,800
They say when you’re in
a hurry, go around.

168
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,040
Is that right?

169
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,540
He’s not here…

170
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,990
Aah! That hit-and-run ship!

171
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,240
I’m sure they never even dreamed
that I was raising these in here.

172
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,540
This one’s bad.

173
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,810
Well, making an emergency landing here
was the only miscalculation I had.

174
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,110
Were you surprised?

175
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,670
I was.

176
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,980
What the hell are you guys?

177
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,210
Why are you here?

178
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,190
That’s my line!

179
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,620
How did you get in here
in the first place?

180
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,950
—The door was open.
—Is that so?!

181
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,920
Culprit of the hit-and-run,
prepare to get arrested!

182
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,190
Stink bug gas!

183
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,360
Wait, wait, wait!

184
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,180
Don’t think that you
can get away from me!

185
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,830
Don’t get in my way!

186
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,850
Ein! Growl!

187
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,640
C-Come on! Let go of me!

188
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,890
Boo!

189
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,880
Gotcha!

190
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,170
W-Wait…

191
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,870
T-These mushrooms are
worth 100,000 each.

192
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,510
Let me go, and I’ll give them to you.

193
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,350
Why?

194
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,610
Think about which one is worth more.

195
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,750
I dunno.

196
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,350
A-Are you an idiot?!

197
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,750
Take the mushrooms!

198
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,990
Okay!

199
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,560
“Thanks”

200
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,400
“Oh, it’s no problem”

201
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,650
Yahoo! Dinner! Mushroom!

202
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,630
100,000 each? Really?

203
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,220
That sure would make some money.

204
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,730
These are real?

205
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,750
Excuse me.

206
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,600
I’m with the police.

207
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,230
I want to ask a few questions about
Domino, an illegal mushroom dealer.

208
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,940
Unfortunately, we have no clue.

209
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,210
I’m so sorry we can’t be of any help.

210
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,150
Ed knows who that… Mmf!

211
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,710
Don’t mind her…

212
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,910
In exchange, I got… Mmgh!

213
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,360
—Really…
—She’s a troublesome kid…

214
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,820
Excuse me, sir.

215
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,140
They’re okay.

216
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,740
He must really like shiitake mushrooms.

217
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,850
Well, sorry to bother you.

218
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,620
Here’s dinner.

219
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,130
What’s the menu?

220
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:47,900
Shiitake stir-fry, shiitake stew,
shiitake salad, and a shiitake dessert.

221
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,900
Yaaaaaay!

222
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,060
Again? How many days has it been?

223
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,070
No… I can’t eat anymore.

224
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,600
Quit complaining, and be
thankful that we can even eat!

225
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,840
Thankful!

226
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,030
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

227
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:31,370
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

228
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:37,070
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

229
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:43,810
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

230
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:53,060
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

231
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,070
The real folk blues.

232
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:06,480
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

233
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:14,110

235
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:27,530

236
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,150
COMING EPISODE

237
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,080
A videotape that was delivered to
the Bebop with no return address.

238
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,420
Because we wanted to view the tape,
things took a turn for the unexpected.

239
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,590
No, actually it doesn’t go anywhere.

240
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,600
At first glance,
the story is pointless…

241
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,100
…the actions are on a small scale…

242
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,260
…and the ending is forced…

243
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,000
…but what will you get out of it all?

244
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,730
Next episode: “Speak like a Child”.

245
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,180
At first glance, it’s interesting.

246
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,140
SPEAK LIKE A CHILD
At first glance, it’s interesting.

247
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,180
SPEAK LIKE A CHILD
