00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,338
[ Man ]
We're all just floating.

4
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,555
[ Kaylee ]
You couldn't possibly.

5
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:32,557
[ Simon ]
No. I wish I was lying.

6
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,992
I just,you know,
we'd all just made surgeon.

7
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:38,326
That was it.
We were the elite.

8
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:41,798
- The world was ours, you know.
- So you had to be naked?

9
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,802
Naked, yes.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:49,035
- And on top of the statue of Hippocrates.
- [ Laughs ]

11
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:52,009
- Can you just picture me?
- What, naked?

12
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:56,174
Uh, hmm, let's see.
I'm gonna have to conjure up, uh--

13
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:58,547
Yeah, that's,
that's gonna be difficult.

00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:00,950
[ Laughing ]

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,116
- So did the feds come?
- There were no feds...

16
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,352
until I started singing.

17
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:09,553
- Oh, no!
- No. This is not--

18
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:11,358
What did you sing?

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,364
This is not funny. This--

20
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:17,459
This is a morality tale
about the evils of sake.

21
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:23,036
I would be there right now.

22
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:27,704
I mean, it was, it was--

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,308
It was either that
or the national anthem. Reports vary.

24
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,546
[ Kaylee ]
You don't remember any of this?

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,989
I remember talking the feds
out of telling my father...

26
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,652
or paying the feds
out of telling my father.

27
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,992
- I get fuzzy on the aspects.
- [ Kaylee Laughing ]

28
00:01:55,408 --> 00:02:00,277
- So, like, never?
- Well, no.

29
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:02,837
Not ever, never?

30
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,076
Some orders allow shepherds
to marry...

31
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:10,020
but I follow a narrower path.

32
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,887
But I mean, you still got the urge.
They don't...

33
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,893
cut it off or nothin'.

34
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:19,022
No. I'm more or less intact.

35
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,362
I just direct my energy elsewhere.

36
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:24,597
You mean like masturbatin'?

37
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,730
I hope you're not thinking
of taking orders yourself.

38
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:29,775
[ Laughs ]
That'll be the day.

39
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:33,710
I got stupid.
The money was too good.

40
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,907
I don't give half a hump
if you're innocent or not.

41
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,747
So where does that put you?

42
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,653
- [ Laughing ]
- Saint Jayne. It's got a ring to it.

43
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:47,124
I'm just trying to remember
how many miracles you've performed.

44
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:50,060
I once hit a guy in the neck
from 500 yards with a bent scope.

45
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,156
- Don't that count upstairs?
- Oh, it'll be taken into consideration.

46
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,929
You made that sound
kind of ominous.

47
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,997
I put out a few waves
to some old acquaintances.

48
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:39,602
I may even be able to find something
in New Melbourne if you need the shuttle free.

49
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,612
I'm just gonna be there long enough
to pick up cargo.

50
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,614
The only thing you're gonna find
in New Melbourne...

51
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,650
is fish and fish-related activities...

52
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,652
so unless you got the overwhelming urge
to gut sturgeon...

53
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,654
and who hasn't occasionally--

54
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,657
But it's a layover point for almost
every planet this side of the system.

55
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:54,659
I could--

56
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:56,661
I just don't wanna draw this out.

57
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,663
Have you decided when
you're gonna tell the others?

58
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:01,427
I--

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,832
No.

60
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:06,804
- I appreciate your not saying anything.
- Well, I don't.

61
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,170
So make up your mind.

62
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:11,573
I'm a big girl.
Just tell me.

63
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:14,909
None of it means a damn thing.

64
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:44,737
It's just an object.

65
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,108
It doesn't mean what you think.

66
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:51,308
- You know that's not to be touched.
- Stay calm. Stop yelling at her.

67
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:54,409
[ Mal ] River, sweetheart, you want nothin'
to do with that. Put it down.

68
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,422
- Kaylee.
- What were you thinking?
Where did you get ahold--

69
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,857
- It was in my hand.
- I'm not mad. Just let me-- Thank you.

70
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:07,494
Fully loaded, safety off.
This here is a recipe for unpleasantness.

71
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:11,229
- Does she understand that?
- She understands.

72
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:13,237
She doesn't comprehend.

73
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:15,705
Well, I'm glad we've
made that distinction.

74
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,107
No touching guns, okay?

75
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:21,339
No touching.

76
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:25,406
- River--
- It's getting very, very crowded!

77
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:27,748
I thought she was on the med.

78
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,754
Her medications are erratic.

79
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:33,155
There's not one that her system
can't eventually break down and--

80
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:36,956
When I want a lot of medical jargon,
I'll talk to a doctor.

81
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:39,554
You are talking to a doctor.

82
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:43,432
Yeah, okay. My point is it could've
been you she might've shot just then--

83
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:45,470
the doctor,
as you just made note of.

84
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,565
And who exactly could fix you?
Not nobody.

85
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:52,270
We're deep in space,
corner of No and Where.

86
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:54,812
You take extra care with her...

87
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,871
'cause we're very much alone out here.

00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:12,026
~ Take me where I cannot stand ~

00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:14,861
~ I don't care, I'm still free ~

00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:19,132
~ You can't take the sky from me ~

92
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:21,799
~ Take me out to the black ~

93
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:24,434
~ Tell them I ain't comin'back ~

94
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:28,206
~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~

95
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,977
~ You can't take the sky from me ~

96
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,589
~ There's no place I can be ~

97
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,995
~ Since I've found serenity ~

98
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:50,558
~ But you can't take the sky from me ~~

99
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:29,631
Little River just gets more colorful
by the moment. What'll she do next?

100
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,006
Either blow us all up
or rub soup in our hair.

101
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,545
- It's a toss-up.
- I hope she does the soup thing.

102
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:37,275
It's always a hoot,
and we don't all die from it.

103
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:41,479
- Poor kid.
- Yeah. She's definitely got--

104
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,953
- Funny.
- Something wrong?

105
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:46,218
I'm just getting a weird heat bounce
off our wake.

106
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,783
- Engine flux?
- Sensors probably got turned around.

107
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:52,319
Those lockers are sealed. Only way she can
get in there is if she knows the combination.

108
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:54,491
I don't leave my guns around, Mal,
and I don't leave 'em loaded.

109
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,727
Well, somehow, she got her hands
on your hardware.

110
00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:59,600
Now, supposing she took up
something with hull-piercing bullets.

111
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:02,937
Bullets are soft lead, Mal. Even Vera
could barely breach the hull.

112
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:05,033
She's the best I got.

113
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,170
Anyhow, let's move this conversation
in a "notJayne's fault" direction.

114
00:08:08,247 --> 00:08:11,546
I didn't make her crazy. Hell,
I didn't even want her on the ship.

115
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:16,283
Is that the direction you want
this conversation to go in?

116
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:18,915
Just don't want to take a lashing
for something I ain't the cause of.

117
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,686
[ Zoe ]
Where's River at now?

118
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,217
In her room, which I'm thinking
we bolt from the outside from now on.

119
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,389
That's a little extreme, isn't it?

120
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:30,265
- Anybody remember her coming at me
with a butcher's knife?
- Wacky fun.

121
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:33,305
- You wanna go, little man?
- Only if it's someplace with candlelight.

122
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:35,602
Sir, I know she's unpredictable,
but I don't think she'd harm anyone.

123
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:38,575
- [Jayne ] Butcher's knife.
- Anyone we can't spare.

124
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,942
As far as we know, the girl's never even
picked up a gun before.

125
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:43,914
[ Kaylee ]
That ain't so.

126
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:49,045
Kaylee,you got somethin'to say?

127
00:09:55,954 --> 00:10:00,050
[ Mal ] Okay, Kaylee,
why don't you speak your piece?

128
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,617
It was when the captain and Wash
got took by Niska.

129
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:06,892
I ain't likely to forget that
anytime soon.

130
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:10,662
Well, we all went in--
me too--

131
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,829
Didn't make much account
of myself, I'm afraid.

132
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:16,238
I got no problem with the notion
of you not killing nobody, Kaylee.

133
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:18,868
What's this got to do with River?
She wasn't even in that fight.

134
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:22,675
Well, no, she was.
I got pinned down...

135
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:26,479
and there were three guys
and I couldn't--

136
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,453
And then River comes up.

137
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:34,549
She looks out, sees 'em all--

138
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:37,561
And they was spread out,
you know, had some cover.

139
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:43,329
She-- She only looked for a second
and... took my gun...

140
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:45,666
closed her eyes...

141
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:48,171
killed 'em.

142
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,142
- She shot them?
- All three.

143
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:57,376
Dead. In an instant.
With her eyes still closed.

144
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,383
That's-- [ Chinese ].
You saw it wrong.

145
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:03,854
Not a jot. And it weren't
auto fire or luck.

146
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,446
She just--

147
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:10,757
- She just did the math.
- You understand how that sounds?

148
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:13,627
What? She killed 'em with mathematics.
What else could it have been?

149
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:17,635
You couldn't have done it,
Jayne, nor you, Cap'n.

150
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:19,898
Nobody can shoot like that
that's a person.

151
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:23,264
So River's not a person.

152
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,841
[ Kaylee ]
Oh, please don't be mad.

153
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:29,847
[ Simon ] I just want
to understand what you're saying here.

154
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:32,406
- I thought River was your friend.
- She is.

155
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,647
But, Simon, the way she--

156
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:38,485
Right after,
she looked at me and...

157
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:41,048
she smiled...

158
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:43,617
like nothing was wrong.

159
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:46,459
Like we were playing.

160
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,827
Scared me.

161
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:54,065
Could be she
saved your life, Kaylee.

162
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,573
Oh, I'm all aware of that,
and I'm not saying--

163
00:11:56,642 --> 00:12:00,100
She probably didn't even know what was going on.
Thought it was a game.

164
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,772
Later on you can explain to me
how that's a comfort.

165
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,373
Might have to use some of that
math we've been hearing about.

00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:52,575
Cleaned up after.

509
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:55,616
Shined and polished.

510
00:36:55,683 --> 00:36:59,585
Everything in here gleams.

511
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:02,521
Well, I'll be a son of a whore.

512
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,582
You're not in my gorram mind.
You're on my gorram ship!

513
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,256
[ Laughing ]

514
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:13,767
It's very interesting,
all these buttons.

515
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:17,566
Okay! We're not
touching those, okay?

516
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,039
- How the hell did she get on my ship?
- Put the gun away.

517
00:37:20,108 --> 00:37:23,669
Okay. I'm putting it away.

518
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:28,045
No, he's not.

519
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:32,450
I'm putting it away
because we're all reasonable people.

520
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,750
Don't want to be
doing anything rash...

521
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,790
fiddling with any dials.

522
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:39,258
You're not right, Early.

523
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:43,461
You're not righteous.
You've got issues.

524
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:46,364
No. Or yes.

525
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:49,926
I could have that.
You might have me figured out then.

526
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:52,871
Good job.
I'm not a hundred percent.

527
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:57,742
- You talk too much.
- I'm flawed in that way. I sometimes go on.

528
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:00,406
- It's been said--
- It's okay, Early.

529
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:05,912
- I'm going with you.
- River, what are you--

530
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:11,054
Don't belong.
Dangerous like you.

531
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:15,127
Can't be controlled.

532
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:17,255
Can't be trusted.

533
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:23,069
Everyone could just go on without me
and not just have to worry.

534
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:27,768
People could be
what they wanted to be...

535
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:31,903
could be with
the people they wanted.

536
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:35,277
Could live simple.

537
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,978
No secrets.

538
00:38:39,387 --> 00:38:43,687
- No.
- I'll be fine.

539
00:38:46,394 --> 00:38:50,854
I'll be your bounty, Jubal Early...

540
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:53,298
and I'll just fade away.

541
00:38:55,103 --> 00:38:59,767
Well, finally something
goes according to--

542
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,009
Simon?

543
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:07,780
[ Screams ]

544
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:19,789
See? That's what it feels like.

545
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,828
Just hang tight, darlin'.
Early's on the move.

546
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:54,193
[ River ]
Shh. It's okay.

547
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,335
You made the right move, darlin'.

548
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:14,245
Best for you to go on with ol' Early.

549
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,844
You think so?
Some of us feel differently.

550
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:51,876
Permission to come aboard?

551
00:40:53,054 --> 00:40:55,887
You know, you ain't quite right.

552
00:40:57,492 --> 00:40:59,619
It's the popular theory.

553
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:01,924
Go on, get in there.

554
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:04,430
Give your brother a thrashing
for messing up your plan.

555
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:07,297
He takes so much looking after.

556
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:12,672
To the left.

557
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,708
Your left.

558
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:18,267
Okay, now, very gently,
pull that aside.

559
00:41:18,346 --> 00:41:21,645
This is really not
my area of expertise, Doctor.

560
00:41:21,716 --> 00:41:25,914
I tend to be putting these into people
more than the other thing.

561
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:29,514
Can I mop your brow? I am at the ready
with the fearsome brow mop.

562
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,320
- You got the bullet.
- [ Grunts ]

563
00:41:32,393 --> 00:41:36,989
Okay, I'm just gonna pass out
for a minute, but you're doing great.

564
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:40,467
And we live to fight another day.

565
00:41:40,535 --> 00:41:43,629
Any chance that-- [ Chinese ]
might survive?

566
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:48,198
Air he had left, I'd say his chance
would be about one in...

567
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:50,335
a very large number.

568
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:52,709
Ain't odds I'd play.

569
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,805
How's your lip?

570
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:04,358
- [ Book ] I just feel such a fool.
- [Jayne ] Yeah.

571
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:06,620
All them years of priest training...

572
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:08,662
and taken out
by one bounty hunter.

573
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:11,994
Don't get me wrong.
I gave him a hell of a fight.

574
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:15,900
- Epic, I'm guessing.
- They're be poems and songs.

575
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:20,737
-Just you wait.
- At least you got some play.
I missed every damn thing.

576
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:24,005
[ Kaylee ]
And then his folks come by to fetch him...

577
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:27,377
and it turns out
he's, like, 14 years old.

578
00:42:27,448 --> 00:42:29,382
[ Laughing ]

579
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,816
I mean, he must've been
some kind of genetic experiment...

580
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:34,013
'cause I swear this guy was, uh--

581
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:37,023
[ Sighs ]
Oh, my daddy whupped me so hard.

582
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:38,718
Oh.

583
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:41,853
Well, I'm at fours.
Let's see you match that.

584
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:47,057
I can win this.

585
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:51,833
I'm hearing a lot of talk there, genius.
Come on. Show me what you got.

586
00:43:14,996 --> 00:43:18,329
Well, here I am.

587
00:43:56,971 --> 00:43:59,906
Grr! Arrgh!
