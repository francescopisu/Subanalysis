00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:27,829
01 Firefly The Train Job - Episode 01 2002 English

2
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,450
Your move.

3
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,880
- That's a bold move.
- I live on the edge.

4
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,890
Nice work, dumb-ass.

5
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,140
I've given thought
to moving off the edge.

6
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,180
Not an ideal location.

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
- Make it a place in the middle.
- A toast!

8
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,400
Toast!

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,520
Quiet!

10
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,030
Shut up!

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,740
I'm... I got words.

12
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,750
I'm saying, this is an auspicious day.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,910
We all know what day it is.

14
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,790
Suspicious. What day is it?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,010
A glorious day for all the proud members
of the allied planets.

16
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,840
Unification Day!

17
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,380
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,890
The end of the scum bag independents
and the dawn of a new galaxy.

19
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,470
Yeah!

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,520
Captain.

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,190
Just feel the need for another drink.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,070
What month is it?

23
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,410
Hey, you gonna drink
to the Alliance with me?

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,250
Six years today, the Alliance
sent the brown coats running...

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,790
pissing their pants.

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,090
You know, your coat is kind
of a brownish colour.

27
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,630
It was on sale.

28
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,510
You didn't toast.

29
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,390
You know, I'm thinking
you're one of them independents.

30
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,560
I'm thinking you weren't burdened
with an over abundance of schooling.

31
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,270
Why don't we just ignore
each other till we go away?

32
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,440
The independents were a bunch
of cowardly, inbred piss pots.

33
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,160
Should have been killed off
of every world spinning.

34
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,660
Share that to my face.

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,960
I said, you're a coward
and a piss pot.

36
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,130
- Now, what are you gonna do about it?
- Nothing.

37
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,800
I wanted you to face me
so she could get behind you.

38
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,850
Drugs are so cute.

39
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,570
- Jane.
- Hey, I didn't fight no war.

40
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,280
Best of luck, though.

41
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,740
Fine.

42
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,660
Let's do this.

43
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,870
Wash, we got some
local colour happening.

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,750
A grand entrance would not go amiss.

45
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,270
Is Jane even awake?

46
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

47
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,830
Ha, ha! Ha, ho, ho, ho.

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,460
There's just an acre of you fellows,
isn't there?

49
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,290
This is why we lost, you know.
Superior numbers.

50
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,460
Thanks for the re-enactment, sir.

51
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,090
Hey, hey, them ain't kosherized rules.

52
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,010
I'm thinking somebody needs
to put you down, dog.

53
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,430
What do you think?

54
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,640
I'm thinking we'll rise again.

55
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:37,820
Every man there, go back inside or we
will blow a new crater in this little moon.

56
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Damn yokels can't even tell a
transport ship ain't got no guns on it.

57
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,840
Blow a new crater in this moon.

58
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,680
My thanks, Wash.

59
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,970
- Nice save, as always.
- A pleasure.

60
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,390
- And how are our passengers?
- They're fine.

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,690
So, what happened?
Was there a terrible brawl?

62
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,070
- There was.
- Are you getting my wife into trouble?

63
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,990
What...? I didn't start it.
Just wanted a quiet drink.

64
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,320
Funny how you always find yourself
in an Alliance-friendly bar...

65
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,870
come U-day, looking for a quiet drink.

66
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,830
This is another sign of your tragic space
dementia, all paranoid and crotchety.

67
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,540
Breaks a heart.

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,580
Did we at least make a contact?

69
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,630
Ladies and menfolk,
we have ourselves a job.

70
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,220
Take us out of the world, Wash.

71
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,470
We got us some crime to be done.

72
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,390
River.

73
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
River, it's okay.

74
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,970
It's me.

75
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,890
You know who I am?

76
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,650
Simon.

77
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,190
Were you dreaming?

78
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,490
- Did you dream about the Academy?
- It's not relevant.

79
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,660
If you can talk about
what happened there...

80
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,630
I know it's hard, but the more I know,
the faster you'll get better.

81
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,590
This isn't home.

82
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,130
No.

83
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,720
No, we can't go home.

84
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,890
If we go home, they'll just
send you back to the Academy.

85
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,850
This is safer now.

86
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,150
We're on a ship.

87
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,150
Mid-bulk transport.

88
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,160
Standard radian accelerator core,
class code 03-K64.

89
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,910
- Firefly.
- Well, that's something.

90
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,500
I can't even remember all that.

91
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,130
- You need a weave on that?
- It's nothing.

92
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,720
I expect there's someone's face
feels differently.

93
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,930
They tell you, never hit a man
with a closed fist...

94
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,970
but it is, on occasion, hilarious.

95
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,810
I suppose so.

96
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,900
So the fight didn't draw any attention?

97
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,770
No Feds.
Just an honest brawl between folk.

98
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,900
None of us want the Alliance on us,
doctor. That's why you're here.

99
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,530
I thought I was here
because you needed a medic.

100
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,120
Well, not today.

101
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,620
Mal.

102
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,710
Bad...

103
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
in the Latin.

104
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,590
- Shepherd Book.
- Captain.

105
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,340
How's the girl?

106
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,180
Still a little whimsical in the brain pan.
Seems calm enough, though.

107
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,560
- That young man's very brave.
- Yeah.

108
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,360
He's my hero.

109
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,820
He gave up everything to free
his sister from that place.

110
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,360
Go from being a doctor
on the central planets...

111
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,700
to hiding on the fringes
of the system.

112
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,740
- There's not many would do that.
- I suppose not.

113
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,620
There's not many
would take him in, either.

114
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,920
Why did you?

115
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,960
Same reason I took you on board,
Shepherd. I need the fare.

116
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,840
Neither of us can pay a tenth of what
your crew makes on one of your jobs.

117
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,930
Are you referring to our legitimate
business enterprises?

118
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm wondering why a man so anxious...

119
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,640
to fly under Alliance radar
would house known fugitives.

120
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,270
The Alliance had her in that institution
for a purpose, whatever it was.

121
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,940
And they will want her back.

122
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,900
You're not overly fond of the boy.
So why risk it?

123
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,900
Because it's the right thing to do.

124
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,610
Oh, would you look at this.

125
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,780
Kaylee!

126
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,540
I'm wondering if you know
why you're doing it.

127
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,870
What about you? How come
you're flying about with us brigands?

128
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,750
Shouldn't you be off bringing religiosity
to the fuzzy-wuzzies or some such?

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,840
Oh, I got heathens aplenty right here.

130
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,630
If I'm your mission, Shepherd,
best give it up.

131
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,100
You're welcome on my boat.

132
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,600
God ain't.

133
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,430
Where the hell's that girl?

134
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,160
- Do you want me to put it up?
- No, that's okay.

135
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,830
You have such lovely hair.

136
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,580
I'm sure the doctor would agree.

137
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,200
Who, Simon?

138
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,870
He's much too...
I mean, I'm just...

139
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,500
- Do you think it looks better up?
- We could experiment.

140
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,300
We might even get wild later
and wash your face.

141
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,720
You ever do this for your clients?

142
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,640
Very occasionally. Not all of them
have enough hair to get a brush through.

143
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,810
Have you ever had to service a really
hideous client? With boils and the like?

144
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,400
A companion chooses her own clients.
That's Guild law.

145
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,780
But physical appearance
doesn't matter so terribly.

146
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,240
You look for compatibility of spirit.

147
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,330
There's an energy about a person that's
difficult to hide. You try to feel that...

148
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,200
Then you try to feel
the energy of their credit account.

149
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,370
It has a sort of aura.

150
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
What did I say to you
about barging in?

151
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,420
- That it was manly and impulsive?
- Yes, precisely.

152
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,760
Only the exact phrase
I used was, Don't.

153
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,260
You're holding my
mechanic enthralled.

154
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,430
Kaylee, what's going on
in the engine room?

155
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,930
Were there monkeys? Some terrifying
space monkeys maybe got loose?

156
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,350
I rewired the graph thrust. Somebody
won't replace that compression coil.

157
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,060
Get the place squared away.
It's dangerous in there.

158
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,270
And I ain't paying you
to get your hair played at.

159
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,530
We work before we play.

160
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,200
- You're servicing crew now?
- In your lonely, pathetic dreams.

161
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,910
What do you want?

162
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,960
- May have a job.
- Congratulations.

163
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,670
On a decently civilised planet where
I could screen some respectable clients?

164
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,380
Respectable clients,
that seems a contradiction.

165
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,340
Don't start.

166
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
There's...

167
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,520
We haven't got a location yet.

168
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,480
We'll be landing on a skyplex in a bit,
run by a fellow called Niska.

169
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,940
- Never heard of him.
- Well, I have.

170
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,700
While we're there,
you'll stay confined to the ship.

171
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,280
Is the petty criminal ashamed
to be riding with a companion?

172
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,160
This guy has a very unlovely rep.
He's got work for me, fine.

173
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,000
But I don't...

174
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
I'm not sure you'd be safe.

175
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,800
Mal, if you're being a gentleman,
I may die of shock.

176
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,760
- Have you got time to do my hair?
- Out.

177
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Is fine. Crow, they can come in.

178
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,250
- And Malcolm Reynolds is which?
- I'm Capt.. Reynolds.

179
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,470
- My first mate Zoe. This is Jane.
- Very nice.

180
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,680
I am Adelai Niska.

181
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,970
You have seen Crow. He loves
to stand at the door to say, Boo.

182
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,520
We got word you might
have a job for us.

183
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,850
Yes.

184
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,980
Yes, an exciting job.

185
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,940
A train has something I need.

186
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,280
- You have worked a train before?
- We did a few.

187
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,910
Are you going to ask me
what it is I need?

188
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,790
As a rule, no.

189
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,250
Yes, good. You have reputation.

190
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,000
Malcolm Reynolds gets it done,
is the talk.

191
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,670
Well, glad to hear that.

192
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,840
You know what is reputation?

193
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,300
Is people talking, is gossip.

194
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,980
I also have reputation not so pleasant,
I think you know. Crow.

195
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,280
Now, for you, my reputation
is not from gossip.

196
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,830
You see this man?
He does not do the job.

197
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,170
I show you what I do with him
and now my reputation for you is fact.

198
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,130
Is solid.

199
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,340
You do the train job for me...

200
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,180
then you are solid.

201
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,850
No more gossip.

202
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Right.

203
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,400
Oh, you do not like I kill this man.

204
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,110
Oh, no, I'm sure
he was a very bad person.

205
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,160
My wife's nephew.
At dinner, I'm getting earful.

206
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,120
There is no way out of that.

207
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,120
So... Oh, the train job.
Come in.

208
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,840
Here, in fifth car, two boxes.
Alliance goods.

209
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:04,260
You don't mind the taking from Alliance,
I think, from your reputation.

210
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,770
You get on train at Hancock
headed for Paradiso.

211
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,600
You take boxes off before you reach
Paradiso and deliver to Crow...

212
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,900
here.

213
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,110
Half money now, Crow give you
other half at rendezvous point.

214
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,700
Anything goes wrong,
then your reputation only gossip...

215
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,160
and things between us not so solid.

216
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,960
Yes?

217
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,350
- How long till we hit Paradiso?
- 20 minutes.

218
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,810
We should be in the foothills in five.

219
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,110
Let's get to work.

220
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,190
He's a psycho, you know. Niska.

221
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,910
He's not the first psycho to hire us,
nor the last.

222
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,870
You think that's a commentary on us?

223
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,660
I have an image of a guy
hanging from the ceiling.

224
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,250
I got an image of it not being me.
Let's do the thing.

225
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,970
Hi.

226
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,230
Shepherd.

227
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,820
Good day.

228
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,280
So...

229
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,040
how do you think it's going?
The caper?

230
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,790
Mal knows what he's doing.

231
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,620
How long have you known him?

232
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,920
I've been on the ship
eight months now.

233
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,800
I'm not certain I'll ever actually
know the captain.

234
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,350
I'm surprised a respectable companion
would sail with this crew.

235
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,930
It's not always this sort of work.

236
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,100
They take the jobs they can get,
even legitimate ones.

237
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,230
The further from the central planets,
the harder things are.

238
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,770
This is part of it.

239
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,940
I wish I could help.

240
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,490
I mean, I don't want to help...

241
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,870
Not help help.
Not with the thieving, but...

242
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,450
I do feel awfully useless.

243
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,790
You could always pray
they make it back safely.

244
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,880
I don't think the captain would
much like me praying for him.

245
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,840
Don't tell him.

246
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,010
I never do.

247
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,230
Go on. Straight through.

248
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,070
Keep moving.

249
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,540
Sir, is there some information
we might maybe be lacking...

250
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,710
as to why there's an entire
Fed squad sitting on this train?

251
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,670
- It doesn't concern us.
- It kind of concerns me.

252
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,840
They're not protecting the goods. If they
were, they wouldn't let people past.

253
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,470
- Think that changes the situation a bit?
- I surely do.

254
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,560
It makes it more fun.

255
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,020
Sir, I think you have a problem
with your brain being missing.

256
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,350
Come on.

257
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,980
We stick to the plan.
We get the goods.

258
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,690
We're on Serenity before the train
reaches Paradiso.

259
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,400
Only now we do it under the noses
of 20 trained Alliance Feds.

260
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,860
And that makes them look
all manner of stupid.

261
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,950
This job I would pull for free.

262
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,530
- Can I have your share?
- No.

263
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,120
- If you die, can I have your share?
- Yes.

264
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,380
Hey.

265
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,340
Oh, hey, doctor.

266
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,850
You really should just call me Simon.

267
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,100
Oh, I'll do that then.

268
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,060
So...

269
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,020
what are we doing? Oh, crime.

270
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,780
Crime?

271
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,780
Good.

272
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,820
- Okay, crime.
- It's a train heist.

273
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,450
You see, we fly over the train car,
the captain and Zoe sneak in...

274
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,250
we lower Jane onto the car,
and they bundle up the booty...

275
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,040
and we haul them all back up.
Easy as lying.

276
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,550
- They've done this before?
- Hell, no.

277
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,010
But I think it's gonna work. The captain
gengish when it comes to plans.

278
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,680
Is there anything I can...?
Something I should be doing?

279
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,020
Staying the hell out of everyone's way.

280
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,270
No call to be snappy.

281
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,190
Are you about to jump
onto a moving train?

282
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,900
- The captain ain't around. I'm in charge.
- Since when?

283
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,440
Just because Mal says you're medic,
don't make you part of the crew.

284
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,610
Just play at figuring what's wrong with
that sister of yours till we call for you.

285
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,450
Right.

286
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
You shouldn't be so rude to him.

287
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,720
- Because he's all rich and fanciful?
- He's not rich.

288
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,970
The Alliance crashed his accounts
when he snuck out his sister.

289
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,930
Yeah, we could all be rich
if we handed her back.

290
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,140
- You're not even thinking that.
- Mal is.

291
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,770
- That's not funny.
- He ain't stupid.

292
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,650
Why would he take on trouble like those
two if there weren't no profit in it?

293
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,530
Captain's got a move
he ain't made yet. You'll see.

294
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,530
Time for some thrilling heroics.

295
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,160
Niska's sources better be good.

296
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,790
Shining.

297
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,710
Find the cargo.

298
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,680
All hail the great Alliance.

299
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,450
Aha!

300
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,940
Fifteen seconds.

301
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,790
- Go!
- Go. Go now!

302
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,800
Come on.

303
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,960
- Where are the others?
- They shot my gorram leg.

304
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,090
Are they still on the train?
Are they gonna be okay?

305
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,420
Everybody off!

306
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,970
Come on, everybody off!

307
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,820
Our man didn't get a look.

308
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,700
Well, jeez, can someone
find out what they took?

309
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,250
Keep those people together.
Quiet them down.

310
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,120
It's medicine, sir.

311
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,500
All of the supplies.

312
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,880
They stole the gorram medicine?
We been waiting...

313
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,550
- All of it?
- Every ounce.

314
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,930
God help us.

315
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,970
Son of a bitch.

316
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,090
- What's the fuss?
- All network alert. Cargo theft.

317
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,840
Medical shipment lifted off a train
en route to Paradiso.

318
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:19,520
Six crates of Pescaline D. That will get
you a tidy fortune on the black market.

319
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,390
Tag it received. Bounce it back.
Locals can deal with it.

320
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,270
Sir, there is a regiment holding
in Paradiso.

321
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,360
They were headed to the installation.

322
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,400
Then get them back on the train.
Who's holding them there?

323
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,900
The sheriff requested we deploy
if you'd help...

324
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,200
These are federal marshals,
not local narcotic hounds.

325
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,490
They've got better things to do.

326
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,700
So do we.

327
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,420
Gorram it, let's get us moving.

328
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,420
Now, I'm not finished.

329
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,670
- This ain't the rendezvous spot.
- It is now.

330
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,170
- Niska's people are not partial to waiting.
- Let them read a magazine.

331
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,890
We don't make the sale
until Mal and Zoe are back.

332
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,100
These are stone killers.
They ain't cuddly.

333
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,310
I'm not flying anywhere
without my wife.

334
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,600
She'll be okay.
She's with the captain.

335
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,730
There, you see. Everybody wins.

336
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,650
Doc, I need a pop
to quiet this pain some.

337
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,110
All right, but what about the authorities?

338
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,610
We're sitting here with stolen Alliance
goods. Won't they look for us?

339
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,660
They buzz this canyon,
we'll hear them before they see us.

340
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,290
- We're good...
- They'll never stop.

341
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,500
They'll just keep coming
until they get back what you took.

342
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,170
Two by two...

343
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,130
hands of blue.

344
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,470
Two by two...

345
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,680
hands of blue.

346
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,640
How about you shut that crazy mouth?
Is that a fun game?

347
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,890
I'm in charge.
I'm telling you how it works.

348
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,110
We don't get the goods to Niska,
he'll make meat pies out of us.

349
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,150
I ain't walking into that.

350
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,820
Is this Adelai Niska
you're talking about?

351
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,660
Now, how would a shepherd
know a name like that?

352
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,490
As I've heard it,
he made a deal with the captain.

353
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,500
If the captain's not there to finish it,
if Niska finds out he's being held...

354
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,500
and may speak as to who hired him...

355
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,460
I think we're better off
being a little late.

356
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,970
- This is a nightmare.
- Nothing points to us yet, sir.

357
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,890
That ain't what I'm talking about.

358
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,610
Whatever happens,
remember I love you.

359
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,530
Sir?

360
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,490
- Because you're my wife.
- Right, sir.

361
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,370
Honey.

362
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,200
Car three, row twelve.
Mr. And Mrs. Raymond?

363
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,290
Can you tell us what's going on?
We've been here for so long.

364
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,170
- Did someone on the train get killed?
- No, no, no, nothing like that.

365
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,760
Says there your fare's
paid for by a third party?

366
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,760
My uncle. It was a wedding gift.

367
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,760
Wedding gift.

368
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,560
- Spending your honeymoon in Paradiso?
- Actually, we're here looking for work.

369
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,070
That right?

370
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,650
My uncle said he knew
a Joey Bloggs out here.

371
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,780
Said he might have an opening.
Thought we'd try our luck.

372
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,660
You a miner by trade? Either of you?

373
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,330
Not really.

374
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,040
Haven't seen many folk choose
this life weren't born to it.

375
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,750
Well, work is real scarce
for a couple just starting out.

376
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,800
How come there's so many sick here?

377
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,970
Bowden's Malady.

378
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,760
- You know what that is?
- An affliction of the bone and muscle.

379
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,640
- Degenerative.
- Very.

380
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,440
Every planet that's been terraformed
for human life has its own little quirks.

381
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:58,400
Turns out the air down underground
mixed up with the ore processors...

382
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,780
perfect recipe for Bowden's.

383
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,160
Everybody gets it.

384
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,120
Miners, dumpers.

385
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,990
Hell, I got it, and I ain't
ever set foot in a mine.

386
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,120
- But it's treatable.
- There's medicine.

387
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,960
Pescaline.

388
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,590
You can live like a person
if you get it regular...

389
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,720
but our shipment got stole
right off the train you was riding in.

390
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,850
Which is why you won't be seeing
a parade in town today.

391
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,220
Stolen?

392
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,810
Didn't I see an entire regiment of fine,
young Alliance Federals on the train?

393
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,060
You did.

394
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,320
Same regiment let their medicine
get swiped from under their noses...

395
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,240
then took off for their own camp
without so much as a whoopsy daisy.

396
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,160
That sounds like the Alliance.

397
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,830
Unite all the planets so that everybody
can be interfered with or ignored equally.

398
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,460
Alliance ain't much use to us
out here on the border planets.

399
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,920
But...

400
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,250
they didn't steal the medicine.

401
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,590
I ever find those people, they ain't
ever gonna see the inside of a jail.

402
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,680
I'm just gonna toss them in a mine...

403
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,140
and let them breathe deep
for the rest of their lives.

404
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,980
Can't argue with that.

405
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:22,360
You mind telling me when it was
you last spoke to Joey Bloggs?

406
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,280
- Never did myself.
- Right. Your uncle.

407
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,660
And it was indicated to you
that Joey had an opening?

408
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,040
Any job would do.

409
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,380
It's funny your uncle never mentioned
the Bowden's problem...

410
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,210
or that Joey Bloggs ate his own
gun about eight months back.

411
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,260
Did he?

412
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,090
Yep.

413
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,050
Blew the back of his head right off.

414
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,220
So...

415
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,690
would his job be open?

416
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,810
We waited long enough.
Let's get this bird in the air.

417
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,730
- No way.
- You really should sit down.

418
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,650
We can't leave the captain and Zoe.

419
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,860
They ain't coming. We can't get them.
They're done. Fire it up.

420
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,700
- What's going on?
- We're taking off.

421
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,990
- We're not.
- Captain would do the same.

422
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,330
- Not in a million years.
- Listen to me...

423
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,160
Know what the chain of command is?

424
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,040
It's the chain I beat you with
till you understand who's in command.

425
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,790
Now, we're finishing this deal.

426
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:26,050
Then maybe we'll come back for those
morons that got themselves caught.

427
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,090
You can't change that by getting all...

428
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,390
- bendy.
- All what?

429
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,020
You got the light from the console...

430
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,400
to keep you...

431
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,650
Lift you up.

432
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,820
Oh, they shine like...

433
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,110
little angels.

434
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,080
- Did he just go crazy and fall asleep?
- I told him to sit down.

435
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,460
You doped him.

436
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,750
It was supposed to kick in
a good deal sooner.

437
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,710
I just didn't feel comfortable
with him in charge.

438
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,300
I hope that's all right.

439
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,840
So how do we get the others?

440
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,520
If Jane was right about them
not making contact...

441
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,060
they got pinched getting off that train.

442
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,440
We can't just waltz in
and pull them out.

443
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,360
Someone respectable enough
might be able to.

444
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,410
- What the hell...?
- Don't you dare speak to me.

445
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,460
Sheriff, I want this man
bound by law at once.

446
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,540
- That's assuming he hasn't been already.
- No one's been bound. Not yet.

447
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,750
Thank God you stopped them.

448
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,380
Did you think you could access
my accounts and I wouldn't find you?

449
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,100
And, Zoe, what would your husband say
if he knew you were here?

450
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,220
I was weak.

451
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,230
- So I take it they ain't newly weds.
- Hardly.

452
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Malcolm's my indentured man...

453
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,030
with three years left in his debt.

454
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,240
I imagine we'll have to add another
six months after this little adventure.

455
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,280
You'll have to pardon them.

456
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,120
Don't think one of thems ever seen
a registered companion before.

457
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,370
- I apologise for my manner.
- Oh, not a bit.

458
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,710
Should I contact my ship? Do you
need to hold them much longer?

459
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,840
Looks to me like we're about done here.

460
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,130
We had some unrelated trouble.
His story had kind of an odour to it.

461
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,600
Yes. It's not the only thing
about him that does.

462
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,680
Thank you very much, sheriff.

463
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,190
Come along.

464
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,740
That's a hell of a lady.

465
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,750
- Her files were all in order?
- I read them twice.

466
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,460
All right. Let's get started
with the rest then.

467
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:21,720
- Hey. How did it go?
- She hit me.

468
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,610
We tried to get him into the infirmary.
He's just heavy.

469
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,320
- Engine's running. We're good to go.
- We're not going.

470
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,910
- Not what? Not why?
- We're bringing the cargo back.

471
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,450
What? What do you mean back?
I waited for you guys.

472
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,210
What are you talking about?
What about Niska?

473
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,420
Won't this put him in a killing mood?

474
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,170
- Others need this more.
- Let's get it on the mule.

475
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,590
- My shuttle's faster.
- You risked enough flying in there once.

476
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,800
I don't want to get
slapped around no more.

477
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,930
We'll explain to Niska that the job
went south when we return the money.

478
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,100
If you want to explain,
now's your chance.

479
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,490
You didn't make the rendezvous.

480
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,120
We ran into a few complications.

481
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,330
You are thinking of taking Mr. Niska's
money and his property maybe.

482
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,500
Interestingly, neither.

483
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,260
- I don't understand.
- Yeah, look, here's what it is. Deal's off.

484
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,050
We changed our minds.

485
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,220
You entered into an arrangement
with Mr. Niska.

486
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,640
- There is no mind-changing.
- That's where you're wrong.

487
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:51,020
We just can't take this job,
so you just relax.

488
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,110
We'll get you the money Niska gave us,
you return it to him, we'll call it even.

489
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,780
There is no even.

490
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,570
Is that right?

491
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,590
Nice shot.

492
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,720
I was aiming for his head.

493
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,570
We'll have to drag them from here.

494
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,360
Leave them just off the street...

495
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,320
notify the sheriff
once we're in deep, deep space.

496
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,030
Why not tell him in person?

497
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,660
Got word of a ship not far out.

498
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,210
Came looking.

499
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,170
Didn't expect to find you
coming back.

500
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,550
Didn't expect to be coming.

501
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,630
Nothing missing.

502
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,690
You were truthful back in town.
These are tough times.

503
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,270
A man can get a job...

504
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,820
he might not look too close
at what that job is.

505
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:06,160
But a man who learns all the details
of a situation like ours, well...

506
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,240
then he has a choice.

507
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,370
I don't believe he does.

508
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,800
Let's get these crates back to town.

509
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,090
Make ourselves useful.

510
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,280
Now, this is all the money
Niska gave us in advance.

511
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,280
You bring it back to him,
tell him the job didn't work out.

512
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,780
We're not thieves.

513
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,120
But we are thieves. The point is,
we're not taking what's his.

514
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,330
We'll stay out of his way
as best we can from here on in.

515
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,710
You explain that's best
for everyone, okay?

516
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,510
Keep the money.

517
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,260
Use it to buy a funeral.

518
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:09,510
It doesn't matter where you go
or how far you fly.

519
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,810
I will hunt you down, and the last thing
you see will be my blade.

520
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,350
Darn.

521
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,990
This is all the money...

522
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,240
Oh, I got it. I'm good.
Best thing for everyone.

523
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,490
I'm right there with you.

524
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,720
- You should have let me do this sooner.
- I've had plenty worse.

525
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,680
It's just... Ow!

526
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,680
- Sorry.
- Just be careful.

527
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,140
Pretty fast thinking,
doping up Jane.

528
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,020
- Can't say you made a lifetime friend.
- I'll deal with him.

529
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,650
Yeah, I'm not too worried about you.

530
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,280
How's your sister?

531
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,940
The same.

532
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,110
In one moment, she seems
perfectly cogent. The next...

533
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,660
she speaks nonsense.

534
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,700
It's like a child.

535
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,580
So difficult to diagnose.

536
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:22,500
I still don't know what the government
was trying to do with her.

537
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,010
So I have no idea if they succeeded.

538
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,550
Hands of blue.

539
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,010
Two by two...

540
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,890
hands of blue.

541
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,650
- Sorry to keep you waiting. There's...
- We're not interested.

542
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,940
We're here about a theft.

543
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:47,110
The medicine on that planet.
Word came up that was returned.

544
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,950
We didn't fly 86 million miles to track
down a box of Band-Aids, colonel.

545
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,780
We're looking for a girl.

546
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,000
This girl.
