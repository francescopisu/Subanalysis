12 Firefly Heart Of Gold - Episode 12 2003 English

2
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,520
Nandy!

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,150
Nandy!

4
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,030
Get inside.

5
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,460
Go.

6
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,510
- We ain't open for business.
- Shut up, whore.

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,260
You we don't trade with at all,
Rans Burgess.

8
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,140
You're no longer welcome.
You've been told that.

9
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,100
I've been told a great many things.
I'm here for what's mine.

10
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,270
Ain't nothing here belongs to you.

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,940
You don't get gone, we'll be well
within our rights to drop you.

12
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,190
Only rights you got
are the ones I give you.

13
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,200
- Find the girl!
- She ain't here.

14
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,870
Girl left this moon more than a month
ago. It was you chased her off.

15
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,500
Petaleen!

16
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,550
It's a good thing you haven't left
with my baby.

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,800
- This baby ain't yours.
- So you keep saying.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,980
If this DNA is a match with mine...

19
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,560
know I will be back for my baby.

20
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,070
And if I have to,
I'll cut it out of you.

21
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,870
All right, now, it'll all work out.

22
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,460
- He'll do it too. He'll do what he says.
- No, he won't. We won't allow it.

23
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,800
- How we gonna stop him?
- We'll get help, that's how.

24
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,680
Help? There's not a soul on this moon
go up against Rans Burgess.

25
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,680
She's right.
Ain't nobody strong enough.

26
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,350
And even if there was,
who'd help us?

27
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,900
Hi.

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,780
Sorry.
Didn't mean to startle you.

29
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,860
You didn't. I was just...

30
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,620
That's more like a, it's a warrior-like,
strikes fear into the hearts of...

31
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,870
You know, not altogether wise,
sneaking up on a fellow...

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,580
when he's handling his weapon.
Sure. I've heard that said.

33
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,210
But perhaps the dining area
isn't the place for this sort of thing.

34
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,760
What? It's the only place
with a table big enough.

35
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,220
Of course.

36
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,850
In that case,
every well-bred petty crook knows...

37
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,560
small, concealable weapons always
go to the far left of the place setting.

38
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,400
Got a distress call coming in.
Some folks asking for help.

39
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,780
Really? Folks asking for help
from us petty crooks.

40
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,950
- Well...
- I should take that right away.

41
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,450
Well, it's for her.

42
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,580
Huh?

43
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,950
The call's for Inara.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,830
- I'll take it in my shuttle.
- I'll send it there.

45
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,580
This distress
wouldn't happen to be...

46
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,590
taking place in someone's pants,
would it?

47
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,990
And I got word
you were in the area.

48
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,620
I'm imposing,
but I got no one else to ask.

49
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,410
It sounds like something
this crew can handle.

50
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,870
I can't guarantee they'll handle it
particularly well, but...

51
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,130
- if they've got guns and brains at all...
- They've got guns.

52
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,130
Payment won't be a problem.
We just ain't equipped for this.

53
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,340
- Nandy, it's gonna be all right.
- The house would tell you not to come.

54
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,010
I know they ordered you to shun me
when I left.

55
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I would have waived you long ago.
It's just...

56
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,900
It doesn't matter.

57
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,610
Who'd have thought
we'd end up way out here?

58
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,320
Who'd have thought?

59
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,820
- Let me know what your people say?
- Of course.

60
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,740
I'll wait to hear from you.

61
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,530
And you.

62
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,630
I suppose you heard most of that.

63
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,960
Only because I was eavesdropping.

64
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,180
- Your friend sounds like she's in trouble.
- She is.

65
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,300
And there's no authority on that moon
she can go to. They're totally alone.

66
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,560
Some men
might take advantage of that.

67
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,350
One man.

68
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,480
She's looking for someone
to come and explain things to him?

69
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,110
That's essentially it, yes.

70
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,780
A whole houseful of companions.
How are they fixed for payment?

71
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,450
They're not companions.

72
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,040
They're whores.

73
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,370
Thought you didn't care for that word.

74
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,620
It applies.

75
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,080
They're not registered with the guild.
They're...

76
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,840
- Independent?
- Yes.

77
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,300
If you agree to do this
you'll be compensated. I'll see to it.

78
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,550
- I've put a little aside...
- Keep your money.

79
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,850
I won't be needing no payment.

80
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,680
Mal.

81
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,390
Thank you.

82
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,110
I'll contact Nandy at once.

83
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,740
But you will be paid.
I feel it's important that we keep ours...

84
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,320
strictly a business arrangement.

85
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,160
- I'll speak with the crew.
- Good.

86
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,790
Those who have a mind
are welcome to join.

87
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,550
Those who'd just as soon
stay on the ship can do that too.

88
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,720
Don't see the benefit,
getting involved...

89
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,720
in a stranger's troubles
without an up-front price.

90
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,810
These people need assistance. The
benefit wouldn't necessarily be for you.

91
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,890
- That's what I'm saying.
- No one's gonna force you to go.

92
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,440
As stated,
this job is strictly speculative.

93
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,900
Good. Don't know these folks,
don't care to.

94
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,770
- They're whores.
- I'm in.

95
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,110
Wash, plot a course.

96
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,160
- That's the whorehouse?
- Yes.

97
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,040
How come it looks
like a frozen dinner pack?

98
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,290
Solar sheeting. Cheap power.

99
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,630
Hope the whores
are prettier than the house.

100
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,180
- Nandy, darling.
- It's so good to see you.

101
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,560
- You look wonderful.
- You look exactly the same.

102
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,060
- How do you do that out here?
- Sheer force of will.

103
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,940
- This is Malcolm Reynolds.
- I appreciate your coming.

104
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,570
Well, any friend of Inara's is a strictly
business-like relationship of mine.

105
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,610
This is my first mate, Zoe.
I'll introduce you to the rest later.

106
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,870
- Can I start getting sexed already?
- Well, that one's kind of horrific.

107
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,790
- Can we talk business?
- In here. The rest of you...

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,330
there's food and some liquor at
the sideboard. Make yourselves at home.

109
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,920
Look, they got boy whores.
Isn't that thoughtful?

110
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,300
- I wonder if they service girl folk at all?
- Let's not ask.

111
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,930
Isn't there a pregnant woman
to examine?

112
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,810
You'd really lie
with someone being paid for it?

113
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,560
Well, it's not like anyone else
is lining up to, you know, examine me.

114
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,940
Whoo! My John Thomas is about
to pop off and fly around...

115
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,780
there's so much tasty in here!

116
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,820
Would be you'd get your most poetical
about your pecker.

117
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,370
- You'd be the doctor?
- Yes.

118
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,170
- This is Petaleen.
- Yes, sir.

119
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,750
She's feeling a might weak
right now.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,670
- Well, let's get you lying down.
- Now that's a plan.

121
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,090
- Shepherd?
- No, thank you.

122
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,720
We were hoping we might
have a prayer meeting.

123
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,850
We ain't had one in months, except
what Emma here reads out on Sundays.

124
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,770
The last shepherd to come by was
springtime, he only read one passage.

125
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,070
And he took it out in trade
off both of us.

126
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,360
Everyone's got somebody.

127
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,030
Wash, tell me I'm pretty.

128
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,450
Were I unwed,
I would take you in a manly fashion.

129
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,410
- Because I'm pretty?
- Because you're pretty.

130
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,040
I take it
reason doesn't enter into this.

131
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,540
Not with Rans Burgess.
The man is a taker.

132
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,460
- You think the kid is his?
- I think it's Petaleen's.

133
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,260
But the blood test.

134
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,880
Well, he did favour Petaleen
pretty exclusively, but she had others.

135
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,300
Fifty-fifty, not that it matters.
The man ain't fit to raise a cactus plant.

136
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,890
His barren prairie shrew
can't bear him an heir...

137
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,560
so he takes it into his head
to pull it out of us. Not gonna happen.

138
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,860
- I see that's the case.
- And you see the way we live here.

139
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,440
Go into town, it's the same.

140
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,780
Some places come up rustic because
they ain't got more than basics.

141
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,860
Rans Burgess has money enough
to build a city, a real community.

142
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,740
Keeps people living like this
so he can play cowboy...

143
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,250
be the one with the best toys. Turn
this moon into a gorram theme park.

144
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Someone stands up to him...

145
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,170
He means to burn me out.

146
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,920
Yeah, he sounds like a fun guy.
I'd like to meet him.

147
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,300
This won't be solved with talk.

148
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,220
When I'm gonna fight a man,
it helps to size him up.

149
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,970
- Well, he'll be at the theatre tonight.
- And so will I.

150
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,440
Inara. Think you can stoop
to being on my arm?

151
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,190
Will you wash it first?

152
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,240
So I told the boy, "You take a clean
woman's virtue, you take the woman."

153
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,580
And that's for life!"
And the boy said his vows right then.

154
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,410
Took very little persuading
on my part.

155
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,340
It's nice to know there's some places
left where old-fashioned...

156
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,920
values still mean a thing.

157
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,550
- Isn't that right, dear?
- Mm.

158
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,720
- I don't think I know you.
- Name's Malcolm, Malcolm Reynolds.

159
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,100
And might I just say,
she is quite a beauty.

160
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,890
Well, thank you.

161
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,890
Ever had occasion to handle
one of these, Mr. Reynolds?

162
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,770
Silk trigger, active return bolt laser.

163
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,070
- It's lighter than it looks.
- Don't let that fool you.

164
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,860
Won't find technology like that
short of Alliance.

165
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,740
And even their issues
don't have the auto-target adjust.

166
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,200
I had that crafted special.

167
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,210
Didn't think weapons such as this
were generally legal. For a private owner.

168
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,590
My husband makes a distinction between
legality and morality, Mr. Reynolds.

169
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,010
- I've said that myself.
- Bending one unjust law is small...

170
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,180
when it comes to protecting
one's family.

171
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,270
- I think I understand you.
- And as you say, she is a beauty.

172
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,350
She sure is.
Of course, I was referring to the lady.

173
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,190
Ma'am.

174
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,490
Yes?

175
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,830
- Well?
- Well what?

176
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,330
You said you wanted to look him
in the eye. You've done that.

177
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,830
- So, what's the plan?
- We get back to Serenity...

178
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,710
and we get off this rock
just as fast as we can.

179
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,470
And there can be no mistake?
Good.

180
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,680
- Rans?
- The DNA matches.

181
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,060
The child is mine.

182
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,320
We run. Math just don't add up.

183
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,070
Our weapon stores
aren't exactly overpowering...

184
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,780
and I don't much like
what we'd be up against.

185
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,330
Nothing worse than a monster
who thinks he's right with God.

186
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,330
I turn Burgess away once
and he'll keep coming.

187
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,040
Won't stop
till he gets what he thinks is his.

188
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,880
- So we run.
- I understand, Capt.. Reynolds.

189
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,050
You have your people to think of,
same as me. And this ain't your fight.

190
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,680
I don't believe you do understand,
Nandy. I said we run. "We."

191
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,600
My people, your people, and whatever
bits of precious you got in this house...

192
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,520
you can't bear to part with.
We load up Serenity...

193
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,350
and we leave Burgess in the dust.

194
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,900
It took me years to cut this piece
of territory out of other men's hands...

195
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,070
to build this from nothing.
Nandy...

196
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,410
It's who I am, and it's my home.
I'm not going anywhere.

197
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,290
He'll kill you. He'll kill every last
one of them, it comes to that.

198
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,920
- And he'll sleep well that night.
- Rans Burgess is just a man.

199
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,550
And I won't let any man
take what's mine.

200
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,680
I doubt you'd do different
in my position.

201
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,180
Well, lady, I must say...

202
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,560
you're my kind of stupid.

203
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,940
Hell, he ain't expecting
much of a fight.

204
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,190
Might be we catch him
with his drawers low.

205
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,440
He'll probably ride in by daylight.

206
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,610
But I figure, three-point watch,
say four-hour shift...

207
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,530
just to be on the safe side.
Threepoint, Four-hour...

208
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,700
should do it.
I'm fair handy with a hammer.

209
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That so, Shepherd?

210
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,000
Been following the footsteps
of a carpenter some time now.

211
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,460
I can do something
about our fortifications.

212
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,670
Okay, then. We start shooting...

213
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,760
he'll most like try to burn us out,
save sweat and bullets.

214
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,800
- Nandy, what's the water supply like?
- Underground well.

215
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,680
Pump that draws it up's antiquated,
but don't break down.

216
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,890
Kaylee, think you can swing
an upgrade?

217
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,480
I'll talk to Serenity,
see what she's got.

218
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,190
- Good. We might...
- Starting!

219
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,480
- And that it is, but time...
- Dr. Tam?

220
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,190
Oh, it's starting! Okay!

221
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,900
Okay, it's starting! All right.

222
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,870
Everybody relax, be calm.

223
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,990
Nobody panic!
Every thing's gonna be okay!

224
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
- I got this one, captain.
- Thanks. Okay.

225
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,710
Okay, then.
Let's get to work, people!

226
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,070
The girls and I
have been talking, Shepherd.

227
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,150
We've been discussing what we'd like
said over us if we should fall.

228
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,030
No.

229
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,570
I only bury the dead, child.

230
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,410
No one here's gonna die.

231
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,120
There's people gonna die.

232
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,290
And with people dying,
comes guts and screaming.

233
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,750
That can bring on screwed-up behaviour,
a person ain't used to it.

234
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,720
When the time comes, most important
thing, keep your wits about you. Clear?

235
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,760
All right.

236
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,890
These are my favourites.
You're to keep them coming.

237
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,600
I shoot, I run out, you hand me
the next biggest one, and so on.

238
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,360
- Is there an understanding here?
- Yes.

239
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,980
Alrighty then, let's get to work.

240
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,450
All I'm saying is that we're living
in the rough and tumble...

241
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,040
and don't see that changing soon.
Nor do I.

242
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,330
Not sure now is the best time to bring
a tiny, helpless person into our lives.

243
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,130
That excuse
is getting a little worn, honey.

244
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,460
It's not an excuse, dear.
It's objective assessment.

245
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,130
I can't help that it stays relevant.

246
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,180
I don't give a good gorram
about relevant, Wash. Or objective.

247
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,680
And I ain't so afraid of losing something
that I ain't gonna try to have it.

248
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,230
You and I would make
one beautiful baby.

249
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,440
And I wanna meet that child
one day.

250
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,820
Period.

251
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,700
Y'all are pulling,
not squeezing like I said.

252
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,580
Next one don't hit that board
is giving up a special treat.

253
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,580
That man's gonna use up
our credit before we've earned it.

254
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,550
After you've saved our lives,
you can do some chores maybe.

255
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,300
- I'm a fair hand with a mop.
- So your legend tells.

256
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,760
Truth is, I expected more of you
to be taking payment in our trade.

257
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,260
Well, we're not a conglomeration.

258
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,600
Got a preacher, married fella,
and the doctor...

259
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,560
well, he'd have to relax
for 30 seconds to get his play.

260
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,690
That'd be more or less a miracle.

261
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,940
These are fetching pieces.
Any of them work?

262
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,610
Don't got many rounds for the
chaplain there, but the rest'll be of use.

263
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,080
- This is my favourite.
- What's its history?

264
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,450
Violence and crime, sad to say.

265
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,910
- What about you?
- Similar.

266
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,790
No, I mean when are you planning
to avail yourself of some of our trade?

267
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,130
- My girls is clean and kind-spirited.
- Well, I got the job on my mind.

268
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,340
After, I'm sure I'll trade.

269
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,970
They're a fine bunch.

270
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,480
You ain't looked at one of them as long
or loving as you looked at those pistols.

271
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,940
You're not sly, are you?
Because I got my boys.

272
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,770
Sly? No.

273
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,690
I lean toward women folk.
Just, one thing at a time.

274
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,940
Never liked complications.

275
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,860
Oh, I'm certain of that.

276
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,120
- Something to be smiling at?
- I trained as a companion, remember?

277
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,420
- I read people pretty well.
- Well, that's nice for you.

278
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,000
She's a hell of a woman, ain't she?

279
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,460
Inara.

280
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,590
Yeah, she's a cherry blossom,
no denying.

281
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,720
Expect you know her better,
coming up together and all.

282
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,390
Imagine I do.
She ever tell you why she left Soonal?

283
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,140
- Never asked.
- Yes, you did.

284
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,310
And I don't know my own self.
I was gone long before.

285
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,860
And I'll tell you, it was a shock,
her leaving. She was special.

286
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,110
There's 40 women in House Madrassa,
and you'd pick her out in a second.

287
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,660
Could've been House Priestess,
few years' time.

288
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,700
- Is that right?
- Had her eyes on it too.

289
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,160
Very focused.

290
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,540
She's like you, more than a little.

291
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,840
And how exactly is that?

292
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,300
She hates complications.

293
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,010
They do crop up though,
don't they?

294
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Such is life.

295
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,980
You're not completely dilated yet.

296
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,310
Don't try to force it,
the contractions are still preliminary.

297
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,610
- What's he saying?
- It's gonna be a little while, sweetie.

298
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,110
But it hurts!

299
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
This child wants to be born,
I know it!

300
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,450
Can you get the green vial
from my bag?

301
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,700
We can dull the pain some.

302
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,700
How many babies
have you actually delivered?

303
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,370
As a primary, this'll be the first.
You?

304
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,170
- My first too.
- Mine too.

305
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,470
- It's gonna be a long night.
- You'll do great, doctor.

306
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,180
Who do you think is in there?

307
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,940
It was the dulcimer.

308
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,110
The dulcimer
drove you out of Soonal?

309
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,150
Did you kill a dulcimer
in a terrible passion?

310
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,650
Actually, yes.

311
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,990
And now that dulcimer's family
is out to get even, I get it.

312
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,870
I was at practice.

313
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,080
You never stop practising, you know,
not a true companion.

314
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,250
Some baroque piece,
and the instructor keeps saying:

315
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,040
"You're playing it, not feeling it."

316
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,710
And the fifth time he said it,
I took the damn thing and smashed it.

317
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,050
And that's when it occurred to me
that a companion's life...

318
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,140
might be a little too constricting.

319
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,520
So I trucked out to the border, learned
to say "ain't." Came to find work.

320
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,770
Found this place.

321
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,230
It's a nice place.

322
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,150
It was a dung-heap run by a pig who
had half the girls strung-out on drops.

323
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,450
There's no guild out here.

324
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,780
They let men run the houses,
and they don't ask for references.

325
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,620
We didn't get along.

326
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,790
And where's he at now?

327
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,420
Let's just say he ain't playing
the dulcimer anymore either.

328
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,220
You are a remarkable woman.

329
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,930
If you don't mind my saying.

330
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,900
Well, as long as it's you saying it
and not my fine rice wine.

331
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,780
It takes more than a few drinks
to render my judgement blurry.

332
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,110
What about you?

333
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,030
- Am I getting any prettier?
- By the minute.

334
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,210
I should make sure
everyone's ready for...

335
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,380
Everyone's asleep.

336
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,090
Well, there's them that can't...

337
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,260
night before a fight.

338
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,640
Can you?

339
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,850
- What?
- Sleep.

340
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,100
Listen, Nandy,
I have a confession to make.

341
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,650
Maybe I should get the Shepherd.

342
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,190
Well, I ain't sinned yet.

343
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,570
And I'd feel a little more than awkward
if he were here when I did.

344
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,320
You expect to accomplish something
sinful then, do you?

345
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,700
If I'm overstepping my bounds,
let me know.

346
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,670
Malcolm, I've been waiting for you
to kiss me since I showed you my guns.

347
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,590
You okay with this?

348
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,140
I'm just waiting to see if I pass out.

349
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,850
Long story.

350
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,850
- I want you to bed me.
- I guess I mean to.

351
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,980
I ain't her.

352
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,030
Only people in this room
are you and me.

353
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,610
So my child...

354
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,370
how long has it been
since your last confession?

355
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,830
- Longer than I care to say.
- You remember where everything goes?

356
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,500
Let's just say
I plan to take it real slow.

357
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,750
So the whore's got herself a champion,
has she?

358
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,260
- This great man got a name?
- Reynolds. Malcolm Reynolds.

359
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,550
Yes, I've met the man.

360
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,430
- How many has he got with him?
- Just a few.

361
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,310
And only two real fighters
besides himself.

362
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,560
But they got the girls stirring
for a battle.

363
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,770
I certainly wasn't expecting
a battle.

364
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,440
Seems the Heart of Gold's
got itself a few mercenaries.

365
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,150
Guess we best
call the whole thing off.

366
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,200
Earned yourself quite a bag of silver,
little kitten.

367
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:06,290
But I got a few more chores in mind
before you get it.

368
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,460
I'm ready.

369
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,880
Now, Shahri here...

370
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,550
she understands a whore's place,
don't she?

371
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,470
But Nandy and those others,
they spit on our town.

372
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:26,390
They've no respect for the sanctity
of fatherhood or decency or family!

373
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:33,030
They have my child, held hostage to their
decadent ways, and that I will not abide!

374
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,900
We will show them what power is!

375
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,870
We will show them
what their position in this town is!

376
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:46,370
Let us all remember, right here and now,
what a woman is to a man!

377
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,500
Get on your knees.

378
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,630
- Well.
- I just had to...

379
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,840
tell Nandy about...

380
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,340
About time to...

381
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,470
- Big fight today.
- Mal, please.

382
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,520
No, well, I, no...

383
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,310
You know, I was up, I got...

384
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,480
So you took to bed with Nandy.
I'm glad.

385
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,270
- Glad?
- Yes.

386
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,240
She's a dear friend,
and probably in need of comfort now.

387
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,320
Well...

388
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,410
One of the virtues of not being
puritanical about sex...

389
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,910
is not feeling embarrassed afterwards.
You should look into it.

390
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,580
Well, I just didn't want
you thinking...

391
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,960
that I was taking advantage
of your friend.

392
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,840
She's well worth taking advantage of.
I sincerely hope you did.

393
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,050
So you're okay.

394
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,840
Well, yeah, why wouldn't you be?

395
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,850
I wouldn't say I'm entirely okay.

396
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,390
I'm a little appalled at her taste.

397
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,140
Wash, you there yet?

398
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,560
All but.

399
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,020
- Nice day for a last stand, eh?
- Nope.

400
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Plan to make a few stands after this.

401
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,780
Just hoping for air support
from your quarter.

402
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,740
Couple of low flyovers,
engines tipped earthward at full-blast.

403
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,700
Should give our guests something other
than killing you to think about.

404
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,700
What I like to hear. Out.

405
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,620
Malcolm seem a little funny to you
at breakfast this morning?

406
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,540
Come on, Kaylee.

407
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,960
We all know I'm the funny one.

408
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,010
You ladies and gentlemen
all locked and loaded?

409
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,010
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Remember...

410
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,390
shoot the man, not the horse. Dead
horse is cover. Live horse, pile of panic.

411
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,480
Now, girl, that is just plain dirty.

412
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,600
You are aware your radio's transmitting.

413
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,020
Because I don't feel particularly girlish
or dirty at the moment.

414
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,450
Yeah, just up here waiting, captain.
Ready, 100 percent.

415
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,950
Better be.

416
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,710
You're stronger than this thing.

417
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,670
I can feel it in your grip.

418
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,290
Petaleen, look at me.

419
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,500
This is just a moment in time.

420
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,130
Step aside and let it happen.

421
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,640
- How is she, doctor?
- She's at 10 centimetres. Not long now.

422
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,020
Inara, I thought
it was just him that...

423
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,150
Nandy, believe me, I'll be fine.

424
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,180
Morning.

425
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,190
- How are you doing?
- A might tense.

426
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,320
I'd like you on the balcony with me.
See everyone from there...

427
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,990
- You didn't give me the whole truth.
- About what?

428
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,400
About her feelings for you.

429
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,780
- I really don't know...
- Looks like imminent violence!

430
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,850
Zoe, Jayne, you seeing this?

431
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,140
Gotta be 30 men out there.

432
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,140
Confirm that.
Plus a mounted gun on that hovercraft.

433
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,770
What's that you said
about running for it?

434
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,400
Okay, folks!

435
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,440
We got no shortage of ugly riding in
on us. But that don't change the plan.

436
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,780
Anybody goes down, drag them
to the back and get back to shooting.

437
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,990
Only way to help them's
to finish this.

438
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,050
Wash, we'll be trading
injuries in under two minutes.

439
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,930
I'd like my sky a bit less empty.

440
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,640
Copy that, Mal. We...

441
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,410
Open her up!

442
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,990
Cover!

443
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,520
Jayne, I do believe
that's our first hurdle.

444
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,600
You might...

445
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,610
I think I might, captain.

446
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,980
Fire!

447
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,460
What have I done?

448
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:58,970
Go!

449
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,560
Wash! Where the hell is my spaceship?

450
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,870
Rotten lasers!
Book! Zoe! Second hurdle!

451
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,890
That's it, Petaleen.
One more push.

452
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,520
That's the shoulders!

453
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,390
Good!

454
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,410
Jayne? I lost visual on Burgess!

455
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,000
Same here.

456
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,020
Take to right!

457
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,820
Whoo-hoo!

458
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,070
Hey! There he is! Get him!

459
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,200
Come on, let's get him!

460
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,090
Try the other side!

461
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Got you!

462
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,930
Open this door!

463
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,600
Nobody's going...

464
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,520
anywhere.

465
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,770
- It's...
- It's a boy. Healthy.

466
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,900
Good morning, Petaleen.

467
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,400
How's my boy?

468
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,750
No!

469
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,010
Rans.

470
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,720
Most of your men are either dead,
dying or run off.

471
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,680
That don't matter none.
I got what I came here for.

472
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,390
- Ain't leaving here with it.
- This is my blood, woman!

473
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,770
No! This is your blood!

474
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,940
Now you hand that child over
nice and slow...

475
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,360
or I'll spill
more than you can spare.

476
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,410
- You're gonna pay for what you've took.
- She was just a whore!

477
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,750
Petaleen! You bring my baby out
right now!

478
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,760
You hear me? I wanna see my son!

479
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,190
Rans, this is Jonah.

480
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,690
Jonah, say hi to your daddy.

481
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,700
Say goodbye to your daddy, Jonah.

482
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,830
Go on! Go on home!

483
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,330
You go with them.

484
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,690
I think those girls'll do all right.

485
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,820
She taught them well.

486
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,650
Yeah.

487
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,790
I'm glad you were with her,
her last night.

488
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,210
- I am.
- Yeah, well, I ain't.

489
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,090
Hell, I wish I never met her.

490
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,000
Then I wouldn't have failed her.

491
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,720
That wasn't the way of it.

492
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,220
That's a kindness.

493
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,600
But nothing you say
will convince me different.

494
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Well, I'm still glad.

495
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,730
So you weren't before?

496
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,360
Inara.

497
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,620
I ain't looking for anything
from you.

498
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,750
I'm just...

499
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,210
Just feeling
kind of truth some right now.

500
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,920
And, uh...

501
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,090
And life's just too damn short
for ifs and maybes.

502
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,010
I learned something from Nandy.

503
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,430
Not just from what happened,
but from her.

504
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,390
The family she made...

505
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,520
the strength of her love for them,
it's what kept them together.

506
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,150
When you live...

507
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,620
with that kind of strength...

508
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,330
you get tied to it.

509
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,750
You can't break away.

510
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,370
And you never want to.

511
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,540
There's something...

512
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,220
There's something I should have done
a long while ago.

513
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,180
And I'm sorry...

514
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,010
for both of us,
that it took me this long.

515
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,360
I'm leaving.
