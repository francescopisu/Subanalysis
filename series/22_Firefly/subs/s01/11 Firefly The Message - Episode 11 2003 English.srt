11 Firefly The Message - Episode 11 2003 English

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,670
We are not alone!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,420
Forget what you think you know.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,710
Forget what your mother told you
when she tucked you in at night.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,800
Forget the lies of our oppressive...

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,050
allied governments.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,970
Behind this curtain is the very secret
they do not want you to see.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,850
The most astounding scientific find
in the history of humanity...

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,680
proof of alien life!

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,690
That's right. Go ahead and laugh, sir.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,570
But what you'll see inside this room
will change your life forever.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,820
It will haunt your dreams and harrow,
yes, your very soul.

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,870
Yep. It's a cow fetus.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,780
Guess so.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,660
Does seem to have an awful lot of limbs.

16
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,910
It's mutated.

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,750
But a cow? How do you figure?

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,880
It's upside down.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,420
Cow.

21
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,970
Yep.

22
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,640
And I'm out 12 bits.

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,220
I really know how to show a girl...

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,190
a disgusting time.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,650
No, it's...

26
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,940
sweet.

27
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,860
Poor thing never saw the light of day.
Now it's in show business.

28
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,320
You manage to find the bright side
of every single thing.

29
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,500
Also, we've...

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,870
got this booth to ourselves
for five whole minutes.

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,710
- We're not alone, remember?
- He's not gonna squawk.

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,630
Tell me more good stuff about me.

33
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,340
Uh...

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,550
Well, you're kind of a genius,
when it comes to machines.

35
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,520
You always say what you mean.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,140
And your eyes...

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,140
Yeah? Eyes, yeah?

38
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,650
And, um...

39
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,110
I don't know how to...

40
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,280
Well, plus...

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,030
every other girl I know is either
married, professional...

42
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,910
or closely related to me...

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,790
so you're more or less, literally,
the only girl in the world.

44
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,550
- Hm, that's a hell of a thing to say.
- I was joking.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,010
Oh, no, no, I get it. I do.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,970
Back on Osiris, you probably had nurses
and debutantes crawling all over you...

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,930
but down here, at the bottom
of the barrel, it's just me.

48
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
No. That's not even...

49
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,020
I'm glad I rated higher
than dead Bessie, here.

50
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,400
Oh, my God, it's grotesque!

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,200
Oh, and there's something in a jar.

52
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,240
Scare her away again, did you?

53
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,910
This may come as a shock,
but I'm actually...

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,880
not very good at talking to girls.

55
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,590
Why, is there someone you
are good at talking to?

56
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,260
Do not fear me.
Ours is a peaceful race...

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,390
and we must live in harmony.

58
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,600
- Struck out again?
- It's like something out of a fable.

59
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,680
This priceless artefact, the biggest score
of my career and no one will touch it.

60
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,480
The Lassiter's universally known.

61
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,230
Fencing it is like fencing the Mona Lisa.

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,820
Well, but...

63
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,110
Mona who?

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,870
You're out of your league.

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,700
You should consider my offer.

66
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,700
I'm done thinking about that,
and you are to stay clear.

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,330
- I know people in highest ranks...
- Jabber, jabber, I ain't listening.

68
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,000
Just because you helped out on the job
don't make you a crook.

69
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,800
I will not have you jeopardising
your career over this.

70
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,260
The career you abhor and look down on?

71
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,010
I just don't want you in the way
of trouble. Take it as you like.

72
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,390
Amnon!

73
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
- How you been?
- Malcolm!

74
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,890
An old friend's face is a balm in this age.

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,520
- You holding some post for me?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,980
Got quite a haul.

77
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,400
- You can sign for everyone?
- Sure.

78
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,990
- Any packages for me?
- Don't know yet.

79
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,990
My food is problematic.

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,780
Girl's a mind-reading genius. Can't
figure out how to eat an ice-planet.

81
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,620
- Did you get everything?
- Yeah.

82
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,620
They didn't have rounds for the bunder,
but we're ammo'd up pretty good.

83
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,420
I got a discount on account of my
intimidating manner.

84
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,420
Oh.

85
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,640
This one's addressed to you
and Zoe, Mal.

86
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,350
I don't remember ordering parts.

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,520
- The little one's for Cobb.
- I got post?

88
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,440
Might we all want to step a few paces
back before he opens that.

89
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,440
Ha, ha! It's from my mother.

90
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,030
- So do aliens live among us?
- Yeah. One of them's a doctor.

91
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,860
"My dear boy, I hope you are well...

92
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,410
and that you get this soon
in your travels."

93
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,580
- Did you order any equipment?
- No, sir.

94
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,920
"Thank you for the credits
you forwarded."

95
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,590
They have helped, as Mattie
is still sick with the Damplung.

96
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,010
I made you the enclosed...

97
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,650
Enclosed, to keep you warm
in your travels.

98
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,570
Hope to hear from you soon.
Love...

99
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
"your mother."

100
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,900
How's it sit? Pretty cunning,
don't you think?

101
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,160
I think it's the sweetest hat ever.

102
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,490
A man walks down the street in that,
people know he's not afraid of anything.

103
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,120
Damn straight.

104
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,540
Let's hope we get some funny hats too.

105
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,980
What did you all order a dead guy for?

106
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,280
Thanks.

107
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,780
I didn't know you were out there.

108
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,320
Sort of the point. Stealth.

109
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,950
You may have heard of it.

110
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,950
I don't think they covered that in basic.

111
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,750
Well, at least they covered
dropping your weapon...

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,130
so you can eat beans
and get yourself shot.

113
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,630
Yeah, I got a badge in that.

114
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,380
- Won't happen again.
- If it does, I'm just gonna watch.

115
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,600
Anything interesting out there?
If you don't mind my asking.

116
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,850
About 30 troops behind those buildings.

117
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,730
Mortars. No rollers yet.

118
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,020
I expect they plan to peck at us
for a spell before they charge.

119
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,570
They had two scouts sniffing.

120
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,030
I took them down.

121
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,950
Wow, I didn't hear a single thing.

122
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,910
First rule of battle, little one...

123
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,120
don't ever let them know
where you are.

124
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,370
Whee-hee!
I'm right here! I'm right here!

125
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,920
You want some of me?!
Yeah, you do! Come on!

126
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,040
Come on!

127
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,880
Whoo-hoo!

128
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,760
There are other schools of thought.

129
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,930
Whew! Ha! That was bracing.

130
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,600
Don't like it when you shoot
at them. I worked that out myself.

131
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,100
- Did you find Vitelli?
- Vitelli is out of it.

132
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,940
The bumble bee laid down arms
at the first sign of inevitable defeat.

133
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,070
Can you imagine
such a cowardly creature?

134
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
South west corridor's open, huh?

135
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,490
- Tracey, ain't you dead yet?
- Through no fault of my own.

136
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,950
I really wanted your beans.

137
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,870
They're gonna come right through here.
They got rollers?

138
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,490
They got every damn thing.

139
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,830
How's the lieutenant?

140
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,580
Started screaming, all of a sudden,
about his arms, where is his arms?

141
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,750
- We had to go find them.
- What happened?

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,210
He ain't even hurt.
He got 10 fingers on his hands...

143
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,760
but he's screaming
like they're gone, crying.

144
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,800
And he ain't said a word in two hours.

145
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,180
Sir? Do we hold?

146
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,390
I don't wanna die here. Forgive me.

147
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,190
This rock ain't worth it. Not our lives.

148
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,690
Everybody dies.

149
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,070
Someone's carrying a bullet for you
right now who doesn't know it.

150
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,570
The trick is, die of old age
before it finds you.

151
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,120
We could still cut through
the 22nd at school system.

152
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,660
Make a decent stand there.

153
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,700
Well, we can't do any good here.

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,910
I sure as hell ain't gonna lay down arms.

155
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Zoe...

156
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,500
you heard the lieutenant give
the order to join the 22nd?

157
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,420
- I did.
- Round them up, then.

158
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,930
- You heard him too.
- I ain't gonna rat you out.

159
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,100
Ain't me I'm worried on.
If lieutenant gets his mind back...

160
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,680
this shouldn't go on his record.
Ain't his fault.

161
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,020
More than he'd probably...

162
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,100
Seeker!

163
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,280
- Is it bad? Ls it bad?
- It's glorious!

164
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,910
- We gotta move!
- I can't!

165
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,410
We gotta run!
Zoe, get the lieutenant.

166
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,210
You know the old saying.

167
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,930
Well, it don't make any kind of sense.
Zoe?

168
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,800
I got nothing. But it's definitely Tracey.

169
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,970
You know this guy?

170
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,810
Is this a warning of some kind?

171
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,390
Mal, you gotta get this thing
out of my station.

172
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,190
No, no, no. Human transport
on a postal route...

173
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,480
is very illegal.

174
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,520
If anyone knows I took a corpse,
I'll lose my franchise.

175
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,990
- Who sent it?
- I don't know. There was no return.

176
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,200
- How long has it been here?
- A week.

177
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,910
- This can't stay here.
- He don't smell.

178
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,200
I know. Been decently preserved.

179
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,080
Give me a hand.

180
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,250
- We're taking him on board?
- We are.

181
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,960
- I don't see the percentage in that.
- Don't strain your brain trying.

182
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,260
It might break something.

183
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
We got it.

184
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,440
What's going on?

185
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,270
Did we get something fun?

186
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,740
You are such a boob.

187
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,830
How do we know he ain't
plague-ridden, or something?

188
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,000
- We know.
- We don't, actually.

189
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,550
I mean, I respect that you guys
have a history, but what are you doing?

190
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,880
If you want me to do a proper autopsy...

191
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,130
- Cut him up?
- Not just yet, thank you, doctor.

192
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,630
Robot.

193
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,890
What do you got?

194
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,150
Um, okay, uh...

195
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,650
Recording. Hi, I guess.

196
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,950
This is a message for Zoe
and for Malcolm Reynolds...

197
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,910
and I really hope you all
are the ones listening to it.

198
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,790
I'll spare you the boring details...

199
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,500
falling in with untrustworthy folk...

200
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,710
making a bunch of bad calls.

201
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,340
All that matters is I expect
to be shuffled off...

202
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,180
and you two are the only people
I trust to get me where I'm going...

203
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,890
which is home.

204
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,350
I'd like my body to be with my folks
on St. Albans.

205
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,230
We got the family plot there,
and my mom and dad, well...

206
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,900
they deserve to know I died.

207
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,650
You know, it's funny, we went
to the war never looking to come back...

208
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,450
but it's the real world
I couldn't survive.

209
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,870
You two carried me through that war...

210
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,540
and now I need you to carry me
just a little bit further, if you can.

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,710
Tell my folks I wanted to do right by
them and that I'm at peace and all.

212
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,550
When you can't run anymore, you crawl,
and when you can't do that, well...

213
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,010
Yeah, you know the rest.
Thanks, both of you.

214
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,640
Oh, yeah, and make sure my eyes
is closed, will you?

215
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,980
Wash?

216
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,270
St. Albans is a two-day ride
if we burn hard enough.

217
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,030
- That might make your schedule...
- It's all right.

218
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,640
That's right, gentlemen,
you have been told tales all your life...

219
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,730
but alien races exist among us.
The proof is right inside.

220
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,230
You'll be amazed and astounded.

221
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,330
Can I help you?

222
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,290
You are an ugly-looking little quim,
you know that?

223
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,830
- If there's a problem, I can...
- You must be asking yourself...

224
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,670
how repulsive-looking the guy that's
gonna make you his woman gonna be?

225
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,220
I mean, prison is a lonely place.

226
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,600
You sure as a hundred moons ain't
gonna be pitching.

227
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,310
So, what kind of sorry-ass troll is gonna
get blue enough to grapple with you?

228
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,150
Shudder to think.

229
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,610
I've broken no law.

230
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,030
Transportation of human cargo,
especially dead cargo...

231
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,530
through the allied postal system
is punishable by five to 10 years.

232
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,620
Plus, you don't know this yet,
but you resisted arrest.

233
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,080
- Where's my body?
- I don't know.

234
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,250
The dead guy. He got shipped here.

235
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,970
- He shipped back out, I guess. Where?
- I never saw a body.

236
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,010
But wait. There was a crate
big enough for one.

237
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,720
I mean, I did hand that over,
just a little while ago.

238
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,600
Lovely. Who got it?

239
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,190
Um...

240
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,940
Here.

241
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,200
Malcolm Reynolds.
Where do you suppose he's off to?

242
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,490
He captains a Firefly. You should be
able to capture him if you leave now.

243
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,750
- Are you telling me to leave?
- No, I didn't mean that.

244
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,290
Relax. You've been great.

245
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,380
I was just bluffing about arresting you.
Who needs that kind of paperwork?

246
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,880
Skunk, light him on fire.

247
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,380
No, wait! I told you everything...

248
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,550
Come on, come on!
I told you what I knew!

249
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,010
What...? What do you...?
I... I just...

250
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,520
Tell anyone we were here...

251
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,140
warn Capt.. Reynolds
that we're coming...

252
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,230
and you'll wish that we burned you.

253
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,230
Good.

254
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,110
Boys, let's go find us a corpse.

255
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,830
I really hope you all are the ones
listening to it.

256
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,590
I'll spare you the boring details...

257
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,380
falling in with untrustworthy folk,
making a bunch of bad calls.

258
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,010
All that matters is I expect
to be shuffled off...

259
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,890
and you two are the only people
I trust to get me where I'm going...

260
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,770
which is home.

261
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,480
I'd like my body to be with my folks
on St. Albans.

262
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,190
We got the family plot there,
and my mom and dad, well...

263
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,740
they deserve to know I died.

264
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,410
You know, it's funny, we went to
the war never looking to come back...

265
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,290
but it's the real world
I couldn't survive.

266
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,590
Sorry, preacher.
Am I making too much noise?

267
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,130
No, no. I was just...

268
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,130
saying a few words.

269
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,970
Don't know the boy's denomination,
but...

270
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,770
Oh, no, it's good. The Lord should
ought to look after the dead.

271
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,060
You wanna do a set? I'll spot you.

272
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,820
I'm not so terribly in the mood.

273
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,700
Most people
is pretty quiet about now.

274
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,540
Me? I see a stiff, one I didn't have to
kill myself, I just get the urge to...

275
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,620
you know, do stuff,
like work out or run around...

276
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,250
maybe get some trim,
if there's a willing woman about.

277
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,800
Not that I get flush with corpses
or anything. I ain't crazy.

278
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,760
It makes sense. Looking to feel alive
out of adventure.

279
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,600
Now, for psychology,
that don't sound half-dumb.

280
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,600
My kind of life don't last long, preacher.

281
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:16,060
So I expect I'm invested in
making good sport of it whilst I can.

282
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,480
You gonna read over me
when I get taken down?

283
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,030
Oh, I suspect you'll be around
long after we're all gone.

284
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,530
What the hell are you doing?

285
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,290
- River, that might not be the best place...
- I'm very comfortable.

286
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,630
I guess we do all have
different reactions to death.

287
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,800
I thought I was gonna die.

288
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,760
- How could he possibly even...?
- The colonel was dead drunk.

289
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,220
Three hours pissing on
about the enlisted men.

290
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:55,770
"They're scum. They're not fighters."
And then he passed right out. Boom.

291
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:02,320
We couldn't even move him,
so Tracey snipped it right off his face.

292
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,450
And you never seen a man more proud
of his moustache than him.

293
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,500
I mean, I will never love a woman
the way this officer loved that lip ferret.

294
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,290
Big walrussy thing, all waxed up.

295
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,840
Did he find out?

296
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,170
Oh, the next morning, he wakes up,
it's gone and he is furious!

297
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,430
But he can't just say, you know,
"Someone stole my moustache!"

298
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,220
So he calls together all the platoons.

299
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,810
- We thought he was gonna shoot us.
- He's eye balling us something fierce.

300
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,440
Not a word. He comes up to Tracey, and
Tracey's wearing the thing on his face!

301
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,320
He glued it on!

302
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,780
He's staring the old man down
wearing his own damn moustache.

303
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,990
Oh, God.

304
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,450
Well, the colonel must have said...

305
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,670
- Are we hit?
- That was too damn close.

306
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,500
They're behind us.
Fire over the port bow.

307
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,380
- Warning shot?
- They could've hit us.

308
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,720
Feds.

309
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,430
This is Lt. Womack
of Allied Enforcement.

310
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,470
You're in possession of stolen goods...

311
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,470
and are ordered to cut thrust
and prepare for docking.

312
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,220
- The Lassiter.
- That was quick.

313
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,310
Do you think Saffron tipped them off?

314
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,810
This is Capt.. Reynolds.
I think there's been a mistake.

315
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,690
There's been a lot of mistakes.

316
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,570
The latest of which is you taking
that crate.

317
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,240
Um, we took in a lot of inventory today.

318
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,240
If something got mixed in, we'll hand it
back, but I don't think we're your men.

319
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,580
Let me check through the cargo.
Is it marked?

320
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,120
I'd think twice about playing games
with me there, mister.

321
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,920
I will blow you to pieces.

322
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,960
You do that, your precious crate's
gonna be in shards.

323
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,260
I got deliveries to make, so you
just lock on to my trajectory...

324
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,890
and I'll take a look here,
see if anything matches your description.

325
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,850
- Police procedure has changed.
- He calls back, you keep him occupied.

326
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,100
- What do I do? Shadow puppets?
- We'll take care of it.

327
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,860
- I don't get this. They're after Tracey?
- Or there's something else in that box.

328
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,980
Anything?

329
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,610
Not unless this crate's made of
magical wish-granting planks.

330
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,320
Check his pockets.

331
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,660
- That ain't right.
- Well, neither is being blowed up.

332
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,540
- Nothing about this sits right with me.
- Empty.

333
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,750
Well, they want this body for something,
and I'm guessing it ain't a proper burial.

334
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,010
Well, doctor, I guess
you are doing an autopsy.

335
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,140
You really think there's
something in there?

336
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,930
Using corpses for smuggling
is a time-honoured, repulsive custom.

337
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,890
Maybe it's gold.

338
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,940
And maybe he was a friend of ours,
and you need to show a little respect.

339
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,610
I got respect. I'm just saying...

340
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,530
gold.

341
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,150
He's been open before.

342
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,030
How's that?

343
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,370
It's... It's good work.
Scar's nearly invisible, but...

344
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,660
Well, let's see what's in there.

345
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,600
- Get a hold of him!
- Spry, for a dead fella.

346
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,480
Settle down! Settle!
That's enough.

347
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,270
- He was cutting on me, sarge.
- I know. I told him to.

348
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,060
- You told him to? What for?
- Because you were dead!

349
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,610
Huh? Oh.

350
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,200
Right. I suppose I was.

351
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,490
- Hey, there, Zoe.
- Private.

352
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,120
- You feeling a mite calmer now?
- Yes, sarge.

353
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,040
- Um, sarge?
- Yeah?

354
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,290
I think I'm naked.

355
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,340
Sorry for jumping on you the way I did.

356
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,180
I was a little confounded.

357
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,890
Rising from that state can
be disorienting. Was it byphodine?

358
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,140
Can you bring that pan, please?

359
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,100
The drug you took to make it
appear you were dead.

360
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,690
Remember what it was called?

361
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,280
Never did ask. The guy who sold
it to me said I'd be under a week or so.

362
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,280
He told me I wouldn't dream, but I did.
I dreamt of my family.

363
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,410
You can take that.

364
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,040
All right.

365
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,210
Wanna explain exactly why you got
yourself all corpsified and mailed to me?

366
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,880
What are you running from?

367
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,380
Running to, not from.

368
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,180
I just wanted to get home, that's all.
That's all I ever wanted.

369
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,180
Except there's them
that take exception to that...

370
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:46,600
to me leaving while I was
in possession of their property.

371
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,440
What'd you boost, Tracey?

372
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,110
- Was it gold?
- More importantly...

373
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,240
who'd you boost it from?

374
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,570
- Well...
- Captain, I don't mean to...

375
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,080
We may have a medical emergency here.

376
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,830
This man appears to be in cardiac arrest.

377
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,500
What? Tracey, are you
having a heart attack?

378
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,460
It don't look like he is.

379
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,510
Don't pay any attention to your
machines, doc. They'll fib to you.

380
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,670
Heart's just fine. Better than fine.

381
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,390
Just runs a little hotter than the usual,
that's all.

382
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,260
My God! It's not just the heart muscle,
it's everything.

383
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,600
All the moving parts.

384
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,980
That's what I took, Mal.
That's what they want back.

385
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,610
Tracey, are you gonna tell me what in
the chin-cha-doh you're talking about?

386
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,450
Sure, sarge.

387
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,990
Sure.

388
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,670
- Thank you.
- So your innards ain't your innards?

389
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,300
They got scooped out.

390
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,760
Replaced every bit.

391
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,850
What'd you wanna go and do that for?

392
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,390
For the money.

393
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,480
They're paying me to transport what
they stuck in.

394
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,600
You're smuggling human organs?

395
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,690
They're grown in a lab.
Only way to move them is in a person.

396
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,650
- Not sure why.
- The technology's not ready.

397
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,610
Blastomeres are unapproved.

398
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,200
Likely unstable. You're not
just a carrier, you're an incubator.

399
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,830
I was supposed to be at the drop
two weeks ago. Clinic in Ariel.

400
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,290
They were to open me up, take out
the goods and put my own organs back.

401
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,540
- So, what happened?
- Better offer.

402
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,750
Another buyer was willing to go
three times the going rate.

403
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,840
Enough so I could get my folks
off that rock they live on...

404
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,550
set them up some place better.
Some place warm.

405
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,390
That's real nice.

406
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,270
But your better offer went south.

407
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,440
Yeah, I got myself in a little bit
of a pickle, sarge.

408
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,520
The folks I was working for
got wind of what I had planned.

409
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,570
I showed up, my new buyer was dead...

410
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,570
and some men were waiting for me.

411
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,280
But you got away.

412
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,080
Only just.

413
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,830
I knew they'd never stop looking for me
so long as I was alive.

414
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,420
Thought my chances would be better
if I weren't.

415
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,130
So you died and figured
they'd stop looking for you?

416
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,050
Yep.

417
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,430
I think maybe you figured wrong.

418
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,230
I think they're about done
being stalled to...

419
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,190
Mal!

420
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,450
- Your dead army buddy's on the bridge!
- He ain't dead.

421
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,660
- Oh.
- How far are we to St. Albans?

422
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,660
Five minutes from atmo.

423
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,250
Bring up the terrain specs.
Kaylee, get him out of here!

424
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Strap in!

425
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,040
This is Capt.. Reynolds.

426
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,420
Reynolds, I'm a dangerous-minded man
on a ship loaded with hurt.

427
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,720
Now, why you got me chatting
with your peons?

428
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,010
Tracey, you go on down below.
We'll handle this.

429
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,430
Uh, uh... Just seeing to some
technical difficulties.

430
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,180
I'm not interested, captain.

431
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,310
I stepped over a lot of bodies
to get to that one you got in your hold.

432
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,270
You play this right and yours
won't have to be among them.

433
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,490
- Sarge...
- The captain ordered you off the bridge!

434
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,900
Come on.

435
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,780
We'd love to let you dock...

436
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,080
but that buck knocked out
our fore-couple.

437
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,330
So we have to park it
if you want the tour.

438
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,500
All right, captain. We can do this
on the ground just as easy.

439
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,130
Yeah, easy. There.

440
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,920
- Think you can do it?
- Watch me.

441
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:47,640
Attention, crew, this is the captain.
Sit down and hang on to something.

442
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,280
Uh, you okay?

443
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,580
- So I can let go of you now?
- Oh, you can.

444
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,450
Yeah.

445
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,540
All this hard banking...

446
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,090
when the gravity drive
and actual gravity...

447
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,130
start working against each other...

448
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,130
it tosses the lunch about.
Your pilot's pretty wild.

449
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,050
He can thread a needle with this bird.
He's the best.

450
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,470
That's good to know.

451
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,850
- So are you and he...?
- Sweeties? Oh, hell, no!

452
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,400
He's married to Zoe.

453
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,570
- Zoe got married?
- Yeah.

454
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,900
Yeah, next, you'll be telling me
she smiles, has emotions.

455
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,530
She must have been stone-cold
during the war.

456
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,620
I think the sarge was even a little bit
afraid of her. Now she's married.

457
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,340
Well, that's good.
People making a life for each other.

458
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,840
Had enough of this goose-run.

459
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,970
Don't need no ante-tour of this ice cube.

460
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,050
- Now, let's park it!
- Just looking for a good spot.

461
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,810
What is it?

462
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,350
It's a little strange.
There's a Fed station right here...

463
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,230
but our friends haven't made
a transmission since they broke atmo.

464
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,570
So, what about you?

465
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,570
Oh, you know, mostly just...

466
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:37,750
stuff like this. Just finding myself
in one scrape or another.

467
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,250
Sorry to drag you all into this.

468
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,420
Oh, danger's pretty much our business.

469
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,720
Still, if you got put in a bad spot at all,
Kaylee...

470
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,340
I'd be real unhappy.

471
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,970
Get ready for a hard burn.

472
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,560
They'd be crazy to follow us in here.

473
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,040
They're not behind us anymore.

474
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,380
I didn't think of that.

475
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,230
Oh! Whoa, okay! Ah!

476
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,690
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

477
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,650
- This kind of flying wakes up a guy!
- Awake helps.

478
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,590
There. Now...

479
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,510
if we shut down the main power...

480
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,970
They might not read our auxiliary
under all this.

481
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,310
What if they come down
to get a visual?

482
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,730
She's not a small ship.

483
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,190
We're not moving.

484
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,190
Why aren't we moving?

485
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,780
Probably part of some genius plan
to give the Feds the slip.

486
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,570
Yeah, probably.

487
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,620
What was that?

488
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,040
Sounds like full-yield mag drops.

489
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,670
I think they picked up a little
triangulation in cop school.

490
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,340
1001.

491
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,300
- 1002.
- River?

492
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,640
I'm counting between lightning
and thunder...

493
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,930
to see if the storm's coming or going.

494
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,810
1005.

495
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,740
Options?

496
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,950
Well, we're only as good as long as
the roof holds out. Direct hit above us...

497
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,830
ship's electrics will be fried.

498
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,910
- We'll have to climb out.
- Yeah, or get dug out.

499
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,590
Getting closer.

500
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,000
Captain, there is another way.

501
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,550
Uh, captain said to stay put.

502
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,090
I just wanna see what's happening.

503
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,220
We're cornered, and it's only
a matter of time before they find us...

504
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,100
what's left of us.
Let's not wait for that to happen.

505
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,560
What are you saying?

506
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,020
I'm saying we make good
on what we said we were gonna do.

507
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,400
Let's call them.

508
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,070
Fly out of this canyon, let them board.

509
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,700
Give ourselves up?

510
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,280
It's our only choice.

511
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,910
We let them board,
we're taking an awful chance.

512
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,660
- These boys ain't playing, preacher.
- I'm aware of that.

513
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,970
That one was really close.

514
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,930
That tears it. I'm with the preacher.

515
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:26,020
I ain't getting snowed in permanent
on account of some jackass kid!

516
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,060
It's the only option, captain.

517
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,480
Wash, call the cops.
Tell them we give up.

518
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,650
No, thank you!

519
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,200
- Tracey, what are you doing?
- I said, no!

520
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,950
Those bastards want to yank out
this million-credit meat...

521
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,740
and leave me bleeding.

522
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,370
Now turn off that radio!

523
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,210
Twerp's gonna get us killed!

524
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,840
Don't you move!
Don't anybody move!

525
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,550
All right, we need to power up.
We need to run. Now!

526
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,760
Put that thing down.
You have no idea...

527
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,800
Oh, shut it, Shepherd!

528
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,390
Or I swear to your god,
I will shoot you dead if you do not!

529
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,310
Sarge! Zoe! What are you doing
with this Bible thumper?

530
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,850
- Wash, call the cops.
- But...

531
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,070
I'll kill him!
I'll put a hole right through him!

532
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,900
You mailed your ugly business
to Zoe and me, Tracey.

533
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,700
Cash on delivery.

534
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,660
I'll go to hell before I watch you
turn and bite us for the favour.

535
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,000
Wash, call them up, tell them
we'll meet them topside.

536
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,130
- No, thank you!
- Do it.

537
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,300
No!

538
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,220
You shot me.

539
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,560
Damn right.

540
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,560
- That's enough shooting.
- Wash!

541
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,560
- Ow?
- Everybody calm down.

542
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,810
- Kaylee, get out of there!
- You're a rabbit, Mal!

543
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,950
Hurry! Hurry!

544
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,240
I probably scared you back there,
didn't I?

545
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,070
Did you see his face? It was great.

546
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,700
- You're really bleeding.
- Yep. They shot me.

547
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,460
- Why?
- Because they wanna sell me off.

548
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:18,420
You won't let them do that, will you,
Kaylee? Because, you know, I think...

549
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,050
you and I really had a moment
back there.

550
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,680
- Tracey?
- You know, Kaylee...

551
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,680
I need to fly out of here.
Can we take the shuttle and go?

552
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,100
- I ain't going anywhere with you.
- Nobody's going anywhere, private.

553
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,730
Captain, what is going on?

554
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,270
Don't make me.

555
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,400
Far as I can see, no one's made you
do anything.

556
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,610
You brought this on yourself.

557
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,570
Got in over your head with those
stone-cold gut-runners.

558
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,740
Then you panicked, brought
the whole mess down on all of us.

559
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,210
- That ain't what happened.
- Oh, yes, that's what happened.

560
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,920
I'm thinking some of that trail of bodies
Womack talked about was left by you.

561
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,460
And you ain't left a trail of bodies,
work you do?

562
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,970
- Because your rep speaks elsewise.
- Weren't bodies of people helping me.

563
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,470
And you're helping out lots.
Because I needed a chest wound.

564
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
That can be seen to.

565
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,810
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- In every way possible.

566
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,060
Do you know why I picked you and Zoe?
Because you're saps!

567
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,650
You repping out as stone killers...

568
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,660
but I still remember the old sarge
with his stories and his homilies...

569
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,330
of glory and honour.
Maybe you should have listened.

570
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,910
Yeah, well, what are you now?

571
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,960
What are we now, Mal?

572
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,210
See there?

573
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,050
You hear that quiet?

574
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,800
Means the call's already been made.

575
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,970
Well, that call...

576
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,140
That call means you just murdered me.

577
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,320
No, son...

578
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,490
you murdered yourself.

579
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,290
I just carried the bullet a while.

580
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,600
Well, now, somebody left the dog
off the leash.

581
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,480
I've been shot too many times
to be scared by a gun.

582
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,270
Womack, I think I broke your junk.

583
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,780
A little problem during shipping.

584
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,820
Don't think I have to tell you folk
the kind of trouble you're in!

585
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,370
Wetware smuggling, resisting
and fleeing an officer of the law.

586
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm sure the search of the ship
will come up with another few felonies.

587
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,590
You won't be searching the ship,
Womack.

588
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
- That so?
- It is.

589
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,430
You won't be taking us in.
Nor the boy who's dying up there.

590
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,720
Now, I'm authorised to kill as I like.

591
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,760
Shepherds notwithstanding.

592
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,430
Why is it you didn't call in for backup?

593
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,230
There's a Fed station 80 miles
from where you're standing.

594
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,280
You got your command stripes
at the Silver Hold colonies.

595
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,200
Puts you about eight sectors away
from your jurisdiction.

596
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,950
Since you're running this job
on the side...

597
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,000
you took pains to keep your
presence here secret.

598
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,910
I doubt it would bother anyone...

599
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,210
if we laid your bodies to rest
at the bottom of one of these canyons.

600
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,310
It's damaged goods anyhow.

601
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,440
That hat makes you look like an idiot.

602
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,660
So...

603
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,210
that was the plan?

604
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,170
That was a good plan.

605
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,170
I think so.

606
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,930
Um, you...

607
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,180
You weren't that far off
about me being stupid.

608
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,520
I never could get my life working right.

609
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,190
Not once after the war.

610
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:53,450
Kaylee, I'm so sorry. I didn't...

611
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,450
- Sarge?
- Right here.

612
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:05,870
You... That stupid message of mine...

613
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,960
and I was trying to play you guys.

614
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,500
And now...

615
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,130
you'll do it.

616
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,800
- You'll get me home.
- Yeah.

617
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,640
- Yeah.
- Well, you know the old saying:

618
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,530
When you can't run, you crawl...

619
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,120
and when you can't crawl,
when you can't do that...

620
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,160
You find someone to carry you.

621
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,680
You know, it's funny...

622
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,140
we went to the war
never looking to come back...

623
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,100
but it's the real world
I couldn't survive.

624
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,190
You two carried me through that war...

625
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,660
and now I need you to carry me
just a little bit further...

626
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,490
if you can.

627
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,470
Tell my folks I wanted to do right
by them and that I'm at peace and all.

628
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:13,920
When you can't run anymore, you crawl,
and when you can't do that, well...

629
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,630
yeah, you know the rest.
