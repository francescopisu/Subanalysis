13 Firefly Objects In Space - Episode 13 2002 English

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,910
We're all just floating.

3
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,920
- You couldn't possibly...
- No, I wish I was lying.

4
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,470
I just, you know,
we'd all just made surgeon.

5
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,810
That was it. We were the elite.
The world was ours, you know.

6
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,430
So you had to be naked?

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,440
Naked, yes. And on top
of the statue of Hippocrates.

8
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,650
- Can you just picture me?
- What, naked?

9
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,660
Oh, well, let's see,
I'm gonna have to conjure up...

10
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,240
Yeah, that's gonna be difficult.

11
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,370
- So did the Feds come?
- There were no Feds.

12
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,250
- Until I started singing.
- Oh, no...

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
- No, this is not...
- What did you sing?

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,340
This is not funny. This is a
morality tale about the evils of sake.

15
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,680
I would be there right now.

16
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,350
I mean, it was...
It was either...

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,650
It was either that
or the national anthem.

18
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,820
- Reports vary.
- You don't remember any of this?

19
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,370
I remember talking the Feds
out of telling my father.

20
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,030
Or paying the Feds
out of telling my father.

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,290
I get fuzzy on aspects.

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,050
So, like, never?

23
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,180
Well...

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,760
no.

25
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,260
Not ever never?

26
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,600
Some orders allow shepherds to marry,
but I follow a narrower path.

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,570
But, I mean, you still got the urge?
They don't cut it off or nothing?

28
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,650
No. I'm more or less intact.

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,030
I just direct
my energy elsewhere.

30
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,080
You mean, like masturbating?

31
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,660
I hope you're not thinking
of taking orders yourself.

32
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,460
Yeah, that'll be the day.

33
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,340
I got stupid.
The money was too good.

34
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,550
I don't give half a hump
if you're innocent or not.

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,880
So where does that put you?

36
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,010
It ain't impossible. Saint Jayne.
It's got a ring to it.

37
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,810
I'm just trying to remember
how many miracles you've performed.

38
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,520
I once hit a guy from 500 yards
with a bent scope.

39
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,820
- Don't that count upstairs?
- Oh, it'll be taken into consideration.

40
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,150
You made that
sound kind of ominous.

41
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,480
I put out waves
to some old acquaintances.

42
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,030
I may even find something in
New Melbourne if you need the shuttle.

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,320
I'll only be there to pick up cargo.

44
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,120
The only thing you're gonna find there
is fish and fish-related activities.

45
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,000
So unless you got the overwhelming urge
to gut sturgeon, and who hasn't?

46
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,080
But it's a layover point
for almost every planet.

47
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,290
I could...
I just don't want to draw this out.

48
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,880
Have you decided
when you'll tell the others?

49
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,510
I... No.

50
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,850
- I appreciate your not saying anything.
- Well, I don't, so make up your mind.

51
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,230
I'm a big girl. Just tell me.

52
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,100
None of it means a damn thing.

53
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,260
It's just an object.
It doesn't mean what you think.

54
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,060
- Stay calm!
- You know that's...

55
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,520
Stop yelling.
That's gonna make it worse.

56
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,730
River. Sweetheart. Put it down.

57
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,060
- Where did you get that?
- Don't yell.

58
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,400
It was in my hand.

59
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,530
I'm not mad, just let me...
Thank you.

60
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,120
Fully loaded, safety off.
This here is a recipe for unpleasantness.

61
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,540
- Does she understand that?
- She understands.

62
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,910
She doesn't comprehend.

63
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,210
I'm glad we've made that distinction.
No touching guns, okay?

64
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,960
No touching.

65
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,880
- River...
- It's getting very, very crowded!

66
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,430
Thought she was on the mend.

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,300
Her medications are erratic.

68
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,600
There's not one that her system
can't eventually break down and...

69
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,400
If I want a lot of medical jargon,
I'll talk to a doctor.

70
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,110
- You are talking to a doctor.
- Yeah. Okay.

71
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,240
My point is, it could have been you
she might have shot.

72
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,110
The doctor, as you just made note of.
And who exactly could fix you?

73
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,030
Not nobody.

74
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,700
We're deep in space,
corner of No and Where.

75
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,200
You take extra care with her...

76
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,540
because we're very much alone
out here.

77
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,090
Little River gets more colourful
by the moment. What will she do next?

78
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,390
Either blow us all up
or rub soup in our hair. It's a toss-up.

79
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,050
I hope she does the soup thing.

80
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,560
It's always a hoot,
and we don't all die from it.

81
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,100
- That poor kid.
- Yeah.

82
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,980
She's definitely got...

83
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,360
- Funny.
- Something wrong?

84
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,730
I'm getting a weird heat bounce
off our wake.

85
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,610
- Engine flux?
- Sensors probably got turned around...

86
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,780
She can only get in there
if she knows the combination.

87
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,120
I don't leave loaded guns around.

88
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,240
She got her hands
on your hardware.

89
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,120
Suppose she took up something
with hull-piercing bullets.

90
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,330
Bullets are soft lead. Even Vera
could barely breach the hull...

91
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,670
and she's the best I got. Now...

92
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,800
let's move the conversation
in "not Jayne's fault" direction.

93
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,220
I didn't make her crazy.
Hell, I didn't even want her on the ship.

94
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,680
Is that the direction you want
this conversation to go in?

95
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,310
Just don't want to take a lashing
for something I ain't the cause of.

96
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,060
- Where is River now?
- Her room.

97
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,600
Which I'm thinking of bolting
from the outside.

98
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,310
That's a little extreme.

99
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,820
Remember her coming at me
with a butcher's knife?

100
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,860
- Wacky fun.
- You wanna go, little man?

101
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,990
Only if it's some place
with candlelight.

102
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,280
I don't think she'd harm anyone.

103
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,530
- Butcher's knife!
- Anyone we can't spare.

104
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,080
As far as we know, she's never
even picked up a gun before.

105
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,540
That ain't so.

106
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,710
Kaylee, you got something to say?

107
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,820
Okay, Kaylee,
why don't you speak your piece?

108
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,250
It was when the captain and Wash
got took by Niska.

109
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,540
I ain't like to forget that
anytime soon.

110
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,420
Well, we all went in. Me too.

111
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,050
Didn't make much account
of myself, I'm afraid.

112
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,920
I got no problem with
you not killing nobody.

113
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,550
What's it to do with River?
She wasn't in the fight.

114
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,890
Well, no, she was.

115
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,140
I got pinned down, and there
were three guys, and I couldn't...

116
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,020
And then River comes up.

117
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,230
She looks out, sees them all.

118
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,240
And they was spread out, you know,
had some cover.

119
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,740
She only looked
for a second, and...

120
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,330
took my gun, closed her eyes...

121
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,830
killed them.

122
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,540
She shot them?

123
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,420
All three. Dead in an instant.
And their eyes still closed.

124
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,050
Well, that's...
You saw it wrong.

125
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,470
Not a jot.
And it weren't auto-fire, or luck.

126
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,600
She just...
She just did the maths.

127
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,270
You understand how that sounds?

128
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,270
She killed them with maths.
What else could it have been?

129
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,280
You couldn't have done it, Jayne.
Nor you, captain.

130
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,450
Nobody can shoot like that
that's a person.

131
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,950
So River's not a person?

132
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
Oh, please, don't be mad.

133
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,330
I just want to understand
what you're saying here.

134
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,170
I thought River was your friend.

135
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,090
She is! But, Simon, the way she...

136
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,130
Right after, she looked at me...

137
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,260
and she smiled,
like nothing was wrong.

138
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,140
Like we were playing.

139
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,520
Scared me.

140
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,690
Could be she saved
your life, Kaylee.

141
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,770
I'm aware of that,
and I'm not...

142
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,280
She probably didn't even know
what was going on.

143
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,780
Thought it was a game.

144
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,450
Later on, explain to me
how that's a comfort.

145
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,990
Might have to use
some of that maths.

146
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,790
What we've got here to deal with
is the larger issue.

147
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,330
And that larger issue is, we've got
someone on board this ship...

148
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,080
might be a danger to us.

149
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,130
Ain't a question
of whether we like her.

150
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,210
Some of us have grown
attached to River.

151
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,760
Kaylee, you have,
or you would have spoken sooner.

152
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,090
Which, by the by,
you should have.

153
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,890
I find River pleasant enough
myself...

154
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,270
but she does have
an oddness to her.

155
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,440
And I ain't just talking about
her proficiency with firearms.

156
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,650
The girl knows things.

157
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,610
Things she shouldn't.
Things she couldn't.

158
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,900
What, are you saying
she's a witch?

159
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,110
Yes, Jayne. She's a witch.
She has had congress with the Beast.

160
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,910
She's in Congress?

161
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,290
How did your brain
even learn human speech?

162
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,120
I'm just so curious.

163
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,710
This isn't a joking matter.
This is about our lives and River's.

164
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Thank you.

165
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,300
She's deeply intuitive.
It's true that sometimes...

166
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,430
I don't think she's intuitive, doctor.
I think she's a reader.

167
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,270
- Psychic?
- Ls that even remotely possible?

168
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,230
You tell me.

169
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,610
You've been studying
what they've done to her.

170
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,070
Well, they've definitely altered
the way she reacts to things.

171
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,160
Even the way she perceives.
But I'm not...

172
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,530
Psychic, though? That sounds like
something out of science fiction.

173
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,200
- You live in a spaceship, dear.
- So?

174
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,330
Back up a second. Are you saying
she really reads minds?

175
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,590
Or near enough.
Am I alone thinking along these lines?

176
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,630
No.

177
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,170
Well, I don't like the idea of someone
hearing what I'm thinking.

178
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,890
No one likes the idea
of hearing what you're thinking.

179
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,850
The Alliance could have
any number of uses for a psychic.

180
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,720
A psychic. Or an assassin.

181
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,600
She's just a kid.

182
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,690
And she just wants to be a kid.

183
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,030
I wish it were that simple.

184
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,780
Yeah. If wishes were horses,
we'd all be eating steak.

185
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,830
- What do we plan to do about this?
- Well, that's the question.

186
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,710
I don't think
she'd ever hurt any of us.

187
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,880
Maybe you're right.

188
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,130
I ain't gonna make a decision
till I thought on it a while.

189
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,170
It's late.

190
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,890
Let's get some rest.

191
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,270
- Simon...
- I gotta check on my assassin.

192
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,150
Oh, please don't be mad.
I had to say something.

193
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm not mad at you.

194
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,190
I just...

195
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,870
She loves this ship.

196
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,620
I think it's more home to her
than any place she's been.

197
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,370
What about you?

198
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,500
I mean, I...

199
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,880
I thought the hospital was home.

200
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,470
I was really making
a difference there...

201
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,100
and embarrassingly large
stacks of money.

202
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,270
And I could've...

203
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,770
I would be there right now
if she hadn't...

204
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,610
If they had just left her alone.

205
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,660
Is it so bad here?

206
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,750
I don't even know if the captain...

207
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,410
No, I mean...

208
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,090
Isn't there anything
about this place you're glad of?

209
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,850
Good night, you two.

210
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,070
- I...
- Don't. Yeah, I...

211
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,280
Good night.

212
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,160
Don't let the space bugs bite.

213
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,250
Space bugs?

214
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,600
River?

215
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,190
River?

216
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,290
I like this ship.

217
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,670
Serenity. She's good-looking.

218
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,420
How did you get on?

219
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,930
Strains the mind a bit, don't it?
You think you're all alone.

220
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,180
Maybe I come down the chimney,
Kaylee.

221
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,690
Bring presents
to the good girls and boys.

222
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,820
Maybe not though.
Maybe I've always been here.

223
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,440
What do you want?

224
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,200
That's a beating heart, isn't it?

225
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,500
Pull off any one of 1000 parts,
she'll just die.

226
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,330
Such a slender thread.

227
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,000
You ever been raped?

228
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,760
The captain is right down that hallway.
He can hear you.

229
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,390
The captain's locked in his quarters.

230
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,510
They all are.

231
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,520
There's nobody can help you.

232
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,230
Say it.

233
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,190
There's nobody can help me.

234
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,240
I'm gonna tie you up now.

235
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,160
And you know
what I'm gonna do then?

236
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,920
I'm gonna give you a present.
Get rid of a problem you've got.

237
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,840
And I won't touch you in any
wrong fashion, nor hurt you at all.

238
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,050
Unless you make some kind of ruckus.

239
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,390
You throw a monkey wrench
into my dealings in any way...

240
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,560
your body is forfeit.

241
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,980
It ain't nothing but a body to me...

242
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,270
and I can find all unseemly manner
of use for it.

243
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,400
Do you understand?

244
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,240
Yes.

245
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,280
Turn around and put your hands
behind your back.

246
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,780
Oh...

247
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,050
Now tell me, Kaylee,
where does River sleep?

248
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,310
Hello?

249
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,090
River?

250
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,450
Dr. Tam,
why don't you sit yourself down.

251
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,250
- I'd rather die standing.
- Well, the intention is not for you to die.

252
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,830
The warrant doesn't specify a particular
need for you to be alive, but...

253
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,760
Where's your sister?

254
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,560
Are you Alliance?

255
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,640
- Am I a lion?
- What?

256
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,600
I don't think of myself as a lion.

257
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,860
You might as well, though.
I have a mighty roar.

258
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,150
- I said "Alliance."
- Oh. I thought...

259
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,570
- No, I was...
- That's weird.

260
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,870
- Where's your sister?
- I don't know.

261
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,200
Who do you work for?

262
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,410
- This is her room.
- Yes.

263
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,500
- It's empty.
- I know.

264
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,960
So is it still her room
when it's empty?

265
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,130
Does the room, the thing, have purpose?
Or do we?

266
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,140
- What's the word?
- I really can't help you.

267
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,350
The plan is to take your sister.

268
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,220
Get the reward,
which is substantial.

269
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,350
"Imbue," that's the word.

270
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,400
- So you're a bounty hunter?
- No, that ain't it at all.

271
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:49,320
- Then what are you?
- I'm a bounty hunter.

272
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,450
I'm named Early.

273
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
I'm known to some.

274
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,210
Been tracking you since the Feds
were tipped off on Ariel.

275
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,170
- She sleep with anybody?
- River?

276
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,300
Yeah. She grapple with any of the crew?
May be in their quarters.

277
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,130
No.

278
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,880
Maybe she does
and you don't know about it.

279
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,600
This is insane. I'm not gonna
help you find her, in any case.

280
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,730
I think this is very pretty.
I like the weight of it.

281
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,980
I thought the intention
was not to kill me.

282
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,410
You're missing the point.

283
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:38,370
The design of the thing
is functional.

284
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,540
The plan is not to shoot you.
The plan is to get the girl.

285
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,880
If there's no girl, then the plan,
well, is like the room.

286
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,010
You are gonna help me look for her.

287
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,270
I don't think my last act in this 'verse
is gonna be betraying my sister.

288
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,190
You're gonna help me.

289
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,690
Because every second you're with me
is a chance to turn the tables...

290
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,610
to get the better of me.

291
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,950
Maybe you'll find your moment.
Maybe I'll slip.

292
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,240
Or you refuse to help me...

293
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,910
I shoot your brain out and I go upstairs
and spend some time...

294
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,580
violating the little mechanic
I got trussed up in the engine room.

295
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,380
I take no pleasure in the thought, but
she will die weeping if you cross me.

296
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,720
You're out of your mind.

297
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,810
That's between me and my mind.
Let's start with these rooms.

298
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,980
He's not killed. Be a while before
he comes to, but he'll mend.

299
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,900
How much a part of your plan dictated
the need of beating up a shepherd?

300
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,570
That ain't a shepherd.

301
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,540
She wouldn't come in here anyway.
She hates this room.

302
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,460
You see, Early...

303
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:11,920
the people you're planning to sell her
to cut up her brain in a lab like this.

304
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,050
Tortured her. A teen aged girl.

305
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,720
- Not some bandit, just an innocent...
- Ever been shot?

306
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,560
- No.
- You ought to be shot.

307
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,980
Or stabbed. Lose a leg.

308
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,360
To be a surgeon, you know.

309
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,400
Know what kind of pain
you're dealing with.

310
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,950
They make psychiatrists
get psychoanalysed...

311
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
before they can get certified...

312
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,200
but they don't make
a surgeon get cut on.

313
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,700
That seem right to you?

314
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,640
Come on out, River.
The nice man wants to kidnap you.

315
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,390
Shh.

316
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,810
I like the way the walls go out.

317
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:15,530
Gives you an open feeling.
Firefly's a good design.

318
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,950
People don't appreciate
the substance of things.

319
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Objects in space.

320
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,580
People miss out on what's solid.

321
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,790
It's not your moment, doctor.

322
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,720
Is that the companion shuttle?

323
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,760
Yes.

324
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,020
We'll try the empty first.
Then we'll pay her a visit.

325
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,310
Her room's not saying a damn thing.

326
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,320
Hold it.

327
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,710
This is pointless, you know that?

328
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,590
Two hundred thousand
seems fairly pointed to me.

329
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,470
Money like that, I could retire.

330
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,020
Not that I would.

331
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,900
- What's life without work?
- Serenity is a smuggling ship.

332
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,980
I've been here a year.
I couldn't name where she might hide.

333
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,070
I don't have a year.

334
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,860
Your sister's becoming
a real annoyance.

335
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,120
I feel for you.

336
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,960
I'm not gonna waste my time
threatening you...

337
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,420
because I think you believe I will kill
people if someone upsets my plan.

338
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,300
I'm gonna seal you in, though.
You just sit.

339
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,350
You can still walk away from this.
I know you're tired.

340
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,020
Don't go visiting my intentions.

341
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,650
Don't ever.

342
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,160
Man is stronger by far
than woman...

343
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,030
yet only woman can create a child.

344
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,290
Does that seem right to you?

345
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:34,880
All right. That's all the hide-and-seek
I got time for.

346
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,500
I know you're on this ship,
little girl.

347
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,880
So here's how this goes.

348
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:46,010
Show yourself and finish this exchange,
or your brother's brains'll be flying.

349
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,770
You understand. I'm sort of
on the clock here. It's frustrating.

350
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,520
You're wrong, Early.

351
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,980
No, dumpling.
I will shoot your brother if you...

352
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,320
Wrong about River.
River's not on the ship.

353
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:06,280
They didn't want her here,
but she couldn't make herself leave...

354
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,200
so she melted. Melted away.

355
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:17,290
They didn't know she could do that,
but she did.

356
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,460
I'm not sure I take
your meaning there.

357
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:26,840
I'm not on the ship. I'm in the ship.

358
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,850
I am the ship.

359
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,140
- River...
- River's gone.

360
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,980
Then who exactly
are we talking to?

361
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,360
You're talking to Serenity.

362
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,950
And Early...

363
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,870
Serenity is very unhappy.

364
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,130
Kaylee.

365
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,760
River!

366
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,560
You're afraid.

367
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,560
He tied me up.

368
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,270
- I don't know where he came from.
- It's okay.

369
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,230
You're gonna be okay.

370
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,820
I told him where you were.

371
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:29,240
I'm sorry. I didn't know
what else to do. I...

372
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:35,040
I'm fine. I need you to do
something for me.

373
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,960
Gotta be brave.

374
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,170
- I'm tied up. I can't.
- Got tools. Something sharp.

375
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,880
Don't be scared.

376
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,550
I'm right here.

377
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,020
Where'd she go?

378
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,770
I can't keep track of her when she's not
incorporeally possessing a spaceship.

379
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,980
That's nonsensical crap.
Ain't nobody can do that.

380
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,320
You somewhere on this boat.
Somewhere with a 'com, playing games.

381
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,200
That's somewhat unsettling.

382
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,080
Early.

383
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,040
Mr. Jubal Early, bounty hunter.

384
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,250
May I call you Jubal?

385
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,250
Ain't nobody calls me that.

386
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,920
Your mother does.

387
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,380
Oh, sorry. Did. She's gone now.

388
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,390
Is that supposed to scare me,
bringing up my mother?

389
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,600
You're a liar. I don't think
your intentions are honourable.

390
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,440
Well, no. I'm a bounty hunter.

391
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,690
It's not generally considered honourable,
so much as...

392
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,400
I live by a code, though,
which I think is worth...

393
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,610
You hurt people.

394
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,530
Only when the job requires it.

395
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,290
Wrong. You're a bad liar.
You crawl inside me uninvited...

396
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,500
and you hurt my crew.
I see everything that passes...

397
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,420
I only hurt people because they keep
getting in the way of me finding you.

398
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,840
- Tell her.
- What am I, your advocate?

399
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,010
You are, starting now.

400
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,050
He's really very gentle and fuzzy.

401
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,640
We're becoming fast friends.

402
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,600
You folks are all insane.

403
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,440
Well, my sister's a ship.
We had a complicated childhood.

404
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,020
Doesn't anybody care...

405
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,360
that I have a finely crafted gun
pointed at this boy's head?

406
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,990
I care.

407
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,990
Then you gonna stop me from
doing what I don't want to?

408
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,950
You gonna be smart here, River?

409
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,210
River?

410
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,670
Serenity?

411
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,510
What the hell's going on here?

412
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,470
I need you to do me
a favour, captain.

413
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,560
There was a guy. He's very blurry.

414
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,100
You better be careful.

415
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,690
How come there's a guy on board, and
why are you all of a sudden the ship?

416
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,940
- I know you have questions.
- That's why I just asked them.

417
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:13,150
But there isn't a lot of time, captain.
I need you to trust me.

418
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,030
Am I dreaming?

419
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,240
We all are.

420
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,950
Don't make faces.

421
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,580
Are you ready?

422
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,550
I just have to think here.

423
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,260
These older models have locators at all?

424
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Won't help.

425
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,400
With the exception of one deadly midget,
this girl is the smallest cargo...

426
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,730
I've ever had to transport,
yet by far the most troublesome.

427
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,490
Does that seem right to you?

428
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,530
- What did he do?
- Who?

429
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,320
The midget.

430
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,990
Arson.

431
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,200
Little man loved fire.

432
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,020
I can take this guy out.

433
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:30,110
He's faster than you.
All of you. And he's wearing armour.

434
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,190
What about his face?
Is his face wearing armour?

435
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,190
No touching guns.

436
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,700
It's soon now. Are you ready?

437
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,370
- How do you know what he's gonna do?
- I'm very close to him.

438
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,790
- He doesn't even see it.
- Okay, but...

439
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,710
Go now!

440
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,840
You're not welcome here
anymore, Early.

441
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,630
Do you think I'm gonna leave here
empty-handed?

442
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,050
I know it.

443
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,390
Yeah, well, you know me real well.

444
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,230
Wish I didn't.
You like to hurt folk.

445
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,270
It's part of the job.

446
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,360
It's why you took the job.

447
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:19,490
Power, control, pain.

448
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,870
Your mother knew.

449
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,080
Signed "the sinner"
when she waved goodbye.

450
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,500
She's relieved.

451
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,540
Saw darkness in you.

452
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,790
You're not well.

453
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,960
You'll be wanting to shut up now.

454
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,550
Big Golden Retriever
sitting on the lawn.

455
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,430
Never took to you.

456
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,600
Smelling you.

457
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,060
Your neighbours pet.

458
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,140
You did things to him.

459
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,400
Cleaned up after.

460
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,360
Shined and polished.

461
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:59,440
Everything in here gleams.

462
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,320
Well, I'll be a son of a whore.

463
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,490
You're not in my mind.
You're on my ship!

464
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,670
It's very interesting,
all these buttons.

465
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,460
Okay. We're not touching those, okay?

466
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,920
- How did she get on my ship?
- Put the gun away.

467
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,550
Okay. I'm putting it away.

468
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,600
No, he's not.

469
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,230
I'm putting it away...

470
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,350
because we're all
reasonable people.

471
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,650
Don't want to do anything rash...

472
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,690
fiddling with any dials.

473
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:42,360
You're not right, Early.
You're not righteous.

474
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,990
- You've got issues.
- No.

475
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,830
Or, yes. I could have that.
You might have me figured out then.

476
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,750
Good job. I'm not 100 percent.

477
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,210
You talk too much.

478
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,800
I'm flawed in that way.
I sometimes go on, it's been said.

479
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,300
It's okay, Early.

480
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,050
I'm going with you.

481
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,010
River, what are?

482
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,930
I don't belong. Dangerous, like you.

483
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,150
Can't be controlled.
Can't be trusted.

484
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:24,320
Everyone can just go on without me
and not have to worry.

485
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,660
People could be
what they wanted to be...

486
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,910
could be with the people
they wanted.

487
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,170
Could live simple.

488
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,750
No secrets.

489
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,420
No.

490
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,090
I'll be fine.

491
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,680
I'll be your bounty, Jubal Early.

492
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,770
And I'll just fade away.

493
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:00,320
Well, finally something
goes according to...

494
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,900
Simon?

495
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,170
See? That's what it feels like.

496
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,720
Hang tight, darling.
Early's on the move.

497
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,870
Shh. It's okay.

498
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:14,640
You made the right move, darling.
Best of you to go with old Early.

499
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,890
You think so?

500
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,390
Some of us feel differently.

501
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,800
Permission to come aboard?

502
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,760
You know, you ain't quite right.

503
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
It's a popular theory.

504
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,810
Go on, get in there.

505
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,940
Give your brother a thrashing
for messing up your plan.

506
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,190
He takes so much looking after.

507
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,410
To the left. Your left.

508
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,160
Okay, now,
very gently, pull that aside.

509
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,420
This is really not my area
of expertise, doctor.

510
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,710
I tend to be putting these into people
more than the other thing.

511
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,210
Can I mop your brow? I'm at the ready
with the fearsome brow mop.

512
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,880
You got the bullet.

513
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,970
Okay, I'm just gonna pass out
for a minute, but you're doing great.

514
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,180
And we live to fight another day.

515
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,400
Any chance that shima lakkoren
might survive?

516
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,980
Air he had left, I'd say his chance
would be about one in...

517
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,070
a very large number.

518
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,780
He knows that play.

519
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,530
How's your lip?

520
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,870
I just feel such a fool.

521
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:08,550
All them years of priest training,
taken out by one bounty hunter.

522
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,760
Don't get me wrong.
I gave him a hell of a fight.

523
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,050
Epic, I'm guessing.

524
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,850
They'll be poems and songs.
Just you wait.

525
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,560
Least you got some play.
I missed every damn thing.

526
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,770
And then his folks
come by to fetch him...

527
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,770
and it turns out
he's, like, 14 years old!

528
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,740
I mean, he must've been
some kind of genetic experiment...

529
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,820
because I swear this guy was...

530
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,200
Oh, my daddy whupped me so hard.

531
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,750
One of fours.
Let's see you match that.

532
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
I can win this.

533
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:51,090
I'm hearing a lot of talk there, genius.
Come on. Show me what you got.

534
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,530
Yep. Here I am.
