00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,719
04 Firefly Safe - Episode 04 2002 English

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,160
We're in trouble.

3
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,630
We got cut off.

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,510
- Cut off from what?
- Our platoon, Simon.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,010
We got out playing for
the independent Squad...

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,430
and we won't make it
back to our platoon.

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,180
We need to resort to cannibalism.

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,640
That was fast.
Don't we have rations or anything?

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,520
They got lost.
We're gonna have to eat the men.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,110
Aren't you supposed to practise
for your recital?

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,770
I learned it all.

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,190
- That's wrong.
- It's from the book, River.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,820
No. The book is wrong.
His whole conclusion is fallacious.

14
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,460
So how did the Independents cut us off?

15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,120
They were using dinosaurs.

16
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,960
Language, young man.

17
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,840
Sorry, Dad. The Independents
attacked us with dinosaurs.

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,340
Simon lost his head in the heat of battle.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,140
Because there were dinosaurs involved,
I think we'll let it slide.

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,310
- Did you get my wave?
- I got it. Your text shorted.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,900
I got it during a board meeting.
Thank you.

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,730
If I had a dedicated source box,
it wouldn't short. I lost half my essay.

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,990
Yes, and you'd have access to any tien
sha duh that filtered in from the cortex.

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,990
I absolutely forbid it.

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,370
- Dad.
- Dad.

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,330
I will not have it in my house.

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,500
But since your mother's
ordered you one...

28
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,080
I should give up the fantasy
this is my house.

29
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,330
Are you kidding?

30
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,670
You will repay me by becoming
a brilliant doctor. That's the deal.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,010
Dedicated source box,
brilliant doctor.

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,510
- When do I...?
- Many years.

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Dad, this is so...

34
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,250
- It's really gonna...
- I know.

35
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,390
You think I'd let you work
with something second-rate?

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,060
- Thank you.
- You're worth it.

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,650
Is it possible for you two geniuses
to give your tired old dad...

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,190
a couple minutes quiet?

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,150
No! No, I don't want to go in!

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,860
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

41
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,330
You can't dig into me, shove 20 needles
in my eyes and ask me what I see!

42
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,750
I... We won't go in. Look.

43
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,000
- No test today.
- No rutting tests?

44
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,090
Stupid son of a bitch dressed me
up like a gorram doll.

45
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,010
No tests, no shots.

46
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,010
Come on. I'm just gonna give you
a smoother cuttle.

47
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,270
River!

48
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,230
Not him.

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,740
So she's added cussing and hurling
about things to her repertoire.

50
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,870
- She really is a prodigy.
- It's just a bad day.

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,660
No. A bad day is when someone's
yelling spooks the cattle.

52
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,830
Understand? Ever see cattle stampede
when they got no place to run?

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,040
It's kind of like a meat grinder.

54
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,590
- And it'd lose us half our herd.
- She hasn't gone near the cattle.

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,180
No. But in case you hadn't noticed,
her voice kind of carries.

56
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,680
We're two miles above ground and
they can probably hear her down there.

57
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,890
As soon as we unload,
she can holler until our ears bleed...

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,940
although I would take it
as a kindness if she didn't.

59
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,150
The human body can be drained
of blood in 8.6 seconds...

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,320
given adequate vacuum systems.

61
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,740
See, morbid and creepifying,
I got no problem with.

62
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,610
Long as she does it quiet-like.

63
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,160
This is paranoid schizophrenia, captain,
hand crafted by government scientists...

64
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,540
who thought my sister's brain
was a rutting playground.

65
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,870
I have no idea what will set her off.

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
- If you have some expertise...
- I'm not the doctor.

67
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,750
And I'm not your gorram
babysitter either.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Gag her if you have to.

69
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Got trade to be done.

70
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,560
You see that?

71
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,400
Fancy vessels such as that don't land
here unless they got something to sell.

72
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,870
If it happens to be something
we need, we take it.

73
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,220
It's about time
you broke in them pretty shoes.

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,220
Get along!

75
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,510
You know, they walk
just as easy if you lead them.

76
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,970
I like smacking them.

77
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,690
Hope this corral's strong enough
to hold them.

78
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,190
Shepherd's a purely
figurative title, you know.

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,200
Next time we smuggle stock,
let's make it something smaller.

80
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,080
Yeah, we should start dealing
in those black market Beagles.

81
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,000
Little soul, big world.

82
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,840
Eat, sleep and eat.

83
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,260
Many souls.

84
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,050
Cattle on the ship three weeks,
she don't go near them.

85
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,520
Now we're on Jiangyin and she needs
to communicate with the beasts?

86
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,230
They weren't cows inside.

87
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,020
They were waiting to be,
but they forgot.

88
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,980
Now they see sky and they remember
what they are.

89
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,990
Is it bad that what she said
made perfect sense to me?

90
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,280
Come on now, let's get
you clear of the work.

91
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,490
What's going on?

92
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,950
- What are you doing?
- I'm fixing to do business.

93
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,120
I can't be herding steers
and your sister.

94
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,870
- She didn't mean any harm.
- I never figured she did.

95
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,670
But when a man engages
in clandestine dealings...

96
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,630
he has this preference
for things being smooth.

97
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,380
- She makes things not be smooth.
- Right.

98
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,630
I'm very sorry
if she tipped off anyone...

99
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,510
about your cunningly
concealed herd of cows.

100
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,680
I'm starting to think you've got
too much time on your hands.

101
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,430
I've got a notion regarding that.

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,060
Why don't you take your sister
for a little walk?

103
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,820
- A walk?
- Yeah. Some place away.

104
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,450
Well, probably best we stay close.
Alliance has us marked as fugitives.

105
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,660
Closest Alliance is the cruiser
Magellan, hours from here...

106
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,240
and I promise they ain't
coming to Jiangyin.

107
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,910
Still, I'm not sure
it's such a wise suggestion.

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
I wouldn't mistake it for a suggestion.

109
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,710
Don't worry.
We won't leave without you.

110
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,010
Does it seem every supply store
on every water planet...

111
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,430
has the same five rag dolls
and the same woodcarvings of...

112
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,470
What is this, a duck?

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,730
That's a swan.

114
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,480
- I like it.
- You do?

115
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,030
Looks like it was made with,
you know, longing.

116
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,700
Made by a person who really
longed to see a swan.

117
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,830
Perhaps because they'd only heard
of them by rough description.

118
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,500
Do you think this did make a nice gift?

119
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,210
A gift? For whom?

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,460
I just kinda like it.

121
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,210
It's rich, you know.

122
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,760
Oh. For Simon.

123
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,470
I didn't say that.

124
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,140
You don't do a very good job
of hiding your interest.

125
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,020
He's just so...

126
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,400
You just wanna take a bite
out of him all over, you know?

127
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,520
Careful.

128
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,190
Morning, you two.

129
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,150
Don't usually see you two out
and about planet-side.

130
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,780
Yeah, we're trying something
different today.

131
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,370
River...

132
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,160
Be careful with that. That's...

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,500
- What is that?
- That's a post-holer.

134
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,460
You dig holes.

135
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,460
For posts.

136
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,420
It's, it's dirty and sharp.

137
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,840
Let's come over here.

138
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,470
Jiangyin Prairie Paradise.

139
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,440
Good God. They're asking
money for this crap?

140
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,440
Hard to believe, ain't it?
Glad you're out.

141
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,530
Give you a chance to have a little fun.

142
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,530
Fun. Right.

143
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,280
I consider this fun.

144
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,540
It's fun being forced to the ass end
of the galaxy...

145
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,960
to get to live on a
piece of los soh ret.

146
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,380
And eat moulded protein.

147
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,510
And be bullied around by our
pien dyododo chowren of a captain.

148
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,050
It's fun.

149
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,550
Los soh?

150
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,390
Sorry?

151
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,760
Serenity ain't los soh.

152
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,390
- No, I didn't mean...
- Yeah, you did.

153
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,270
You meant everything you just said.

154
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,480
Well, no.

155
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,400
Actually I was being ironic.
So in the strictest sense...

156
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,530
You were being mean is what.

157
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,120
And if that's what you
think of this life...

158
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,460
then you can't think much
of them that choose it, can you?

159
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,060
River?

160
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,190
This is the last time,
last time with cows.

161
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,360
There's an idea with Beagles.
They have smallish droppings.

162
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,320
I believe so, sir.

163
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,870
Also, your disreputable men are here.

164
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,580
Better go take their money.

165
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,460
Morning, gentlemen.

166
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,710
Must be the Grange brothers.
Hope you're in the mood for beefsteak.

167
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,340
Attractive animals, ain't they?

168
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,090
They ain't well-fed. Scrawny.

169
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,510
Hey, wah. Milk and hay,
three times a day.

170
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,560
- Fed to them by beautiful women.
- That was something to see.

171
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,930
They's branded.

172
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,440
You are hitting on the selling points.
The first brand's a giveaway.

173
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,850
Claim them as your own.

174
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,900
Twenty a head.

175
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,400
That's an amusing figure, since
you agreed on 30 with Badger.

176
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,820
That's before we saw them.

177
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,450
They're atrophied from being
on a ship for a month.

178
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,870
My comprehension is less muscle,
the more tender the meat. Thirty.

179
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,000
- Problem?
- No.

180
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,210
About a minute from now,
we'll agree on 25.

181
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,220
Seem a mite jumpy to you?

182
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,450
Morning, officers.

183
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,380
I'm thinking maybe
we walk away entirely.

184
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,430
I'm thinking you do that,
and we got ourselves trouble.

185
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,550
Morning, ladies.

186
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,260
Serious trouble,
of the you-owe-us variety.

187
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,020
I can go to 25.

188
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:39,400
Well, we'll be taking a loss, but you
seem like clean and virtuous boys. Done.

189
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,370
Marcus and Nathaniel Grange,
you are wanted in connection...

190
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,370
to the illegal killing of Rance Durbin.
You are bound by law to stand down.

191
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,340
You know, I'm starting to find
this whole planet very uninviting.

192
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,170
Yeah.

193
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,450
- Careful with that!
- Seems we have ourselves a situation.

194
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,780
Who are you?

195
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,410
Just a bystander.

196
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,080
- This your beef?
- No, sir.

197
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,040
You're looking at the proper
owners right there.

198
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,620
I'd like to see some paper on that cattle.

199
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,380
Come on, hurry it up!

200
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,850
- Here we go.
- Never goes smooth.

201
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,310
How come it never goes smooth?

202
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,280
Hey, stay with me, Shepherd.

203
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,990
That's...

204
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,200
That's quite a lot of blood, isn't it?

205
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,240
It just means you ain't dead.

206
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,540
Afraid I might be needing a preacher.

207
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,210
That's good. You lie there
and be ironical. Stretcher!

208
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,670
- Jayne!
- They going.

209
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,550
Of course.
They got what they wanted.

210
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,430
You get the cash?

211
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,260
What's going on?

212
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,640
Oh, God! Shepherd!

213
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,220
Shepherd, can you hear me?

214
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,810
Doing good.

215
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,940
Wash, get down to the infirmary.

216
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,400
Gotta try to stop this bleeding.

217
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,240
Don't you worry, Shepherd.

218
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,450
Captain and Zoe got lots of experience
with this kind of thing.

219
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,540
Seen a lot worse in the war.

220
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,920
Shepherd?

221
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,630
Oh, God. He ain't breathing.

222
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,230
He ain't dead.

223
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,770
But he is bad off. We got to see
what we can do to help him.

224
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,450
Wash, go to town. See if you can't find
that Jin seem yong, the doctor.

225
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Hurry.

226
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Faster. Got to go faster.

227
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,160
- Won't get there before dark.
- Get where? Where are we going?

228
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,000
Shut up!

229
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,500
If it's ransom you want,
I can arrange something.

230
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,750
No talking!

231
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,880
Look, you don't understand.
My sister...

232
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,010
Your sister is fine, Simon.

233
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,430
She's not fine.

234
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,050
Didn't you look at the letters?
Look at the letters.

235
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,430
Well, I'm looking at letters.

236
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,770
These phrases, they don't sound
anything like her.

237
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,770
Some of these words,
they're misspelled.

238
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,110
She started correcting my spelling
when she was 3.

239
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,740
She's trying to tell us something.

240
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,370
I think there's a code.

241
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,700
- A code?
- Yes.

242
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,790
I always thought it was River
who was lost without you.

243
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,090
Now I'm beginning to wonder
if it isn't the other way around.

244
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,630
Did you have a good time at the
Darbanvilles' Ball this year?

245
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,970
What are you...?

246
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,260
River thought it was duller
than last year.

247
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,600
But since we don't know anybody
named Darbanville, I can't judge.

248
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,060
- Did you read these?
- Well, of course I did.

249
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,980
It's one of her silly games.
You two are always playing.

250
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,110
She is trying to tell us something
that somebody doesn't want her to say.

251
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,820
Simon, this is paranoid.

252
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,620
It's stress.

253
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,330
If they heard you talking like this
at the hospital...

254
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,370
it could affect your entire future.

255
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,710
- Who cares about my future?
- You should.

256
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,590
You're a surgeon in one of the best
hospitals in Capitol City.

257
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,130
On your way to a major position,
possibly even the Medical Elect.

258
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,130
You're gonna throw all that away?

259
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,680
Everything you've worked
for your whole life?

260
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,810
Being a doctor means more to you
than just a position, I know that.

261
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,360
A few months' time,
you'll turn around and there she'll be.

262
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,530
Nothing is going to keep
you two apart for long.

263
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,240
No! Oh, no!

264
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,450
- Found you.
- Get him!

265
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,830
River, no! River! Run! Run!

266
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,790
- Found you!
- Go!

267
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,590
Bring her.

268
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,300
Where is the doctor?
Why isn't he with you?

269
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,640
- He wasn't in town or anywhere.
- He was in town. We saw him there.

270
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,970
- Him and River. I can show you...
- The town's not that big, Kaylee.

271
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,720
Believe me, he wasn't there.

272
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,940
Knew it. Probably saw
them cops, turned tail.

273
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,900
The doctor could be called
a lot of things but not coward.

274
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,770
Do you think they were arrested?

275
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,320
Worse than that, probably.

276
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,780
- Looks like maybe they got snatched.
- Kidnapped?

277
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,070
I went by the sheriff's. If we'd checked
the posted alerts we might have known.

278
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,450
Settlers up in the hills
take people sometimes.

279
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Usually tradesmen and the like.

280
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,710
And now they got themselves a doctor,
and we don't.

281
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,420
We're going.

282
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,300
Well, what are you doing?
What about Simon and River?

283
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Forget them.

284
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,220
We already lost two people today.
If I can help it, we won't lose a third.

285
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,680
Wash, get us in the air.

286
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,770
We're lost.

287
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,440
- Lost in the woods.
- It's gonna be okay. They'll find us.

288
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,530
Once the captain realises
what happened, they'll come.

289
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,790
See there? No one's coming for you.
You just keep moving.

290
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,010
That bad?

291
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,270
Battle wounds are nothing
new to me, preacher.

292
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,940
I've seen men live with
a dozen holes in them this size.

293
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,730
- That right?
- Surely is.

294
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,360
I knew a man who had a hole clean
through his shoulder once.

295
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,320
Used to keep a spare hankie in there.

296
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,120
Where's the doctor? Not back yet?

297
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,500
We don't make him hurry
for the little stuff.

298
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,630
He'll be along.

299
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,750
You could hurry a little.

300
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,350
Well, there's Greenleaf.
They'd have med help there.

301
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,350
Too far. More than 10 hours.

302
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,730
- He's worse off than that.
- You know where to find what you need.

303
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,400
- Don't recall inviting you here.
- You didn't.

304
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,570
You know where you can
find a doctor.

305
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,780
He was dumb enough to get himself
grabbed in broad daylight.

306
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,150
Don't have time
to be looking for him now.

307
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,796
No assurance we'd find him
or that he wouldn't need a doctor.

308
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,660
I'm not talking about Simon.

309
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,250
I'm talking about medical facilities.

310
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,130
That's not an option, nor is it
a discussion I want to have right now.

311
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,670
It doesn't matter what you want.
He's dying.

312
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,630
We need a doctor now.

313
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,600
Look what we got!
Got ourselves a doctor!

314
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,890
A real doctor.

315
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,400
Stand up straight.

316
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,360
They brought home
a doctor. Thank the Lord.

317
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,540
Dear Diary, today I was pompous
and my sister was crazy.

318
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,760
Today we were kidnapped by hill folk,
never to be seen again.

319
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,220
It was the best day ever.

320
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,220
Now we're talking.

321
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,850
Amazing we kept them this long.

322
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,950
- Can I?
- Sure.

323
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,620
He's out, though.

324
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,830
He did this for me once.

325
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,090
How's he doing?

326
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,220
I cleaned it out, wrapped it up.
Best I could do.

327
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
I don't know.

328
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,180
Well, we're headed for help, right?

329
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,230
- Captain will come up with a plan.
- Well, that's good. Right?

330
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,270
You're not recalling
some of his previous plans.

331
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,200
We left them back there.

332
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,410
Yeah.

333
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,120
Don't seem right.

334
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,040
- You sure this is where you wanna be?
- Oh, I'm fairly certain it ain't.

335
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,100
Be sure to ask nicely.

336
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,810
Alliance cruiser Magellan
this is Firefly transport Serenity...

337
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,480
requesting permission for docking.

338
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,940
Firefly transport Serenity,
stand by for docking orders.

339
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,990
In here.

340
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,660
I don't figure it's as fancy as you're
used to, but that's what we got.

341
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,250
I got you a doctor.

342
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,210
Praise the Lord.

343
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,340
Doralee here will show you what's what.

344
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,880
- What's your name?
- Simon.

345
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,760
Hello there. Who are you?

346
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:38,600
This is River.
River, just sit down over there.

347
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,190
Has there been a...?

348
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,100
Is there a sickness here?

349
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,860
Nothing special.

350
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,730
Just people get sick or injured.

351
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,490
Though mostly people heal
on their own, but sometimes...

352
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,620
Sometimes you need a doctor.

353
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,750
Bring me light,
and any supplies you have.

354
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,720
You sanguine about the reception we're
apt to receive on an Alliance ship?

355
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,640
Absolutely.

356
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,940
- What's sanguine mean?
- Sanguine, hopeful.

357
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,690
Plus, point of interest,
it also means bloody.

358
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,230
That pretty much covers
all the options, don't it?

359
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,740
We're requesting aid.
No other purpose.

360
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,750
We got papers.

361
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,960
- What's your business?
- We're a supply ship, freelance.

362
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,340
Had an accident this morning,
crewman got hurt.

363
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,510
We need medical help.

364
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,050
Faster be better than slow.

365
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,260
Official seal's out of date,
Captain Harbatkin?

366
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,310
We ain't had a checkpoint in a while.
You gonna see to my man?

367
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,810
How did this happen?

368
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,190
Bystander in a gunfight.
Back on Jiangyin.

369
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,940
You can check. Not he nor
any of ours were the aggressors.

370
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,490
We aren't an emergency facility.
Our services aren't for just anyone.

371
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,030
Get... Med...

372
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,040
My ident card.

373
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,430
Get this man to the infirmary at once.

374
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,940
You keep that bandage clean now,
you understand?

375
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,900
She's not quite right, is she?

376
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,030
She's been through some trauma.

377
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,570
She's recovering though.

378
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,080
She won't get a good conversation
out of Ruby. I can tell you that much.

379
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,410
That little girl's mute.

380
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,290
Do you know the cause?

381
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,080
- Was she born deaf?
- No.

382
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,750
She was fine until two years ago
when she stopped talking.

383
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,800
A place like this might be good
for your sister.

384
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,930
Quiet, safe.

385
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,930
A place where folks
take care of each other.

386
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,100
Yes. Seems like a lovely little
community of kidnappers.

387
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,810
The Lord says judge not.

388
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,440
They took us off the street.

389
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,780
Sometimes life takes you places
you weren't expecting to go.

390
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,360
Life didn't bring us here.
Those men did.

391
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,530
You were on a transport ship, right?

392
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,410
Taking a journey?

393
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,500
The way of life in my findings is, journeys
end where and when they want to...

394
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,580
and that's where
you make your home.

395
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,420
This isn't our home.

396
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,880
If it isn't here, where is it?

397
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,510
This place gives me
an uncomfortableness.

398
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,140
So, what do you figure?

399
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,310
Shepherd's got some kind
of connection with the Alliance?

400
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,270
That's what it looks like.
It would surprise me if he did.

401
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,360
See? That's my whole problem
with picking up tourists.

402
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,940
Ain't never what they claim.

403
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,400
Does seem like everyone's
got a tale to tell.

404
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,290
River?

405
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
River?

406
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,170
- What's wrong?
- River's gone. So's the girl.

407
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,720
Ruby. I'll check out back.

408
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,680
River. Don't...

409
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,930
What is that?

410
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,560
Oh.

411
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,650
I picked them.

412
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,150
Here. They'll stain your dress.

413
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,750
You have to eat.

414
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,370
Hodgeberries.

415
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,250
Remember when we found those giant
Hodgeberry bushes...

416
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,800
on the Cambersons' estate?

417
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,590
And we thought they'd
grown wild, but...

418
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,060
A long while ago.

419
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,270
- I took you away from there.
- No.

420
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,230
I know I did.

421
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,690
You don't think I do, but...

422
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,400
I get confused.

423
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,030
I remember everything.

424
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,700
I remember too much.

425
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,660
And some of it's made-up.

426
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,630
And some of it can't be quantified.

427
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,090
And there's secrets, and...

428
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,050
It's okay.

429
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,340
But I understand.

430
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,010
You gave up everything
you had to find me.

431
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,310
You found me broken.

432
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,900
It's hard for you.

433
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,860
You gave up everything you had.

434
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:25,440
Maybe everything I have is right here.

435
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,410
You need to eat.
Keep up your strength.

436
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,460
We won't be here long.

437
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,880
Daddy will come and take us home.

438
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,340
And I'll get better.

439
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,260
I'll get better.

440
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,850
These are better than
the Cambersons' berries.

441
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,810
They are. Except they're poison.

442
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,400
You believed her. Made a face.

443
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,910
You are such a brat.

444
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,570
You get to bed now.

445
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,700
We should probably think
about doing the same.

446
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,080
It's been a big day, what
with the abduction and all.

447
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,540
Well, y'all don't have to sleep here.
There's a house set aside for you.

448
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,460
We've been looking for a doctor
for a good while, so things are ready.

449
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,300
Really?

450
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,590
Her sister got killed.

451
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,970
Mother got crazy, killed the sister.

452
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,890
That one lived.

453
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,400
Ruby talked to you, honey?

454
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,520
It's true what she's saying.

455
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:47,110
Poor woman went out of her mind,
tried to kill her two girls.

456
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,570
Ruby lived.

457
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,950
Sweetheart, you are an angel.

458
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,490
No one's been able to get
Ruby to speak even a peep.

459
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,710
It's a miracle! That's what it is.

460
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,120
Ruby doesn't talk.

461
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,920
Her voice got scared away.

462
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,300
I hear crickets.

463
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,180
I don't understand.

464
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,470
If Ruby didn't talk,
how do you know...?

465
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,600
My sister's...

466
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,230
She's very good at...

467
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,070
What's wrong?

468
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,070
And they shall be among the people.

469
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,280
And they shall speak truths
and whisper secrets.

470
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,450
And you will know them by their crafts.

471
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,660
What are you talking about?

472
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,290
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

473
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,650
Have you completely lost your mind?

474
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,980
- Nearly.
- We got the wave at the Friedlichs.

475
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,860
I had to leave your mother
at the dinner table.

476
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,110
I'm sorry, Dad.

477
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,080
I never would have tried to save
River if I had known...

478
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,410
there was a party at risk.
Don't you dare be flippant with me.

479
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,000
I just spent 2000 credits
to get you out of here.

480
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,500
I had to walk through that door,
which goes on my permanent profile.

481
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,880
- Are you trying to destroy this family?
- I didn't realise it would be so easy.

482
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,350
- Dad, I didn't do anything.
- You were in a blackout zone.

483
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,690
Talking to someone who
might be able to help River.

484
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,480
And I'm going right back there.

485
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,900
This is a slippery slope, young man.

486
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:54,570
You have no idea how far down you
can go. You're not taking us with you.

487
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,820
Meaning what?

488
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,820
I won't come for you again.

489
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,750
You end up here or get mixed up in
something worse, you're on your own.

490
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,330
I will not come for you.

491
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,510
Now are you coming home?

492
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,260
This is lunacy! You're supposed
to be the teacher here.

493
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,930
What exactly is it you teach?

494
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,230
What's going on, woman?
Why are you knocking us from our beds?

495
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,770
The new doctor's sister's a witch!
She read Ruby's mind.

496
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,240
- Saw things she couldn't.
- No, River is not a witch.

497
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,240
She's just a troubled girl.

498
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,570
I'm sure that's true.

499
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,250
You're not a witch, are you...?

500
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,500
I'm the patron here.
Do you know what that means?

501
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,540
Yes. You're in charge.

502
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,760
Ever since the old patron died.

503
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,130
That's right.

504
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,340
He was sick and he was getting better.

505
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,640
And you were alone
in the room with him.

506
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,810
- No!
- This girl reads minds...

507
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,310
and spins falsehoods.

508
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,020
She's a witch, and we must
purge the devil from her!

509
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,560
With fire!

510
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,410
You're gonna be fine,
Shepherd. Alliance patched you up.

511
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,370
- Alliance?
- Yeah.

512
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,830
They let us come, and they let us go.

513
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,550
What kind of ident card gets us
that kind of reception and send off?

514
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,970
I am a Shepherd.

515
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,390
- Folks like a man of God.
- No, they don't.

516
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,350
Men of God make everyone
feel guilty and judged.

517
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,720
That's not what I saw.

518
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,270
You like to tell me
what really happened?

519
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,480
I surely would.

520
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,240
And maybe someday I will.

521
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:04,740
It's good to be home.

522
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,790
Badger just hailed us.

523
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,790
Getting impatient for his share. Wants us
to drop it on the Common Fed Base.

524
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,170
That'll be a lot easier to do without
the two most wanted on board.

525
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,050
Life would look to be simpler
with us not carrying any fugees.

526
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,380
He is right, you know.

527
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,300
Yeah.

528
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,470
Simpler.

529
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,870
Take me instead.
Take my life for hers.

530
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,530
The witch must die.

531
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,450
God commands it.

532
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,500
No! Get away from her!

533
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,890
She has done nothing to you!

534
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,900
If she dies tonight, it won't be God's
will that killed her, it'll be you!

535
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,610
Your lunacy! Your ignorance!

536
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,300
That's not gonna stop us, doctor.

537
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,300
Post-holer.

538
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,180
Digging holes for posts.

539
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,940
Light it.

540
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,160
Time to go.

541
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,340
Well, look at this.

542
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,890
Appears we got here
just in the nick of time.

543
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,890
What does that make us?

544
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,810
Big damn heroes, sir.

545
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,730
Ain't we just.

546
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,900
Sorry to interrupt, folks.

547
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,400
Y'all got something that belongs to us,
and we'd like it back.

548
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:46,110
This is a holy cleansing.
You cannot think to thwart God's will.

549
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,410
Y'all see the man hanging out of the
spaceship with the really big gun?

550
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,460
I'm not saying you weren't easy to find,
but it was kind of out of our way...

551
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,000
and he didn't wanna come
in the first place.

552
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,000
Man's looking to kill some folk.

553
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,750
It's his will you should worry
about thwarting.

554
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:11,350
Gotta say, doctor, this town's real
and the folks are near miraculous.

555
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,470
Yes, I'm very proud.

556
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,430
Cut her down.

557
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,020
The girl is a witch.

558
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,770
Yeah, but she's our witch.

559
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,480
So cut her the hell down.

560
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,950
Hey, doctor.
Glad you're back now on the ship.

561
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,910
Thanks.

562
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,010
I've moved him to his room.

563
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,340
- How's he faring?
- He's gonna be fine. Yeah.

564
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,220
- They took good care of him.
- Good to know.

565
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:00,940
So finally a decent wound
on this ship and I miss out.

566
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,270
I'm sorry.

567
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,860
Well, you were busy trying to get
yourself lit on fire. It happens.

568
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,740
Captain...

569
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,950
- Why did you come back for us?
- You're on my crew.

570
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,240
But you don't like me.

571
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,330
Why did you come back?

572
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,790
You're on my crew.

573
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,080
Why are we still talking about this?

574
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,750
Chow's in 10! No need to dress.

575
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,310
So Shepherd says to him...
