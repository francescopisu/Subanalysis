07 Firefly Out Of Gas - Episode 07 2002 English

2
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,450
- A real beauty, ain't she?
- Yes, sir.

3
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,700
Tell you what. You buy this ship,
treat her proper...

4
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,490
she'll be with you for the rest
of your life.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,750
Well?

6
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,720
You paid money for this, sir?

7
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,760
On purpose?

8
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,560
What? Come on, seriously, Zoe,
what do you think?

9
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,560
Honestly, sir, I think you got robbed.

10
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,770
Robbed? What do you mean?

11
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,610
It's a piece of fei-oo.

12
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,570
Fei-oo?

13
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,320
Okay, she won't be winning any beauty
contests anytime soon, but she is solid.

14
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,910
A ship like this, be with you
till the day you die.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,410
- Because it's a death trap.
- That's not...

16
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,040
You are very much lacking
in imagination.

17
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,620
I imagine that's so, sir.

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,380
You haven't seen most of it.
Let me show you the rest.

19
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,510
And try to see past what she is
and on to what she can be.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,470
- What's that, sir?
- Freedom, is what.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,180
I meant what's that?

22
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,930
Step around that.
Something was living in here.

23
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,220
I tell you, we get a mechanic,
get her up and running again...

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,440
hire a good pilot, maybe a cook,
live like real people.

25
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,280
A small crew. They must feel the need
to be free. Take jobs as they come.

26
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,820
They never have to be under the heel
of nobody ever again.

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,200
No matter how long the arm
of The Alliance might get...

28
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,740
we'll just get ourselves
a little further.

29
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,370
- Get her running again?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,750
- So not running now?
- Not so much. But she will.

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,180
I already know what I'm gonna call her.
Got a name all picked out.

32
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,470
No. That is not true.

33
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,090
- No.
- I swear it is.

34
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,510
Surely one of you must've told him.

35
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,270
No. Not one of the brethren
had the heart to say anything.

36
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,350
He was so proud.

37
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,020
What? What was he proud of?

38
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,480
Who he?

39
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,360
Looked rather natty,
truth be told, you know?

40
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,240
What was natty? I wanna hear
about the natty thing.

41
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,500
Shepherd Book was just telling us funny
stories about his life at the monastery.

42
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,670
Monastic humour. I miss out
on all the fun.

43
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,040
And all the food too, apparently.

44
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,760
Just who do you think
you're married to?

45
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,010
- Voilà.
- I love my wife.

46
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,550
- So we got a course set?
- We do.

47
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,760
Took creative navigating,
but we should make it to Greenleaf...

48
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,180
without running afoul
of Alliance patrols.

49
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,650
- Or a living soul, for that matter.
- The way it should be.

50
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,730
Of course, what should be
an 18-hour trip...

51
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,610
will take us the better part
of a week by this route.

52
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,740
We're in no rush.
I like an easy, languorous journey.

53
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,870
Gee, I wonder what that would be like.

54
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Let me help you with that.

55
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,240
It's your turn.

56
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,750
My turn?

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,170
Shepherd told us a funny story
about being a preacher.

58
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,460
Now you tell us a funny story
about being a doctor.

59
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,260
A funny story.

60
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,260
Yeah, because sick people
are hilarious.

61
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,180
Well, they... They can be. Uh...

62
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,640
Well, in fact, I remember this time
I was working the ER...

63
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:12,940
and this... This, uh... This fellow, this,
uh, you know, upright sort of citizen...

64
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,440
he comes in, and he's, you know,
complaining...

65
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,360
Inara, she's gotta have some funny
whoring stories, I'd wager.

66
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,740
Oh, do I ever. Funny and sexy.

67
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,870
You have no idea.
And you never will.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,080
I don't discuss my clients.

69
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,210
Aw, come on, Inara. Who'd know?

70
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,750
You. A companion
doesn't kiss and tell.

71
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,550
So there is kissing?

72
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,090
Hey, doc, I think Kaylee may
need your help after all.

73
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,350
Care to make the first incision,
Dr. Tam?

74
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,350
- Happy birthday, Simon.
- Happy birthday!

75
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,440
This is, uh...

76
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,650
How did... How did you know?
River, did you...?

77
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,860
"Day" is a vestigial mode of time
measurement based on solar cycles.

78
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,200
It's not applicable.

79
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,700
I didn't get you anything.

80
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,910
Seems a fresh warrant for your arrest
came up over the cortex.

81
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,630
Had your birthday attached right to it.

82
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,040
Really?

83
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,840
I hope you like it. Couldn't get a hold
of no flour, so it's mostly protein.

84
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,300
In fact, it's pretty much
what we just had for dinner.

85
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,310
But I tried to get the frosting as
chocolaty-tasting as possible, so...

86
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,520
Thank you.

87
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm really... I'm very, very
deeply moved. Thank you.

88
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,610
Well, deeply move yourself to blow out
them candles, so we can try a slice.

89
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,120
Come on, doc. Give a good blow.

90
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,250
What the hell was that?

91
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,670
Maybe just a hiccup.
I'll go check it out.

92
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,340
- I'll take a look at the helm.
- Fire.

93
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,470
Okay, right.

94
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,890
- Zoe!
- Fire!

95
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,600
Fire!

96
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,070
Baby. You've gotta talk to me.

97
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,530
Seal off everything
that leads below decks!

98
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,990
Do it now!

99
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,170
- Is she gonna be okay?
- I need my med kit.

100
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,880
Not this way. We've got fire.

101
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,930
- Where do you think you're going?
- Zoe's been badly hurt.

102
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,640
- I need my medical supplies.
- Sorry, nobody leaves.

103
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,060
- Every thing's sealed tight.
- If you don't let me go, she could die.

104
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,600
I let you through, we all die.

105
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,770
It's okay.

106
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,730
She's in shock. I need to bring
her vitals back up.

107
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,820
- How bad is it?
- There's no sign of burning.

108
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,950
- It must be internal. I'll do a scan.
- Baby? Zoe, can you hear me?

109
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,370
Zoe? Come on, sweetheart.

110
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,870
Zoe? Come on, talk, baby.

111
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,290
- Look at me, sweetheart.
- Kaylee.

112
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,800
Kaylee, look at me.

113
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,420
I need you up in the engine room
figuring out what caused this.

114
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,430
She ain't moving.

115
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,720
Serenity's not moving.

116
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,560
I know it.

117
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,610
Which is why we need to suss out what
happened so we can get her going again.

118
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,110
- Think you can do that?
- Yes, captain.

119
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,320
That's a good girl.

120
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,570
Come on, baby. You're strong,
the strongest person I ever met.

121
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,080
- You can do this.
- Ls she gonna make it?

122
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,000
- Please, I need to work.
- Wash.

123
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,580
- I need you on the bridge.
- Zoe's hurt.

124
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,130
And the doctor's gonna do
everything he can.

125
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,670
Meantime, I gotta have you on the
bridge. We need to know how bad it is.

126
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,670
How bad? It's bad, okay, sir?

127
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,720
My wife may be dying here,
so my feeling is it's pretty bad.

128
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,140
- Wash...
- I'm not leaving her side, Mal!

129
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,600
Don't ask me again.

130
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,060
I wasn't asking. I was telling.

131
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,860
You're gonna get to that bridge, and
you're gonna get us back on our feet.

132
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,540
Yeah. This is all very doable.

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,460
Shouldn't be a problem at all.

134
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,220
A few modifications.

135
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,470
Get some real manoeuvrability
out of this boat.

136
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,970
You'd be surprised.

137
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,890
So you'll take the job then?

138
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,060
Might do, might do.

139
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,060
- Think I'm starting to get a feel here.
- Good.

140
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,110
Well, take your time.
Make yourself to home.

141
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,990
Just fiddle around with the dials there.
We'll be nearby.

142
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,740
- Great, ain't he?
- I don't like him.

143
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,450
- What?
- Just something about him bothers me.

144
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,750
- What? What about him bothers you?
- I'm not sure. It's something.

145
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,330
Your something comes up against a list
of recommendations as long as my leg.

146
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,460
Tanaka raves about this guy.

147
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,840
Renshaw's been trying to get him
for a month.

148
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,340
- And we need us a pilot.
- I understand, sir. He bothers me.

149
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,840
We finally got ourselves
a genius mechanic.

150
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,890
It's time we hired someone
to fly this.

151
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:24,600
Genius? No one's ever called me
that before. Shiny.

152
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,230
He just bothers me.

153
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,490
Her heart stopped.

154
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,570
Someone should get
her husband down here.

155
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,990
- No. What do you need, doc?
- That drawer, right there.

156
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,000
- That's the one.
- What is it?

157
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,040
Pure adrenaline.

158
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,870
Cap?

159
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,330
Zoe gonna be okay?

160
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,040
You let the doctor worry about Zoe.

161
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,590
Come on.

162
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,260
Tell me what you know.

163
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,970
Catalyser on the port
compression coil blew.

164
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,600
- It's where the trouble started.
- I need that in captain dummy-talk.

165
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,890
- We're dead in the water.
- Can you fix it?

166
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,440
- I can try.
- Just get us to limping. That's all I need.

167
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,400
What? What is it?

168
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,530
- It's worse than just the coil.
- How can it be worse?

169
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,200
Main life-supports down
since the engine's dead.

170
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,290
- But we've got auxiliary life-support.
- No, we don't. Ain't even on.

171
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,870
Explosion must've knocked it out.

172
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,460
So, what are we breathing?

173
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,340
Whatever got pumped into the atmo
before the explosion shut it all down.

174
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,300
Most of that oxygen got ate up
by the fire on its way out the door.

175
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,970
Well, whatever left is what we got.

176
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,550
How long?

177
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,970
Couple of hours, maybe.

178
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,810
We'll start to feel it, and then
we won't feel nothing at all.

179
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,950
How is she?

180
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,120
She's still unconscious,
but her vitals are strong.

181
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,840
She won't know it, but as long as
her condition remains like this...

182
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,300
she'll outlive us all.

183
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,970
She's using less oxygen.

184
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,570
I always thought the name Serenity...

185
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,360
had a vaguely funereal sound to it.

186
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,370
I love this ship.

187
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,660
I have from the first moment I saw it.

188
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,000
I just don't want to die on it.

189
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,960
I don't want to die at all.

190
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:37,340
Suffocations not exactly
the most dignified way to go.

191
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,170
The human body will...

192
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,680
Please, I don't really require
a clinical description right now.

193
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,890
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,520
I just...

195
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,650
It was my birthday.

196
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,790
Don't be afraid.

197
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,960
That's what it says.
"Don't be afraid."

198
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,460
Yes.

199
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,510
But you are afraid.

200
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,840
Yes.

201
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,140
You're afraid we're going
to run out of air...

202
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,020
that we'll die gasping.

203
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,600
But we won't.
That's not going to happen.

204
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,030
We'll freeze to death first.

205
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,790
You get that beacon sent?

206
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,290
- Yeah, it's sent.
- Good.

207
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,500
Pointless.

208
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,460
- What?
- Nothing, sir. It's a brilliant plan.

209
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,130
I'm sure we'll all be saved.

210
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,420
I'm getting a little weary
of this attitude.

211
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,970
Are you? Well, I'm so very sorry, sir.

212
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,720
I guess the news that we'll be purple,
bloated and fetal in a few hours...

213
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,350
has made me a little snippy.

214
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,890
It's possible someone might pick up
that signal.

215
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,440
No, Mal, it's not possible. No one's
gonna pick up the damn signal.

216
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,070
You wanted us under the radar.
That's where we are.

217
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,740
- Out of range of anyone.
- Then make it go further.

218
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,410
- I... What?
- Make the signal go further.

219
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,950
I can't make it go further.

220
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,250
Not if you're gonna sit around
and whinge.

221
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,500
- What do you expect me to do, Mal?
- Whatever you have to.

222
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,880
If you can't do it here, get a suit on
and go outside the boat...

223
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,050
And what? Wave my arms around?

224
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,630
Wave your arms around.
Jump up and down.

225
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,840
Divert the nav sats to the transmitter.

226
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,140
Divert the... Right!

227
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,760
Teenage pranks are fun
when you're about to die.

228
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,560
- Give the beacon a boost, wouldn't it?
- Yes, Mal, it would boost the signal.

229
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,230
But even if a passer by did receive,
it would muck up their navigation.

230
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,270
- Could be that's true.
- Damn right!

231
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,990
They'd be forced to stop and dig out
our signal before they could go any place.

232
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,700
Maybe I should do that then.

233
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,280
- Maybe you should.
- Okay.

234
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,000
- Good!
- Fine!

235
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,960
What do you two think you're doing,
fighting at a time like this?

236
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,250
You're gonna use up all the air.

237
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,720
Life-support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

238
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,230
Life-support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

239
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,280
Bester?

240
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
What's this I hear about
yet another delay?

241
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,290
Supposed to have this engine fixed
and us up and...

242
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,620
What in the name of...?

243
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,290
Bester?

244
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,090
Bester?

245
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,630
Bester!

246
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,100
What?

247
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,940
You do realise we've been parked on this
rock a week longer than we planned?

248
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,150
Yeah, but there's... There's stuff to do.

249
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
As, for example, that job we've
got waiting for us on Pacquin.

250
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,070
When we landed, you said you needed
a few days to get us space-worthy...

251
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,450
and is there something wrong
with your bunk?

252
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,490
What?

253
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,500
Oh, no, captain. She likes engines.

254
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,090
They make her hot.

255
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,970
Bester, get your prairie harpy
off my boat and put us back in the air.

256
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,970
Okay, but can't.

257
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,050
- What do you mean, "can't"?
- No can do, cap.

258
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,470
- Secondary grav boot's shot.
- No, it ain't.

259
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,400
Ain't nothing wrong with your grav boot.
Grav boot's just fine.

260
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,310
Hello.

261
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,820
She doesn't... That's not what it...
No, it ain't.

262
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,610
Sure it is. Grav boot
ain't your trouble.

263
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,660
I seen the trouble plain as day when I
was down there on my back before.

264
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,660
Your reg couple's bad.

265
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,580
The reg... The what?

266
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,290
The reg couple.

267
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,250
Right here.

268
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,510
See?

269
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,220
- No.
- This.

270
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,930
I'm pointing right at it.

271
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,430
Hey.

272
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,480
Here. Hand me that, will you?

273
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,070
Don't serve much
of a purpose anyway.

274
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,400
Just tends to gum up the works
when it gets tacked.

275
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,160
So I figure why even have one?

276
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,790
Better to just take your G-line, plug it
straight into the port pin-lock...

277
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,580
and that should...

278
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,710
There!

279
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,670
- What'd you do?
- She fixed it.

280
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,340
Well, it wasn't really broke.

281
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,300
Where'd you learn to do that, miss?

282
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,720
Just do it, that's all.

283
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,930
- Daddy says I got natural talent.
- I'll say you do.

284
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,680
- Don't we need this?
- You work for your daddy, do you?

285
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,350
When he got work,
which ain't too often lately.

286
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,600
You got experience with a vessel
like this?

287
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,190
I never even been up in one before.

288
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,610
Wanna?

289
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,490
- You mean...?
- Sure.

290
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,700
- For how long?
- Long as you like.

291
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,620
- Long as you can keep her in the sky.
- You offering me a job?

292
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,660
- What?
- Believe I just did.

293
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,170
I just gotta ask my folks.

294
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,590
Don't leave without me.

295
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,380
Mal, what do you need
two mechanics for?

296
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,760
I really don't.

297
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,850
Kaylee?

298
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,850
Kaylee, what are you doing?

299
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,230
I'm sorry, captain. I'm real sorry.

300
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,060
I should have kept better care of her.

301
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,280
Usually she lets me know
when somethings wrong.

302
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,030
Maybe she did, I just wasn't
paying attention, or...

303
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,200
Kaylee, I cannot be having this from you
right now. We got work to do.

304
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,040
Catalser's broke.
Gonna need a new one.

305
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,920
There is no new one.
You gotta make do with what you got.

306
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,300
- It's broke.
- Come on.

307
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,670
This the part? It don't hardly seem
like nothing.

308
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,390
All right. Where does it go?

309
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,060
Here.

310
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,810
But it don't fit no more.

311
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,060
Well, you gotta figure a way
to make it fit.

312
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,860
Sometimes a thing gets broke
can't be fixed.

313
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,400
Without this, the engine don't turn?

314
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,740
Engine don't turn, life-support
won't function. We don't breathe.

315
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,950
You wanna keep breathing, don't you?

316
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,330
So do I.

317
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,500
Life-support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

318
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,520
Life-support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

319
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:47,740
Well, as you're all keenly aware,
we've run into a bit of a situation.

320
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,960
Engine's down, life-supports
on the Fritz...

321
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,590
and I got nine people here
all wanting to breathe.

322
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,670
Truth is, don't got a whole lot
of options at this juncture.

323
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:10,060
So instead of focusing on what we don't
got, time to talk about what it is we do.

324
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:15,770
And what we got are two shuttles.
Short-range, won't get far.

325
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,730
But each got heat,
and they each got air.

326
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Last longer than what's left on Serenity.

327
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,160
- Long enough to reach some place?
- No.

328
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,660
So where will we go then?

329
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,250
Far as you can get.

330
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,620
We send both shuttles
in opposite directions...

331
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,290
betters the chances of someone
getting picked up.

332
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,340
Shepherd Book, Kaylee, Jayne
will ride with Inara in her shuttle.

333
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,380
Doc, you and your sis will ride
with Wash and Zoe...

334
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,470
seeing as how Zoe still needs
some doctoring.

335
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,060
What about you?

336
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,520
Four people per shuttle. That's
the arrangement. Evens the odds.

337
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,350
I'm staying with Serenity.

338
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,060
- Captain...
- We sent out a beacon.

339
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,400
Even managed to boost it a little.

340
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,530
If by some chance we get a response...

341
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,610
someone's gonna have
to be here to answer.

342
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,160
Let's get those shuttles prepped.

343
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,040
Wash, shuttles are that way.

344
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,710
I know. But like you said, someone
might answer the beacon.

345
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,130
And when they do, I wanna make sure
that you can call everyone back.

346
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,380
Won't take but a minute.

347
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,890
Jayne, get shuttle number two ready.
I'll see to Inara's.

348
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,720
Let's get moving.

349
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,390
Take only what you need.

350
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,270
- Mal...
- If you fly smart, don't push too hard...

351
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,950
- shuttle life-support will last.
- This isn't the ancient sea.

352
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,490
Don't go down with your ship.

353
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,870
She ain't going down.
She ain't going anywhere.

354
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,080
Jayne'll be valuable if you're in trouble.
Don't trust him. Don't let him take over.

355
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,210
You're paid for the month.
It's your ship.

356
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,460
Mal.

357
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,920
As far as your security deposit goes,
that I might have to owe you.

358
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,710
Well, here she is.

359
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,260
Nice, ain't she?

360
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,600
- Smallish.
- Well, not overly.

361
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,480
How much room do you really need
for what you do anyway?

362
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,270
I got a surveyor and his wife
interested in renting it.

363
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,480
They're just waiting to hear back.

364
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,610
- What's her range?
- Standard short.

365
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,110
She'll break atmo from a wide orbit...

366
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,080
get you where you need to go,
bring you back home again.

367
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,250
She's space-worthy, just like
the rest of Serenity is.

368
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,040
No need to sound so defencive, captain.

369
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,710
I prefer something
with a few miles on it.

370
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,840
Were we to enter into
this arrangement, captain...

371
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,760
there are a few things
I would require from you...

372
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,340
the foremost
being complete autonomy.

373
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,720
This shuttle would be my home.

374
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,270
No crew member would be allowed
entrance without my invitation.

375
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,980
You'd get your privacy.

376
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,900
And just so we're clear...

377
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,150
under no circumstances will I service
you or anyone who is under your employ.

378
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,780
I'll post a sign.

379
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,280
That won't be necessary.

380
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,370
The other thing I insist upon
is some measure of assurance...

381
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,240
that when I make an appointment,
I'm in position...

382
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,000
to keep that appointment,
so far as such assurances are possible...

383
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,870
on a vessel of this type.

384
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,670
That's an awful lot of caveats
and addendum's there.

385
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,300
As I stated, I just want to be clear.

386
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,720
I'll take that into consideration
while I review the applications.

387
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,890
Don't be ridiculous.
You're gonna rent this shuttle to me.

388
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,180
- Am I?
- Yes.

389
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,810
And for one-quarter less
than your asking price.

390
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,100
- That a fact?
- It is.

391
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:46,320
And you figure you'll be getting
this discount why, exactly?

392
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,740
You want me.

393
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,030
You want me on your ship.

394
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,370
- Do I?
- Yes.

395
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,200
Because I can bring something
your surveyor...

396
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,370
or any of the other fish
you might have on line can't:

397
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,960
- A certain respectability.
- Respecta...

398
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,710
And based on what little I've seen
of your operation...

399
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,210
I suspect that's something
you could use.

400
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,800
Fine.

401
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,970
Let me ask you this.

402
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,270
If you're so respectable,
why are you even here?

403
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,690
I mean, I've heard tell of fancy
ladies such as yourself...

404
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,400
shipping out with big luxury liners
and the like...

405
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,900
but a registered companion
on a boat like this?

406
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,900
- What are you running from?
- I'm not running from anything.

407
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,280
If it's Alliance trouble, you might
want to consider another ship.

408
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,280
Some here fought for the Independents.

409
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,040
The Alliance has no quarrel with me.
I supported Unification.

410
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,920
Did you?

411
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,250
Well, I don't suppose you're
the only whore that did.

412
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,550
Oh, one further addendum.

413
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,590
That's the last time you get
to call me whore.

414
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,600
Absolutely.

415
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,180
Never again.

416
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,520
Keep everything set as low as possible.
Don't waste what you got.

417
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,600
Let me do that. You never
could operate this thing.

418
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,160
And try not to talk.

419
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,740
Talking uses up air.
Ain't no need for it.

420
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,990
Mal, come with us.

421
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,790
Can't. Four to a shuttle, Inara. Four.

422
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,580
One more. It can't make
a difference, not now.

423
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,710
I'm not leaving Serenity.

424
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,970
Mal, you don't have to die alone.

425
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,470
Everybody dies alone.

426
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,810
- Every thing's set and ready.
- Good.

427
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,770
I linked the nav systems of both
shuttles into the helm here.

428
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,700
When your miracle gets here, pound this
button once. It'll call back both shuttles.

429
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,790
Go see to your wife.

430
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,970
I went ahead and closed off
all below-deck vents...

431
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,640
diverted what's left to the bridge.
Ain't much.

432
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,060
My advice is seal off everything
behind you on your way back up.

433
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,020
Might buy you some time.

434
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:29,900
And I prepped a suit for you.
It's hanging in the fore deck.

435
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,320
- So when the time comes...
- I won't be needing it, but thanks.

436
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,240
Okay.

437
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,360
Well.

438
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,980
Firefly...

439
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,700
Your distress...

440
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,580
Firefly Serenity...

441
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:17,690
I'm sorry for your troubles, captain.
They sound many.

442
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,070
But you do understand, I can't
invite you aboard my vessel.

443
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,990
- I don't know you.
- I ain't asking for a ride, just a push.

444
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,700
Right. Your mechanical trouble.
Your compression coil, you say?

445
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,990
- It was the catalyser.
- Not even the coil.

446
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,790
- Catalyser's a nothing part, captain.
- It's nothing till you don't got one.

447
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,290
Then it appears to be everything.

448
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,710
Well, it is possible we might
have something that could do you.

449
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,170
We just come from a big
salvage mission off Ita Moon.

450
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,760
- I'd appreciate it.
- Trouble is...

451
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,140
how can I know for certain
your story's true?

452
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,140
Ambush could be waiting for me
and my people on the other side.

453
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:58,060
You can plainly see my shuttles
have been launched, just like I said.

454
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,740
And by now you've scanned me.
You know I got no life-support.

455
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,530
I don't expect to see any weapons
when we board.

456
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,870
And I do expect to see that engine part
before I open the door.

457
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,130
I feel like maybe we can do business.

458
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,820
Check him.

459
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,410
Search the ship. Start with the cockpit
and work your way down.

460
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,370
- Is this what you meant by ambush?
- I'm just verifying your story.

461
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,000
If you find anybody on board not
supposed to be, you shoot them.

462
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,840
I thought we were gonna be
reasonable about this.

463
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,170
Reason. He's gonna talk to us
about reason now.

464
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,340
Yeah, that's a joke.

465
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,850
- Which one you figure tracked us?
- The ugly one, sir.

466
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,140
- Could you be more specific?
- Do we look reasonable to you?

467
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,770
Well, looks can be deceiving.

468
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,940
Not as deceiving
as a low-down, dirty deceiver.

469
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,860
Well said.
Wasn't that well said, Zoe?

470
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,950
Had a kind of poetry to it, sir.

471
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,410
You want I should shoot
them now, Marco?

472
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,200
Wait till they tell us
where they put the stuff.

473
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,040
That's a good idea.

474
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,620
Good idea.

475
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,340
Tell us where the stuffs at,
so I can shoot you.

476
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,880
Point of interest.

477
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,510
Offering to shoot us might not work
so well...

478
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,090
as an incentive as you might imagine.

479
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,890
Anyway, we've hidden it.

480
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,770
So you kill us, you'll never find it.

481
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,730
Found you easy enough.

482
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,730
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

483
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,610
How much they paying you?

484
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,940
Huh?

485
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,030
I mean, let's say you did kill us
or didn't.

486
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,990
There could be torture, whatever.
But somehow, you found the goods.

487
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,540
- What would your cut be?
- Seven percent, straight off the top.

488
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,410
Seven? Huh.

489
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,460
- What?
- Hm?

490
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,960
Nothing. Not a thing. No, I just...

491
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,920
- Does that seem low to you?
- It does.

492
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,710
- That ain't low.
- Stop it.

493
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,300
- Seven percent's standard.
- Okay. Zoe, I'm paying you too much.

494
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,100
- What does she get?
- Knock it off!

495
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,810
Forget I said anything.
I'm sure you're treated well.

496
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,850
You get the perks, got your own room.

497
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,100
No?

498
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,230
You share a bunk?

499
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,610
With that one.

500
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,450
- Really?
- Jayne, this ain't funny.

501
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,580
- Yeah, I ain't laughing.
- You move on over to this side...

502
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,160
we'll not only show you
where the stuffs at...

503
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,870
we'll see to it you get
your fair share.

504
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,250
Not no sad seven.

505
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,170
- Private room?
- Jayne!

506
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,420
Your own room, full run
of the kitchen.

507
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,170
Jayne, I ain't asking...

508
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,260
Shut up.

509
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,680
How big a room?

510
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,470
Ship's clear, captain.

511
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,520
You check the engine room?

512
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,770
Just like he said,
the catalyser's blown.

513
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,190
That's all he needs.

514
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Anything that's worth anything
is right here in this cargo bay.

515
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,700
So you take a look around,
decide what you think is fair.

516
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,490
Already decided.

517
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,250
We're taking your ship.

518
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,210
Billy, get this plugged in.

519
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,800
Jesse, call Stern over here. You're
gonna pilot this pile of gosa out of here.

520
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,590
We'll get it as far as...

521
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,760
Jesse, don't call Stern.

522
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,560
Billy, leave the catalyser.

523
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,610
Do as he says.

524
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,190
Take your people and go.

525
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,800
You would've done the same.

526
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,380
We can already see I haven't.

527
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,800
Now get the hell off my ship.

528
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,960
Life-support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

529
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,600
Life-support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

530
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:33,650
Life-support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

531
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,300
- Real beauty.
- Serenity's not moving.

532
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,260
- When your miracle gets here...
- Come with us.

533
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,880
Everybody dies alone.

534
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,720
I'll run up and scrape off a piece.

535
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:50,810
- You'd do that for me?
- I'd do anything for you.

536
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,280
I don't think it's something
he should see when he wakes up.

537
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,570
Welcome back, sir.

538
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,410
- I go some place?
- Very nearly.

539
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,040
We thought we'd lost you.

540
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,370
I've been right here.

541
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,630
- Wash, you okay?
- Yeah, Mal, I'm fine.

542
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,840
- You got a thing in your arm.
- Yeah.

543
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,470
Try not to speak.
You're heavily medicated...

544
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,470
and you've lost a lot of blood.

545
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,770
I thought I ordered you all
off the ship.

546
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,690
- I call you back?
- No, Mal, you didn't.

547
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,940
I take full responsibility, captain.

548
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,950
The decision saved your life.

549
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,280
Won't happen again, sir.

550
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,120
Good.

551
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,250
And thanks. I'm grateful.

552
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,620
It was my pleasure, sir.

553
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,500
Hey, we'd have been back first...

554
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,290
except there's something wrong
with Inara's shuttle.

555
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,300
She done something to it.
Smells funny.

556
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,630
- I told you, that's incense.
- So you say.

557
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,680
- Hey, captain.
- Hey.

558
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,260
You fixed the ship. Good work.

559
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,430
- Thanks.
- All right.

560
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,690
I have to insist, the captain
needs to rest.

561
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,520
Yeah. I think the doc might not
be wrong about that one.

562
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,900
Just gonna need a few...

563
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,410
You all gonna be here when I wake up?

564
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,290
We'll be here.

565
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,710
Good.

566
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,670
That's good.

567
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,590
Yep. Real beauty, ain't she?

568
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,390
Yes, sir, a right smart purchase,
this vessel.

569
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,730
I'll tell you what, you buy this ship,
treat her proper...

570
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,940
she'll be with you for the rest
of your life.

571
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,110
Son?

572
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,490
Hey, son?

573
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,030
You hear a word I've been saying?
