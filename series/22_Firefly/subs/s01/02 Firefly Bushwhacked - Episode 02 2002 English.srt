02 Firefly Bushwhacked - Episode 02 2002 English

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,070
Over here.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,490
Bull's-eye.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,580
- Yes!
- Too tall, too tall.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,630
- Jayne!
- Little man!

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,380
Yes!

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,260
Come on, old man.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,730
- Right behind you.
- Yeah!

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,650
Hello.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,780
- Who's winning?
- I can't really tell.

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,200
They don't seem to be playing
by any civilised rules that I know.

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,700
Well, we're pretty far
from civilisation.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,460
- How's your sister?
- She's good. Better.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,000
She has her days.
And she still won't talk about...

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,260
what they did
to her at the academy.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,590
Perhaps she's not sure herself.

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,850
Open.

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,680
Good eye. Good eye!

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,390
She dreams about it.
I know that much.

20
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,940
Nightmares.

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,610
And now on the run,
on this ship...

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,610
I don't know if I'll be able to help her
here, and I need to help her.

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,700
Simon, you are.
Leaving your whole world behind?

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,450
It's incredibly selfless.

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,030
Yeah.

26
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,830
I selflessly turned us both
into wanted fugitives.

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,580
We're all running from something,
I suppose.

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,510
Proximity alert.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,970
- We must be coming up on something.
- Oh, my God.

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,010
What can it be? We're all doomed.
Who's flying this thing?

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,310
Oh, right, that would be me.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,640
Back to work.

33
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,020
So I guess it makes us one man short.

34
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,020
Yeah, little Kaylee's always
one man short.

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,940
Say, doc, why don't you
come on down...

36
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,950
and play for our side.
Inara won't mind.

37
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,010
- Wash, you have a stroke or something?
- Near enough.

38
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,810
What happened?

39
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,560
- Anybody home?
- Been hailing her.

40
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,230
But if who ever's there is as healthy
as the guy we just ran over...

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,110
can't imagine anybody's
gonna be picking up.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Bring us in closer.

43
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,160
Get you close enough
to ring the doorbell.

44
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,240
What is it?

45
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,000
It's a ghost.

46
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,560
So, what do we figure,
transport ship?

47
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,690
Converted cargo hauler.
Maybe a short-range scow.

48
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,730
You can see she don't wanna
be parked like that.

49
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,360
The port thrust's gone and that's what's
making her spin the way she is.

50
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,950
A short-range vessel this far
out into space?

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,950
Retrofitted to carry passengers.

52
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,910
Travellers pick them up at government
auction. A few modifications...

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,000
and they serve well enough
for a one-way push to the outer planets.

54
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,580
Settlers.

55
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,420
Cram 15 or 20 families on a boat
that size, you pack them in tight enough.

56
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,710
Families?

57
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,130
Tell you what I think.

58
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,550
I figure that fella we run into
did everyone on board. Killed them all.

59
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,010
Then he took a swim, see how
fast his blood would boil out his ears.

60
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,730
You're a very up person.

61
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,480
- Shouldn't we report this?
- To who? Alliance?

62
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,520
Right. They're gonna run here
lickety-split...

63
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,820
make sure these tax-payers are okay.
Then we'll have to.

64
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,280
If they're in need of help,
why aren't they beaming a distress call?

65
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,200
It's true. There's no beacon.

66
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,280
Which means no one's looking
to find her.

67
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,790
All the more reason for us
to do the right thing.

68
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,210
How's about you just say a prayer
when we slide on by?

69
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,000
Shall I remind you of the story
of the Good Samaritan?

70
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,630
I'd rather you didn't.
But we'll check it out.

71
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,970
Could be survivors.
And if not, well, then...

72
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,300
no one's gonna mind
if we take a look...

73
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,510
see if they left something behind.

74
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,850
Yeah... No, someone could be hurt.

75
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,830
Where do you think you're headed?

76
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,330
I thought I'd offer my services...

77
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,550
in case anyone on board
required medical attention.

78
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,340
Well, cap and Zoe
are going in first.

79
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,800
We'll holler if we need you.

80
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,970
- Something wrong?
- Hm?

81
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,770
Oh, no. No, I...

82
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,860
Well, I suppose it's just the thought
of a little Mylar and glass...

83
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,490
being the only thing
separating a person from nothing.

84
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,860
It's impressive what nothing
can do to a man.

85
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,990
Like that fella we bumped into.

86
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,700
He likely stuck up under
our belly about now.

87
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,790
That's what space trash does,
you know...

88
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,170
kind of latches on to the first
big something stops long enough.

89
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,510
Hey, now, that'd be a bit like
you and your sister, wouldn't it?

90
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,330
Entering adjoining air lock now.

91
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,420
Okay, Wash,
ask Serenity to knock for us.

92
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,810
Emergency power's up.

93
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,520
Dashboard light.

94
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,470
Whatever happened here
happened quick.

95
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,400
Everything was left on.

96
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,110
Ship powered down on its own.

97
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,580
No sign of a struggle.

98
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,540
- They're just...
- Gone.

99
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,550
Sir.

100
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,260
Personal log.

101
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,140
Someone was in the middle
of an entry.

102
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,950
It's okay.

103
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,280
It's okay, I'm here.

104
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,120
Bad dreams again?

105
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,460
No, I can't sleep.
There's too much screaming.

106
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,510
River, there is no screaming.

107
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,590
There was.

108
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,680
Hey, grab your med kit,
let's hoof it.

109
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,640
Mal wants us both over there
on the double.

110
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,020
- They found survivors?
- Didn't say.

111
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,940
Right.

112
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,110
I'll ask Inara to look in on River.

113
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,990
Whatever. I ain't waiting.

114
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll meet you there.
But don't take forever.

115
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,910
Still gotta get suited up.

116
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,790
Hi.

117
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,720
What are you doing here,
and what's with the suit?

118
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,020
You're hilarious.

119
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,690
- Sadist.
- All right, enough.

120
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,110
Ain't got time for games.

121
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,110
As long as you're here, you might as
well lend a hand. You roll with Kaylee.

122
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,320
Let's be quick about this, all right?

123
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,160
A few loads each. Don't be greedy.

124
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,620
- Where are the people?
- Ship says lifeboat launched a week ago.

125
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,700
We're gonna assume
everyone got off okay.

126
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,500
We're here to pick the bones.
Start in the engine room.

127
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,000
Jayne, you take the galley.

128
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,090
You had this on wrong.

129
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,140
Sir...

130
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,470
I count 16 families signed on.

131
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,100
- Lifeboat wouldn't hold a third of that.
- I know.

132
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,390
Wash, any luck?

133
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,230
Think I found something that matches
that class. Layout looks about right.

134
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,530
Seems to me any valuables,
if there are any...

135
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,200
likely be stored
somewhere C-deck aft.

136
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,570
Good work. Keep the engine running.

137
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,040
River? It's Inara.

138
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,040
Are you hungry, sweetie?

139
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
River?

140
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,360
- Aren't you the least bit curious?
- About what?

141
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,200
Well, what happened here.

142
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,160
Why would anybody abandon their ship
in the middle of nowhere like this?

143
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,120
For all sorts of reasons.
Just not mechanical.

144
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,250
What?

145
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,880
There ain't nothing wrong with this.
Not that I can see, anyhow.

146
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,090
Whew!

147
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,880
Well, here's a good one.

148
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,930
Hold the bag open.

149
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,280
This looks to be it.

150
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,080
- Locked.
- Well, now...

151
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,550
I'd say that's like
to be a very good sign.

152
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,870
Here.

153
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,540
Gen-seed, protein, crop supplements.

154
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,080
Everything a growing family needs
to make a fresh start on a new world.

155
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,500
Hard subsidies for 14-plus families.

156
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,460
- That's...
- About a fortune.

157
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
Forget the rest.
We just take this stuff.

158
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,890
We're gonna need a hand
hauling it out of here.

159
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,930
Sir...

160
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,270
even on a lifeboat...

161
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,020
you'd think those who escaped
would find room for some of this.

162
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,280
- Nobody escaped.
- Sir?

163
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,780
Nobody.

164
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,580
My God.

165
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,460
I know what did this.

166
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,710
Get her out of here.

167
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,720
Jayne? Jayne, drop what you're doing
and get to the engine room.

168
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,060
I want you to take Kaylee and the doctor
off this boat. Don't ask questions.

169
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,730
Jayne.

170
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,110
Captain?

171
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
Captain.

172
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Zoe!

173
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,820
Came from above, sir.

174
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,030
The galley.

175
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,540
- We heard shooting.
- River, what are you...?

176
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,960
- I followed the voices.
- Don't ever leave the ship. Not ever.

177
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,670
Okay, handle her, will you, son?

178
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,670
- What in... ls going on in there?
- Not now, dear.

179
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,690
What'd you see?

180
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,280
Didn't. It came at me from behind.

181
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,530
Big, though. Strong.

182
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,990
- I think I might have hit him.
- You did.

183
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,140
- No. No, no...
- Easy, now.

184
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,390
No one's gonna hurt you.

185
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,600
No. No mercy. No.

186
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,900
- Any more than we already did.
- No mercy.

187
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,400
Well, we got lots of mercy.
We got lots and lots of...

188
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,130
Oh, yes...

189
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,000
he's a real beast.

190
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,300
It's a wonder you're still alive.

191
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,050
Looked bigger
when I couldn't see him.

192
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,640
- I wonder how long he lived like that.
- I know.

193
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,310
He must be real brave to survive
like that when nobody else did.

194
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,810
Yeah, real hero,
killing all them people.

195
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,990
What? No, we don't believe that.

196
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,200
We don't, do we?

197
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,780
Captain wouldn't have brought him
on board were that the case.

198
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,740
Pulse is rapid.

199
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,410
Blood pressure's high side of normal,
to be expected.

200
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,420
Weak. They were all weak.

201
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,670
Other than the bullet wound,
there isn't any exterior trauma.

202
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,670
Though that crack to the head
probably didn't do him any good.

203
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,220
Cattle.

204
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,310
Cattle for the slaughter.

205
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,930
Dope him.

206
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,520
- I don't think that...
- Just do it.

207
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,730
No mercy. No resistance.

208
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,910
Open up. See what's inside.

209
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,800
No mercy.

210
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,010
So how's our patient?

211
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,520
Aside from borderline malnutrition,
he's in remarkably good health.

212
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,310
So he'll live then.

213
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,940
Which, to my mind, is unfortunate.

214
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,110
Not a very charitable attitude, captain.

215
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,110
- Charity'd be putting a bullet in his brain.
- Mal.

216
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,990
We'd save him the suffering.

217
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,660
All right, no one goes in here.

218
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,450
Nothing more we can do,
not after what he's seen.

219
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,500
What do you mean?

220
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,210
The ship was hit by Reavers.

221
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,250
Reavers?

222
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,220
- Mal, how can you know?
- He don't.

223
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,270
That's how. No way.

224
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,770
It was that other fella,
the one we run into.

225
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,310
Like I said before,
he went stir-crazy...

226
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,900
killed the rest,
then took a walk in space.

227
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,150
- Just a second ago you said that...
- Don't matter. Wasn't Reavers.

228
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,280
Reavers don't leave no survivors.

229
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,700
- Strictly speaking, wouldn't say they did.
- What are you suggesting?

230
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,910
Don't matter we took him off that boat.
It's the place he's gonna live now.

231
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,790
I don't accept that.

232
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,460
Whatever horror he witnessed...

233
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,670
whatever acts of barbarism,
it was done by men. Nothing more.

234
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,760
Reavers ain't men.

235
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,380
Of course they are.

236
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,640
Too long removed from civilisation,
perhaps, but men.

237
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,850
And I believe there's a power
greater than man.

238
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,640
A power that heals.

239
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,060
Reavers might take issue
with that philosophy.

240
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,480
If they had a philosophy.

241
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,860
And if they weren't too busy
gnawing on your insides.

242
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,950
Jayne's right. Reavers ain't men.

243
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,660
Or they forgot how to be.
Now they're just nothing.

244
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,660
They got to the edge of the galaxy,
that place of nothing...

245
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,630
and that's what they became.
Why are we sitting here?

246
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,050
- If it was Reavers, we should be gone.
- Work ain't done.

247
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,260
Still substantial money value
sitting over there.

248
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,720
I ain't going over there
with them bodies, no rutting way.

249
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,260
- Not if Reavers messed with them.
- Jayne, you'll scare the women.

250
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,100
I'll go.

251
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,480
- I've dealt with bodies.
- I'd like to go with him.

252
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,400
Maybe see what I can do
about putting those folks to rest.

253
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,530
Those folks are already resting.
Reavers saw to that.

254
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,070
How we treat our dead
is part of what makes us different...

255
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,080
than those did the slaughtering.

256
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,540
All right.

257
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,080
You go say your words.

258
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,040
Jayne, help the doctor and
Shepherd Book cut down those people...

259
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,010
then you'll load up the cargo.
I don't believe this.

260
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,760
- We're sitting put for a funeral?
- Yes, Jayne.

261
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,220
That is exactly what we're gonna do.

262
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,810
I won't have these people looking
over my shoulder.

263
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,890
I ain't saying there's any peace to be
had, but on the off-chance there is...

264
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,520
those folks deserve a little of it.

265
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,490
Just when I think
I've got you figured out.

266
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,580
That was real pretty, captain,
what you just said.

267
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,790
Didn't think you were one
for rituals and such.

268
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,750
I'm not. I figure it'll keep
the others busy for a while.

269
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,880
No need to concern them
with what's to be done.

270
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,130
Sir?

271
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,390
It's a real burden
being right so often.

272
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,680
- What is that?
- Booby trap.

273
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,230
Reavers leave them for rescue ships.
Triggered it when we latched on.

274
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,810
- And when we detach?
- It blows.

275
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,110
Okay, so we don't detach. We just...

276
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,570
- I don't know, sit tight until...
- What, Reavers come back?

277
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,860
Looks like they jerry-rigged it
with a pressure catch.

278
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,700
It's the only thing that'd work
with these spare parts.

279
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,080
We could probably bypass that easy,
we get to the DC line.

280
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,870
Tell me right now, Kaylee.
You think you can do this?

281
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,670
Sure. Yeah.

282
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,210
I think so.

283
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,840
Besides, if I mess up, it's not like
you'll be able to yell at me.

284
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,850
No. No.

285
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,090
What's going on?

286
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,050
Well, right at this particular moment,
I'd have to say, not a thing. Right?

287
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,430
- Not a gorram thing.
- Looked like a thing to me.

288
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,850
Thought we had a situation,
but it looks to be taken care of.

289
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,810
Let's get that merchandise put away.

290
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,450
Everyone's home, Wash. Let's go.

291
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,620
No, no, no. Don't you say that.
It's the Reavers.

292
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,960
- The gorram Reavers come back.
- Get that stuff stored.

293
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,300
- Like it's gonna matter!
- Just do it!

294
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,130
Reavers?

295
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,260
Firefly-class transport, you are
ordered to release control of your helm.

296
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,310
Prepare to dock and be boarded.

297
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,280
Looks like civilisation finally
caught up with us.

298
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,460
No mandatory registration markings
on the bow.

299
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,170
Make sure we cite them for that.

300
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,710
Sir, we've identified the transport ship
they were attached to.

301
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,880
It was licensed to a group
of families out of Bernadette.

302
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,510
They were due to touch down in Newhall
three weeks ago. Never made it.

303
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,470
Once we secure these vultures,
we'll send a team over.

304
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,100
Didn't we have a flag
on a Firefly a while back?

305
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,150
Check.

306
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,990
Here it is. An alert issued
on an unidentified Firefly-class...

307
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,490
believed to be carrying two fugitives.
A brother and sister.

308
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,950
What are they wanted for?

309
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,700
It's not available. It's classified.

310
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,660
40,000 of these in the air,
and that's all they give us.

311
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,920
Well, I'm not about to have any
surprises on a routine check.

312
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,670
We run into these two,
we shoot first.

313
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,670
The brass can sort it out later.

314
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,340
- What was it?
- Open the stash, pull out the goods.

315
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,010
- Just got done putting it in.
- I'm telling you to take it all out again.

316
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,180
- Why for?
- I got no notion to argue this.

317
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,020
In about two minutes' time, this boat's
gonna be crawling with Alliance.

318
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,360
No.

319
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,860
- We've gotta run.
- Can't. They're pulling us in.

320
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,700
If they find us, they'll send River back
to that place.

321
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,490
To be tortured.
I'd never see her again.

322
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,540
Stack everything here in plain sight.

323
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,040
Don't want to seem
like we got anything to hide.

324
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,370
Might give them boys
the wrong impression.

325
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,750
- Or the right one.
- That too. Go run and fetch your sister.

326
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,550
What?

327
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,050
Are you gonna put her
in plain sight too?

328
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,970
- Don't get touchy. Just do as I say.
- Ls that why you let us stay?

329
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,890
- To use us as bargaining chips?
- Knew there was a reason.

330
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,390
They're not taking her.
You're not giving her to them.

331
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,440
Don't be a fool, son.

332
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,860
Do as the man says.

333
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,840
Well, quite a lot of fuss.

334
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:53,680
If I didn't know better,
I'd think we were dangerous.

335
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,970
- Is this your vessel?
- Bought and paid for.

336
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,720
I'm Capt.. Malcolm Reynolds.

337
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,810
- And is this everyone, captain?
- By way of crew, it is.

338
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,400
Though, in our infirmary,
you're gonna find a fella we rescued.

339
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,190
Saved him, guess you could say.

340
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,400
Straight through the back,
next to the common area.

341
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,530
And these items,
I take it you rescued them as well.

342
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,430
Looks like
an illegal salvage operation.

343
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,050
It does? That's discouraging.

344
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,760
Alliance property too.
You could lose your ship.

345
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,180
That's a wrist-slap compared
to the penalty for harbouring fugitives.

346
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,980
A brother and sister. When I search
this vessel, I won't find them?

347
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,900
No children on this boat.

348
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,900
I didn't say children.

349
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,200
Siblings. Adult siblings.

350
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,870
I misunderstood.

351
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,500
No chance they could've stowed away?

352
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,960
No one would blame you.

353
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,250
I know how these older-model Fireflys...

354
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,630
tend to have those troublesome
little nooks.

355
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Do they?

356
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,340
Smugglers and the like tend to prefer
them just for that reason.

357
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,060
We will continue this conversation
in a more official capacity.

358
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,480
- I want every inch of this junker tossed.
- Junker?

359
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,150
Settle down, Kaylee.

360
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,240
But did you hear what
that purple-belly called Serenity?

361
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,280
Shut up.

362
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,550
- You are a companion.
- Yes.

363
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,850
And you were based
for years on Sihnon.

364
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,310
It's only in the last year that
you've been with The Serenity?

365
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,360
It's just Serenity. And that's correct.
In a few weeks, it will be a year.

366
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,110
Why is this important?

367
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,240
I'm just trying
to put the pieces together.

368
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,660
It's a curiosity,
a woman of stature such as yourself...

369
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,530
falling in with these types.

370
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,080
Not in the least.

371
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,080
It's a mutually beneficial
business arrangement.

372
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,000
I rent the shuttle from Capt.. Reynolds,
allowing me to expand my client base.

373
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,760
And the captain finds that having
a companion on board...

374
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,970
opens certain doors that might
otherwise be closed to him.

375
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,050
And you love him?

376
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,060
- I don't see how that's relevant.
- He is your husband.

377
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,310
Yes.

378
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,600
You met through Capt.. Reynolds.

379
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,940
Captain was looking for a pilot.
I found a husband.

380
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,310
Seemed to work out.

381
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,400
- You fought with Reynolds in the war.
- Fought with a lot of people.

382
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,900
- And your husband.
- Fight with him sometimes too.

383
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,950
Is there any particular reason
you don't wish to discuss your marriage?

384
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,910
Don't see that it's any
of your business, is all.

385
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,710
We're very private people.

386
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,380
The legs. Oh, yeah. I'd definitely
have to say it was her legs.

387
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,960
You can put that down.

388
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,010
Her legs and right where her legs
meet her back.

389
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,100
Actually, that whole area.
That and above it.

390
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,520
Six gerstlers crammed right
under every cooling drive...

391
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,100
so you strain your
primary artery function...

392
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,650
and you have to recycle secondary
exhaust through a bypass system...

393
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,610
just so you don't pump
it through the main atmo feed...

394
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,940
and asphyxiate the entire crew.

395
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,740
Now, that's junk.

396
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,410
Have you seen what she wears?
Forget about it.

397
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,830
Have you ever been
with a warrior woman?

398
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,220
Pirates.
Pirates with their own chaplain.

399
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,930
There's an oddity.

400
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,770
Not the only oddity this end
of space, commander.

401
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,560
We have things not always so plain
as on the central planets.

402
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,230
Rules can be a mite fuzzier.

403
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,150
These fugitives that we're looking for,
the brother and the sister...

404
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,490
they were last seen on Persephone.

405
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,990
That a fact?

406
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,330
They also left port
aboard a Firefly-class transport.

407
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,200
About the same time
that you shipped out with Serenity.

408
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,710
Well, Persephone's a big place.

409
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,290
Yes.

410
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,460
Yes, it is, and that Firefly isn't.

411
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,590
And if anyone's hiding anywhere on it,
we will find them.

412
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,590
So I figure by now you've been over
to the derelict, seen for yourself.

413
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,930
Yes. Terrible thing.

414
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,730
If you want my advice,
you won't tow it back.

415
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,190
Just fire the whole gorram thing
from space, be done with it.

416
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,900
That ship is evidence. I'm not
in the habit of destroying evidence.

417
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,740
Of course not.
It'd be against the rules.

418
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,030
I'm gonna make a leap here...

419
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,950
and figure this is your first tour
out here on the border.

420
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,830
It's a very loyal crew
you have there.

421
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,000
But then, I can tell
by your record you have...

422
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,260
a tendency to inspire that quality
in people, sergeant.

423
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,180
It's not sergeant.
Not anymore. War's over.

424
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,890
For some, the war will never be over.

425
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,560
I notice your ship's called Serenity.

426
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:02,020
You were stationed on Hara. Battle
of Serenity Valley took place there.

427
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,360
You know,
I believe you might be right.

428
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,690
Independents suffered
a crushing defeat there.

429
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,490
Some say after Serenity,
the brown coats were through.

430
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,530
The war ended in that valley.

431
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,200
Seems odd you'd name your ship after
a battle you're on the wrong side of.

432
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,710
May have been the losing side.

433
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,580
Still not convinced
it was the wrong one.

434
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,210
- Is that why you attacked that transport?
- What?

435
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,340
You're still fighting
the same battle.

436
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,720
Only those weren't soldiers you
murdered, they were civilians.

437
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,560
Citizens trying to make a new life,
and you just can't stand that, can you?

438
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,230
So we attacked that ship, then brought
the only living survivor to our infirmary.

439
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,270
- Is that what we did?
- I'd ask him.

440
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,570
Only I'm not sure he can speak
with his tongue split down the middle.

441
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,280
I haven't seen that kind
of torture since...

442
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,030
Well, since the war.

443
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,330
I should have known.

444
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,830
You are bound by law.

445
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,000
Formal charges will be transmitted.

446
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,750
Commander, I'm not what you need
to be concerned about right now.

447
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,380
If things go the way they are,
there's gonna be blood.

448
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,300
- Let's start compression.
- All right.

449
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Get a line in.

450
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,570
Reavers?

451
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,530
That is what I said.

452
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,860
You can't imagine how many times men
in my position hear that excuse.

453
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,030
- Reavers did it.
- It's the truth.

454
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,240
You saw them, did you?

455
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,540
- Wouldn't be sitting here if I had.
- No, of course not.

456
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,830
I'll tell you who did. That poor
bastard you took off my ship.

457
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,460
He looked into the face of it,
was made to stare.

458
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,720
- It?
- The darkness.

459
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,140
Kind of darkness
you can't even imagine.

460
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,720
Blacker than the space
it moves through.

461
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,180
Very poetic.

462
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,560
They made him watch.

463
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,520
He probably tried to turn away.
They wouldn't let him.

464
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,110
You call him a survivor. He's not.

465
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,240
A man comes up against that kind
of will, the only way to deal with it...

466
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,620
I suspect, is to become it.

467
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,500
He's following the only course left
to him.

468
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,540
First, he'll try to make himself
look like one.

469
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,130
Cut on himself, desecrate his flesh.
And then...

470
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,010
he'll start acting like one.

471
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,810
Let's have two MPs up here
to escort Sgt.. Reynolds to the brig.

472
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,860
Let's go again.

473
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,410
Later.

474
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,910
Maybe. Captain said
once the coast is clear...

475
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,910
we should lay low in the shuttle.
Come on.

476
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,330
Coming back?

477
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:13,210
Yes. Yes, of course he is.
They all are.

478
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,090
Your ship will be auctioned.

479
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,890
The proceeds will be applied
to the cost of your defence.

480
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,520
Get him out of here!

481
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,140
Go to full lock down.
I want guards on the nursery.

482
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,270
It won't matter. You won't find him.

483
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,860
But I know where he'll go.

484
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,110
Wait! No. Don't. Don't.

485
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,870
River, it's okay.

486
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,620
- Wait. Wait.
- They've gone. Come on.

487
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,370
- Don't.
- River, it's okay.

488
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,840
- Come on.
- No. Don't...

489
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,260
River, you don't have to be afraid.

490
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,720
Why would he come back here?

491
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,810
Looking for familiar ground.

492
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,230
He's on the hunt.

493
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,940
All right. Let's get him to the brig.

494
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,230
- No, no, no. I should go with you.
- It's out of the question.

495
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,360
How many men
you feel like losing today?

496
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,780
Nobody knows Serenity like I do.
I can help you.

497
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,580
We let him go first.

498
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,620
Right.

499
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,040
You want to...

500
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,850
Thanks.
Now I'll really have the advantage.

501
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,740
We don't know
how long it's going to be.

502
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,240
Once we're settled,
we shouldn't move much.

503
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,200
I'm just gonna grab some food.

504
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,330
Someone's coming.

505
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,140
You save his gorram life,
he still takes the cargo.

506
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,430
He had to.

507
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,730
