00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,249
03 Firefly Shindig - Episode 03 2002 English

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,310
Didn't hardly have
to convert the ship even.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,430
Six in the corner.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,270
Stronger locks, thicker doors, keep
everybody where they're supposed to be.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,060
Don't even need more rations.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,900
Hey!

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,070
- Wait!
- Come on!

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,830
- You made money, huh?
- Hand over fist, my friend.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,380
Water plants need labour, terraforming
crews got a prodigious death rate.

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,170
Labour? You mean slaves.

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,550
Well, they wasn't volunteers,
for damn sure.

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,220
That why you didn't have to lay in
more rations?

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,940
- I didn't hear no complaints.
- How much money? Lots?

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,110
There's a chance you might want
to head back to the ship.

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,360
No, I'm all right.
This is entertaining, actually.

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,070
- Yeah? What's entertaining?
- I like watching the game.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,620
As with other situations,
the key seems to be...

18
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,450
giving Jayne a heavy stick
and standing back.

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,960
Still, might have to clear out
before too much longer.

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,670
- Seems there's a thief about.
- Thief?

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,380
Took this right off him.

22
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,470
They earned that with the sweat
of their slave-trading brows.

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,430
- Mal.
- Oh, terrible shame.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,180
They won't discover it till they order
their next round of drinks.

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,970
Good drinker, that one.

26
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,800
Lovely place.
I'll tell my friends.

27
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,240
- Seem to you we clear out in a hurry?
- Seems to me, we do that a lot.

28
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,620
Hear tell, though,
we're gonna stay a while on Persephone.

29
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,950
- Shiny.
- Yeah? Thought you'd get land crazy...

30
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,910
that long in port. Probably.

31
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,630
But I been sane a long while now,
and change is good.

32
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,670
- Well, ain't that a joyful sight.
- Gotta love a sunset.

33
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,300
It's starting to get familiar,
like a second home.

34
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,180
Persephone ain't home.
Too many people we need to avoid.

35
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,850
Resupply, look for work,
move along.

36
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,770
- We sniff the air, we don't kiss the dirt.
- Wasn't planning on the dirt kissing.

37
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,570
I wouldn't stand for it anyway, captain,
jealous man like me.

38
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,190
- Closing in.
- Planet's coming up a mite fast.

39
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,660
That's just because I'm going down
too quick.

40
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,080
- Likely crash and kill us all.
- Well, that happens, let me know.

41
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,500
Okay. Whoa.

42
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,210
No, we're good. We're good.
It's okay.

43
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,060
I understand your time on our planet
is limited...

44
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,020
and if you've selected my proposal
to hear...

45
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,020
then the honour you do me
flatters my...

46
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,600
my honour, and I hope to...

47
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,820
- Now there's the smile made of sunlight.
- Atherton. How wonderful to see you.

48
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,200
Did you get my message?
I was extra appealing.

49
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,790
Flattering. I had no idea I was arriving in
time for the social event of the season.

50
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,960
So you'll accompany me?
I ask, heart in my throat.

51
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,840
There's a certain offer
I'm still waiting to hear about.

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,090
Yes, I imagine there is.
I'm delighted to say I'll be there.

53
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,300
Now, I'm sorry, Atherton,
I have to run.

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,520
No, please, I understand.
I'll see you soon.

55
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,400
- Good afternoon, captain.
- Morning.

56
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,820
We're downing. In case Wash don't kill
us, local time's gonna be a.m., 10 or so.

57
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,200
Yes, I saw that.

58
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,570
Making plans? Atherton Wing.

59
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,910
Now he's a regular, ain't he?

60
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,120
- I've seen him before.
- I never did.

61
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,630
Not what I pictured. Young.

62
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,210
- Must be rich to afford your rates.
- I suppose.

63
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,010
- He has engaged me for several days.
- Days?

64
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,640
- Boy must have stamina.
- He does.

65
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,930
Well. Fine.

66
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,110
- Is he letting you out at all?
- We're attending a ball tomorrow night.

67
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,280
Do all the men there pay for their dates,
or just young, rich ones with stamina?

68
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,160
Most women will not be companions,
if that's what you're asking.

69
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,120
Perhaps the other men
couldn't attract one.

70
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,160
It sounds like the finest party
I could imagine getting paid to go to.

71
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,630
I don't suppose you'd find it
up to the standards of your outings.

72
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,630
More conversation and less petty theft
and getting hit with pool cues.

73
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,390
I understand if you need to go prepare
for that...

74
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,850
it's 10 in the morning issue.

75
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,640
Yeah, better go do that, because I think
this is more of an evening look.

76
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,630
Look at the pretties!

77
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,130
What am I looking at?
The girls or the clothes?

78
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,220
- There's girls?
- The clothes, please.

79
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,510
Say, look at the fluffy one.

80
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,640
Too much Foofaraw.
If I were gonna wear a dress...

81
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,520
I'd want something with slink.
You want a slinky dress?

82
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,900
I can buy you a slinky dress.
Can I have money for a slinky dress?

83
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,190
- I'll chip in.
- I can hurt you.

84
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,480
The only place I seen something
so nice...

85
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,700
is some of the things Inara has.
We best be moving.

86
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,280
I guess she needs all that stuff.
Life she leads.

87
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,540
Well, sure. Sometimes the customers
buy her things.

88
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,580
She knows some real rich men.

89
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,000
- These ain't feathers I'm toting here.
- I like the ruffles.

90
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,380
- Inara gets to wear whatever she wants.
- What are you gonna do in that rig?

91
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,090
Bounce around the engine room?
Be like a sheep walking on its hind legs.

92
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,520
See you on the ship, captain.

93
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,700
What, she mad or something?

94
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,800
- Badger.
- Capt.. Reynolds.

95
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,470
Heard you was in town. Thought
we might have a bit of a sit-down.

96
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,390
Prefer a bit of a piss off.

97
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,350
I'm very sorry, did I give you
the impression I was asking?

98
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,160
Seems to me, last time
there was a chance for a palaver...

99
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,240
we were all manner of unwelcome.

100
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
This ain't bad.

101
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,500
There's a trick to it.
Wood alcohol.

102
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,250
Now we're favoured guests.

103
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,630
Treated to the finest in beverages
that make you blind.

104
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,300
- So, what is it you need?
- Excuse me.

105
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,560
There's a local
by the name of Warrick Harrow.

106
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,770
Got some property he wants to sell
off-planet. Fetch a higher price.

107
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,850
- The local powers won't let him.
- It's a conundrum.

108
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,860
What my man Harrow needs himself
is a smuggler. Willing to cut you in on it.

109
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,780
Why me? You have access to ships.
You could do it yourself.

110
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,320
He won't deal with me direct.
He's taken an irrational dislike.

111
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,200
What happened, he see your face?

112
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,920
He's a quality gent. Nose in the air
like he never won gwa pee.

113
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,250
Don't find me respectable,
but you, I figure, got a chance.

114
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,210
You backed out of a deal last time.
Left us hanging.

115
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,010
- Hurt our feelings.
- You recall why that took place?

116
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,010
I had a problem with your attitude,
is why.

117
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,970
Felt you was, what's the word?

118
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,100
- Pretentious?
- Exactly!

119
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,560
You think you're better
than other people.

120
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,570
Just the ones I'm better than.

121
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,320
I'm thinking that very quality
is the one you're placing value on today.

122
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,320
I place value on the fact
that stick up your peeku...

123
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,240
is as large as the one Harrow's got.
How would you even set up a meet?

124
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,950
The man won't deal with you.

125
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,910
Know a place he'll be.
Safe place...

126
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,290
using some new-tech gun scans.
High-class too.

127
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,710
Won't let me in there.
You might slip in.

128
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,920
Of course, you couldn't buy an invite
with a diamond the size of a testicle.

129
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,720
I got my hands on a couple.

130
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,440
Of invites.
You want this meeting or not?

131
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,240
Col. Cyrus Mumsen and escort.

132
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,540
William and Lady Courtland.

133
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,260
Atherton Wing and Inara Serra.

134
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,780
Roberta, it's been too long.

135
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,040
Half the men in this room
wish you were on their arm.

136
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,920
Only half? I must be losing
my undefinable allure.

137
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,430
Oh, it's not that undefinable.
All of them wish they were in your bed.

138
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,560
I'm looking for the boy
with the shimmer one.

139
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,100
Oh, she blushes.
Not many in your line of work do that.

140
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,530
You are a very singular woman.
And I find...

141
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,950
I find I admire you more and more.

142
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,330
Kaylee!

143
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,420
Kaylee!

144
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,010
Not speaking to you, captain.

145
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,550
Got no need to speak.
Come on, got a job for you.

146
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,070
I'm trying to offer you something,
you know. A life.

147
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,860
- If you want it.
- Atherton.

148
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,790
You can live here on Persephone
as my personal companion.

149
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,330
You're a generous man.

150
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:16,510
- That is not a yes.
- It's not a no, either.

151
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,590
You look gorgeous, dear.

152
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,980
You belong here, Inara.
Not on a flying piece of gosa.

153
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,100
- You see that, don't you?
- Atherton, language.

154
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,480
What, piece of gosa?
But it is a piece of gosa.

155
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,110
Miss Kaywinnit Lee Frye and escort.

156
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,370
Kaylee?

157
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,380
Oh, gosa.

158
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,170
Does...? Does this seem kind of tight?

159
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,550
It shows off your backside.
Did you see the chandelier? It's hovering.

160
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,430
- What's the point of that, I wonder.
- Oh, mangoes.

161
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,510
I mean, I see how they did it,
I just ain't getting the why.

162
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,600
These girls have
the most beautiful dresses.

163
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,980
- And so do I, how about that?
- Just be careful.

164
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,440
We cheated Badger
out of good money to buy that.

165
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,690
You're supposed to make me
look respectable.

166
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,440
- Yes, sir, Captain Tight Pants.
- Okay.

167
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm looking for our guy Harrow.

168
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,490
And Inara. We should look for her, right?
Just to say hello.

169
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,290
If we see her.
I think she's wearing gold.

170
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,290
Okay, help me find our man.
He's supposed to be older, stocky...

171
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,920
wears a red sash crossways.
Why does he do that?

172
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,750
Maybe he won the Miss Persephone
pageant. Just help me.

173
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,800
Is that him?

174
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,880
That's the buffet table.

175
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,430
Well, how can we be sure
unless we question it?

176
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,680
Fine. Don't make yourself sick.

177
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,700
Ante up, gentlemen. Dishes.

178
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,790
Dishes. Could do with less of them.

179
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,750
Garbage.

180
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,630
So I'll card... Plum.

181
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,220
Plums are tall.

182
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,600
I'll take two.

183
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,930
Two. No tall-card claim.

184
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,690
- Speaking of garbage, I'll take three.
- Three.

185
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,650
Dealer forced to claim the tall.

186
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,870
What do you suppose the captain
and Kaylee are doing now?

187
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,120
- Septic vac.
- Eating steaks off of plates...

188
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,410
made of solid money, like as anything.
I fold.

189
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,080
Me too. Tall cards around
my neck like a weight.

190
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,340
Take it, Shepherd.

191
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,960
That's a nice pile of things
I don't have to do.

192
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,470
It's the ones that take you.

193
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,720
The ones reaching and doing it.

194
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,060
- River.
- Ls she hurt?

195
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,650
- Better see to her.
- It's okay.

196
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,230
It's a bad habit for a fugitive.

197
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,820
- Calm down.
- Do that in public, get herself hauled off.

198
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,900
- Everywhere.
- Sit down.

199
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:13,240
- Hands go everywhere...
- She didn't harm much.

200
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,580
- We'll have a few mystery meals.
- Because sometimes...

201
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,830
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.

202
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,300
And they come.

203
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,050
So we gonna play cards
or screw around?

204
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,860
I thought you wanted to spend
more time off-ship this visit.

205
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,240
Out there, it seems like it's all
fancy parties. I like our party better.

206
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,080
The dress code's easier,
and I know all the steps.

207
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,620
I'd say you do, at that.

208
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,920
Oh...

209
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,500
Don't fall asleep now.

210
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,220
Sleepiness is weakness of character.
Ask anyone.

211
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,010
It is not.

212
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,800
You are acting captain. Know
what happens, you fall asleep now?

213
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,230
Jayne slits my throat
and takes over.

214
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,730
- That's right.
- Then we can't stop it.

215
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,440
Well, I wash my hands of it.
It's a hopeless case.

216
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,320
I'll read a nice poem at the funeral.
Something with imagery.

217
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,660
You could lock the door and keep
the power-hungry maniac at bay.

218
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,170
Don't know,
I'm starting to like this poetry idea now.

219
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,260
Here lies my beloved Zoe
My autumn flower.

220
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,640
Somewhat less attractive now that
She's all corpsified and gross.

221
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,800
Oh, no!

222
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,650
Aren't they something?

223
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,570
They're like butterflies or little pieces
of wrapping paper blowing around.

224
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,590
- Hello.
- I don't... Have we been introduced?

225
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,510
Oh, I'm Kaylee.

226
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,720
Banning. And this is Dester,
Cabott and Zoe.

227
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,510
Don't you just love this party?

228
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,270
Every thing's so fancy, and there's
some kind of hot cheese over there.

229
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,850
- It's not as good as last year.
- Really? What did they have last year?

230
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,860
Standards.

231
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,940
Who made your dress, Kaylee?

232
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,820
Oh, do you like it? When I saw
the ruffles, I just couldn't resist.

233
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,490
You ought to see to your girl.

234
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,540
Your girl, she's not very good.

235
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,670
She made you a dress
that looks like you bought it in a store.

236
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,090
Oh, I didn't know...

237
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,220
Why, Banning Miller,
what a vision in your fine dress.

238
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,640
It must've take a dozen slaves
a dozen days to get you into that getup.

239
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,730
Of course, your daddy tells me
it takes a schoolboy's wink...

240
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,100
to get you out of it again.

241
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,450
Forgive my rudeness.
I cannot abide useless people.

242
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,380
Oh, no. No. Thank you very much.

243
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,220
Beg your pardon,
but would you be Mr. Warrick Harrow?

244
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,810
- Sir Warrick Harrow. The sash.
- The sash?

245
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:11,190
- It indicates lordhood.
- And it's doing a great job.

246
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,240
Sir, my name's Malcolm Reynolds.
I captain a ship named Serenity.

247
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,620
I've been led to understand you want
to move some property off-world.

248
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,920
Some property you want to move
off-world discreetly.

249
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,210
You're mistaken, sir.
I'm an honest man.

250
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,550
There's nothing dishonest about getting
your goods to people what need them.

251
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,930
- Whom do you represent?
- Represent isn't exactly the...

252
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,390
- Don't waste my time.
- Fellow called Badger.

253
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,350
I know him,
and I think he's a psychotic lowlife.

254
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,150
I think calling him that is an insult
to the psychotic lowlife community.

255
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,030
- But the deal is solid.
- Sorry to interrupt.

256
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,160
Sir Warrick, I know you from the club,
I believe.

257
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,990
Captain, this is Atherton Wing.

258
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,040
Atherton, Capt.. Mal Reynolds.

259
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,330
Pleased to meet you. Inara, I didn't
realize you were going to this party.

260
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,290
- It's the only party.
- And I can see why.

261
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,550
How about that floating chandelier?

262
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,090
Almost outshines our girl here.

263
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,470
Ath... Can I call you Ath?

264
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,680
Inara has spoken of you to me.
She made a point of your generosity.

265
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,640
Given that,
I'm sure you won't mind...

266
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,560
if I ask Inara the favour of a dance?

267
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,230
Of course.

268
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,370
- You're a brave man.
- I know what's mine.

269
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,790
This dance I think I actually know.

270
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,680
- Why are you here?
- Business, same as you.

271
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,810
I was talking to a contact about a job,
and you came over.

272
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,560
- You were staring at me.
- I saw you, is all. You stand out.

273
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,190
In this company, I believe
you're the one who stands out.

274
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,700
Maybe I just want to see
a professional at work.

275
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,990
Is this the hardest part,
or is that later?

276
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,530
You've no call to try to make me
ashamed of my job. What I do is legal.

277
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,160
And how's that smuggling coming?

278
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,120
- My work's illegal, but it's honest.
- What?

279
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,210
While this, the lie of it.

280
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,710
That man parading you around
on his arm as if he actually won you.

281
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,420
As if he loves you.
And everyone here going along with it.

282
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,930
These people like me and I like them.
I like Atherton too, by the way.

283
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,890
Well, sure. What's not to like?

284
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,140
- I'm liable to sleep with him myself.
- He likes me, whether you see it or not.

285
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,270
- Of course.
- He's made me an offer.

286
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,150
You think he doesn't honour me,
but he wants me to live here.

287
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,900
I'd be his personal companion.
I could belong here.

288
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,990
Call me pretentious,
but there is some appeal in that.

289
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,620
You're right.
Got no call to stop you.

290
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,870
You've got the right to a decent life.

291
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,790
- I see Kaylee's here.
- Cried Cinderella tears.

292
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,670
I told her she could have that layer cake
she's wearing.

293
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,010
- I think she looks adorable.
- Yeah, but I never said it.

294
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm not saying the 80-04
is hard to repair...

295
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:34,060
it just ain't worth it.
It's a fine machine. Just keep it tuned.

296
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,560
- The extenders ain't braced.
- I've been telling them to buy the 80-10.

297
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,440
Tenders snap off,
don't matter how the engine's cycling.

298
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,190
- I wonder if I could request the honour...
- Wait a minute, let her talk.

299
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,950
By the way,
the 80-10's the same machine.

300
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,910
They just changed the plating,
hoped no one noticed.

301
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,760
It's possible you're right,
this ain't my kind of party.

302
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,140
Whoa, now.
Watch yourself. No need for hands on.

303
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,520
Excuse me, she's not here with you,
captain. She's mine.

304
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,150
Yours? She don't belong to nobody.

305
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,320
Money changed hands,
which makes her mine tonight.

306
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,650
No matter how you dress her up,
she's still...

307
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,740
- So this is my kind of party.
- Oh, Mal.

308
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,290
What? The man was out of line.

309
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,580
- I accept.
- That's great. What?

310
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,340
- There has been a challenge.
- I hope you're prepared, captain.

311
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,760
You all talking about a fight?
Fine. Let's get out of here.

312
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,340
- It's not a fistfight, Mal.
- The duel will be tomorrow morning...

313
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,390
at Kaytree Pond.
Why wait? Where's that guard?

314
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,390
- He collected a whole mess of pistols.
- If you require it...

315
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,430
any gentleman here
can give you use of a sword.

316
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,900
Use of a what?

317
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,320
- What's going on?
- I'm not rightly sure. What's going on?

318
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,530
Well, first, you'll be put up in lodgings
for the night so you don't disappear.

319
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,620
I wouldn't blame you, incidentally.

320
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,580
Wing may be a spoiled dandy,
but he's an expert swordsman.

321
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,290
He's killed a dozen men.
You're the only one gave him a reason.

322
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,000
- Oh, this is a joke.
- He'll need a second.

323
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,960
- What's that?
- I'll take on the job.

324
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,130
He fights if you refuse.

325
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,590
Inara, come with me, please.

326
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,720
Now, you taking on this job...

327
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,430
being my second,
does this mean we're in business?

328
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,230
It means you're in mortal danger.

329
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,070
But you mussed up Atherton's face and
that has endeared you to me somewhat.

330
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,320
You might even give him a fight
before he guts you.

331
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,150
Inara!

332
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:05,290
Up until the punching,
it was a real nice party.

333
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,040
The captain's gone
and got himself in trouble.

334
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,710
- A duel?
- With swords?

335
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,300
The captain's a good fighter.
He must know how to handle a sword.

336
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,970
I think he knows which end to hold.

337
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,180
So we just need to figure out
how to get him out of there.

338
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,890
We have until the morning, correct?
Do you know what lodging he's in?

339
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,270
Oh. This is embarrassing.
Some of you seem...

340
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,850
to be misapprehending
my purpose in being here.

341
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,730
You're here to make sure that we don't
do what these men are keen on doing.

342
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,650
Penny for the smart lady.

343
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,950
Persephone's my home. I got to
do business with the people here.

344
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I don't want it known I brought
someone in, caused this kind of ruckus.

345
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,960
We'll just settle in till this blows over,
one way or the other.

346
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,340
- Jayne, I wouldn't.
- Why not?

347
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,720
Hi.

348
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,870
- Mal.
- Whoa!

349
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,580
What are you doing here?

350
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,880
Atherton's a heavy sleeper
night before a big day.

351
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,550
Killing you in the morning,
then a haircut later.

352
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,220
Such a comfort,
having friends visit at a time like this.

353
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,640
I knew the accommodations
would be nice. Atherton doesn't skimp.

354
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,350
I don't suppose I like being kept by him
as much as others do.

355
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:31,860
- How come you're still attached to him?
- Because it's my decision, not yours.

356
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,900
Thought he made it pretty clear
he's got no regard for you.

357
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,530
You did manage to push him
into saying something.

358
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
It made a nice justification
for the punch.

359
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,830
He insulted you, I hit him.
Seemed like the thing to do.

360
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:49,000
- Why did this get so complicated?
- Well, it's about to get simpler.

361
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,710
There's a back door.
The desk clerk is on alert.

362
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,800
- He'll let us out.
- I'm not running off.

363
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,220
I didn't do this to prove
some kind of point to you.

364
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,510
I thought I was defending your honour,
and I never back down from a fight.

365
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,390
- Yes, you do. You do all the time.
- Well, yeah.

366
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,190
But I'm not backing down
from this one.

367
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,360
He's an expert swordsman, Mal.
You had trouble with the pillar.

368
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,360
- How will your death help my honour?
- Well, I plan on having it be his death.

369
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,900
That's why I need lessons.

370
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:25,030
I figure you know how,
being such an educated woman and all.

371
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,880
He said not to do anything.

372
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,920
- He'll join us after he wins the duel.
- Yeah, what if he don't win?

373
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,760
It doesn't hurt
to have a contingency plan, Kaylee.

374
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,560
I'm thinking, since we're unarmed,
we should take them by surprise.

375
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,890
- All at once.
- Not necessarily.

376
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,940
We can lure one or two of them away.
Say, infirmary?

377
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,610
Take them out, be on Badger
before he knows what happens.

378
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,490
Yeah, only if his attention
is elsewhere.

379
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,000
What we need is a diversion.

380
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,920
- I say Zoe gets naked.
- Nope.

381
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,340
- I could get naked.
- No!

382
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,870
River, you can't be here.

383
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,750
No, come on.

384
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,540
- River! River, please.
- Who's that there?

385
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,470
Yeah, look at me.
What's your story, love?

386
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,300
She's just a passenger.

387
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,100
Yeah? Why ain't she talking?
She got a secret?

388
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,940
- No, I...
- Sure. I got a secret.

389
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,400
More than one.

390
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,070
Don't seem likely I'd tell
them to you, now, do it?

391
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,700
Anyone off Dayton Colony knows better
than to talk to strangers.

392
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,920
You're talking loud enough
for the both of us, though, ain't you?

393
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,040
I've known a dozen like you.

394
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,670
Skipped off home early.
Minor graft jobs here and there.

395
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,470
Spent some time in the lock-down,
but less than you claim.

396
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:53,560
Now you're what?
Petty thief with delusions of standing?

397
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,440
Sad little king of a sad little hill.

398
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,690
Nice to see someone
from the old homestead.

399
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,780
Not really.

400
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,820
Call me if anyone interesting
shows up.

401
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,040
I like her.

402
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,500
That there, exactly the kind of diversion
we could've used.

403
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,550
Attack.

404
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,550
How did I avoid that?

405
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,350
- By being fast like a freak.
- No.

406
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,770
Because you always attack
the same way.

407
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,440
Swinging from the shoulder
like you're chopping wood.

408
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,810
Thrust with the point sometimes
or swing from the elbow.

409
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,690
- From the shoulder feels stronger.
- It's also slower, Mal.

410
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,820
You don't need strength as much
as speed. We're fragile creatures.

411
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,450
It takes less than a pound of pressure
to cut skin.

412
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,950
You know that?
They teach you that in whore academy?

413
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,330
You have a strange sense
of nobility, captain.

414
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,090
Lay a man out for implying I'm a whore,
but you keep calling me one to my face.

415
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,220
I might not respect your job,
but he didn't respect you.

416
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,180
That's the difference.

417
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,010
Inara, he doesn't even see you.

418
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,560
Well, I guess death will solve the issue
to everyone's satisfaction.

419
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,140
This duel is the result of the rules
of your society, not mine.

420
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,570
You are always breaking the rules,
no matter what society you're in.

421
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,530
You don't get along with criminals
either, so you constantly get in trouble.

422
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,620
You think following rules will buy you a
nice life, even if they make you a slave.

423
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,790
Don't take his offer.

424
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,580
- What?
- Don't do it.

425
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,170
In case it happens, it means
he's the fellow who killed me...

426
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,210
and I don't like fellows who kill me,
not in general.

427
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:55,180
I said before that I didn't have call
to stop you, and that's true.

428
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,560
Anyways, don't.

429
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,770
I need to get back.

430
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,030
He'll be up early.

431
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,030
Right. He's got that big day.

432
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,470
Best be careful, Ath.
I hear these things are sharp.

433
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,850
- He thinks he's doing well, doesn't he?
- He's being toyed with.

434
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,870
- What's he doing?
- Don't fall for that!

435
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,760
Well, this isn't
going to take long, is it?

436
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,660
We're coming up on the end, miss.
You might not want to watch.

437
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,340
Atherton! Wait.

438
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,880
I'll stay here, exclusive to you.
Just let him live.

439
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,940
He's down.

440
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,780
You have to finish it, lad.

441
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,660
You have to finish it.

442
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,620
For a man to lay beaten
and yet breathing...

443
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,210
it makes him a coward!
It's humiliation.

444
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,210
Sure. It would be humiliating.

445
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,970
Having to lie there while the better man
refuses to spill your blood.

446
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,760
Mercy is the mark of a great man.

447
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,970
Guess I'm just a good man.

448
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,560
Well, I'm all right.

449
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:42,030
Inara. Inara!

450
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,530
You've lost her, lad.
Be gracious.

451
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:50,790
You set this up, whore.
After I bought and paid for you.

452
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,790
I should have uglied you up
so no one else would want you.

453
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,630
See how I'm not punching him?
I think I've grown.

454
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,550
Well, get ready to starve.
I'll see to it you never work again.

455
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,100
Actually, that's not how it works.

456
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,100
You've earned yourself a black mark
in the client registry.

457
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,900
No companion is going to contract
with you ever again.

458
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,940
You'll have to rely on your
winning personality to get women.

459
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,190
God help you.

460
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,500
- You didn't have to wound that man.
- Yeah, I know. It was just funny.

461
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,790
You willing to fight that hard
to protect my property...

462
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,590
I'll have it in your hold
before midnight.

463
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,510
Mighty fine shindig.

464
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,650
Doc's filling the Shepherd in
on the plan.

465
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,740
We're ready to move on your signal.
Doc is the diversion.

466
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,290
Did you ever see such a lazy crew?

467
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,790
- Captain!
- You're hurt.

468
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,670
- You get us a deal?
- I got a deal.

469
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,340
- Now get off my ship.
- Ta very much for a lovely night, then.

470
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,810
- Ow.
- Are you badly hurt?

471
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,400
Oh...

472
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,520
We was just about to spring
into action, captain.

473
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,740
- Complicated escape and rescue op.
- I was gonna watch.

474
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,900
It was very exciting.

475
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:43,170
Thank you for the wine.
It's very fresh.

476
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,300
To Kaylee and her inter-engine
fermentation system.

477
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,760
- Are you in pain?
- Absolutely.

478
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,720
- I got stabbed, you know, right here.
- I saw.

479
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,690
I don't care much for fancy parties.
Too rough.

480
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,400
- It wasn't entirely a disaster.
- I got stabbed right here.

481
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,610
You also lined up
exciting new crime.

482
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,530
It's good to have cargo.

483
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,620
Makes us a target for every other
scavenger out there, of course...

484
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,120
but sometimes, that's fun too.

485
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,210
I am grateful, you know, for the
ill-conceived and high-handed attempt...

486
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,760
to defend my honour,
although I didn't want you to.

487
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,260
Gracious as that is, as I look back...

488
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,470
I should have stayed
out of your world.

489
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,020
My world? If it is that.

490
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,150
I wasn't gonna stay, you know.

491
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,940
Yeah? Why is that?

492
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,450
Someone needs to keep Kaylee
out of trouble.

493
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,320
And all my things are here.

494
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,870
Besides, why would I
want to leave Serenity?

495
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,750
Can't think of a reason.
