06 Firefly Jaynestown - Episode 06 2002 English

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,540
- Come on, admit it, it's true.
- No, I won't. Because it's not.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,710
- I use swear words like anybody else.
- Oh, really?

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,420
I never heard you. When is it that you do
all this cussing? After I go to bed or...?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,430
I swear when it's appropriate.

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,930
Simon, the whole point of swearing
is that it ain't appropriate.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,020
Hey there, Inara.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,190
Heading off for
some glamorous romance?

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,600
Let's hope so.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,520
See you two tomorrow.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,900
Don't let Mal get you into too much
trouble while I'm gone.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,490
Bye, now. Have good sex.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,030
What?

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,550
Now this would be a perfect time
for a swear word.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,420
- What happened in here?
- Needed to find some tape.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,970
- So you had to tear my infirmary apart?
- Apparently.

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,520
My God, you're like a trained ape,
without the training.

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,480
Jayne, I told you we're setting down
on the Canton Factory settlement...

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,270
on Higgins' Moon.
Yep, that you did.

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,740
- Canton don't allow guns in their town.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,950
That's why I ain't strapping one
to my hip.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,570
No, that's why you ain't
strapping one anywhere.

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,200
Mal, I was in Canton
a few years back.

24
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,910
I might have made me
a few enemies thereabouts.

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,670
Enemies? You? No, how can it be?

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,340
I don't like the idea
of going in there empty-handed.

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,170
Why are you still arguing
what's been decided?

28
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,610
Okay, Inara, we're atmospheric.
You are good to go.

29
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,820
Thanks, Wash.
Disengaging in three, two, one.

30
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,350
Canton really stinks.

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,980
That's what makes it a great drop point.
No one comes through.

32
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,610
I vote we do this job
really, really fast.

33
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,070
Kessler's our man. He's holding
the goods we're to deliver.

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,490
We go in, make contact.
Easy-peasy.

35
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,410
Zoe, you're holding down the fort.

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,530
Let Bernoulli know we'll have
his merchandise end of the week.

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,540
- Don't I usually stay with the ship?
- I outrank you. Have fun.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,420
So this is the place
where they make mud.

39
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,880
Yep. Clay, really.

40
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,680
You'd be surprised how many
things it ends up in.

41
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,350
Serenity's got more than a few
ceramic parts in her.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,390
- Really?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,810
Captain, don't you think Simon
should come with us?

44
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,900
- What? Oh, Kaylee, I don't think...
- Go on, boy. See the sights.

45
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,440
I can watch over your sister. I believe
we've been developing a rapport.

46
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,200
- I don't know. River...
- Go on. I'm a shepherd, after all.

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,950
I should be able to keep my eye
on a flock of one.

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,830
We're not going that far, doctor...

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,960
and you might maybe make
yourself useful.

50
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,380
Come again?

51
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,090
The management here don't take kindly
to sightseers, which is why we're...

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,470
posing as buyers.

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,840
There ain't a one of us looks the part
more than the good doctor.

54
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,600
I mean, the pretty fits, soft hands,
definitely a moneyed individual.

55
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,190
- All rich and lily-white, pasty all over.
- All right.

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,070
- Fine, I'll go, just stop describing me.
- You're the boss, boss.

57
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,740
He's the boss now?
Day keeps getting better and better.

58
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,540
Area's employees only.

59
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,630
Best be getting back to landing
unless you have business here.

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Yes.

61
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,930
Yes, I'm looking to buy some mud.

62
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,180
Well, then, come to the right place.

63
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,690
Captain...

64
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,520
Of course, we can handle
any volume here.

65
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,280
We have over 2000 workers,
mostly indentured.

66
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,110
We pay them next to nothing.

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,330
That way we can pass the savings
directly on to you, the customer.

68
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,580
Savings?

69
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,080
Uh... Excellent, that's...

70
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,080
Because, as I said before,
I'm gonna be needing quite a bit of it.

71
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,880
- I'm a buyer.
- The best of its kind.

72
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,130
We mix it, we brick it raw
right here on the premises.

73
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,090
You add the right catalyst,
you kiln it proper...

74
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,140
this stuffs 10 times stronger
than steel at half the weight.

75
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,390
Yes. I've heard great...

76
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,270
What happened to Simon?
Who is this diabolical master of disguise?

77
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,980
He's learning.

78
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,820
- It's...
- Excuse me, boss.

79
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm sure the foreman
has things need attending.

80
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,410
Let's wander a bit,
look at the operation...

81
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,080
then you can figure on
whether we get an account.

82
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,160
Yes?

83
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,130
Yes. Yes, we'll wander a bit.

84
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,340
Fair enough. Come and see me
when you're through.

85
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,050
All right. Head to worker town...

86
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,800
find our man Kessler,
get this job done.

87
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,770
The boy's gonna get us killed.
Let's just do this deal and get.

88
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,560
His disguise ain't half as funny as yours.

89
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,110
- Who're you supposed to be, anyway?
- You haven't been here in years.

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,570
You really think you need that getup?
No one's gonna remember you.

91
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,650
I think it's possible they might.

92
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,710
Son of a bitch.

93
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,320
- Jayne?
- Yeah?

94
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,990
You wanna tell me how come
there's a statue of you here...

95
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,320
looking at me
like I owe him something?

96
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,320
Wishing I could, captain.

97
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,830
- No, seriously. You want to tell me...?
- Look, Mal, I got no rutting idea.

98
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,710
I was here a few years back,
like I said...

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,670
pulled a second-story, stole a lot of
scratch from the magistrate on the hill...

100
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,010
but things went way south.

101
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,170
I had to high tail it.

102
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,300
They don't put you on a pedestal
in town square for that.

103
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,270
Yeah, except I'm looking at some fairly
compelling evidence says they do.

104
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,600
This must be what going mad feels like.

105
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,980
I think they captured him,
though, you know.

106
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,690
Captured his essence.

107
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,190
- He looks sort of angry, don't he?
- That's kind of what I meant.

108
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,620
Shift 4 on duty.
Shift 4 on duty.

109
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,750
Hey, I got an idea.

110
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,420
Instead of us hanging around
playing art critic...

111
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,000
till I get pinched,
how's about we move away...

112
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,380
from this eerie-ass piece of work
and get on with our day.

113
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,880
I don't know.

114
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,760
This here's a spectacle might warrant
a moment's consideration.

115
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,060
Everywhere I go
his eyes keep following me.

116
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,770
Come on, gorram, we got a job.
Let's go do it, get the hell out of here.

117
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,490
I crossed the magistrate
of this company town. Understand?

118
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,030
He ain't exactly a forgiving sort of guy.

119
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,660
- Magistrate Higgins, I may presume.
- You may.

120
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,330
But I only make the people I own
use my title.

121
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,130
Mr. Higgins will do fine.

122
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,300
And you can call me Inara, Mr. Higgins.

123
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,090
It's a rare pleasure,
your visit to my little moon.

124
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,850
- The journey wasn't too taxing?
- Not at all. I'm refreshed and ready.

125
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,230
- Shall we begin at, say, 7:30?
- Perfect.

126
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,150
I have a feeling it will take all your art
to deal with this particular problem.

127
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,950
Every problem, Mr. Higgins,
is an opportunity in disguise.

128
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,580
- What are we up to, sweetheart?
- Fixing your Bible.

129
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,670
I...

130
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,340
What?

131
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,800
Bible's broken.
Contradictions, false logistics.

132
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,220
- Doesn't make sense.
- No, no, you can't take...

133
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,760
We'll integrate nonprogressional
evolution theory...

134
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,930
with God's creation of Eden.

135
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,810
Eleven inherent metaphoric
parallels already there.

136
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,230
Eleven, important number.
Prime number.

137
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,440
One goes into the house of eleven
eleven times but always comes out one.

138
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,700
- Noah's Ark is a problem.
- Really?

139
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,370
We'll have to call it
early quantum-state phenomenon.

140
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,710
Only way to fit 5000 species
of mammal on the same boat.

141
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,040
Give me that.

142
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,920
River, you don't fix the Bible.

143
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,720
It's broken.

144
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,180
It doesn't make sense.

145
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,390
It's not about making sense.

146
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,890
It's about believing in something.

147
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,690
And letting that belief
be real enough to change your life.

148
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,820
It's about faith.

149
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,990
You don't fix faith, River.

150
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,740
It fixes you.

151
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,710
You hang on to those then.

152
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,050
Can't be a statue of me.
No reason for it.

153
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,180
Flies in the face
of every kind of sense.

154
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,980
Won't argue with that.

155
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,030
They call it mudder's milk.

156
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,240
All the proteins, vitamins and carbs
of your grandma's best turkey dinner...

157
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,450
plus 15% alcohol.

158
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,370
- It's horrific.
- It worked for the Egyptians.

159
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,790
- What's that?
- The ancient Egyptians.

160
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,420
Back on Earth. Not so different
from the ancestral form of beer...

161
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,300
they fed the slaves to build
their pyramids. It's liquid bread.

162
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,840
It kept them from starving and knocked
them out so they wouldn't...

163
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,640
be inclined to insurrection.
Wow, Simon, that was so...

164
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,680
historical.

165
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,400
Now what's a gussied-up fella like you
doing in a place like this?

166
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,070
Shake your head, boy,
your eyes are stuck.

167
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,410
Get!

168
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,250
- You wouldn't be looking for Kessler?
- Just having a brew.

169
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,380
I knew a Kessler.

170
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,210
Knew?

171
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,390
He was a good middleman.
Low profile. Didn't filch.

172
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,970
Last week the factory foreman
and his prod crew...

173
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,930
heard he was moving contraband.

174
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,180
- Gave him a peck of trouble for it.
- What kind of peck was that?

175
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,690
The kind where they hacked off
his hands and feet with a machete...

176
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,900
rolled him into the bog.
They peck pretty hard around here.

177
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,900
Listen, my client off-world
is waiting for his delivery.

178
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,070
- If the goods are gone...
- Not to worry.

179
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,830
Your man's merchandise is here,
safe in Kessler's hiding place.

180
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,290
We gotta figure out
how to get it across town...

181
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,250
without being seen
by the foreman and his prods.

182
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,290
I advise we all just
lay low for a moment.

183
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,720
Jayne The man they call Jayne.

184
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,720
He robbed from the rich
And he gave to the poor.

185
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,770
Stood up to the man
And he gave him what for.

186
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,650
Our love for him now
Ain't hard to explain.

187
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:50,360
The hero of Canton
The man they call Jayne.

188
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,410
Our Jayne saw
The mudders' backs breaking.

189
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,670
He saw the mudders' lament.

190
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,130
And he saw the magistrate taking.

191
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,170
Every dollar and leaving 5 cents.

192
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,140
So he said
You can't do that to my people.

193
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,810
Uh, Jayne?

194
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Yeah, Mal.

195
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,730
You got any light you'd like to shed
on this development?

196
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,400
No, Mal.

197
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,990
No, this must be what
going mad feels like.

198
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,870
Stood up to the man
And he gave him what for.

199
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Our love for him now
Ain't hard to explain.

200
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,460
The hero of Canton
The man they call Jayne.

201
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,840
Now here is what separates heroes.

202
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,680
From common folk like you and I.

203
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,560
The man they called Jayne
He turned around his plane.

204
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,850
And let that money hit sky.

205
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,520
Oh, I'll be gorram.
That's where that cash went.

206
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,280
I stole that money from Higgins
like the song says.

207
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,950
Lifted me one of his hovercraft.
But I got tagged by anti-aircraft...

208
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,160
started losing altitude, had to dump
them strongboxes to stay airborne.

209
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,250
Sixty thousand, untraceable...

210
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,420
and I drop it right square in the middle
of mud-farmer central.

211
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,970
We gotta go to the crappy town
where I'm a hero.

212
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,600
Yeah!

213
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,450
- Hello?
- In here, River.

214
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,710
I tore these out of your symbol,
and they turned into paper...

215
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,090
but I want to put them back, so...

216
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,210
Sorry, what's that?

217
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,930
River? River, come back.

218
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,640
Preacher, what the hell did you sick...?
Oh.

219
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,600
Now they off the subject of me,
shouldn't we be getting out of here?

220
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,520
- I'd say that's a reasonable request.
- Rutting mudders.

221
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,620
Yay!

222
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,630
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!

223
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,220
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!

224
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,100
Give me some milk.

225
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,980
Don't you understand?
He's come back.

226
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,740
It's Jayne.

227
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,110
- What the...?
- A hero can't and won't be drinking...

228
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,580
that sun-myun how. He drinks
the best whiskey in the house!

229
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,000
Is this how people
lay low where you're from?

230
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,840
- Not generally, no.
- Listen, friend, I came here...

231
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,050
to make sure the deal
went down solid.

232
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,470
Not to get chopped up by the Canton
prod crew and fed to the bog.

233
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,060
I understand your concerns, friend.

234
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,560
This here's all part of our new plan.

235
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,440
- Captain, how exactly is this part of...?
- Still working the details.

236
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,510
Inara, allow me to introduce
my son, Fess Higgins.

237
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,390
Hello, Fess. Mr. Higgins,
this shuttle is a place of union.

238
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,220
- I'm sure you can appreciate...
- What is this?

239
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,060
I brought you here to bed my son,
not throw him a tea party.

240
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,190
Sir, a companion greeting ceremony
is a ritual with centuries of tradition...

241
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,570
My son is 26 years old,
and he ain't yet a man.

242
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,740
Twenty-six. And since he can't find
a willing woman himself...

243
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,120
Mr. Higgins, you're not allowed here.

244
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,370
- What?
- As I said, this room...

245
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,750
is a consecrated place of union.

246
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,710
- Only your son belongs here.
- Well, I'm...

247
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,040
Why don't you go
and let us begin our work.

248
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,840
- Now listen here, young lady...
- Good night, Mr. Higgins.

249
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,600
Well, that's a bit more peaceful.

250
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,230
Will you sit?

251
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,980
- To Jayne!
- To Jayne!

252
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,690
To me!

253
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,200
- To the mudders!
- Yeah!

254
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,450
Boss Higgins...

255
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,370
You know, I've saved lives.

256
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,830
Dozens. Maybe hundreds.

257
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,300
I re-attached a girl's leg.
Her whole leg.

258
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,470
She named her hamster after me.

259
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,180
I got a hamster.

260
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,470
He drops a box of money,
he gets a town.

261
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,100
- Hamsters is nice.
- To Jayne.

262
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,440
The box-dropping,
man-ape-gone-wrong thing.

263
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,950
- You know, you are pretty funny.
- And you're pretty...

264
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,870
pretty.

265
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,000
- What did you just say?
- I just said that you're pretty.

266
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,460
Even when you're covered
in engine grease, you're...

267
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,680
No, especially. Especially when
you're covered in engine grease.

268
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,970
Time to get out of this nut house.
I got planning to work out.

269
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,140
Now, captain?
Things are going so well.

270
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,440
I suppose. Jayne's certainly
feeling better about life, but...

271
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,190
I said, things are going well.

272
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,650
Oh, well.

273
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,910
Well, I tell you what. Jayne is
stuck here with his adoring masses.

274
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,000
Why don't you and Simon hang around
and keep an eye on him for me.

275
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,210
The snow on the roof is
too heavy. The ceiling will cave in.

276
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,970
His brains are in terrible danger.

277
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,260
River?

278
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,970
- Please, why don't you come on out?
- No, I can't.

279
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,270
- Too much hair.
- Ls that it?

280
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,360
Hell, yes, preacher. If I didn't have stuff
to get done, I'd be in there with her.

281
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,700
It's the rules of my order.

282
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,910
Like the book, it symbolises...

283
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,580
River, honey, he's putting
the hair away now.

284
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,500
It doesn't matter.
It'll still be there. Waiting.

285
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,760
Honey, we're home.

286
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,550
Where you guys been?
Bernoulli's chomping at the bit...

287
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,340
says he wants his merchandise.

288
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,140
We still got a few wrinkles
to work out on the deal.

289
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,310
Did you know that Jayne
is a bona fide folk hero?

290
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,100
- Got a song and everything.
- You've been drinking, husband.

291
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,110
That he has.
Don't make it any less the case.

292
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,110
- You're telling me Jayne...
- It's true.

293
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,150
True enough. We can use it, anyways.

294
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,110
We talked a few pillars of the mudder
community into having a little...

295
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,410
Jayne Day celebration
in town square tomorrow.

296
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,920
It should buy us enough of a distraction
to get the stolen goods...

297
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,960
out from under the foreman.

298
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,960
You're really gonna have to
start again. Jayne's a what?

299
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,680
This whole thing, it is embarrassing.

300
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,890
My father's right again, I guess.
And to have to bring you here...

301
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,810
Your father isn't right, Fess.
It's not embarrassing to be a virgin.

302
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,980
It's simply one state of being.

303
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,860
As far as bringing me here...

304
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,360
Companions choose the people
they're to be with very carefully.

305
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:59,040
For example, if your father had asked me
to come here for him, I wouldn't have.

306
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,870
Really?

307
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,290
Really, Fess.

308
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,670
But you're different from him.

309
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,840
The more you accept that,
the stronger you'll become.

310
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,810
So the magistrate, he let you
folks keep all that cash?

311
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,690
He did. And it pained him,
that's for dead sure.

312
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,070
When he found out, he sent
his prods in to take it back from us...

313
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,110
but the workers resisted.

314
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,530
Fought the law, huh?

315
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,030
If the mudders are together,
there's too many of us to be put down.

316
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,700
So in the end,
he just called it a bonus.

317
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,500
That's one hell of a bonus.

318
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,460
And then, when we put that statue
of you in town square...

319
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:48,550
he rolled in, wanted to tear it down,
but the whole town rioted.

320
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,880
You guys had a riot
on account of me?

321
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,180
My very own riot.

322
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,430
I can't believe you're back.

323
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,890
How could I stay away?

324
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,070
- Magistrate Higgins.
- My son's out there...

325
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,200
I pray to God, losing his cherry.

326
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,700
There's a problem in worker town, sir.

327
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,210
Jayne Cobb's come back.

328
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,190
- Evening, Stitch.
- What do you want with me?

329
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,360
Nothing. Done your time,
you paid your debt.

330
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,990
It's time you were on your way.

331
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,460
Here. I believe these
were your personal effects.

332
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,140
You keep me in that box four years,
and then you give me a loaded gun?

333
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,310
You got the urge to use it, no doubt.

334
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,230
But I'm not the one that
brought you in on that robbery.

335
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,980
I'm not the one that turned on you
when his plan went south.

336
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,450
How high up was that shuttle
when he pushed you out? Thirty feet?

337
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,950
Jayne Cobb cost you
four years of your life...

338
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,700
plus a perfectly good eyeball.

339
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,210
And here's the poetical portion.
He's back in town.

340
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,420
This very day.

341
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,210
Best of luck in your new life.

342
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,120
- Hey, captain. Captain!
- Hey.

343
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,200
Mal. Mal, I...

344
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,580
No, nothing happened.

345
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,550
No, there was some drinking,
but, no, we certainly didn't.

346
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,300
I would never...
Not with Kaylee.

347
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,390
- What do you mean, not with me?
- Yeah. Where's my hero?

348
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,140
Now love for me now
Ain't hard to explain.

349
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:52,770
The hero of Canton
The man they call me.

350
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,530
Eggs. The living legend needs eggs,
or maybe another milk.

351
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
No, living legend
needs to come with us.

352
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,030
He's got a little appearance to make.

353
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,620
- He does?
- That's right.

354
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,370
This job here's gone
way past long enough.

355
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,040
All right, well, you go on now.
I got me important hero-type stuff to do.

356
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,800
- Where you going?
- I'm going with you.

357
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,510
I don't think so.
No, maybe you ought to stay here.

358
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,730
It's about time for a civilised person
to have his breakfast.

359
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,560
That's the sort of thing would be
appropriate, don't you think?

360
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:53,290
- Excuse me, could I see a menu?
- A what?

361
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,290
You're very quiet.

362
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,380
I'm sorry.

363
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,670
I just...

364
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,220
I just thought I'd feel...

365
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,060
different after.

366
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,400
Aren't I supposed to be a man now?

367
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,320
A man is just a boy who's old enough
to ask that question.

368
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,870
Our time together,
it's a ritual, a symbol.

369
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,910
It means something to your father.

370
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,580
I hope it was not entirely
forgettable for you.

371
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,010
- Oh, no, it was...
- But it doesn't make you a man.

372
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,880
You do that yourself.

373
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,930
Fess! Fess Higgins! Get out here!

374
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,940
So that's where the little...

375
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,900
Jayne celebration
we got planned comes in.

376
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,110
Should give us enough time
to get the goods back on Serenity.

377
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,190
I don't know.

378
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,200
You think we should be using
my fame to hoodwink folks?

379
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,580
- You better laugh when you say that.
- No, really, Mal, I mean...

380
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,160
maybe there's something to this.
The mudders...

381
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,590
I think I really made
a difference in their lives.

382
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,710
- Me, Jayne Cobb.
- I know your name, jackass.

383
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,380
- They threw a riot on my account.
- A riot?

384
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,970
- Morning, kids.
- Ls that Jayne? Ls that really him?

385
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,480
- Wash, pinch me. I must be dreaming.
- Hell, I'll pinch you.

386
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,980
Just get on over to town square, Jayne.
Your fans are waiting.

387
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,630
You think we can get this stuff
cross-town without being noticed?

388
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,420
Gotta find it first.

389
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,720
Here we go.

390
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,730
Let's get it dug up.

391
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,230
- A criminal hearing?
- Yeah, my father's ordered me to attend.

392
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,110
You see, there's this man...

393
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,780
It happened when I was
growing up here.

394
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,950
He stole a ton of money from my dad
and gave it to the poor...

395
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,620
to my father's workers.

396
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,250
He's become kind of a folk hero
in Canton.

397
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,380
Go on.

398
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,090
Well, he's back.
Apparently, he landed here yesterday.

399
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,510
Yesterday?

400
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,630
Oh, no.

401
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,010
I know this man.

402
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,640
He just has this idiotic sense
of nobility, you know.

403
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,940
He can never just let things go.

404
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,360
He thinks he's this hard-hearted criminal,
and he can be unrelenting...

405
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,440
but there's a side to him
that's just so...

406
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,950
You mean you actually know Jayne?

407
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,620
Jayne? Jayne Cobb?
You're talking about Jayne Cobb?

408
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,660
Yes, Jayne Cobb,
the hero of Canton.

409
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,250
The only person I ever saw
who stood up to my father.

410
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,750
I, wha...

411
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,670
My dad had him traced to his ship.
He had port control put a lock on it.

412
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,550
Jayne'll get back
and find out that he's grounded.

413
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,550
I sort of hate the idea
of his getting caught.

414
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,680
Yes, that would be bad.

415
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:46,150
Could I just get the check, please?

416
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,190
Heard tell you run with Jayne Cobb.

417
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,530
Excuse me?

418
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,830
You're gonna take me to that dirty,
low-down shingle of a man.

419
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,920
Listen, sir, I don't know who...

420
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,670
Sir? Look at me, you panty-waist idiot!

421
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:21,220
I just spent the last four years steaming
in a hotbox and you're sir-ing me?

422
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,980
Folks say you're part
of Jayne's team, so...

423
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,120
where is that no-good reptile
hiding himself?

424
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:42,160
Tell me, boy, or I'll cut off
every last bit of them good looks.

425
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,870
Ah!

426
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,500
Oh, not done yet, young'un.

427
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,960
That's gonna cost you an eye.

428
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,010
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!

429
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,720
Come on. Come on!

430
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,070
They love their boy.
Just drive by nice and slow.

431
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,200
- Come on, sir, let's just get...
- The magistrate says no.

432
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,040
We hold position. Understand me?

433
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,000
Zoe, pack down the cargo.
Wash, you heat up Serenity.

434
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,550
- We're blowing this mess in half an hour.
- Already there.

435
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,300
Let's go get our wayward babes.

436
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,430
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!

437
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,600
Speech! Speech! Speech!

438
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,850
Um...

439
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,570
I'm no good with words. Don't...

440
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,610
Don't use them much myself.

441
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,410
But I want to thank you all for being
here and thinking so much of me.

442
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,460
Far as I see it...

443
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,330
you people been given
the shortest end of the stick...

444
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,920
ever been offered a human soul
in this crap-heel'verse.

445
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,220
But you took that end...

446
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,800
and you...

447
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,100
- Well, you took it.
- Yeah.

448
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,680
- Yeah, we did.
- That's... Well, I guess that's something.

449
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,650
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,900
Wow. That didn't sound half bad.

451
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,780
I'm shocked my own self.

452
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,120
Stitch Hessian.

453
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,840
Well, hey there, Jayne.

454
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,720
Thought I'd make you watch
while I butchered me one of your boys.

455
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,970
He ain't one of mine.

456
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,520
Where you been hiding?

457
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,060
You gone got yourself
looking mighty hideous.

458
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,270
Yeah.

459
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,030
Now Jayne gets his.

460
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,030
Oh, honey.

461
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,700
Kaylee?

462
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:28,160
So, what's this about a hero of Canton?
Was I hearing that right?

463
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,460
Four years of lock down
plays tricks on the ear.

464
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,920
I ain't a hero, Stitch.

465
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,380
Just a working stiff like you.

466
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,010
Yep, he's right. Jayne is.

467
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,140
Heck, we used to work together,
he and I.

468
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,480
Now why don't you just
let old Stitch speak his peace.

469
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,690
Go on, then.

470
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,870
A whole lot of money in a magistrate's
safe, weren't there, Jayne?

471
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,290
Got away clean too, but then our plane
took a hit, and we're going down.

472
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,920
We dumped the fuel reserve,
dumped the life support.

473
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,790
Hell, we even dumped the seats.

474
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,630
Then there's Jayne, the money and me.

475
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,260
There was no way
he was gonna drop that money.

476
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,850
- He did. He dropped it on the mudders.
- By accident, you inbred dung-head.

477
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
- He tossed me out first.
- What?

478
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,980
For six months we run together,
he turned me out before I could scream.

479
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,940
- You'd have done the same.
- No. Never.

480
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,570
You protect the man you're with.
You watch his back.

481
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:50,370
Everybody knows that,
hell, except the hero of Canton.

482
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,160
You gonna talk me to death, buddy?
Is that the plan?

483
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,540
This is the plan.

484
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,000
Get up.

485
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,920
Get up, you stupid piece of...

486
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,260
What'd you do that for?
Didn't you hear a word he said?

487
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,470
All of you...

488
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,180
you think that someone's
just gonna drop money on you?

489
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,690
Money they could use?

490
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,150
Well, there ain't people like that.

491
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,570
There's just people like me.

492
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,550
Wash, we're on.
Get us the hell off of the mud ball.

493
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,720
Yeah, I'm working on it.

494
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,780
Hello, Wash. Has there been
a problem with take-off?

495
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,620
Is there a problem?
Is there a problem?!

496
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,960
No.

497
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,250
We're fine.

498
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,760
You did what?

499
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,510
I sent an override to port control,
lifted the land-lock on Serenity.

500
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,350
I ought to wipe that smile off your head.
How dare you defy me, you...

501
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,310
You wanted to make a man
out of me, Dad. I guess it worked.

502
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,390
Just keep walking, preacher man.

503
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,770
You gotta be steely. You can't
be letting men stomp on you so much.

504
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,440
It wasn't exactly a plan.

505
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,440
You ain't weak.

506
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,240
You couldn't beat him back?

507
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,780
Or would that not be appropriate?

508
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,240
You're never letting go
of that, are you?

509
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,790
Well, you confound me some, is all.

510
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:09,290
I mean, you like me well enough,
and we get along.

511
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,130
And then you go all stiff.

512
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,010
I... I'm not... I didn't...

513
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,680
See, you're doing it right now.

514
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,600
What's so damn important
about being proper?

515
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,520
It don't mean nothing
out here in the black.

516
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,060
It means more out here.

517
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,820
It's all I have.

518
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:40,080
I mean, my way of being polite,
or however it's...

519
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:45,330
Well, it's the only way I have
of showing you that I like you.

520
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,500
I'm showing respect.

521
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,300
- So when we made love last night...
- When we what?!

522
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,590
You really are such an easy mark.

523
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,230
Don't make no sense.

524
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,780
What...?

525
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,240
Why the hell did that mudder
have to go and do that for?

526
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,280
Jumping in front of that shotgun blast.

527
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,580
Hell, there weren't a one of them
understood what happened out there.

528
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,920
They're probably sticking
that statue right back up.

529
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,250
Most like.

530
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,880
I don't know why that eats at me so.

531
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,550
It's my estimation...

532
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,810
that every man ever got
a statue made of him...

533
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,270
was one kind
of son of a bitch or another.

534
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,060
It ain't about you, Jayne.

535
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,730
It's about what they need.

536
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,370
Don't make no sense.
