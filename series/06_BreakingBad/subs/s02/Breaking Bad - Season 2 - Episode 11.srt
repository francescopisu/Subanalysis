1
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,095
What's up?

2
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,215
What you need?

3
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:12,883
Yo, you buyin', or are you
just stopping to envy?

4
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,321
Punk bitches.

5
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:03,406
<i>Please leave your message

<i>Record your message after the tone.

7
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:12,115
Bounce, little man.
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,

8
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,910
getting eyeballed hard.

9
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:16,359
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

10
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,234
Get your ass up here now.

11
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,428
- What's that thing in your ear?
- What did I say? Get out of here!

12
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:28,543
What are you waiting for? Go!

13
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:17,404
Synch: Tyno, Michvanilly

14
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:30,476
www.forom.com
www.sub-way.fr

15
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,444
We've made such headway
with your treatments

16
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,719
that now it's time we talked
about sealing the deal.

17
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,000
Absolutely.

18
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,551
As you know,

19
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:47,910
my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

20
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:51,976
That may no longer be the case.

21
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:56,224
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

22
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,686
Maybe a pretty good option.

23
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,767
Dr. Bravenec is one of the few surgeons
in the country

24
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:04,200
performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

25
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,743
He's got a good track record.

26
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,230
Pretty good.

27
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:10,737
It sounds...

28
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:13,746
aggressive.

29
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:16,072
Yes. Very much so.

30
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:19,313
Understand that if you
don't have this surgery,

31
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:21,611
you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

32
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,391
And it will.

33
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:28,101
Now, through the treatment you've had
already, we've bought you some time...

34
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,950
Maybe a lot, probably a little,

35
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,300
but that's all.

36
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:35,354
In my opinion,

37
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:38,226
if you're willing to take some risk,

38
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:40,630
then this offers the best chance.

39
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:49,124
How much would it cost?

40
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,205
I'm not on your insurance.

41
00:04:51,473 --> 00:04:54,109
I'd say between 170,000

42
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:56,487
and 200,000, all in.

43
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,471
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can,

44
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:02,717
but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

45
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:09,019
This is obviously a big decision.

46
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:13,204
And you folks are gonna
want to take some time to discuss it.

47
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,066
I'll do it.

48
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:27,463
Don't you think we should at least
talk this through first?

49
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:31,326
I just think it's the way to go.

50
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:36,986
I have to say I think

51
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,754
it's the right choice.

52
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,372
I recommend that we let the pneumonitis
heal for another couple of weeks,

53
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,996
and then we'll have at it.

54
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,598
That's tricky.

55
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:56,366
- When's the due date?
- It's the 21st.

56
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,667
So two weeks and change?

57
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,928
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

58
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:04,147
That way, Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

59
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,066
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

60
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:29,403
14 messag...

61
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:31,623
God.

62
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,213
It's me.

63
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:40,388
<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

64
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:41,956
Working.

65
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,585
What is it?

66
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,239
Combo's dead.

67
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:50,124
Shot.

68
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:53,596
Which one is he?

69
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:56,715
You did not just say that to me.

70
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,068
- Jesse, listen...
- That figures.

71
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:13,383
What's the word on the street?

72
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,150
No one's dropping no names.

73
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:19,622
Combo rang me before it went down.
Said dudes were mad-dogging him,

74
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:23,100
trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

75
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,312
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean,

76
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,666
what'd you expect?

77
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:33,534
I don't know.

78
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,162
You don't know?

79
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:38,204
Is that all you got?

80
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:42,052
I'll do right by Combo's people.

81
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:47,163
Make sure you bust up
your cell and toss it.

82
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,092
We'll figure it out.

83
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,055
I appreciate what
you're saying and all,

84
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:57,618
but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

85
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:01,062
I'm on probation, man.

86
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:03,361
Fast track to Los Lunas.

87
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,345
We're on the verge

88
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:10,376
of making some serious coin.

89
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,844
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

90
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:20,650
This game we playing, we don't got
the street cred to survive it.

91
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:25,126
Back when everyone thought you killed
Spooge, maybe we were doing okay,

92
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,601
but that whole...

93
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,528
thing to the head thing, the ATM?

94
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:32,195
His junkie bitch copped to it.

95
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,310
The whole town knows it wasn't you.

96
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:41,765
Everyone knows?

97
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:47,124
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know, man.

98
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,648
'Cause we like you and all.

99
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:51,873
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

100
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,858
We'll get by.

101
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:56,589
We'll make it.

102
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:58,225
Sorry, Jesse.

103
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:00,577
I'm out.

104
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:14,538
We have had a bit of a setback.

105
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:19,308
Sorry, that's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

106
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:22,615
- How about your fault? How about that?
- Don't lay that on me.

107
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,846
- You are in charge of distribution.
- You said expand the territory.

108
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:28,317
- That doesn't mean you become careless.
- Guys, guys!

109
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,421
Who do I look like, Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counselor.

110
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:34,223
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

111
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:36,490
Now, setback. Go.

112
00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:39,968
One of our dealers was murdered.

113
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:45,419
It was some kind of turf dispute,

114
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,912
and apparently we lost.

115
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:50,697
And then everyone quit on us.

116
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:53,273
We have absolutely no distribution.

117
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:57,179
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

118
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:59,180
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

119
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:03,953
There's your silver lighting.

120
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:06,923
How about you?
How's the health situation?

121
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,702
It's better.
Do you mind?

122
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:11,722
Better?

123
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:21,027
It's looking a little more positive.

124
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,704
I may have more time than I thought.

125
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,160
Outstanding.

126
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,845
Now, as to your dead guy,

127
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:30,072
occupational hazard.

128
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:32,102
Drug dealer getting shot,

129
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:36,077
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

130
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:39,255
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

131
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,659
38 and change.

132
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,726
38 ounces? Grams?

133
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:47,130
Pounds.

134
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:52,602
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

135
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:54,040
Guys!

136
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:56,948
Why the long faces here?

137
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,342
You're sitting on a gold mine.

138
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,611
A gold mine we can't sell.

139
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,079
We need a proper infrastructure.

140
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,740
We need foot soldiers and dealers

141
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:08,749
on a street level
that are rock solid.

142
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,988
We need muscle,
and we need enforcers.

143
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:14,157
Payback.
That's what we need.

144
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:20,302
God.

145
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:25,509
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

146
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:33,042
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

147
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,258
We need your help.

148
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,160
Let's start with some
tough love, all right?

149
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,095
Ready for this?
Here goes.

150
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,654
You two suck at peddling meth.

151
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,734
Period.

152
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:48,976
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

153
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:51,351
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

154
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:55,758
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

155
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,551
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

156
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,243
What?
Some tattooed speed-freak?

157
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,832
What you two need is
an honest-to-God businessman.

158
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,801
Somebody who treats your product

159
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,012
like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

160
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,904
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

161
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:18,272
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

162
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:22,405
You know someone like that?

163
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,653
Let's just say I know a guy

164
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,078
who knows a guy.

165
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:28,438
Who knows another guy.

166
00:12:28,944 --> 00:12:32,244
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

167
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:36,243
Well, what's his name?

168
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,200
I have no idea.

169
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,040
He's very low profile.

170
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:43,815
He's careful like that.

171
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:47,316
From what I do hear about him,

172
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,451
he sounds a little like you.

173
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,120
I need you to leave.

174
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,729
Look, there's...

175
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,202
some stuff about me
you don't know, and...

176
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:30,057
Like you're a drug dealer?

177
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:33,374
I kind of got that.

178
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:37,699
You pay in cash,
and you use an alias, so...

179
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,591
One of my guys,

180
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:50,434
a friend who worked for me...

181
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:53,449
got murdered.

182
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,620
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

183
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,609
I'm gonna smoke some crystal,

184
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:05,436
and I just think you should go,
being that you're

185
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:07,630
in a program and all and...

186
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,802
You could come with me to a meeting.

187
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,830
No meetings.

188
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:22,941
We could just get out of here.

189
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,449
- It won't help.
- Yeah, it will.

190
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:32,953
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

191
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:34,249
I just...

192
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:38,695
All right, I really
just need you to go.

193
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:45,594
Sir?

194
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:47,149
Enjoy your meal.

195
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:20,894
You're late.

196
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,950
We're in the big time now.

197
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,638
So where's the kingpin?

198
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,807
Your guess is as good as mine.

199
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,100
So you get the dude's name?

200
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,216
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names,

201
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,671
what we look like,
but not the other way around?

202
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,877
Why don't you
get yourself some food?

203
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,424
So we won't both sit here with our Happy
Meals, looking like a couple chumps?

204
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:01,218
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

205
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:02,899
Fine, thanks.

206
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:07,537
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

207
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:10,455
I don't get you, man.

208
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:14,312
A week ago you talked
like you were all ready to hang it up.

209
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,994
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

210
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:21,026
What about after?

211
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:24,416
After, you gonna make up
some new magic number?

212
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:27,454
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

213
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,779
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

214
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:32,466
- Things have changed.
- Oh, I know.

215
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,830
We got a guy killed.

216
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:40,888
You know what?

217
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:44,019
This is bullshit.

218
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:46,313
I'm out of here.

219
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:59,272
I think she's waking up from a nap.

220
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:03,706
She is certainly going to want
to get out and stretch those legs soon.

221
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,047
We'll keep an eye on your fluids.
You're on the low side of normal.

222
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:14,026
What? How low?

223
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:18,192
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

224
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:22,295
We'll just have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

225
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,098
Oh, man, you would
not believe the traffic.

226
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,416
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

227
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,346
Sorry.

228
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:33,977
- What did I miss?
- For your refrigerator.

229
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,097
Oh, my God.

230
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:37,663
Look at her.

231
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:38,786
Look.

232
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:42,242
God. It's like she's here already.

233
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:45,498
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

234
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,476
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

235
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,460
It's time to make a decision.

236
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,678
- You know what I'm going to say?
- The C-section?

237
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:56,476
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

238
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:01,428
My last labor was
pretty tough, so...

239
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:05,676
For the baby, I say yes.

240
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,462
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

241
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:10,419
It's best
we take her a little early.

242
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:12,744
So why don't we schedule it for...

243
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,651
a week from Friday?

244
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,356
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

245
00:19:24,014 --> 00:19:25,464
We have a birthday.

246
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:27,463
The 16th.

247
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:29,264
I like it.

248
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,654
You know, speaking of birthdays,

249
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:37,284
I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

250
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,774
It's an hour before closing.

251
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:42,775
You're supposed
to be taking it easy.

252
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,288
We're having a little get-together
for Ted's birthday

253
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:47,533
and I've got to pick up the cake.

254
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:48,577
Why you?

255
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:52,705
Because I said I would.

256
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:55,791
It's the least I can do.

257
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:51,604
Let's get out of here.

258
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:53,827
You know, go do something.

259
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:56,776
Seriously.

260
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,977
You know that museum
in Santa Fe you talked about?

261
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:03,135
Let's take a drive.

262
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:08,605
Sure.

263
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,899
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's already been drilled and cut,

264
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,024
We're halfway through the job.

265
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,622
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.</i>

266
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:41,941
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

267
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,116
I gotta go.

268
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:45,457
Dean, I gotta go.

269
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:52,609
Happy Birthday!

270
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:59,066
My God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

271
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:02,027
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

272
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:04,292
Wait a minute.

273
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:07,217
Are you making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

274
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:10,250
Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

275
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,330
China's undercutting us at every turn...
I'm at a loss.

276
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:16,742
Wait.

277
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:19,962
I want to hear it first.

278
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:22,722
Absolutely not.
No way.

279
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:25,328
You cannot deny
your employer his birthday wish.

280
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:27,844
- Yes, I can. Watch me.
- Please!

281
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:32,196
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

282
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:35,520
- Come on. It was so good last time.
- It was ages ago.

283
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:38,784
And I'm enormous now.

284
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:41,161
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

285
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:43,527
Not that I ever did.
I mean, come on.

286
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:46,154
You guys, these candles
are getting wax all over the place.

287
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:48,832
- Seriously.
- Yes, come on, Skyler.

288
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:52,068
It's obscene.

289
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:09,157
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

290
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:11,888
<i>To you</i>

291
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,124
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

292
00:23:17,082 --> 00:23:18,512
<i>To you</i>

293
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,066
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

294
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,486
<i>Mr. President</i>

295
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,689
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

296
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,781
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

297
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,067
<i>To you</i>

298
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:45,997
That was fantastic.

299
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,990
Isn't she great, huh?

300
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:50,284
Okay, here we go.

301
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,566
- He wasn't there.
- <i>He was there all right.</i>

302
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:08,015
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours. Nobody came.

303
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,530
<i>All I know is my contact
says he was there.</i>

304
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,267
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

305
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:14,951
Yes, I'm positive.

306
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,661
- Where was he?
- <i>Who knows?</i>

307
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,757
Maybe he stayed out
in the parking lot,

308
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:21,901
checked you out with a telephoto lens.
Didn't like the cut of your jib.

309
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:22,888
Anyway,

310
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:26,088
it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no go.

311
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:28,757
What?
What do you mean?

312
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,668
No deal. No dice.

313
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:32,469
Shot at and missed, shit on and hit.

314
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:36,976
Wait a minute. How can he make
that decision without even meeting me?

315
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,935
<i>I told you he's very cautious
who he does business with.</i>

316
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:43,878
All right?
He's skittish, like a deer.

317
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:47,892
Call him back.

318
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:50,193
<i>I'm sorry.
I can't do that.</i>

319
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:52,894
Yes, you can.
Call him, Saul.

320
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:55,706
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

321
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:58,155
I called a guy who called
a guy who called a guy.

322
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,621
Second of all, it's over.

323
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:02,676
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual,</i>

324
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,977
<i>all you get is the one shot.</i>

325
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,091
Look,

326
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:10,520
I'll see if I can scrape
something else together,

327
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:12,050
but don't get your hopes up.

328
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,828
<i>No one else handles
that kind of bulk.</i>

329
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,248
Damn it.

330
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:59,699
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

331
00:27:07,183 --> 00:27:08,683
Can I help you, sir?

332
00:27:10,682 --> 00:27:12,082
Diet Coke, please.

333
00:27:15,078 --> 00:27:17,078
And five minutes of your time.

334
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,997
What can I do for you?

335
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:31,299
Have a seat.

336
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:33,824
Please.

337
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:49,477
I would like to know
why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.

338
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:53,878
I'm sorry.
I'm not following.

339
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,220
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

340
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,544
I believe that person was you.

341
00:28:02,537 --> 00:28:05,473
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

342
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:08,226
I don't think I am.

343
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:14,493
Sir, if you have a complaint,

344
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:16,830
I suggest you submit it through
our e-mail system.

345
00:28:16,955 --> 00:28:19,321
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

346
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:24,064
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with

347
00:28:24,189 --> 00:28:25,489
is very careful.

348
00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:27,844
A cautious man.

349
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:31,931
I believe we're alike in that way.

350
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:35,405
If you are

351
00:28:35,974 --> 00:28:37,474
who I think you are,

352
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,343
you should give me another chance.

353
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:48,308
I don't think we're alike
at all, Mr. White.

354
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:52,642
You are not a cautious man at all.

355
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:56,066
Your partner was late,
and he was high.

356
00:28:59,256 --> 00:29:00,508
Yes, he was.

357
00:29:00,971 --> 00:29:03,667
He's high often, isn't he?

358
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:09,245
You have poor judgment.

359
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:12,935
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

360
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,002
Are you familiar with my product?

361
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,178
I've been told it's excellent.

362
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:20,796
It is impeccable.

363
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,016
It is the purest,

364
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:26,471
most chemically-sound product
on the market anywhere.

365
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:29,115
That is not the only factor.

366
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:31,531
You could charge twice

367
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:35,656
the current rate for what I provide,
and your customers would pay it.

368
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:37,584
Hands down.

369
00:29:39,164 --> 00:29:42,772
Now, who I choose to do business
with on my end

370
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,698
is not your problem.

371
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,762
You won't see him.

372
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,847
You won't interact with him.

373
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,540
Forget he exists.

374
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:55,737
I have to ask.

375
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,119
Why?

376
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:00,618
Why him?

377
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:05,749
Because he does what I say.

378
00:30:08,048 --> 00:30:10,133
Because I can trust him.

379
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:13,936
How much product
do you have on hand?

380
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:16,180
38 pounds.

381
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:19,217
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

382
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,383
Will I hear from you?

383
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:31,453
I have your numbers.

384
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:38,615
You can never trust a drug addict.

385
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:57,674
Look, I mean, it's all kind
of little dribs and drabs,

386
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,910
but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

387
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:04,185
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

388
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,029
Dribs and drabs.

389
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:08,935
Once you add it all up, though,
and with Keller,

390
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:12,176
the revenues are almost 10% less
than was actually received.

391
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:16,486
And this is every quarter,
for the last two years.

392
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:23,215
When I saw that, I got worried,
so I checked Accounts Receivable

393
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:26,528
on other customers.
I found six other instances

394
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:30,698
of revenues being under-reported.

395
00:31:32,055 --> 00:31:34,755
And I've only just started
to look into it.

396
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:38,323
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

397
00:31:38,448 --> 00:31:40,773
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

398
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,936
Most of the time, they overestimate.

399
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:45,585
So I just let them roll their overages
into the next order

400
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,873
and if I don't,
they'll go elsewhere.

401
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:49,549
Obviously, we forgot

402
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:53,238
or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

403
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:57,705
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see,

404
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:01,017
the money's coming in.
Ventually, as you can see.

405
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:02,886
Right.

406
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:05,055
Right, but...

407
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,178
I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage,

408
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:12,600
to try and sort this out.

409
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:17,869
And most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

410
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,530
In a few cases,

411
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,776
I found Xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

412
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:41,874
All right.

413
00:32:44,324 --> 00:32:45,374
You got me.

414
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:50,360
We're talking nearly a million
dollars of undocumented revenue.

415
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,203
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking

416
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:56,703
about saving a company.

417
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,279
I'm thinking about people's jobs,

418
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:02,397
about their mortgages and pensions

419
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,480
and their college
funds for their kids.

420
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:06,900
Not to mention my own.

421
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:09,319
It doesn't mean that you
have to break the law.

422
00:33:09,622 --> 00:33:10,772
Yes, it does.

423
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:13,513
It's right there in the books.
Business is terrible.

424
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:17,119
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

425
00:33:17,244 --> 00:33:18,494
If I don't keep up...

426
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:21,237
People go to prison for this.

427
00:33:27,752 --> 00:33:30,632
My dad built this
company from nothing.

428
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,120
We make things here.

429
00:33:34,457 --> 00:33:37,057
The people who work
here are like family.

430
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:41,793
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

431
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,639
Don't report this.

432
00:33:53,185 --> 00:33:54,035
Please.

433
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,879
I'm not gonna turn you in.

434
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,440
But I can't be a part of it.

435
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:10,911
I know.

436
00:34:12,063 --> 00:34:13,663
I know. I just wish...

437
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:16,569
I'm sorry.

438
00:34:19,216 --> 00:34:20,866
I don't want you to go.

439
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:41,396
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

440
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:44,918
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

441
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:46,791
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

442
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:50,950
<i>The whole crew was representing. Even
Badger came all the way from Fresno.</i>

443
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:53,309
<i>Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins,</i>

444
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:55,387
<i>everyone was all choked up and shit.</i>

445
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:57,856
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

446
00:34:58,323 --> 00:35:00,322
<i>And you should have seen the coffin.</i>

447
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:02,223
<i>It was like this shiny,
white pearlescent.</i>

448
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:05,816
<i>Like, I'm pretty sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

449
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:08,341
<i>So we're definitely
talking high-end.</i>

450
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:12,162
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

451
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:14,995
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

452
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,906
I like to mix some ice with it.

453
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:49,330
Hold that.

454
00:36:52,614 --> 00:36:53,918
What's it feel like?

455
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:59,065
There's a chill.

456
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:02,636
Don't freak out.
It passes.

457
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:04,623
And then...

458
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:05,930
you'll see.

459
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:12,327
I'll meet you there.

460
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,116
Take that off.

461
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:55,317
Phones off, please.

462
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:15,207
Pipes, I guess.

463
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:18,664
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

464
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:20,853
Eyes on your paper.

465
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:54,050
Excuse me, where's the manager?

466
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:56,325
I'm the manager.
Can I help you?

467
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:02,667
I met a man here last week.
A black gentleman. He's thin. Glasses.

468
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,628
Yes, sir.
That's the owner.

469
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:07,049
Owner.

470
00:41:07,223 --> 00:41:09,984
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

471
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:12,159
He could be at any one of them.

472
00:41:13,665 --> 00:41:16,889
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...

473
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,809
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't give that out.

474
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:24,569
Is this about a complaint? I'd be
happy to refer you to our website.

475
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,316
- What's his name?
- Gustavo.

476
00:41:27,707 --> 00:41:28,507
Gus.

477
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,110
38 pounds, $1.2 million.

478
00:41:37,235 --> 00:41:40,821
Truck stop,
2 miles south of exit 13 on the 25.

479
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:41,896
One hour.

480
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,749
- What?
- One hour. You in or out?

481
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:47,962
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

482
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,109
One hour.
If you miss it,

483
00:41:50,234 --> 00:41:52,784
don't ever show your face
in here again.

484
00:41:58,798 --> 00:42:01,943
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck...

485
00:42:02,068 --> 00:42:05,468
- Come on! Come on!
- <i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

486
00:42:06,464 --> 00:42:07,701
Pick up the phone.

487
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:09,608
Pick up the phone!

488
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:13,363
I'm coming by.
I need the product.

489
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,447
I need the product now!

490
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:19,816
Wake up!

491
00:44:23,972 --> 00:44:24,865
Wake up.

492
00:44:30,647 --> 00:44:31,709
Where'd you put it?

493
00:44:31,996 --> 00:44:34,295
- Where is it? Where's the product?
- Get off of me.

494
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:37,104
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

495
00:44:37,229 --> 00:44:38,716
- In the kitchen.
- Where?

496
00:44:39,707 --> 00:44:40,836
Under the sink.

497
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:47,957
Not now!
