1
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:27,995
These people.

2
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:30,012
Pathetic.

3
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,169
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:36,352
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,670
You know, you guys really
don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,634
We won't even get
the results till next week.

7
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,538
Buddy, we're going to be here.
You kidding me?

8
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:48,130
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

9
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:52,436
You definitely want the PET/CT
and not just the PET.

10
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,804
It's a PET/CT.

11
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:58,479
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:00,702
Some places skimp,

13
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,345
and they only do the PET.

14
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:05,304
I'm not naming any names, but...

15
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,822
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

16
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:11,828
This is where Walt's doctor is.

17
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:15,944
With us, you wouldn't have to wait
until next week to get the results.

18
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:19,876
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

19
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:23,846
I could take one look at Walt's
and tell you immediately how he's doing.

20
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:24,834
Really.

21
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,871
Doctors like people to think
that they're so much smarter

22
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,008
than the technicians,
but you would be surprised

23
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:34,844
how much they come to us for input.

24
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:42,385
Never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

25
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,109
Excuse me.

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,730
You all right in there?

27
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:05,539
You okay?

28
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:11,814
I'm fine, thank you.

29
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,780
Sir, you can go back to
your changing room and get dressed.

30
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:42,466
So, how'd we do?

31
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,356
You did fine.

32
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:50,412
- See anything?
- I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

33
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,572
Dr. Delcavoli will go over
the results with you next week.

34
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:54,574
Sorry.

35
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:17,311
Synch: Tyno, Michvanilly

36
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:30,353
www.forom.com
www.sub-way.fr

37
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,732
Actually, the money laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

38
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:40,445
But I gotta tell ya,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect...

39
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,405
Most people want to know
why they suddenly got rich.

40
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,726
If she finds out,
it's after I'm gone.

41
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,845
How much time they giving you?

42
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:51,790
Weeks.

43
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:53,483
Maybe.

44
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:55,765
Sorry to hear it.

45
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:59,688
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

46
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,960
Oh, well.
Let's crunch some numbers.

47
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:05,561
How much money are we laundering?

48
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:09,766
At this time, $16,000.

49
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:14,004
How long have you been doing this?

50
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:17,270
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

51
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:18,445
Apparently.

52
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,688
All right, 16,000

53
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:23,899
laundered at 75 cents on the dollar,

54
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:25,514
minus my fee,

55
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,735
which is 17%,

56
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,287
comes to $9,960.
Congratulations.

57
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:35,024
You just left your family
a secondhand Subaru.

58
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,761
We'll just have
to cook more, a lot more.

59
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:41,363
That's my legal opinion.

60
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,483
Make hay while the sun
is still shining.

61
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:54,026
You know, we should
do something this weekend.

62
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,411
Get our minds off the test results?

63
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,761
Actually, I...

64
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,404
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

65
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,294
Really?

66
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,102
You know, I never did call her.

67
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:23,068
You're expecting the...

68
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:25,671
the news from the scan to be bad.

69
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:31,986
God.

70
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:36,835
I need you to stay
positive with me here.

71
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:38,176
I am.

72
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:40,023
Positive is good.

73
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:44,715
I'm all for positive,
but positive doesn't change facts.

74
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:46,289
All right?

75
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:51,381
It doesn't change
the need to be prepared.

76
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:52,607
I know.

77
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:55,944
I'm just trying to be hopeful, okay?

78
00:05:56,664 --> 00:05:58,214
You know? Forgive me.

79
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:02,245
Look,

80
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,370
I need to know Mom's going
to leave you something if...

81
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:10,152
if I'm no longer around.

82
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,319
I just need to get that straight.
That's all.

83
00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:20,854
And believe me, I'm going
to earn every penny of it, too.

84
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:25,790
Complaining about
her nurses the entire time.

85
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:30,332
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

86
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,483
A 30-minute discourse about

87
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:39,961
how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

88
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:43,236
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them. You know?

89
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,108
I'll be lucky if I get
a word in edgewise.

90
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:08,403
I actually think the news from the scan
is going to be good.

91
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,572
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

92
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:26,973
We should do something.

93
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:28,657
Yeah, we should.

94
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,164
No, something else.

95
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:34,657
We should go somewhere.

96
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,154
Have you been to
the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

97
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,409
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

98
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:44,399
Georgia O'Keeffe.

99
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:46,794
She's a painter.

100
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,419
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

101
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:51,587
Who is it?

102
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:54,284
Boy, you need some educating.

103
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,395
Yes, I do.
Come here.

104
00:07:57,232 --> 00:08:00,410
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

105
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:03,747
You want to go all the way
to Santa Fe for a museum?

106
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:08,973
Yep, we're going.
Get up.

107
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:14,666
Why can't we just go
to the movies or putt-putt?

108
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:16,536
It's the shit.

109
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,515
A little culture won't kill you.

110
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:21,574
Besides, you might like it.

111
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,299
A lot of her paintings
look like vaginas.

112
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:25,821
Really?

113
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,319
Is there still cereal?

114
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:42,049
<i>If I know you, leave a message.</i>

115
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:45,357
<i>Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.</i>

116
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:48,481
- <i>Hello, Jesse. Pick up...</i>
- Hold on, hold on.

117
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,380
Sorry. One sec.

118
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:56,984
What?

119
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,055
I've been trying to reach you.
Where's your drop phone?

120
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:04,860
- I've been busy.
- <i>Clear your social calendar.</i>

121
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:08,630
- We have to cook.
- <i>What? Today?</i>

122
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,233
<i>No. You'll need today
at least to gather supplies.</i>

123
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:14,887
<i>Now, we're going to need all
new glassware, heating mantles,</i>

124
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,218
about a hundred pounds of ice.
Do you have a paper and pencil?

125
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:22,404
- <i>You should be writing this down.</i>
- Go shopping yourself. I got plans.

126
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:26,822
<i>Smoking marijuana, eating Cheetos,
and masturbating do not constitute</i>

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,686
- plans in my book.
- <i>Screw you and your book, man.</i>

128
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:34,111
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

129
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:36,058
You're going to a museum?

130
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,224
Georgia O'Keeffe.

131
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:41,497
<i>She's a painter? Duh?</i>

132
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,198
She does these vagina pictures.

133
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,764
Or paintings, or...

134
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,502
Or just painted. I don't know.

135
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:50,882
- What are you even talking about?
- Why am I explaining myself to you?

136
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,877
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing. All you need to know is

137
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:59,014
- <i>I ain't cooking, shopping or whatever.</i>
- Let me explain something to you.

138
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:02,251
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

139
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,396
Tuesday?
Four days straight?

140
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,032
Like it or not, we have no choice.

141
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:09,505
<i>And why, exactly, is that?</i>

142
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:14,396
Our methylamine.
It's going bad.

143
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:17,091
- What?
- <i>It's losing its chemical potency.</i>

144
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,635
<i>Now, unless stealing
another barrel sounds</i>

145
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,637
- good to you...
- <i>Hell, no.</i>

146
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,473
We have to act fast
before it goes to waste.

147
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,764
<i>You have a paper and pencil?</i>

148
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:32,214
- <i>Come on.</i>
- All right, all right. Go.

149
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:41,740
- I wish you didn't have to do this.
- Me, too.

150
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:45,282
But I'll be back before you know it,

151
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,676
and you can always
call if you need me.

152
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:49,965
And risk talking to your mother?

153
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,283
That'd have to be some emergency.

154
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:03,837
Love you.

155
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,731
Fly safe, okay?

156
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:07,707
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

157
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,801
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

158
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,984
Did you get everything?
All six?

159
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,290
With reflux condensers?

160
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:17,071
Yes, like I said.

161
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:19,719
Just go.
Drive. Go, go.

162
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:25,549
Good morning to you, too, man.

163
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,652
- Stupid...
- Three entire bags of Funyuns?

164
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:28,242
What?
Funyuns are awesome.

165
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,667
- God.
- More for me.

166
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:33,994
How about something
with some protein, maybe?

167
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:35,806
Something green, huh?

168
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:40,224
Man, I'm getting no service.

169
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:44,186
How are you even alive?

170
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,544
Yo, check your phone.

171
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,016
You get any bars?

172
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,279
I've got a signal.

173
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:56,668
Let me use yours, would ya?

174
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:58,043
Absolutely not.

175
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:01,475
I have to assume Skyler checks
my phone records. You know that.

176
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,291
- It's not business. It's personal.
- Oh, personal.

177
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,445
- What, female?
- Maybe.

178
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,348
Absolutely, that's all I need.

179
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:12,118
Skyler hits "redial"
and some stripper answers.

180
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:15,391
Look, she's not a stripper.
Okay, dickwad?

181
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:17,243
Sorry.

182
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:18,640
My wife checks.

183
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,016
Drinking water?

184
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,726
Is that all we've got?

185
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,140
Ten gallons?

186
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,650
What, you planning
on taking a bath in it?

187
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:35,957
Oh, God.

188
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,760
Not there.
That is our work station.

189
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:49,185
- Our work station.
- That's right.

190
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:53,708
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

191
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,736
Considering this is our only set

192
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,411
and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

193
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,722
Why don't you try sticking them
up your ass sideways?

194
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,485
2.35 pounds.

195
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,414
2.35.

196
00:17:16,198 --> 00:17:17,786
That's the last of it.

197
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:21,604
How many total?

198
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:23,061
19.

199
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:26,399
Dollar-wise?

200
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:28,298
How much?

201
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:32,450
Well, median weight...
2.2 pounds.

202
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:35,330
That's 41.8,

203
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,861
call it 42 pounds at...
What are we selling it for these days?

204
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:40,700
- 40 a pound.
- $40,000?

205
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,778
You said raise the prices.

206
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:45,847
All right, that's 40 times 42,

207
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:48,271
minus distribution charges.

208
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:52,212
What?

209
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,027
What?

210
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,663
$672,000.

211
00:17:58,846 --> 00:17:59,846
All that?

212
00:18:02,776 --> 00:18:03,625
Each.

213
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:05,767
Each?

214
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,173
Each.

215
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:09,698
Six hundred and...

216
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:12,975
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

217
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:15,883
Hell, yeah!

218
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:18,619
Come high, baby!
Come on!

219
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:31,331
Well, there goes the generator.

220
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:34,158
I think that's it for the gas.

221
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,150
Perfect timing, yo.

222
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:40,461
- How do you figure that?
- What do you mean? We're done cooking.

223
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:43,459
I am not done until
this barrel is empty.

224
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:44,994
Look at that.

225
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:48,638
I'd say we still got
10, 12 gallons of methylamine.

226
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:51,844
- Come on, where's your ambition?
- Jesus. Seriously?

227
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,782
We are way ahead of schedule.

228
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,385
Plus, the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane,

229
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,803
and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

230
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:03,291
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off.

231
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:06,250
Look, I don't have to take
you back till Tuesday, right?

232
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,325
So we come back tomorrow, strap on
the sizzle and glass up the rest.

233
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,661
Come on!

234
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:14,736
There's got to be a Denny's
out there someplace.

235
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:16,222
Grand Slam?

236
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,355
A hot shower?

237
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:20,344
A bed?

238
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:26,418
Separate rooms.

239
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,666
That's a given.

240
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:37,055
The battery's dead.

241
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:44,199
Back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place,

242
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:48,436
- where did you put them?
- I left 'em right here in the ignition.

243
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:51,299
Son of a bitch.

244
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,542
This is not my fault.
The buzzer didn't buzz.

245
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,277
- The what?
- The buzzer.

246
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,481
It buzzes when you put the keys in
to let you know that the battery's on.

247
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:01,549
I know that. It didn't buzz.

248
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:04,853
Look, I didn't turn the key or anything.
I'm not stupid.

249
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:06,955
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

250
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,891
It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

251
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:12,486
Is this a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

252
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,996
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

253
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:18,666
The buzzer did not buzz, and you made me
move the keys in the first place,

254
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,841
- remember?
- I see your point.

255
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,805
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should have known to say,

256
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,708
"Don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days!"

257
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,544
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch!

258
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,147
Oh, I'm sorry.
The work station.

259
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:41,885
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

260
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:45,371
How?

261
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,583
You going to be okay?

262
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,660
Damn it.

263
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:02,777
What's it taste like?

264
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,445
Bad, huh?

265
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:13,692
This is good. Right here.

266
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,770
There.

267
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,984
Here. Red to red, black to black.

268
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:28,203
Positive, negative.

269
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:30,254
All right. Start it up.

270
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,693
The hell's wrong with this thing?

271
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,575
You have to really pull.

272
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,500
I am.

273
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,816
Really pull.
Not like a girl.

274
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:44,752
You know what?
Pull this. I am pulling.

275
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,654
It just needs to warm up a little.

276
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:51,926
Oh, God!

277
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:54,329
Oh, Jesus.

278
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:20,639
Well done.

279
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:22,443
As always. Just...

280
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:25,654
Well done.

281
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:28,743
God.

282
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:53,302
Come on, you bitches.

283
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,680
Hear me now.

284
00:22:58,242 --> 00:22:59,202
Damn it!

285
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,007
This is stupid.

286
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:15,536
Okay, now we have to use your phone.

287
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,194
This is ruined.
Do you understand? Just ruined.

288
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,937
I understand you hooked it
up wrong and you blew it up.

289
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,295
- That is not what happened.
- How do you know?

290
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,509
I wasn't the one who dumped out the last
of our water. That's what I know.

291
00:23:28,634 --> 00:23:31,784
There was a fire.
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

292
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:35,968
Is that... You were thinking.
Now that we have identified the problem.

293
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,565
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

294
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:42,741
Look, somebody is going
to have to pick us up.

295
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:47,002
Your wife is not going
to notice one little call.

296
00:23:48,004 --> 00:23:49,454
Mr. White, come on.

297
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:53,289
All right, look.

298
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:56,117
Make it snappy.

299
00:23:57,222 --> 00:24:00,072
- The roaming drains the battery.
- All right.

300
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,259
Yo, Skinny, hey.

301
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,593
Listen, I need you
to come pick us up.

302
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:11,078
Now, all right?
We're stuck out here.

303
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:13,153
You got a pen for directions?

304
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,403
A pencil's fine, retard.

305
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:18,072
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

306
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,894
All right, so you ready?

307
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:23,872
So you're going to head west on the 40
for, like, what, 30 miles?

308
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:28,082
And you're just gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

309
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,154
Big arrows, giant arrows. They light up
and blink and shit. You can't miss them.

310
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,157
But then you're gonna want
to take it slow because there's this

311
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:39,761
dirt road right before this white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

312
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:43,000
Now, you're going to be way,
way out in the boonies, okay?

313
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:47,123
Like, crazy far, so you just got to keep
heading down that dirt road for what?

314
00:24:47,474 --> 00:24:49,124
About another 15 miles.

315
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:50,821
Really? That far?

316
00:24:51,164 --> 00:24:52,814
Hurry up. The battery.

317
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:55,443
Just go down that road
for, like, 15 more miles.

318
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,204
I mean, we're way the hell out here.

319
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:00,731
And yo, listen.

320
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:02,214
Bring water.

321
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:04,229
Leave now.

322
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:06,402
Here.

323
00:25:07,294 --> 00:25:08,394
He's coming.

324
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,598
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel

325
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:20,107
who broke his leg mountain biking,

326
00:25:20,522 --> 00:25:22,758
and he had to drink urine for,

327
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,397
you know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

328
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:28,856
He said it tasted like really hot,

329
00:25:29,414 --> 00:25:31,731
really old soda.

330
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:37,368
We should just call.

331
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:40,392
You know? I'll be quick.
Just be like,

332
00:25:40,517 --> 00:25:42,039
"Yo, where are you?"

333
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:45,899
All right.

334
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Come on.

335
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,009
Yo, where are you?

336
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,079
So you saw the white sign?

337
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,390
He's almost here.

338
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,217
Oh, man.

339
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:11,625
We're getting really freaked out.

340
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:14,671
All right,
so you're on the dirt road?

341
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,724
He's on the dirt road. Good.

342
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:19,031
You just crossed the river?

343
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:22,330
- Have you seen anything?
- Wait, wait. What river?

344
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:27,702
What river? What the hell river you
talking about, man? There's no river.

345
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:30,071
Can you...

346
00:26:32,587 --> 00:26:33,758
Phone's dead.

347
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:39,828
Now what?

348
00:26:45,174 --> 00:26:46,124
What now?

349
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:50,509
Come on.
Seriously?

350
00:27:25,052 --> 00:27:26,427
What's this?

351
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:30,441
I'm trying to

352
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,420
trickle-charge the battery.

353
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:36,099
Seriously?

354
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:39,107
Just by turning that thing?

355
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:40,773
The commutator.

356
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:44,412
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

357
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,081
Usually, this little

358
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:49,584
piston engine turns it,

359
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:53,854
but considering it's lying here
completely totaled...

360
00:27:58,604 --> 00:27:59,604
Anyway.

361
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:05,005
Apply a little elbow grease...

362
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:07,492
It'll take longer.

363
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,169
A lot longer.

364
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,940
But theoretically,

365
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:15,469
it should work.

366
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:18,991
Theoretically.

367
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:25,988
It has to work.

368
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:28,528
You understand?

369
00:28:38,745 --> 00:28:39,745
Can I try?

370
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,150
How much longer?

371
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,040
I don't know.

372
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:11,551
You hanging in?

373
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:14,214
I'm good.

374
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:20,139
It's got to be ready by now. Right?

375
00:30:23,897 --> 00:30:25,597
Give it a little longer,

376
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:28,413
just to make sure we're...

377
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:46,928
Methylamine doesn't spoil, does it?

378
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:54,003
That's not why we're here.

379
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:09,651
Lie much?

380
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:18,963
Push.

381
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:42,684
Come on.

382
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,140
Please.

383
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,456
God.

384
00:32:20,078 --> 00:32:20,958
Please.

385
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:42,936
Why couldn't I have
just gone to Santa Fe?

386
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:44,566
Why?

387
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,200
What are you doing?

388
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,964
I had this coming.

389
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:35,109
What?

390
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:39,908
I have it coming.

391
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,803
I deserve this.

392
00:33:45,252 --> 00:33:46,854
You snap out of it.

393
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:50,739
First off, everything
you did, you did for your family.

394
00:33:51,545 --> 00:33:52,345
Right?

395
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,038
All I ever managed to do

396
00:33:58,227 --> 00:34:00,570
was worry and disappoint them

397
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:03,132
and lie.

398
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:06,504
God.

399
00:34:07,721 --> 00:34:08,871
All the lies.

400
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,692
I can't even...

401
00:34:13,723 --> 00:34:16,570
I can't even keep them
straight in my head anymore.

402
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:19,067
You know what?

403
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,542
Screw this. I'm walking.

404
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,015
You can come or not.

405
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:28,021
Where's my other shoe?

406
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:37,697
Your body

407
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:41,562
is running dangerously
low on electrolytes.

408
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:46,745
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

409
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:49,774
And when they're gone,

410
00:34:50,947 --> 00:34:54,375
your brain ceases
to communicate with your muscles.

411
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:57,356
Your lungs stop breathing,

412
00:34:58,043 --> 00:35:00,116
your heart stops pumping.

413
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:04,234
You go marching out there,

414
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,594
and within an hour,

415
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:08,774
you will be dead.

416
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:13,517
You need to cut out
all your loser cry-baby crap right now

417
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:15,842
and think of something scientific!

418
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:18,743
Something scientific, right.

419
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,401
What? Come on.

420
00:35:20,606 --> 00:35:21,902
You're smart.

421
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,905
You made poison out of beans.

422
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,150
All right, look.

423
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:32,452
We got an entire lab right here.

424
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:34,915
All right?
How about you

425
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:38,719
take some of these chemicals
and mix up some rocket fuel?

426
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:41,822
That way,
you can just send up a signal flare.

427
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,758
Or you make some kind of robot

428
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:47,911
to get us help,
or a homing device or...

429
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:50,631
build a new battery or...

430
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:51,928
Wait. No.

431
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,469
What if we just
take some stuff off of the RV

432
00:35:55,812 --> 00:35:58,788
and build it into something
completely different?

433
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:01,409
Like a dune buggy.

434
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:04,627
That way, we can just dune buggy...

435
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:10,039
What is it?

436
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:12,473
What?

437
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:16,131
Do you have any money?

438
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:20,253
- Change, I mean. Coins.
- I got a bunch of them.

439
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:23,681
Then gather them.

440
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:27,424
And washers and nuts
and bolts and screws

441
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:30,970
and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

442
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:34,641
It has to be galvanized
or solid zinc.

443
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,371
- Solid zinc, right.
- And bring me

444
00:36:38,788 --> 00:36:42,049
brake pads.
The front wheels should have discs.

445
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:44,051
Take them off and bring them to me.

446
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:47,043
Brake pads.

447
00:36:50,848 --> 00:36:53,794
- What are we building?
- You said it yourself.

448
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:55,602
A robot?

449
00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:57,863
A battery.

450
00:36:58,444 --> 00:36:59,255
Move!

451
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:14,994
This doesn't look like
any battery I ever saw.

452
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:17,918
Well, trust me. It is a battery.

453
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:21,100
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

454
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,758
Here.
Cut up the last two sponges.

455
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:27,895
Remember the electrolytes?

456
00:37:29,356 --> 00:37:30,431
Think about it.

457
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,972
A battery is a galvanic cell.

458
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:37,167
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode

459
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:39,606
separated by an electrolyte, right?

460
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:42,409
- Right.
- Well, anyway.

461
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:46,110
On one side, we have mercuric oxide

462
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:48,682
and graphite from your brake pads.

463
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:50,852
This is the cathode.

464
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,105
This is the positive terminal.

465
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,974
This is where the supply
of current flows out from.

466
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:58,087
You see?

467
00:37:58,352 --> 00:37:59,245
Then...

468
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,096
Here, I'll show you.
On the opposite side is our anode.

469
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:04,625
This...

470
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,534
It's zinc.

471
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:12,265
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

472
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,670
So, the sponge is the electrolyte?

473
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:21,023
No, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

474
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:24,485
But yes,
that's what I'm soaking the sponges in.

475
00:38:26,578 --> 00:38:27,411
Good.

476
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:30,397
Good.
And now,

477
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:33,648
what shall we use

478
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:36,597
to conduct
this beautiful current with?

479
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:39,632
What one particular element

480
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,478
comes to mind?

481
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:48,899
A wire.

482
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:52,941
Copper.

483
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:55,999
- Well, I mean...
- It's copper.

484
00:38:57,998 --> 00:38:59,453
The only question now is

485
00:39:00,364 --> 00:39:02,456
will this supply enough current?

486
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,338
And how many cells will we need?

487
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,700
Maybe we've only got
material enough for six.

488
00:39:18,645 --> 00:39:20,487
Put the lid on.
Wait.

489
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:21,825
Positive.

490
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,670
Cathode.

491
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:33,475
Anode.

492
00:39:34,593 --> 00:39:35,415
Damn.

493
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:37,102
That is good.

494
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:39,955
That's very good.
Here we go.

495
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:55,193
How's the...

496
00:40:58,032 --> 00:40:59,032
It's fine.

497
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,823
I know I can trust you to...

498
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:20,984
Whatever happens,

499
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,290
your family will get your share.

500
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,030
So...

501
00:41:43,182 --> 00:41:44,992
I'll be hearing from you.

502
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,210
How's everyone doing?

503
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:18,518
Is that baby ever going
to come out, you think?

504
00:42:20,724 --> 00:42:23,674
- I know, enough already. It's...
- I'm teasing.

505
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:25,793
Everything in its time.

506
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:30,290
Walt, I have your scan results.

507
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,891
And you're showing signs
of remission.

508
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,986
My God.

509
00:42:40,263 --> 00:42:41,541
I want to clarify.

510
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:44,478
There are some misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

511
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:47,047
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

512
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,644
To classify someone as in remission,

513
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:52,510
we only need to determine
that the tumor hasn't grown.

514
00:42:52,635 --> 00:42:54,821
That it hasn't grown?
Jesus.

515
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:56,830
Technically speaking,

516
00:42:56,955 --> 00:43:00,078
a tumor can remain the exact
same size it was before

517
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,719
and the patient
could still be in remission.

518
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:06,287
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage 3 adenocarcinoma,

519
00:43:06,572 --> 00:43:09,455
I like to see...
I hope to see at least

520
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,424
a 25 to 35% reduction in tumor mass,

521
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:16,681
something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

522
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,046
Everybody still with me?

523
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,454
And how has my cancer responded?

524
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,755
Your tumor has shrunk by 80%.

525
00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:37,564
- My God.
- Wait, I'm sorry. I'm really...

526
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:41,601
I'm confused. Isn't 80% a lot?

527
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,521
Mom.

528
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,873
80% is a lot.

529
00:43:47,817 --> 00:43:50,469
- Okay, but, I'm...
- Sweetheart, you were right.

530
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,394
- It's very good news.
- It's very good news.

531
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:56,266
Are you kidding me?

532
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,166
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

533
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:16,193
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

534
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:20,346
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

535
00:44:20,676 --> 00:44:23,577
It's okay.
This is fairly common.

536
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:26,793
See that scary-looking thing there?

537
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:30,183
That's tissue inflammation.
That's a reaction to your radio therapy.

538
00:44:30,844 --> 00:44:33,854
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

539
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:36,029
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

540
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:38,190
Tissue inflammation?

541
00:44:39,505 --> 00:44:41,261
Are you sure about that?

542
00:44:41,736 --> 00:44:43,660
Because the other day,

543
00:44:44,692 --> 00:44:46,642
I was coughing up some blood.

544
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:50,444
- What?
- You probably have a tear

545
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:53,506
in your esophagus from the coughing,
and that can be very serious.

546
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:55,851
You could rupture
and bleed to death.

547
00:44:55,976 --> 00:44:58,986
We're going to have to deal with that
before you leave here today.

548
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:01,948
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

549
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,878
- I'm sorry. I...
- No more secrets, Walt.

550
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:08,503
With something like this,
you have to call me. Immediately.

551
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,144
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

552
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:15,161
But now at least
we have some options.

553
00:45:15,538 --> 00:45:17,838
The most important of which is time.

554
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:22,302
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

555
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,705
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.
