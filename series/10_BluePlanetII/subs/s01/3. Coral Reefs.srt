1
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,640
<i>In a far corner</i>
<i>of South-East Asia,</i>

2
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,435
<i>lies the Coral Triangle.</i>

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,590
<i>A cluster of the richest coral reefs,</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

4
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,035
<i>Undersea cities crammed full of life.</i>

5
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,155
<i>As in any crowded metropolis,</i>

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,354
<i>there is fierce rivalry for space,</i>

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,995
<i>for food</i>

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,160
<i>and for a partner.</i>

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,553
<i>But the reef is also a place</i>
<i>full of opportunity.</i>

10
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,876
<i>A cuttlefish.</i>

11
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,480
<i>It specialises in hunting crabs.</i>

12
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,271
<i>But a large crab is a dangerous quarry.</i>

13
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,232
<i>It has powerful claws.</i>

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,637
<i>The cuttlefish, however,</i>
<i>has a remarkable talent.</i>

15
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,837
<i>Its skin contains millions</i>
<i>of pigment cells</i>

16
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,509
<i>with which it can create</i>
<i>ever-changing colours</i>

17
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,875
<i>and patterns.</i>

18
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,160
<i>And that apparently hypnotises the crab.</i>

19
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,033
<i>A cuttlefish may be clever,</i>

20
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,159
<i>but a shark is bigger.</i>

21
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,877
<i>And it eats cuttlefish.</i>

22
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,200
<i>Time to disappear.</i>

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,834
<i>Back to the hunt.</i>

24
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,834
<i>A new target,</i>
<i>but the same mesmerising technique.</i>

25
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,232
<i>For those that manage to establish</i>
<i>themselves in these bustling</i>

26
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,714
<i>undersea cities,</i>

27
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
<i>there can be great rewards.</i>

28
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,917
<i>Corals build themselves</i>
<i>homes of limestone,</i>

29
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,278
<i>in the warm, clear,</i>
<i>shallow seas of the Tropics.</i>

30
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,920
<i>Their reefs occupy less than one tenth</i>

31
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,999
<i>of one percent of the ocean floor.</i>

32
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,230
<i>Yet, they're home to a quarter</i>

33
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,710
<i>of all known marine species.</i>

34
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,760
<i>They are complex,</i>

35
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,470
<i>infinitely variant structures,</i>

36
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,916
<i>providing all kinds of homes</i>
<i>for their many residents,</i>

37
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,520
<i>from penthouse suites,</i>

38
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,198
<i>to backstreet dens.</i>

39
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,920
<i>Here, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef,</i>

40
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,270
<i>a coral grouper lives</i>
<i>by hunting for small fish.</i>

41
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,793
<i>But how do you get a meal here,</i>

42
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
<i>when you're too big</i>
<i>to squeeze into crevices?</i>

43
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,792
<i>And the grouper also has a rival,</i>

44
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,351
<i>one which is highly intelligent,</i>

45
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,277
<i>and seeks the same kind of prey.</i>

46
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,316
<i>An octopus.</i>

47
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,395
<i>It can reach into really narrow cracks.</i>

48
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,075
<i>Even so,</i>

49
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,233
<i>its prey often escapes.</i>

50
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,152
<i>What if they could work together?</i>

51
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,477
<i>The grouper turns pale,</i>

52
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,918
<i>and tries to attract</i>
<i>the octopus's attention.</i>

53
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,073
<i>It performs a head stand.</i>

54
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,998
<i>Not only is the grouper signalling</i>
<i>to the octopus,</i>

55
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,194
<i>it's indicating</i>
<i>where the prey is hiding.</i>

56
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,711
<i>The octopus reaches inside.</i>

57
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,954
<i>The fish take fright.</i>

58
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,754
<i>And swim straight into</i>
<i>the grouper's jaws.</i>

59
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,000
<i>Sometimes, the octopus gets the reward,</i>

60
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,075
<i>sometimes, the grouper does.</i>

61
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,711
<i>Two very different species</i>

62
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,596
<i>have discovered</i>
<i>that teamwork can bring success,</i>

63
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,792
<i>in reef city.</i>

64
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,756
<i>Teamwork, in fact,</i>
<i>is the very foundation of life</i>

65
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,036
<i>on the reef.</i>

66
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,840
<i>The corals themselves</i>
<i>also rely on a partnership.</i>

67
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,472
<i>But one of a much more intimate kind.</i>

68
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,511
<i>Corals are colonies</i>
<i>of anemone-like animals,</i>

69
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,996
<i>polyps.</i>

70
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,759
<i>Some as small as grains of sand.</i>

71
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
<i>Living inside the tissues of each polyp,</i>

72
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,636
<i>are minute plant-like cells,</i>
<i>invisible to the naked eye.</i>

73
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,039
<i>By day flourishing in tropical sunshine,</i>

74
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,960
<i>the plant-like cells provide the polyps</i>

75
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,879
<i>with up to 90% of their food.</i>

76
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,197
<i>And when it's dark,</i>
<i>the polyps continue to feed</i>

77
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,879
<i>by using their tentacles to grab</i>
<i>edible particles drifting by.</i>

78
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,470
<i>The polyps also extract</i>
<i>calcium carbonate from the sea water,</i>

79
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,509
<i>and use it to build a stony housing</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

80
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,116
<i>Coral colonies</i>
<i>can continue to grow for centuries.</i>

81
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,320
<i>Possibly millennia.</i>

82
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,557
<i>And they can build structures</i>
<i>that can reach the size of a house.</i>

83
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,037
<i>The biggest of their cities,</i>
<i>is the Great Barrier Reef.</i>

84
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,312
<i>It runs for over 1400 miles</i>
<i>along the coast of North East Australia.</i>

85
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,078
<i>Activity in coral reefs,</i>
<i>wherever they are, never ceases.</i>

86
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,795
<i>At dawn, the day shift begins.</i>

87
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,192
<i>Accompanied by a chorus</i>
<i>of submarine song,</i>

88
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,833
<i>created by fish, shrimps,</i>
<i>and other inhabitants of the reef.</i>

89
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,958
<i>Every resident in this city,</i>
<i>has its role.</i>

90
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,151
<i>Scavengers, like the sea cucumber,</i>

91
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,272
<i>recycle the waste of others.</i>

92
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,634
<i>These parrot fish,</i>
<i>bite off chunks of coral</i>

93
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,077
<i>and crunch it</i>
<i>to extract the contents.</i>

94
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,239
<i>And then, excrete the rest as sand.</i>

95
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,760
<i>Green turtles, here in Borneo,</i>

96
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,840
<i>pay regular visits</i>
<i>to a particular patch of coral.</i>

97
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,951
<i>This little female is up early</i>
<i>and one step ahead of the others.</i>

98
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,718
<i>Turtles travel long distances along</i>
<i>the reef in order to get here.</i>

99
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,551
<i>This is their destination.</i>

100
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,514
<i>Turtle Rock.</i>

101
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,558
<i>Generations of visiting turtles</i>
<i>have worn a hollow in its top.</i>

102
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,674
<i>This is home to blennies</i>

103
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,353
<i>and surgeon fish.</i>

104
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,790
<i>They clean the visitors picking off</i>
<i>any algae, parasites and dead skin,</i>

105
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,240
<i>that they can find.</i>

106
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,679
<i>Other client are close behind.</i>

107
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,477
<i>A queue is forming.</i>

108
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,560
<i>The big males barge their way in.</i>

109
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,631
<i>And the smaller female is forced out.</i>

110
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,000
<i>She takes a quick turn around the block,</i>

111
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,800
<i>while the others are squabbling.</i>

112
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,630
<i>And then, she sneaks back in.</i>

113
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,239
<i>So the cleaners get a nutritious meal,</i>

114
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,272
<i>and their customers are freed of</i>
<i>their parasites and other encumbrances.</i>

115
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,277
<i>And it's now thought, that a spot</i>
<i>of pampering at a cleaning station</i>

116
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,357
<i>may even reduce stress.</i>

117
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,751
<i>The lands of the Middle East</i>
<i>are so hot and dry,</i>

118
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,799
<i>that much of their surface</i>
<i>is almost lifeless.</i>

119
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,832
<i>But here in the Red Sea,</i>

120
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,591
<i>Coral Reefs flourish wonderfully.</i>

121
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,274
<i>The waters offshore,</i>

122
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,512
<i>are almost as rich</i>
<i>in life as a rainforest.</i>

123
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,757
<i>And some animals come to the reefs</i>

124
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,072
<i>simply for rest and relaxation.</i>

125
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,235
<i>The family of bottlenose dolphins</i>

126
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,720
<i>are resting on the reef</i>

127
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,509
<i>after a night's feeding offshore.</i>

128
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,400
<i>Whilst the adult and their babies sleep,</i>

129
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,238
<i>the adolescents set of the explore...</i>

130
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,675
<i>...and they appear to make up games.</i>

131
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,834
<i>You might call this one,</i>
<i>"Catch the coral."</i>

132
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,116
<i>The rules aren't entirely clear.</i>

133
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,680
<i>They pick up different bits</i>
<i>of broken coral,</i>

134
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,869
<i>and drop them.</i>

135
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,759
<i>Some fall fast.</i>

136
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,592
<i>Others sink more slowly.</i>

137
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,516
<i>And some seem to be descending in a way</i>

138
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,074
<i>that pleases everybody.</i>

139
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,359
<i>Only the most successful city residents</i>
<i>can afford the luxury of playing games.</i>

140
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,320
<i>But, such games do that their value.</i>

141
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,435
<i>They may help the youngsters develop</i>
<i>the coordination and the agility</i>

142
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,395
<i>that they will need when</i>
<i>they start hunting in the open sea.</i>

143
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,477
<i>Every reef</i>
<i>has a sharply defined boundary.</i>

144
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,958
<i>Its city walls.</i>

145
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,238
<i>On the outer side is the drop off.</i>

146
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,830
<i>These ramparts protect the city</i>
<i>from the ocean waves.</i>

147
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,790
<i>But twice a day, the walls are covered</i>
<i>by the incoming tide.</i>

148
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,630
<i>In the Bahamas, the rush of the water</i>
<i>creates a truly strange phenomenon.</i>

149
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,029
<i>Seamen once told tales</i>
<i>of a giant sea monster,</i>

150
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,590
<i>lurking here deep inside the reef,</i>

151
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,080
<i>that would drag sailors to their doom.</i>

152
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,873
<i>Today, we know it is in fact a whirlpool</i>
<i>created by the incoming tide</i>

153
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,435
<i>rushing over deep coral caves.</i>

154
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,712
<i>These currents bring in fresh supplies</i>
<i>of microscopic food to the reef</i>

155
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,280
<i>from the open ocean.</i>

156
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,997
<i>And in the Maldives,</i>
<i>on the biggest tides,</i>

157
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,630
<i>one particular coral lagoon</i>

158
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,230
<i>become so flooded with plankton,</i>

159
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,556
<i>that it attracts hundreds</i>
<i>of ocean giants.</i>

160
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,033
<i>Manta Rays.</i>

161
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,111
<i>With three meter wing spans.</i>

162
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,553
<i>With their huge sloth</i>
<i>like mouths wide open</i>

163
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,437
<i>they filter out the plankton.</i>

164
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,157
<i>And the mantas create</i>
<i>a vortex of their own</i>

165
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,876
<i>that further concentrates their food.</i>

166
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,272
<i>This behaviour has been called</i>
<i>the manta cyclone.</i>

167
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,077
<i>Then the tide changes,</i>

168
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,912
<i>and the supply of food is cut of.</i>

169
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,075
<i>The mantas leave the lagoon.</i>

170
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,271
<i>Life on the sheltered side of the reef</i>
<i>is tranquil and peaceful.</i>

171
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,592
<i>In these suburbs,</i>
<i>any creature wishing to escape</i>

172
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,235
<i>from the bustling crowds of reef city,</i>

173
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,353
<i>can find plenty of space.</i>

174
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,196
<i>On the other hand,</i>

175
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,317
<i>there is nowhere to hide.</i>

176
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,475
<i>That, at night,</i>

177
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,917
<i>makes it a dangerous place.</i>

178
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,997
<i>Nocturnal predators,</i>
<i>such as this lion fish,</i>

179
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,597
<i>patrol the reef edge.</i>

180
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,598
<i>The hunter has become the hunted.</i>

181
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,915
<i>A bobbit,</i>

182
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,432
<i>a giant carnivorous worm</i>

183
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,231
<i>with jaws as sharp as daggers.</i>

184
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,117
<i>It has an ancestry that stretches back</i>
<i>more than four hundred million years.</i>

185
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,957
<i>It's a meter long.</i>

186
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,551
<i>It tastes for scent.</i>

187
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,475
<i>And feels for movement.</i>

188
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,991
<i>Dawn, and with light,</i>
<i>the reef becomes a safer place.</i>

189
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,870
<i>Little bream return to foraging.</i>

190
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,191
<i>The bobbit might still be hungry.</i>

191
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,550
<i>But now in daylight</i>
<i>the odds have shifted.</i>

192
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,951
<i>The bream can see the bobbit.</i>

193
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,553
<i>Instead of retreating,</i>

194
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,558
<i>they join together to blow away</i>
<i>the sand covering the worm.</i>

195
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,479
<i>So, taking away</i>
<i>its advantage of surprise.</i>

196
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,475
<i>By revealing the bobbit's hiding place,</i>

197
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,155
<i>they will all be able</i>
<i>to feed more safely.</i>

198
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,192
<i>But it pays to remember</i>

199
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,439
<i>there is a bobbit about.</i>

200
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,071
<i>Out here, on the sand flats,</i>

201
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,154
<i>there is safe accommodation for some.</i>

202
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,759
<i>The family of saddleback clownfish</i>
<i>have found an excellent home.</i>

203
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,030
<i>The tentacles</i>
<i>of this carpet anemone can kill.</i>

204
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,395
<i>But the clownfish</i>
<i>are immune to the poison,</i>

205
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,752
<i>so they can shelter from danger.</i>

206
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,112
<i>In return, the fish keep the anemone</i>
<i>clean of debris.</i>

207
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,553
<i>As with all clownfish,</i>

208
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,838
<i>the family is ruled by a big female.</i>

209
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,350
<i>Her white face marks her out</i>
<i>as the boss.</i>

210
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,234
<i>The diminutive male</i>
<i>has to prove his worth,</i>

211
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,917
<i>so he works tirelessly,</i>

212
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,030
<i>removing debris and generally keeping</i>
<i>on top of the housework.</i>

213
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,110
<i>His greatest challenge</i>
<i>is to find a safe place</i>

214
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,749
<i>where the boss can lay her eggs.</i>

215
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,471
<i>But there's nothing solid here</i>
<i>for the female to lay them on.</i>

216
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,831
<i>A nearby shell could be the solution.</i>

217
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,754
<i>If only he can move it</i>
<i>to the protection of the anemone.</i>

218
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,876
<i>Too heavy.</i>

219
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,589
<i>Besides, it has a mind of its own.</i>

220
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,870
<i>The hermit crab.</i>

221
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,196
<i>But out here, twice a day,</i>

222
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,079
<i>the anemone is swept by tidal currents,</i>

223
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,431
<i>and they bring in new opportunities.</i>

224
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,352
<i>An old plastic bottle.</i>

225
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,234
<i>Perhaps, this will do.</i>

226
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,520
<i>Not heavy enough.</i>

227
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,275
<i>A coconut shell.</i>

228
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,632
<i>It looks just right.</i>

229
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,836
<i>But it's a long way from home.</i>

230
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,160
<i>And he can't move it by himself.</i>

231
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,080
<i>So the pair now work together.</i>

232
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,473
<i>A little adjustment</i>
<i>to the anemone's tentacles,</i>

233
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,279
<i>in order to clear a space for it.</i>

234
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,511
<i>And the shell is tucked in.</i>

235
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,634
<i>The female lays.</i>

236
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,710
<i>A safe nursery at last.</i>

237
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,356
<i>He has proved himself worthy</i>
<i>to father her young.</i>

238
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,400
<i>And he fertilizes them.</i>

239
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,277
<i>Now he will meticulously tend the eggs,</i>

240
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,834
<i>keeping them clean</i>
<i>and healthy until they hatch</i>

241
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,554
<i>in 10 days time.</i>

242
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,834
<i>Reef creatures go to great lengths to</i>
<i>give their young a head start in life.</i>

243
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,513
<i>And nowhere more so</i>

244
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,037
<i>than on the remotest reefs in the world.</i>

245
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,119
<i>French Polynesia,</i>

246
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,319
<i>the very heart of the South Pacific.</i>

247
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,032
<i>Protected by their isolation,</i>

248
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,716
<i>some of the reefs here,</i>
<i>are still virtually pristine.</i>

249
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,635
<i>This marbled grouper has made it</i>
<i>in the city and reached adulthood.</i>

250
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,435
<i>Now, it's the time to mate.</i>

251
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,879
<i>To find a partner, he must head</i>
<i>to the most dangerous part of this reef:</i>

252
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,116
<i>The drop off.</i>

253
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,472
<i>Patrolled by grey reef sharks,</i>

254
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,795
<i>hundreds of them.</i>

255
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,280
<i>They seem to be resting,</i>

256
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,396
<i>for now.</i>

257
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,113
<i>Thousands of other groupers</i>
<i>have gathered on the seabed below.</i>

258
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,912
<i>The females are almost bursting</i>
<i>with eggs.</i>

259
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,120
<i>But to mate with one,</i>

260
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,036
<i>he must first get through the crowd</i>
<i>of other waiting males.</i>

261
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,631
<i>And they all have the same thing</i>
<i>on their minds.</i>

262
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,590
<i>They jostle to get as close as possible</i>
<i>to a female.</i>

263
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,159
<i>This male may have</i>
<i>secured pole position,</i>

264
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,557
<i>but the female won't release</i>
<i>her eggs for him to fertilize,</i>

265
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,516
<i>until conditions are just right.</i>

266
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,834
<i>Now the sharks begin to close in,</i>

267
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,276
<i>sensing that</i>
<i>the critical moment is approaching.</i>

268
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,600
<i>The tide is beginning to turn.</i>

269
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,120
<i>This could be the moment to spawn.</i>

270
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,755
<i>Suddenly, the females rush up</i>
<i>towards the surface</i>

271
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,475
<i>releasing their clouds</i>
<i>of eggs as they go.</i>

272
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,480
<i>The males pursue them,</i>
<i>simultaneously releasing their sperm.</i>

273
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,911
<i>It's an act</i>
<i>the groupers seem prepared to die for.</i>

274
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,278
<i>It's now or never.</i>

275
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,480
<i>The fertilized eggs,</i>

276
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,354
<i>will now be swept away</i>

277
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,915
<i>from the many hungry mouths</i>
<i>of the reef dwellers.</i>

278
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,917
<i>Most of the billions of eggs</i>
<i>that cloud the sea,</i>

279
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,435
<i>will be eaten.</i>

280
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,715
<i>But a few,</i>

281
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,991
<i>a tiny but crucial minority,</i>

282
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,632
<i>will find another reef</i>

283
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,873
<i>and make it their home.</i>

284
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,720
<i>But today's coral reefs</i>
<i>are facing a new threat.</i>

285
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,791
<i>The seas are warming.</i>

286
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,234
<i>A rise in temperature</i>
<i>of just one for two degrees</i>

287
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,200
<i>for just a few weeks,</i>

288
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,472
<i>can be enough to cause the coral polyps</i>
<i>to eject their plant-like cells.</i>

289
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,280
<i>When that happens,</i>
<i>the corals lose both their colour,</i>

290
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,076
<i>and their main source of food.</i>

291
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,909
<i>If the high temperatures are sustained,</i>

292
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,030
<i>coral, bleached in this way,</i>

293
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,033
<i>is likely to die.</i>

294
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,753
<i>In recent years, it's thought that</i>
<i>half the world's coral reefs,</i>

295
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,872
<i>have been effected by bleaching,</i>

296
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,914
<i>including since 2016.</i>

297
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,437
<i>around two thirds</i>
<i>of the shallow water corals,</i>

298
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,035
<i>on Australia's Great Barrier Reef.</i>

299
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,832
<i>These once crowded submarine cities,</i>

300
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,950
<i>are reduced</i>

301
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,000
<i>to bleak ruins.</i>

302
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,757
<i>and many of their inhabitants,</i>
<i>left homeless.</i>

303
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,554
<i>Some scientists predict</i>
<i>that by the end of the century,</i>

304
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,037
<i>coral reef cities as we know them,</i>

305
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,077
<i>could be a thing of the past.</i>

306
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,430
<i>Is there any future for these most</i>
<i>precious of ocean treasures?</i>

307
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,552
<i>Well, that ultimately depends</i>
<i>on how fast they heat up,</i>

308
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,071
<i>and how warm the seas become.</i>

309
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,913
<i>And there is a glimmer of hope,</i>

310
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,109
<i>because of the way</i>
<i>the corals reproduce themselves.</i>

311
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,031
<i>On one special night of the year,</i>

312
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,680
<i>the full moon triggers</i>
<i>an extraordinary event:</i>

313
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,240
<i>The spawning of the coral.</i>

314
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,072
<i>With extraordinary synchrony,</i>
<i>entire reefs reproduce.</i>

315
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,193
<i>Billions of fertilized eggs drift away</i>

316
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,471
<i>carried by the ocean currents.</i>

317
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,237
<i>And it's not just the corals that spawn,</i>

318
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,358
<i>so do many other residents of the reef.</i>

319
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,957
<i>A whole range of young</i>

320
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,197
<i>are swept through the oceans,</i>

321
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,634
<i>ready to settle on a vacant site,</i>

322
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,556
<i>and bring back into existence</i>
<i>the complex community,</i>

323
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,037
<i>that is a coral reef.</i>

324
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,714
<i>We may not know what the future</i>
<i>hold for our seas,</i>

325
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,554
<i>but coral reefs can regenerate.</i>

326
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,875
<i>As long as some reefs survive,</i>

327
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,160
<i>some hope can remain.</i>

328
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,320
<i>French Polynesia.</i>

329
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,075
<i>Over 4,000 miles from the nearest</i>
<i>major land mass.</i>

330
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,198
<i>Protected from fishing pressures,</i>

331
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,479
<i>it's home to perhaps the last great</i>
<i>gathering of marbled groupers.</i>

332
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,430
We're finally here.

333
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,119
It's taken quite a few days.

334
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,438
We can't actually say where "here" is,

335
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,276
because uh, we've been asked
not to mention the exact spot,

336
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,392
because it's a protected area.

337
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,355
<i>The team face</i>
<i>a huge filming challenge</i>

338
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,199
<i>as the groupers</i>
<i>normally spawn just once a year,</i>

339
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,556
<i>and it lasts less than an hour.</i>

340
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,389
<i>The team's advisor is biologist,</i>
<i>Yvonne Sadovy who's been</i>

341
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,036
<i>studying fish spawning aggregations</i>
<i>for over 30 years.</i>

342
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,712
Here, it is close
to the situation it has been

343
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,035
for thousands of years.

344
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,035
It's pretty much the only place
on the planet that I'm aware of

345
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,320
where these groupers come together
in the numbers that we see here.

346
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,319
I really hope that they're there

347
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,040
because if they're not, then we've come
all this way for nothing.

348
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,760
We've got our timing right,
haven't we Denis?

349
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,830
Yes.

350
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,714
- Confident?
- Yeah.

351
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,313
<i>They're not disappointed.</i>

352
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,750
<i>Denis has filmed groupers</i>
<i>gathering here for 15 years</i>

353
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,758
<i>and has got to know their behaviour.</i>

354
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,640
<i>The grouper aren't the only ones</i>
<i>to be gathering.</i>

355
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,715
<i>It's the highest density</i>
<i>of grey reef sharks</i>

356
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,234
<i>anywhere on the planet.</i>

357
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,229
This is what a pristine reef
should look like.

358
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,194
Lots and lots of predators.

359
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,912
<i>With the groupers here,</i>
<i>now the challenge is predicting</i>

360
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,992
<i>exactly when they'll spawn.</i>

361
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,880
<i>To judge if they're close,</i>
<i>Yvonne reviews the day's footage.</i>

362
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,116
From what we've seen here,
the male's courting the female.

363
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,113
When you can slow these things down,

364
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,596
this is when you begin to see
some of this detail.

365
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,837
If you were a betting woman
would you bet on tomorrow?

366
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,031
I would say tomorrow or the next day.

367
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,754
I mean I think they're pretty close.

368
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,279
<i>With only six divers, the team</i>
<i>can't stay underwater all the time.</i>

369
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,512
<i>So, based on experience,</i>

370
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,037
<i>they decide to dive</i>
<i>on the full moon's changing tides,</i>

371
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,999
<i>thought to help coordinate</i>
<i>grouper spawning.</i>

372
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,477
<i>But this year,</i>
<i>the strongest tidal change is at night.</i>

373
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,034
We're just kitting up
for the first night dive.

374
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,438
During the day, we've been seeing sharks
around this area, but we don't know

375
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,954
how they're going to react at night.

376
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,196
Are you nervous?

377
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,752
<i>Reef sharks hunt at night,</i>

378
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,153
<i>so the divers wear chain-mail suits</i>
<i>and helmets as a precaution.</i>

379
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,272
One, two, three, four.

380
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,394
Divers comms check, comms check.

381
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,474
Receiving you loud and clear.

382
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,672
<i>No sign of groupers spawning,</i>
<i>but in the dark,</i>

383
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,877
<i>the shark's attitude has changed.</i>

384
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,550
<i>They're hunting.</i>

385
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,756
<i>Using electro-reception to hunt,</i>

386
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:35,199
<i>sharks are tuned to even the smallest</i>
<i>electro stimulus including the cameras.</i>

387
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,640
<i>With the current building,</i>

388
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,193
<i>now is the worst possible time</i>
<i>to lose contact with the surface.</i>

389
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,480
We're in the middle of nowhere.
We have no idea what's going on

390
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,155
down there. All we can hear
is broken communication.

391
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,671
<i>With no sign of spawning,</i>
<i>they end the dive.</i>

392
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,390
Phew!

393
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,791
<i>The team decide</i>
<i>to save their energy</i>

394
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,872
<i>for the next change of the tide.</i>

395
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,158
<i>At dawn, they prepare</i>
<i>for what they hope will be</i>

396
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,835
<i>the spawning event they've</i>
<i>all been waiting for.</i>

397
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,717
Bad news, we still are...

398
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,950
<i>But after just 20 minutes,</i>
<i>the divers are back on the surface</i>

399
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,476
<i>with some devastating news</i>
<i>for their crew.</i>

400
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,870
We missed it.

401
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,118
Maybe they spawned last night.

402
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,870
I don't... Oh, God, I don't know.

403
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,874
<i>The team were too late.</i>

404
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,316
So my guess would be that
we've missed spawning by a few hours.

405
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,155
And possibly,
it's that theyjust reached some

406
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,078
kind of critical mass
or critical density

407
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,753
and spawned a little bit early.

408
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,516
<i>The following year,</i>
<i>Yvonne returns to French Polynesia,</i>

409
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,235
<i>hoping to learn more about the grouper.</i>

410
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,317
<i>This year, Laurent Ballesta</i>
<i>and his experienced crew,</i>

411
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,880
<i>take on the challenge.</i>

412
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,000
<i>With many more divers,</i>
<i>they have a new approach</i>

413
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,399
<i>and they plan to have Laurent on watch</i>
<i>in the water constantly.</i>

414
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,718
<i>And this year, after hundreds</i>
<i>of hours of continual monitoring,</i>

415
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,319
<i>they have captured the defining moment</i>
<i>of this astonishing event -</i>

416
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,236
<i>the mass spawning of the grouper.</i>

417
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,953
We have the privilege
to be able to watch this process

418
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,231
actually occurring.
Uh, and that's a real thrill.

419
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,474
They're really important
for the biology of the animals.

420
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,317
<i>Thanks to a combined</i>
<i>team effort from both crews</i>

421
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,671
<i>and Yvonne's research over many years,</i>

422
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,840
<i>we could at last, tell</i>
<i>the marbled groupers' incredible story.</i>

423
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,075
<i>Next time, we head</i>
<i>into the vastness of the open ocean.</i>

424
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,914
<i>To survive in this blue wilderness,</i>
<i>some are fast,</i>

425
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,991
<i>others use deadly strategies,</i>

426
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,200
<i>and a few rely on the closeness</i>
<i>of their families.</i>
