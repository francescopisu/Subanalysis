1
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,685
TYSON:
<i>We were born into</i> a <i>mystery...</i>

2
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,823
<i>...one that has haunted us since
at least as long as we've been human.</i>

3
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:54,165
<i>We awakened on this tiny world
beneath a blanket of stars...</i>

4
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,625
<i>...like an abandoned baby
left on a doorstep...</i>

5
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:02,665
<i>...without</i> a <i>note to explain
where we came from, who we</i> are...

6
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,964
<i>...how our universe came to be...</i>

7
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,381
<i>...and with no idea
how to end our cosmic isolation.</i>

8
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:15,227
<i>We've had to figure it
all out for ourselves.</i>

9
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,227
Best thing we had going for us
was our intelligence...

10
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,943
...especially our gift for
pattern recognition...

11
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,233
...sharpened over eons of evolution.

12
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,071
The ones who were good
at spotting prey and predator...

13
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,955
...telling poisonous plants
from the nourishing ones...

14
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,163
...had a better chance
to live and reproduce.

15
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,751
They survived and passed on those genes
for pattern recognition...

16
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,915
...with its obvious advantages.

17
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:49,880
<i>Cultures all over the planet
looked up at the same stars...</i>

18
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,470
<i>...and found different pictures there.</i>

19
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,566
We used this gift
for recognizing patterns in nature...

20
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,978
...to read the calendar in the sky.

21
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,401
<i>The messages written in the stars
told our forefathers and mothers...</i>

22
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,491
<i>...when to camp and when to move on...</i>

23
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:19,124
<i>...when the migratory herds and when
the rains and the cold would come...</i>

24
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,410
<i>...and when they would cease for a time.</i>

25
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,796
<i>When they observed the connection
between the motions of the stars...</i>

26
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,083
<i>...and the seasonal cycles
of life on Earth...</i>

27
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,549
<i>...they concluded, naturally,
that what happens up there...</i>

28
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,385
<i>...must be directed at us down here.</i>

29
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,015
<i>It makes sense, right?</i>

30
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:39,428
<i>If the sky was a calendar and somebody
stuck a Post-it note on top of it...</i>

31
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,939
<i>...what else could it be but a message?</i>

32
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,314
<i>And so when the heavenly order
was suddenly violated...</i>

33
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:51,403
...by the apparition of a comet in the sky,
they took it personally.

34
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,317
Can we really blame them?

35
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,488
Back then, they had no other logical
explanation for what was happening.

36
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,578
This was long before
anyone had yet to imagine Earth...

37
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,666
...as a spinning planet with a tilted axis,
revolving around the sun.

38
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:08,583
Every ancient human culture
made the same mistake:

39
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:13,505
The comet must be a message
sent by the gods, or one particular god.

40
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:20,679
And almost invariably our ancestors
concluded the news was not good.

41
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:27,853
<i>It didn't matter if you were an ancient
Aztec, Anglo-Saxon, Babylonian, Hindu.</i>

42
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,485
<i>Comets were portents of doom.</i>

43
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:37,198
<i>The only difference among them was the
precise nature of the coming disaster.</i>

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,116
<i>"Disaster," as in the
Greek word for "bad star."</i>

45
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,707
<i>To the Masai of East Africa,
a comet meant famine.</i>

46
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,748
<i>To the Zulu in the south, it meant war.</i>

47
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,384
<i>To the Eghap people of the west,
it meant disease.</i>

48
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:57,218
<i>To the Djaga of Zaire,
specifically smallpox.</i>

49
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,103
<i>To their neighbors, the Lube,</i>
a <i>comet foretold the death of</i> a <i>leader.</i>

50
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,891
<i>The ancient Chinese
were remarkably systematic.</i>

51
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,568
<i>Starting in roughly 1400</i> BC...

52
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,857
<i>...they began recording and cataloging
the apparitions of comets.</i>

53
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,277
<i>A three-tailed comet
meant calamity for the state.</i>

54
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:22,493
<i>A four-tailed comet
signified an epidemic was coming.</i>

55
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,786
<i>The human talent for pattern recognition
is a two-edged sword.</i>

56
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:32,083
<i>We're especially good at finding patterns
even when they aren't really there...</i>

57
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,220
<i>...something known as
"false pattern recognition."</i>

58
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,008
We hunger for significance...

59
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:46,772
...for signs that our personal existence
is of special meaning to the universe.

60
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:53,063
To that end, we're all too eager
to deceive ourselves and others...

61
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,277
...to discern a sacred image
in a grilled cheese sandwich...

62
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,613
...or find a divine warning in a comet.

63
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,279
Today we know exactly
where comets come from...

64
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,948
...and what they're made of.

65
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,418
<i>TYSON".
Our Ship of the Imagination...</i>

66
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:13,128
<i>...fueled by equal parts
of science and wonder...</i>

67
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,090
<i>...can take us anywhere in space and time.</i>

68
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,925
<i>It can travel faster than light...</i>

69
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,808
<i>...and render visible those things
that cannot be seen.</i>

70
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:28,689
<i>It's carrying us to a mysterious realm
that lies one light-year from the sun.</i>

71
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,145
<i>What is this swarm of worlds?</i>

72
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,652
<i>Was it organized by alien beings?</i>

73
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,438
<i>No, just gravity.</i>

74
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,983
These are the snows of yesteryear.

75
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,948
Drifting mountains of ice and rock.

76
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,989
The preserved remnants
of the birth of the solar system.

77
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,534
It's called the Oort
cloud, after Jan Oort...

78
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,251
...the Dutch astronomer who
foretold its existence back in 1950.

79
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,586
He was trying to solve a paradox.

80
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,003
There's so many ways for comets to die.

81
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,515
Because they cross the orbits of planets,
comets frequently collide with them.

82
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,307
Comets are largely made of ice,
so every time they come near the sun...

83
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,474
<i>...they lose a part of themselves
through evaporation.</i>

84
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,816
<i>And after several thousand trips,
their ice is all gone...</i>

85
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,696
...and what remains of the comet
is now an asteroid.

86
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,825
Comets can be gravitationally
ejected from the solar system...

87
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,576
...and exiled into space.

88
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,660
And yet somehow the comets keep coming.

89
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:32,043
Oort and other astronomers wondered,
"Where do all the comets come from?"

90
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,291
<i>Oort calculated the rate
at which new comets appear...</i>

91
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,507
<i>...and concluded that there must
be a vast spherical swarm of them...</i>

92
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,766
<i>...a few light-years across,
surrounding the sun.</i>

93
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,892
Oort's logic still holds up...

94
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,807
...even after all the discoveries
we've made about comets...

95
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,648
...and the solar system
in the many decades since.

96
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:02,533
And yet the Oort cloud is a sight
that no one has ever seen.

97
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,945
Nor could we. It's dark out here.

98
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,115
And each comet is about as far
from its closest neighbor...

99
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,157
...as the Earth is from Saturn.

100
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,578
But science gives us
special powers of our own.

101
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,339
It gave Jan Oort the gift of prophecy.

102
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,047
Oort was also the first
to correctly estimate...

103
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,258
...the distance between the sun
and the center of our galaxy.

104
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,596
That's a big deal, finding out
where we are in the Milky Way.

105
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:33,104
<i>Our star is about
30,000 light-years from the center.</i>

106
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,937
Oort was also the first guy
to use a radio telescope...

107
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,397
...to map the galaxy's spiral structure.

108
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:44,859
<i>And he discovered that the center of our
galaxy was a place of titanic explosions...</i>

109
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,374
...the first indication
that there might have

110
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:49,747
been a supermassive black
hole lurking there.

111
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,953
Does the fact that most of us know
the names of mass murderers...

112
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:57,747
...but have never heard of Jan Oort,
say anything about us?

113
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,974
<i>The Oort cloud is so enormous...</i>

114
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,102
...that <i>it takes one of its comets
about</i> a <i>million years...</i>

115
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,935
<i>...to complete a single
trip around the sun.</i>

116
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,602
<i>Out here at the far edge
of the solar system...</i>

117
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,864
<i>...even a little tug from
the gravity of a passing star...</i>

118
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:29,370
<i>...can liberate some of these comets from
their gravitational bondage to the sun.</i>

119
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:37,001
Some comets are flung out of the solar
system to wander interstellar space.

120
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,790
But for others there's a different fate.

121
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,850
<i>This one is plunging towards the sun,
gaining speed in an unbroken free fall...</i>

122
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,262
<i>...that lasts hundreds
of thousands of years.</i>

123
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:02,024
<i>When Neptune's gravity gives it another
tug, there's a small change in course.</i>

124
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:06,235
Mighty Jupiter, the most massive object
in our solar system other than the sun...

125
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,742
...attracts the comet
with its powerful gravitational pull...

126
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,370
...bending its path.

127
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,544
<i>When our comet reaches
the inner solar system...</i>

128
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,625
<i>...heat from the sun bakes it.</i>

129
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,594
<i>A beautiful transformation begins.</i>

130
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,062
<i>The barren, sooty iceberg
now sports a glowing halo...</i>

131
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,893
<i>...and a tail.</i>

132
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,703
These layers tell the story
of how the comet was made...

133
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,991
...some 4 billion years ago.

134
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,256
<i>During the 40,000
generations of humanity...</i>

135
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:09,716
<i>...there must have been roughly
100,000 apparitions of a bright comet.</i>

136
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:15,593
<i>For all that time, the best we could do
was look up in helpless wonder...</i>

137
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,932
<i>...prisoners of Earth with nowhere to turn
for an explanation...</i>

138
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,019
<i>...beyond our guilt and our fears.</i>

139
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,106
But then a friendship began
between two men...

140
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,149
...that led to a permanent revolution
in human thought.

141
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,244
<i>Isaac Newton and Edmond Halley
could not know</i> it...

142
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,781
<i>...but their collaboration
would ultimately set us free...</i>

143
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:42,623
<i>...from our long confinement
on this tiny world.</i>

144
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,714
<i>TYSON: The comet of 1664
sent shivers of dread throughout Europe.</i>

145
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,099
<i>And the terror seemed justified...</i>

146
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,978
<i>...when the plague and the Great
Fire of London followed soon after.</i>

147
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,683
<i>WOMAN:
There, with long bloody hair...</i>

148
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,524
<i>...a blazing star threatens the world...</i>

149
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:13,658
<i>...with famine, plague and war.</i>

150
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,699
<i>To princes, it spells death.</i>

151
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,450
<i>To kingdoms, many crosses.</i>

152
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,999
<i>To all estates, inevitable losses.</i>

153
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,839
<i>To herdsmen, rot.</i>

154
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,501
<i>To plowmen, hapless seasons.</i>

155
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,089
<i>To sailors, it brings storms.</i>

156
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:41,682
<i>To cities, civil treasons.</i>

157
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,814
<i>TYSON".
But for one child...</i>

158
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,690
<i>...the comet was not the
least bit frightening.</i>

159
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,198
<i>For him, it was a thing of wonder.</i>

160
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:05,244
<i>Like all of us,
Edmond Halley was born curious.</i>

161
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,128
Hell's bells.

162
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,001
<i>TYSON: He was lucky to have</i> a <i>father who
encouraged and nurtured his curiosity...</i>

163
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,265
<i>...buying him the best

<i>and even funding
his expedition...</i>

165
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:20,221
<i>...to make the first accurate star map
of the Southern Hemisphere.</i>

166
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:24,229
<i>Halley dropped out of Oxford when he was 20
and sailed to St. Helena...</i>

167
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,311
<i>...an island below the equator,
off the west coast of Africa.</i>

168
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,074
Hell's bells.

169
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,406
<i>TYSON: Problem was, nobody told Halley
that the weather on St. Helena...</i>

170
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:43,369
...was <i>generally lousy.
It took him 12 frustrating months...</i>

171
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:48,082
<i>...to observe enough southern stars
to make a complete map.</i>

172
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,964
<i>The gods and heroes of ancient Greece...</i>

173
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:55,298
<i>...were now joined by the mythic figures
of a new world and age:</i>

174
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,387
a <i>toucan,</i> a <i>compass,</i> a <i>bird of paradise.</i>

175
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,934
When Halley came home
with the other half of the sky...

176
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,228
...his map created a sensation.

177
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,193
Now merchants and explorers
could navigate by the stars...

178
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,074
...visible anywhere on Earth.

179
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,451
At the time,
the Royal Society of London...

180
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,363
...was the world's clearinghouse
of scientific discovery.

181
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,911
Its motto, "Nullius in verba,"
sums up the heart of the scientific method.

182
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,921
It's Latin for "see for yourself."

183
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,584
In other words, question authority.

184
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,800
Halley's star maps caught the attention
of the Society's curator of experiments.

185
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,226
I'd show him to you if I
could, but no portrait

186
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:44,513

from his time...

187
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,303
...only the verbal descriptions
of his contemporaries.

188
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,644
They called him "lean, bent, ugly."

189
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,981
He was possibly the most
inventive person who ever lived.

190
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,899
And despite his appearance, he was the most
sought-after party guest in all of London.

191
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:05,823
Why? Hooke's insatiable curiosity
encompassed absolutely everything.

192
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,743
<i>Hooke discovered a little cosmos...</i>

193
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,164
<i>...and we still call it
by the name he gave it: the cell.</i>

194
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,429
<i>Hooke discovered the
cell by looking at a</i>

of his own inventions:</i>

196
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,336
<i>the compound microscope.</i>

197
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:26,765
<i>He anticipated aspects of Darwin's
theory of evolution by almost 200 years.</i>

198
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,849
<i>Hooke also improved the telescope.</i>

199
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,890
<i>The drawings he made of the
astronomical bodies he observed...</i>

<i>...attest to his uncanny precision.</i>

201
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,530
<i>After the Great Fire
destroyed central London in</i> 1666...

202
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,316
<i>...Hooke partnered with the architect
Christopher Wren...</i>

203
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,155
<i>...to redesign and rebuild the city.</i>

204
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:48,031
<i>Hooke was the foremost
experimentalist of his age.</i>

205
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,576
<i>Using coiled springs,
he derived the law of elasticity...</i>

206
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,461
<i>...known today as Hooke's law.</i>

207
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,500
<i>He perfected the air pump,
the height of technology in its time...</i>

208
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,512
<i>...and used it to experiment
on respiration and sound.</i>

209
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,423
<i>And he experimented with cannabis.</i>

210
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,843
<i>He reported to a meeting
of the Royal Society...</i>

211
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,765
<i>...that a sea captain friend of his, quote,
"had so often experimented with it...</i>

212
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:18,482
<i>...that there is no cause of fear,
though possibly there may be of laughter."</i>

213
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,361
But coffee was the drug of choice
for England in the 17th century.

214
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,121

all over London.

[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

216
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,761
This is where people came to get news...

217
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,764
...to launch new ventures,
and to debate ideas.

218
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:52,763
The coffeehouse was an oasis of equality
in a class-obsessed society.

219
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:58,063
Here a poor man needn't give up his seat
to a rich man, nor submit to his opinion.

220
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,604
It was a kind of laboratory of democracy.

221
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,277
In this highly caffeinated atmosphere...

222
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:08,662
...Halley and Hooke met Christopher Wren
to discuss a deep mystery:

223
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,823
Why do the planets move as they do?

224
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,539
The astronomer Johannes Kepler
had demonstrated some 80 years before...

225
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,421
<i>...that the orbits of the planets
around the sun...</i>

226
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,753
<i>...were not perfect circles,
but actually ellipses...</i>

227
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:27,764
<i>...and that the closer a planet
was to the sun, the faster it moved.</i>

228
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,456
Why? Could some invisible
force from the sun

229
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,221
be responsible for
this change in motion?

230
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,264
If so, how did it work?

231
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,309
Could there be a simple
mathematical law to describe it?

232
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:43,230
Maybe something like
Hooke's law of elasticity?

233
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,492
<i>Perhaps.</i>

234
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,872
<i>But try as he might,
Christopher Wren couldn't figure it out.</i>

235
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,783
Damned if I haven't tried. It's beyond me.

236
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,329
I'll wager a book worth 40 shillings
to the man who can solve it.

237
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,999
HOOKE: That book is mine, Mr. Wren.
I've already done the calculation.

239
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,964
Show us, Mr. Hooke.

240
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,472

and Hooke failed to deliver.</i>

241
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,348
<i>He couldn't do the math.</i>

242
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,633
<i>None of them could.</i>

243
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,724
<i>Finally Halley had enough
of Hooke's excuses.</i>

244
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:20,642
<i>Halley knew there must be someone,
somewhere, up to the challenge.</i>

245
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,200
What about that mathematician
at Cambridge?

246
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,702
He was a clever fellow.

247
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,456
He had solved central questions
about the nature of light years before...

248
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,709
...when he was still only 22.

249
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,370
And he invented the reflecting telescope.

00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,710

Went completely to pieces over it, has
been hiding out in Cambridge ever since.

253
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,803
Halley wondered if this strange and, by all
accounts, exceedingly difficult man...

254
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,972
...might succeed where Hooke
and others had failed.

255
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,859
What he couldn't know, what no one
could possibly imagine at the time...

would be forever changed by this meeting...

<i>Newton's refuge

Yes, I understand, sir.

But the thing is, we've been debating
the puzzling question of planetary motion.

302

We all agree that some
force of attraction from

the sun governs the
motions of the planets.

304
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,979
We suspect there must be
a mathematical law...

305
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,740
...to describe how this force
changes with distance.

306
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,242
And knowing of your skill--

307
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:44,122
Yes, yes, the attraction of gravity
weakens with the square of the distance.

308
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,624
That's why the planets move in ellipses.

309
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,285
But, sir, how can you know this?

310
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,204
Why, I have calculated it
some five years ago.

Well, no matter. I shall redo it
and be sure to send it on to you.

325
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,594
Mr. Newton,
I beseech you to work all of this

326
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,979

327
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,482

329
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:01,024
We are in agreement that Mr. Newton
has produced a masterpiece.

330
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,694
However, I'm afraid
the Royal Society has...

331
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,831
Well, regrettably,
sales for the History of Fish...

332
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,539

336
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,219
The disappointing sales
led to a bigger problem.

337
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:32,024
The Royal Society pretty
much blew its total

338

annual budget on the

339
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,442
In fact, they were so strapped for cash...

340
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:42,402
...they had to pay poor Halley's salary
with copies of their worst-selling book.

341

<i>With no money to print

345

<i>Everything depended
on whether or not Edmond Halley...</i>

350

<i>...could get Newton's book
out to the wider world.</i>

351
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,527
<i>Halley resolved not only
to edit Newton's book...</i>

352
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,442
<i>...but to publish it at his own expense.</i>

353
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,077
<i>Newton completed the first two volumes...</i>

354
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:33,207
<i>...laying the mathematical framework
for the physics of motion.</i>

355
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,836
<i>The third volume would settle once and
for all who won the coffeehouse wager.</i>

356

all the known motions of the Earth...</i>

358
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,964
Unfortunately, there was this problem.

359

Now Halley also took on the role
of Newton's psychotherapist.

360

What's the big deal?

389
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:54,932
When Isaac Newton was born in this house
in 1642, the world was very different.

00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:09,272
There was only one way such a thing
could come about in their imagination.

395
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,533
Only one answer for them: God.

396
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,663
For reasons beyond our understanding,
God just created the solar system that way.

397
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,950
But this explanation is
the closing of a door.

00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,960
It doesn't lead to other questions.

He could write the laws of nature
in perfect mathematical sentences.

00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,383
<i>...rising and falling
like merry-go-round horses...</i>

489
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,350
<i>...in their Newtonian dance
around the center of our galaxy.</i>

490
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:44,568
<i>And, oh, yes, there was that thing
about the comet.</i>

491
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,908
What were those strange
and beautiful celestial visitors...

492
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,741
...that appeared without warning
from time to time?

493
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,077
Halley set out to solve this mystery
as a detective would...

494
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,833
...by gathering
all credible eyewitness testimony.

495
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,747
The earliest precise observations
of a comet that Halley could find...

496
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,508
...were made in Constantinople
by Nicephorus Gregoras...

497
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,888
...a Byzantine astronomer and monk,
in June 1337.

498
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,846
Halley hunted down every
astronomical observation of a comet...

499
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:22,686
...recorded in Europe
between 1472 and 1698.

500
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,943
And remember, there was no such thing
as a search engine or a computer.

501
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,606
All Halley had were his books and his mind.

502
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,115
Now here comes the hard part:

503
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,368
Halley had to take the observations
made for each comet...

504
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,952
...and find the shape
of its actual path through space.

505
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,208
No one else but Newton
had yet attempted...

506
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,586
...to apply his new set of laws
to an astronomical question.

507
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:48,089
In an arduous tour de force
of mathematical brilliance...

508
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:54,802
...Halley discovered that comets were bound
to the sun in long elliptical orbits.

509
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,059
And he was the first to know
that the comets seen in 1531

510
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,986
...1607, and 1682...

511
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,771
...were one and the same.

512
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,157
A single comet that
returned every 76 years.

513
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,819
In a stunning example
of true pattern recognition...

514
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:22,116
...he predicted it would be seen again
more than 5O years in the future.

515
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,587
<i>For millennia,
comets had been props for mystics...</i>

516
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:31,876
<i>...who considered them to be
merely omens of human events.</i>

517
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:36,387
Halley shattered their monopoly,
beating them at their own game.

518
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:40,016
A game that no scientist
had ever played before:

519
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,269
<i>prophecy .</i>

520
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,179
And he did not hedge his bet.

521
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:48,020
Like Babe Ruth predicting where his next
home run would land in the stands...

522
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:53,280
...Halley stated flatly that the comet
would return at the end of 1758...

523
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:58,490
...from a particular part of the sky,
following a specific path.

524
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,154
There is hardly a prophecy
attempted by the mystics...

525
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:05,417
...that ever even strives
for comparable precision.

526
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,182
That's Halley's Comet.

527
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,477
Out here at the edge of the solar system,
it doesn't look like much.

528
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,863
Just a big hunk of ice and rock in space.

529
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:39,618
That's because beyond the orbit of Neptune,
nearly 5 billion kilometers from the sun...

530
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,870
...comets lead very quiet lives.

531
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,825
As it reaches the far end of its orbit...

532
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,586
...it'll slow down
till the sun allows it to go no farther.

533
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:55,592
Then it'll begin its long fall
back to the inner solar system.

534
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:59,088
Halley's Comet is in free fall
around the sun.

535
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,801
Everything in our solar system...

536
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:04,434
...the Earth, the moon,
the other planets, comets, asteroids...

537
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,596
...all of them are falling around the sun.

538
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:12,518
Gravity pulls the planets towards the sun,
but because of their orbital momentum...

539
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:17,565
...they keep moving around the sun,
never falling into it.

540
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,618
<i>Robert Hooke had died years before, having
ruined his health with some bad habits:</i>

541
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,830
<i>daily doses of wormwood, opium, mercury.</i>

542
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,507
<i>A few months later,
Newton was elected to</i>

543
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,045
<i>replace him as president
of the Royal Society.</i>

544
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:40,713
<i>It is said that a portrait of Hooke
once hung on these walls.</i>

545
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,929
<i>Halley lived on to accomplish
many more astonishing feats.</i>

546
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,312
<i>He worked right up to his death at age 85.</i>

547
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,646
<i>His final act was to call
for a glass of wine.</i>

548
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:58,109
<i>He downed it with pleasure
and breathed his last breath.</i>

549
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,648
[GLASS SHATTERS]

550
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,997
TYSON: <i>Some believe that it
was on</i> a <i>night like this...</i>

551
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:11,831
<i>...that Isaac Newton finally took
his revenge against Robert Hooke.</i>

552
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,839
<i>Heh.</i>

553
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,344
<i>TYSON".
But Halley's prophecy was not forgotten.</i>

554
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,185
Fifty years later, as the time
of the predicted return approached...

555
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:37,819
...the world's astronomers vied to be
the first to catch sight of his comet.

556
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,775
They weren't disappointed.

557
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:43,693
It's been welcomed back
every 76 years since.

558
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,354
<i>When Halley's Comet
returns to our skies,</i>

559
00:40:47,366 --> 00:40:50,040
<i>sunlight will warm up the
ice on its surface...</i>

560
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:56,422
<i>...once again setting loose
the dust and gases trapped within.</i>

561
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:03,258
<i>Halley's Comet most recently
visited our neighborhood back in 1986.</i>

562
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:09,643
<i>And if you're seeing this in 2061,
then you'll know it's back.</i>

563
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:15,353
<i>May you feel the wonder of all those
who came before you...</i>

564
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,358
<i>...and none of the fear.</i>

565
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,820
<i>Newton's laws made it possible
for Edmond Halley...</i>

566
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:26,736
<i>...to see some 50 years into the future
and predict the behavior of a single comet.</i>

567
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,531
<i>Scientists have been using
these laws ever since...</i>

568
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:35,419
<i>...opening the way to the moon,
and even beyond our solar system.</i>

569
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:39,922
<i>The baby in the basket
is learning to walk...</i>

570
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,843
<i>...and to know the cosmos.</i>

571
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:55,188
Which brings me to one last prophecy.

572
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,475
Using nothing more
than Newton's laws of gravitation...

573
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:03,147
...we astronomers can confidently predict
that several billion years from now...

574
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,940
...our home galaxy, the Milky Way...

575
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:10,829
<i>...will merge with our neighboring
galaxy Andromeda.</i>

576
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:15,952
<i>Because the distances between the stars
are so great compared to their sizes...</i>

577
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:20,463
<i>...few if any stars
in either galaxy will actually collide.</i>

578
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,501
<i>Any life on the worlds
of that far-off future should be safe...</i>

579
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:29,798
<i>...but they would be treated to an amazing,
billion-year-long light show...</i>

580
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,186
<i>...a dance of a half a trillion stars...</i>

581
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,978
<i>...to music first heard
on one little world...</i>

582
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,236
<i>...by a man who had but one true friend.</i>
