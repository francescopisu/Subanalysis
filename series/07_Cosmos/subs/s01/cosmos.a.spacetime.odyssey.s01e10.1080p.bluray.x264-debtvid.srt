343
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,538
As a young man,
Faraday had risen from poverty...

344
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,047
...in one of the most
class-conscious societies...

345
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,049
...the world has ever known...

346
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:10,384
...to become the most celebrated
scientist of his time.

347
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,798
By age 40...

348
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:16,219
...he had invented the electric motor,
the transformer, the generator.

349
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:21,892
Machines that would change everything
about the home, the farm, the factory.

00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,230
Now at 60...

351

...decades after the fertile periods
of the greatest physicists...

352
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,404
...plagued by memory loss
and melancholy...

353
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:37,700
...he fearlessly probed deeper
into the mysterious invisible forces.

354
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,761
The world thought
that Michael Faraday was a has-been.

355

Despite his depression...

356
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,941
...he remained
as passionately curious as ever.

357
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,229
Having discovered the unity of electricity,
magnetism and light...

358
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,942

And as Faraday showed us,
electric currents produce magnetic fields.

And that's a good thing.
