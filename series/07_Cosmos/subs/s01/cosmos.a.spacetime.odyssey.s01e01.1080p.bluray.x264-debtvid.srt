TYSON: A generation ago, the astronomer
Carl Sagan stood here...

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,946
...and launched hundreds of millions of us
on a great adventure.

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:25,234
The exploration of the universe
revealed by science.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,528
It's time to get going again.

7
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,248
We're about to begin a journey
that will take us...

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,750
...from the infinitesimal
to the infinite...

9
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:36,628
...from the dawn of time
to the distant future.

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:40,462
<i>We'll explore galaxies
and suns and worlds...</i>

11
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,969
<i>...surf the gravity waves of space-time...</i>

12
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,381
<i>...encounter beings that
live in fire and ice...</i>

13
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,143
<i>...explore the planets of
stars that never die...</i>

14
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,770
<i>...discover atoms as massive as suns...</i>

15
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:57,524
<i>...and universes smaller than atoms.</i>

16
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,070
Cosmos <i>is also</i> a <i>story about us.</i>

17
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:05,157
<i>It's the saga of how wandering bands
of hunters and gatherers...</i>

18
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,990
<i>...found their way to the stars.</i>

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,665
<i>One adventure with many heroes.</i>

20
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,178
To make this journey,
we'll need imagination.

21
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,384
But imagination alone is not enough...

22
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,676
...because the reality of nature
is far more wondrous...

23
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,810
...than anything we can imagine.

24
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,603
This adventure is made possible
by generations of searchers...

25
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,523
...strictly adhering to
a simple set of rules:

26
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,364
Test ideas by experiment and observation.

27
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:54,498
Build on those ideas that pass the test.
Reject the ones that fail.

28
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,205
Follow the evidence wherever it leads...

29
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,745
...and question everything.

30
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:05,463
Accept these terms,
and the cosmos is yours.

31
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,264
Now come with me.

32
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,254
In this ship of the imagination...

33
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:11,761
...free from the shackles of space
and time, we can go anywhere.

34
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:17,015
If you want to see where we are in space,
just look out the front window.

35
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:25,854
In the dimension of time,
the past lies beneath us.

36
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:31,944
Here is what Earth looked like
250 million years ago.

37
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,199
If you wanna see the future, look up.

38

And this is how it could appear
250 million years from now.

39

If we're going to be venturing out
into the farthest reaches of the cosmos...

40
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,501
...we need to know our cosmic address.

41
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,170
And this is the first line of that address.

42
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,742

44

<i>...no ocean, no life.</i>

46

47

<i>Our star powers the wind and the waves...</i>

00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:34,616
The universe
is 13.8 thousand million years old.

334
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,327
In order to imagine all of cosmic time...

335
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,289
...let's compress it
into a single calendar year.

336
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:58,727
The cosmic calendar begins on January 1st
with the birth of our universe.

337
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:02,641
It contains everything that's happened
since then up to now...

338
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:07,061
...which on this calendar is midnight,
December 31 st.

339
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,152
On this scale, every month
represents about a billion years.

340
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:15,741
Every day represents
nearly 40 million years.

341
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,701
Let's go back as far as we can...

342
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,458
...to the very first
moment of the universe.

343
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:25,963
January 1st. The Big Bang.

344
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,976
<i>It's as far back as we can see in time.</i>

345
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,137
<i>For now.</i>

346
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,852
Our entire universe emerged
from a point smaller than a single atom.

347
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,862
Space itself exploded in a cosmic fire...

348
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,319
...launching the expansion
of the universe...

349
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:57,578
...and giving birth to all the energy
and all the matter we know today.

350
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,657
I know that sounds crazy, but there's
strong observational evidence...

351
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,496
...to support the Big Bang theory.

352
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,162
And it includes the amount of helium
in the cosmos...

353
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,673
...and the glow of radio waves
left over from the explosion.

354
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,459
As it expanded, the universe cooled...

355
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:16,676
...and there was darkness
for about 200 million years.

356
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,635
Gravity was pulling together
clumps of gas and heating them...

357
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:25,307
...until the first stars burst into light
on January 10th.

358
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:37,402
On January 13th, these stars coalesced
into the first small galaxies.

359
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,038
<i>These galaxies merged
to form still larger ones...</i>

360
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,167
<i>...including our own Milky Way...</i>

361
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,622
<i>...which formed about
11 billion years ago...</i>

362
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,042
<i>...on March 15 of the cosmic year.</i>

363
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,175
Hundreds of billions of suns.

364
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,055
Which one is ours?

365
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:04,846
It's not yet born.
It will rise from the ashes of other stars.

366
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,766
<i>See those lights flashing like paparazzi?</i>

367
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,230
<i>Each one is a supernova...</i>

368
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,112
<i>...the blazing death of a giant star.</i>

369
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,733
<i>Stars die and are born
in places like this one...</i>

370
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,446
<i>...a stellar nursery.</i>

371
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:24,035
<i>They condense like raindrops
from giant clouds of gas and dust.</i>

372
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:28,703
<i>They get so hot that the nuclei of the
atoms fuse together deep within them...</i>

373
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:32,965
<i>...to make the oxygen we breathe,
the carbon in our muscles...</i>

374
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,218
<i>...the calcium in our bones,
the iron in our blood.</i>

375
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:41,883
<i>All of it was cooked
in the fiery hearts of long-vanished stars.</i>

376
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:45,519
You, me, everyone.

377
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,682
We are made of star stuff.

378
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,985
<i>This star stuff is recycled and enriched...</i>

379
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:58,650
<i>...again and again,
through succeeding generations of stars.</i>

380
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,784
<i>How much longer until the birth
of our sun?</i>

381
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,448
<i>A long time.</i>

382
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:10,620
It won't begin to shine
for another six billion years.

383
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,297
<i>Our sun's birthday is August 31 st
on the cosmic calendar...</i>

384
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,797
<i>...four and a half billion years ago.</i>

385
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,679
As with the other worlds
of our solar system...

386
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,765
...Earth was formed
from a disk of gas and dust...

387
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,771
...orbiting the newborn sun.

388
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:34,276
Repeated collisions
produced a growing ball of debris.

389
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,322
<i>See that asteroid? No, not that one.</i>

390
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,236
<i>The one over there.</i>

391
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,124
<i>We exist because the gravity
of that one next to</i> it...

392
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,251
<i>...just nudged it an inch to the left.</i>

393
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,540
<i>What difference could an inch make
on the scale of the solar system?</i>

394
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,925
<i>Just wait, you'll see.</i>

395
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:04,181
<i>The Earth took one hell of a beating
in its first billion years.</i>

396
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,970
<i>Fragments of orbiting debris
collided and coalesced...</i>

397
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,516
<i>...until they snowballed to form our moon.</i>

398
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,111
<i>The moon is a souvenir
of that violent epoch.</i>

399
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,944
<i>If you stood on the surface
of that long ago Earth...</i>

400
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,859
<i>...the moon would have looked
a hundred times brighter.</i>

401
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,073
<i>It was ten times closer back then...</i>

402
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:30,366
<i>...locked in a much more intimate
gravitational embrace.</i>

403
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,706
<i>As the Earth cooled, seas began to form.</i>

404
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,418
<i>The tides
were a thousand times higher then.</i>

405
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:42,053
<i>Over the eons, tidal friction within
the Earth pushed the moon away.</i>

406
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:52,722
Life began somewhere around here,
September 21 st...

407
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,358
...three and a half billion years ago
on our little world.

408
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,518
We still don't know how life got started.

409
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:02,360
For all we know, it may have come
from another part of the Milky Way.

410
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,402
The origin of life is one of the greatest
unsolved mysteries of science.

411
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:14,793
That's life cooking,
evolving all the biochemical recipes...

412
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,251
<i>...for its incredibly complex activities.</i>

413
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,259
<i>By November 9th, life was breathing...</i>

414
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:28,015
<i>...moving, eating,
responding to its environment.</i>

415
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,177
<i>We owe a lot to those pioneering microbes.</i>

416
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,220
<i>Oh, yeah, one other thing.</i>

417
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,606
<i>They also invented sex.</i>

418
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,362
December 17th was quite a day.

419
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,273
Life in the sea really took off.

420
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,444
It was exploding with a diversity
of larger plants and animals.

421
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,615
Tiktaalik was one of the first animals
to venture onto land.

422
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,791
It must have felt like
visiting another planet.

423
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:05,131
Forests, dinosaurs, birds, insects...

424
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,464
...all evolved in the
final week of December.

425
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,428
The first flower...

426
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,645
...bloomed on December 28th.

427
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:23,024
As these ancient forests grew and died
and sank beneath the surface...

428
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,156
...their remains transformed into coal.

429
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,442
Three hundred million years later...

430
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,408
...we humans are burning most
of that coal to power...

431
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,790
...and imperil our civilization.

432
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:43,002
Remember that asteroid back
in the formation of the solar system?

433
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,258
The one that got nudged
a little to the left?

434
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,340
Well, here it comes.

437
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,571
For more than a hundred million years,
the dinosaurs were lords of the Earth...

438
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:10,200
...while our ancestors, small mammals,
scurried fearfully underfoot.

439
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,778
The asteroid changed all that.

440
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,665
Suppose it hadn't been nudged at all.
It would have missed the Earth entirely...

441
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,293
...and for all we know, the dinosaurs
might still be here, but we wouldn't.

442
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,376
This is a good example
of the extreme contingency...

443
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,007
...the chance nature of existence.

444
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,385
The universe is already more
than 13 and half billion years old.

445
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,050
Still no sign of us.

446
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,390
In the vast ocean of time
that this calendar represents...

447
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,397
...we humans only evolved
within the last hour...

All of recorded history occupies
only the last 14 seconds...

451
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:05,960
...and every person you've ever heard of
lived somewhere in there.

But if we want to explore
such a brief moment of cosmic time...

456
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,271
...we'll have to change scale.

...our ancestors, yours and mine,
left these traces.

Once we were standing on two feet...

464

...our eyes were no longer fixated
on the ground.

Now we were free to look up and wonder.

For the longest part of human existence,
say the last 40,000 generations...

467
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:32,759
...we were Wanderers, living in small bands
of hunters and gatherers...

...making tools, controlling fire,
naming things...

...all within the last hour
of the cosmic calendar.

<i>...there began a revolution
in the way we lived.</i>

to vanquish mortality.</i>

497
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,288
<i>It shook the world.</i>

498
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,541
<i>Moses was born seven seconds ago.</i>

499
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,203
<i>Buddha, six seconds ago.</i>

500
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,623
<i>Jesus, five seconds ago.</i>

501
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,134
<i>Mohammed, three seconds ago.</i>

502
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,968
<i>It was not even two seconds ago that,
for better or worse...</i>

503
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,804
<i>...the two halves of the Earth
discovered each other.</i>

504
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,968
<i>And it was only in the very last second...</i>

505
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:50,139
<i>...of the cosmic calendar
that we began to use science...</i>

506
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,434
<i>...to reveal nature's secrets and her laws.</i>

507
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,730
<i>The scientific method is so powerful
that in a mere four centuries...</i>

508
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,183
<i>...it has taken us from
Galileo's first look</i>

509
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:02,493
<i>through a telescope
at another world...</i>

510
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,449
<i>...to leaving our footprints on the moon.</i>

511
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:09,617
<i>It allowed us to look out
across space and time...</i>

512
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:14,288
<i>...to discover where
and when we are in the cosmos.</i>

513
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:19,293
<i>SAGAN:
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.</i>

514
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,962
Carl Sagan guided the maiden voyage
of Cosmos...

515
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,675
...a generation ago.

516
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,183
He was the most successful
science communicator of the 20th century...

517
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,845
...but he was first and
foremost a scientist.

518
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:35,601
<i>Carl contributed enormously
to our knowledge of the planets.</i>

519
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,737
<i>He correctly predicted
the existence of methane lakes...</i>

520
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,318
<i>...on Saturn's giant moon Titan.</i>

521
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,950
<i>He showed that the atmosphere
of the early Earth...</i>

522
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,861
<i>...must have contained
powerful greenhouse gases.</i>

523
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:51,079
<i>He was the first to understand
that seasonal changes on Mars...</i>

524
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,368
<i>...were due to windblown dust.</i>

525
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:57,289
<i>Carl was a pioneer in the search
for extraterrestrial life...</i>

526
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,298
<i>...and intelligence.</i>

527
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,631
<i>He played a leading role
in every major spacecraft mission...</i>

528
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:07,550
<i>...to explore the solar system
during the first 40 years of the Space Age.</i>

529
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,561
But that's not all he did.

530
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:18,485
This is Carl Sagan's
own calendar from 1975.

531
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,489
Who was I back then?

532
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,826
I was just a 17-year-old
kid from the Bronx...

533
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,908
...with dreams of becoming a scientist...

534
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,119
...and somehow the world's most
famous astronomer found time...

535
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,000
...to invite me to Ithaca,
in upstate New York...

536
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,706
...and spend a Saturday with him.

537
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,586
I remember that snowy day
like it was yesterday.

538
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,045
He met me at the bus stop...

539
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,428
...and showed me his laboratory
at Cornell University.

540
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:50,217
Carl reached behind his desk
and inscribed this book for me.

541
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:57,353
"For Neil, a future astronomer. Carl."

542
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,231
At the end of the day,
he drove me back to the bus station.

543
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,896
The snow was falling harder.

544
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,407
He wrote his phone number, his home
phone number, on a scrap of paper...

545
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,819
...and he said, "if the
bus can't get through...

546
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:13,035
...call me and spend the night at my home
with my family."

547
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,450
I already knew
I wanted to become a scientist...

548
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,744
...but that afternoon I
learned from Carl...

549
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,787
...the kind of person I wanted to become.

550
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,340
He reached out to me
and to countless others...

551
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:28,380
...inspiring so many of us to study, teach
and do science.

552
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,801
Science is a cooperative enterprise,
spanning the generations.

553
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:37,723
It's the passing of a torch
from teacher to student to teacher.

554
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:41,268
A community of minds
reaching back to antiquity...

555
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,027
...and forward to the stars.

556
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,609
Now, come with me.

557
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:49,322
Our journey is just beginning.
