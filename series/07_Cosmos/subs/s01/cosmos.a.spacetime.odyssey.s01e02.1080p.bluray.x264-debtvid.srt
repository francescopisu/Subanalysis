copies its lost partner...

170
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,935
...resulting in two
identical DNA molecules.

171
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,817
<i>That's how life reproduces
genes and transmits them...</i>

172
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,195
<i>...from one generation to the next.</i>

173
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,606
<i>When a living cell divides in two...</i>

174
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:57,118
<i>...each one takes away with it
a complete copy of the DNA.</i>

175
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,030
<i>A specialized protein
proofreads to make sure...</i>

176
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:05,418
<i>...that only the right letters are accepted
so that the DNA is accurately copied.</i>

177
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,249
<i>But nobody's perfect.</i>

178
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,461
<i>Occasionally,
a proofreading error slips through...</i>

179
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,253
<i>...making a small, random change
in the genetic instructions.</i>

180
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,889
<i>A mutation has occurred
in the bear's egg cell.</i>

181
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,426
<i>A random event as tiny as this one
can have consequences...</i>

182
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,562
<i>...on a far grander scale.</i>

183
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,901
<i>That mutation altered the gene
that controls fur color.</i>

184
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,233
<i>It will affect the production
of dark pigment in the fur...</i>

185
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,444
<i>...of the bear's offspring.</i>

186
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,734
<i>Most mutations are harmless.</i>

187
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,447
<i>Some are deadly.</i>

188
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,329
<i>But a few, purely by chance,
can give an organism...</i>

189
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,083
<i>...a critical advantage
over the competition.</i>

190
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,416
<i>A year has passed.
Our bear is now a mother.</i>

191
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,832
<i>And as a result of that mutation...</i>

192
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,252
<i>...one of her two cubs
was born with a white coat.</i>

193
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,013
<i>When the cubs get old enough
to venture out on their own...</i>

194
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,845
<i>...which bear is more likely...</i>

195
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,432
<i>...to be able to sneak up
on unsuspecting prey?</i>

196
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,894
<i>The brown bear can be seen
against the snow a mile away.</i>

197
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,730
<i>The white bear prospers and passes on...</i>

198
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,611
<i>...its own particular set of genes.</i>

199
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,193
<i>This happens repeatedly.</i>

200
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,983
<i>Over succeeding generations...</i>

201
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,451
<i>...the gene for white fur spreads through
the entire population of Arctic bears.</i>

202
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:28,961
<i>The gene for dark fur
loses out in the competition for survival.</i>

203
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,750
Mutations are entirely random
and happen all the time.

204
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,634
But the environment rewards those...

205
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,966
...that increase the chance for survival.

206
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:43,804
It naturally selects the living things
that are better suited to survive.

207
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,640
And that selection
is the opposite of random.

208
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,189
<i>The two populations of bears
separated and over thousands of years...</i>

209
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,777
<i>...evolved other characteristics
that set them apart.</i>

210
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,364
<i>They became different species.</i>

211
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:07,665
<i>That's what Charles Darwin meant
by "the origin of species."</i>

212
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,827
<i>An individual bear doesn't evolve.</i>

213
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:15,840
<i>The population of bears evolves
over generations.</i>

214
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,714
If the Arctic ice continues to dwindle...

215
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,631
...due to global warming,
the polar bears may go extinct.

216
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,720
They'll be replaced by brown bears...

217
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,556
...better adapted
to the now defrosted environment.

218
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,977
This is a different story
from the one about the dogs.

219
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,643
No breeder guided these changes.

220
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,063
Instead, the environment
itself selects them.

221
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,857
This is evolution by natural selection...

222
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,618
...the most revolutionary concept
in the history of science.

223
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,873
Darwin first presented the evidence
for this idea in 1859.

224
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,706
The uproar it caused has never subsided.

225
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,997
Why?

226
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,589
[BIRDS CHIRPING]

227
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,849
We all understand
the twinge of discomfort...

228
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,932
...at the thought that we share
a common ancestor with the apes.

229
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,473
<i>No one can embarrass you like a relative.</i>

230
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,562
<i>Our closest ones, the chimpanzees...</i>

231
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,604
<i>...they frequently behave inappropriately
in public.</i>

232
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,694
<i>There's an understandable human need
to distance ourselves from them.</i>

233
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,406
A central premise of traditional belief...

234
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,198
...is that we were created separately
from all the other animals.

235
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:34,585
It's easy to see why this idea has
taken hold. It makes us feel special.

236
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:41,130
But what about our kinship with the trees?
How does that make you feel?

237
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:54,644
<i>Okay, here's a segment of the oak
tree's DNA. Think of it like a barcode.</i>

238
00:16:54,805 --> 00:17:00,107
<i>The instructions written in the code of
life tell the tree how to metabolize sugar.</i>

239
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,148
<i>Now let's compare it with
the same section of my own DNA.</i>

240
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,283
<i>The DNA doesn't lie.</i>

241
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,246
This tree and me, we're long-lost cousins.

242
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,910
And it's not just the trees.

243
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,830
If you go back far enough,
you'll find that we share...

244
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,966
...a common ancestor with the butterfly...

245
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,546
"Gray Wolf... ...mushroom...
...shark...

246
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,473
...bacterium... ...sparrow.

247
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,009
What a family.

248
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,395
Other parts of the barcode vary
from species to species.

249
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,149
That's what makes the difference
between an owl and an octopus.

250
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,355
Unless you have an identical twin...

251
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:45,024
...there's no one else in the universe
with the exact same DNA as you.

252
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,408
Within other species,
the genetic differences...

253
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,741
...provide the raw material
for natural selection.

254
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,999
The environment selects which genes survive
and multiply.

255
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,661
When it comes to the genetic instructions
for life's most basic functions...

256
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:03,504
...say, digesting sugars, we and
other species are almost identical.

257
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,966
<i>That's because those functions
are so basic to life...</i>

258
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:11,053
<i>...they evolved before the various
life-forms branched off from each other.</i>

259
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,014
<i>This is our tree of life.</i>

260
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,726
<i>Science has made it possible
for us to construct this family tree...</i>

261
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,232
<i>...for all the species of life on Earth.</i>

262
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,520
<i>Close genetic relatives occupy
the same branch of the tree...</i>

263
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,065
<i>...while more distant cousins
are farther away.</i>

264
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,360
<i>Each twig is a living species.</i>

265
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,785
<i>And the trunk of the tree
represents the common ancestors...</i>

266
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,666
<i>...of all life on Earth.</i>

267
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,044
<i>The stuff of life is so malleable...</i>

268
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,921
<i>...that once it got started,
the environment molded</i> it...

269
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,129
<i>...into a staggering variety of forms...</i>

270
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,968
<i>...10,000 times more than
we can possibly show here.</i>

271
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,387
<i>Biologists have cataloged...</i>

272
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,645
...a <i>half</i> a <i>million different
kinds of beetles alone.</i>

273
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,652
<i>Not to mention the numberless varieties
of bacteria.</i>

274
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,564
<i>There are many millions
of living species...</i>

275
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,325
<i>...of animals and plants,
most of them still unknown to science.</i>

276
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,533
<i>Think of that.
We have yet to make contact...</i>

277
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,245
<i>...with most of the forms
of terrestrial life.</i>

278
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:23,379
<i>That's how many kinds of life there are
on this tiny planet alone.</i>

279
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,041
<i>The tree of life extends
its feelers in all directions...</i>

280
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,257
<i>...finding and exploiting what works,
creating new environments...</i>

281
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,093
<i>...and opportunities for new forms.</i>

282
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,725
<i>The tree of life is three
and a half billion years old.</i>

283
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:44,893
<i>That's plenty of time to develop
an impressive repertoire of tricks.</i>

284
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,112
<i>Evolution can disguise an animal
as a plant...</i>

285
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,543
<i>...taking thousands of generations
to contrive an elaborate costume...</i>

286
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:06,582
<i>...that fools predators into looking
elsewhere for someone to eat.</i>

287
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,468
<i>Or it can disguise a plant as an animal...</i>

288
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,630
<i>...evolving blossoms that take on
the appearance of a wasp...</i>

289
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,642
<i>...the orchid's way of fooling
real wasps into pollinating it.</i>

290
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:24,934
<i>This is the awesome shape-shifting power
of natural selection.</i>

291
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:35,653
<i>Among the dense, tangled limbs
of the vast tree of life...</i>

292
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,866
<i>...you are here.</i>

293
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:42,078
<i>One tiny branch among countless millions.</i>

294
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:47,998
<i>Science reveals that all
life on Earth is one.</i>

295
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,761
Darwin discovered the actual mechanism
of evolution.

296
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,513
The prevailing belief
was that the complexity...

297
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,518
...and variety of life must be the work
of an intelligent designer...

298
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,726
...who created each of these millions
of different species separately.

299
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,359
Living things are just
too intricate, it was said...

300
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,067
...to be the result of unguided evolution.

301
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:17,611
Consider the human eye,
a masterpiece of complexity.

302
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:26,127
<i>It requires a cornea, iris, lens, retina...</i>

303
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,413
<i>...optic nerves, muscles...</i>

304
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:33,585
<i>...let alone the brain's elaborate
neural network to interpret images.</i>

305
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:39,599
<i>It's more complicated than any device
ever crafted by human intelligence.</i>

306
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,853
<i>Therefore, it was argued,
the human eye can't be the result...</i>

307
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,389
<i>...of mindless evolution.</i>

308
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,230
<i>To know if that's true,
we need to travel across time...</i>

309
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,863
<i>...to a world before
there were eyes to see.</i>

310
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,295
<i>In the beginning, life was blind.</i>

311
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,510
<i>This is what our world looked like
four billion years ago...</i>

312
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,555
<i>...before there were any eyes to see.</i>

313
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,601
<i>Until a few hundred million years passed,
and then, one day...</i>

314
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,692
<i>...there was a microscopic copying error
in the DNA of a bacterium.</i>

315
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:41,112
<i>This random mutation gave that microbe
a protein molecule that absorbed sunlight.</i>

316
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,907
<i>Want to know what the world looked like
to a light-sensitive bacterium?</i>

317
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,372
<i>Take a look at the right
side of the screen.</i>

318
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,462
<i>Mutations continued to occur at random...</i>

319
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,716
<i>...as they always do in any population
of living things.</i>

320
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:02,640
<i>Another mutation caused a dark bacterium
to flee intense light.</i>

321
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,301
<i>What is going on here?</i>

322
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,844
<i>Night and day.</i>

323
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,639
<i>Those bacteria that could
tell light from dark...</i>

324
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,479
<i>...had a decisive advantage
over the ones that couldn't.</i>

325
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,441
<i>Why? Because the daytime brought
harsh, ultraviolet light...</i>

326
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,698
<i>...that damages DNA.</i>

327
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,026
<i>The sensitive bacteria
fled the intense light...</i>

328
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,866
<i>...to safely exchange
their DNA in the dark.</i>

329
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,656
<i>They survived in greater numbers...</i>

330
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,245
<i>...than the bacteria
that stayed at the surface.</i>

331
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:34,588
<i>Over time, those light-sensitive proteins
became concentrated in a pigment spot...</i>

332
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,876
<i>...on the more advanced,
one-celled organism.</i>

333
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,554
<i>This made it possible to find the light...</i>

334
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,180
...an overwhelming advantage...

335
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,969
<i>...for an organism
that harvests sunlight to make food.</i>

336
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:57,319
<i>Here's a ﬂatworms-eye view of the world.</i>

337
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,949
<i>This multi-celled organism
evolved a dimple in the pigment spot.</i>

338
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,609
<i>The bowl-shaped depression...</i>

339
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,451
<i>...allowed the animal to distinguish
light from shadow...</i>

340
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,412
<i>...to crudely make out objects
in its vicinity...</i>

341
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,750
<i>...including those to eat
and those that might eat</i> it...

342
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,131
<i>...a tremendous advantage.</i>

343
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,465
<i>Later, things became a little clearer.
The dimple deepened...</i>

344
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,801
<i>...and evolved into a socket
with a small opening.</i>

345
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,637
<i>Over thousands of generations...</i>

346
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,849
<i>...natural selection
was slowly sculpting the eye.</i>

347
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:37,231
<i>The opening contracted to a pinhole covered
by a protective transparent membrane.</i>

348
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,680
<i>Only a little light could
enter the tiny hole</i>

349
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,990
<i>but it was enough to
paint a dim image...</i>

350
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,744
<i>...on the sensitive inner surface of
the eye. This sharpened the focus.</i>

351
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,121
<i>A larger opening
would have let in more light...</i>

352
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,874
<i>...to make a brighter image
but one that was out of focus.</i>

353
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:57,880
<i>This development launched
the visual equivalent of an arms race.</i>

354
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:13,180
<i>The competition needed to keep up
to survive.</i>

355
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:17,270
<i>But then a splendid new feature
of the eye evolved...</i>

356
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:22,610
<i>...a lens that provided both brightness
and sharp focus.</i>

357
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,774
<i>In the eyes of primitive fish...</i>

358
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,615
<i>...the transparent gel
near the pinhole formed into a lens.</i>

359
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,782
<i>At the same time, the pinhole enlarged
to let in more and more light.</i>

360
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,827
<i>Fish could now see in high-def...</i>

361
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,839
<i>...both close up and far away.</i>

362
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,591
<i>And then something terrible happened.</i>

363
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,379
<i>Have you ever noticed
that a straw in a glass of water...</i>

364
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,513
<i>...looks bent at the surface of the water?</i>

365
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,346
<i>That's because light bends
when it goes from one medium...</i>

366
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,261
<i>...to another, say from water to air.</i>

367
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:58,478
<i>Our eyes originally evolved
to see in water.</i>

368
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,938
<i>The watery fluid in those eyes...</i>

369
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,820
<i>...neatly eliminated the distortion
of that bending effect.</i>

370
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,658
<i>But for land animals,
the light carries images from dry air...</i>

371
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,743
<i>...into their still-watery eyes.</i>

372
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:18,503
<i>That bends the light rays
causing all kinds of distortions.</i>

373
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,131
When our amphibious ancestors
left the water for the land...

374
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,293
...their eyes,
exquisitely evolved to see in water...

375
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,553
...were lousy for seeing in the air.

376
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,385
Our vision has never been as good since.

377
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,266
We like to think of our eyes
as state-of-the-art...

378
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,723
...but 375 million years later...

379
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,605
...we still can't see things
right in front of our noses...

380
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,985
...or discern fine details in near darkness
the way fish can.

381
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,522
When we left the water,
why didn't nature just start over again...

382
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,864
...and evolve us a new set of eyes
that were optimal for seeing in the air?

383
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,778
Nature doesn't work that way.

384
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,199
Evolution reshapes existing structures
over generations...

385
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,413
...adapting them with small changes.

386
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:02,751
It can't just go back to the drawing board
and start from scratch.

387
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:06,087
<i>At every stage of its development,
the evolving eye...</i>

388
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,175
<i>...functioned well enough to provide
a selective advantage for survival.</i>

389
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,716
<i>And among animals alive today,
we find eyes...</i>

390
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,260
<i>...at all these stages of development.</i>

391
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,682
<i>And all of them function.</i>

392
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,398
<i>The complexity of the human eye...</i>

393
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,110
<i>...poses no challenge to evolution
by natural selection.</i>

394
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:33,745
<i>In fact, the eye and all of biology
makes no sense without evolution.</i>

395
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:39,204
<i>Some claim that evolution is just a theory
as if it were merely an opinion.</i>

396
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,245
The theory of evolution,
like the theory of gravity...

397
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,413
...is a scientific fact.

398
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,003
Evolution really happened.

399
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:51,717
Accepting our kinship with all life
on Earth is not only solid science.

400
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:56,476
In my view,
it's also a soaring spiritual experience.

401
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,059
<i>Because evolution is blind...</i>

402
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,356
<i>...it cannot anticipate or adapt
to catastrophic events.</i>

403
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,909
<i>The tree of life
has some broken branches.</i>

404
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,867
<i>Many of them were severed
in the five greatest catastrophes...</i>

405
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,283
<i>...that life has ever known.</i>

406
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,292
<i>Somewhere, there's a memorial...</i>

407
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:27,298
<i>...to the multitude of lost species,
the Hails of Extinction.</i>

408
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,129
<i>Come with me.</i>

409
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,483
Welcome to the Halls of Extinction.

410
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:52,399
A monument to the broken branches
on the tree of life.

411
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:06,541
For every single one
of the millions of species alive today...

412
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,832
...perhaps a thousand others have perished.

413
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,844
Most of them died out in everyday
competition with other life-forms.

414
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,472
But many of them were swept away
in vast cataclysms...

415
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,383
...that overwhelmed the planet.

416
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,518
In the last 500 million years,
this has happened five times.

417
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,436
Five extinctions devastated life on Earth.

418
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:35,524
The worst happened
250 million years ago...

419
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:40,367
...at the end of an era
known as the Permian.

420
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,098
Trilobites were
armored animals that hunted...

421
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,135
...in great herds across the seafloor.

422
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:06,556
They were among the first animals to evolve
image-forming eyes.

423
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:13,654
Trilobites had a good long run,
some 270 million years.

424
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,077
Earth was once the planet
of the trilobites.

425
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:20,366
But now they're all gone.
Extinct.

426
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,996
The last of them
were swept from life's stage...

427
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:29,413
...along with countless other species
in an unparalleled environmental disaster.

428
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,629
[RUMBLING AND EXPLOSIONS]

429
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:42,091
The apocalypse
began in what is now Siberia...

430
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:48,765
...with volcanic eruptions on a scale
unlike anything in human experience.

431
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,404
Earth was very different then...

432
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,746
...with one single supercontinent
and one great ocean.

433
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,331
Relentless floods of fiery lava...

434
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:13,794
...engulfed an area larger
than Western Europe.

435
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:18,426
The pulsing eruptions went on for hundreds
of thousands of years.

436
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:22,089
The molten rock ignited coal deposits
and polluted the air...

437
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,805
...with carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gases.

438
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,219
This heated the Earth...

439
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:31,357
...and stopped the ocean currents
from circulating.

440
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,948
Noxious bacteria bloomed...

441
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,836
...but nearly everything else
in the seas died.

442
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:56,669
The stagnant waters belched
deadly hydrogen sulfide gas into the air...

443
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,382
...which suffocated most
of the land animals.

444
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,811
Nine in 10 of all species
on the planet went extinct.

445
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,948
We call it the Great Dying.

446
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,626
Life on Earth came so near
to being wiped out...

447
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,088
...that it took more than
1O million years to recover.

448
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,298
But new life-forms slowly evolved...

449
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:46,261
...to fill the openings left
by the Permian holocaust.

450
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,226
Among the biggest winners
were the dinosaurs.

451
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,111
Now the Earth was their planet.

452
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:04,320
Their reign continued
for over 150 million years.

453
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:09,364
Until it too came crashing down
in another mass extinction.

454
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,415
Life on Earth has taken quite a beating
over the eons.

455
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:17,831
And yet it's still there.
The tenacity of life is mind-boggling.

456
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,590
We keep finding it
where no one thought it could be.

457
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,798
That nameless corridor?

458
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,059
That's for another day.

459
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:41,149
<i>I know an animal that can live
in boiling water or in solid ice.</i>

460
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,485
<i>It can go 10 years without</i> a <i>drop of water.</i>

461
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,650
<i>It can travel naked in the cold vacuum...</i>

462
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:51,196
<i>...and intense radiation of space
and will return unscathed.</i>

463
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,786
<i>The tardigrade, or water bear.</i>

464
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,202
<i>It's equally at home
atop the tallest mountains...</i>

465
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,837
<i>...and in the deepest trenches of the sea.</i>

466
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,714
<i>And in our own backyards,
where they live among the moss...</i>

467
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,171
<i>...in countless numbers.</i>

468
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,304
You've probably never noticed them
because they're so small.

469
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,464
About the size of a pinpoint.

470
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,974
But they're tough.

471
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,978
The tardigrades have survived
all five mass extinctions.

472
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,810
They've been in business
for a half a billion years.

473
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,273
We used to think that life was finicky,
that it would only take hold...

474
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,233
...where it was not too
hot, not too cold...

475
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,650
...not too dark or salty
or acidic or radioactive.

476
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,945
<i>And whatever you do,
don't forget to add water.</i>

477
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:34,490
<i>We were wrong.
As the hardy tardigrade demonstrates...</i>

478
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:39,036
<i>...life can endure conditions that would
mean certain death for us humans.</i>

479
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,204
But differences between us
and life found...

480
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,999
...in even the most extreme environments
on our planet...

481
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:49,547
...are only variations on a single theme,
dialects of a single language.

482
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,807
The genetic code of Earth life.

483
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,548
<i>But what would life be
like on other worlds?</i>

484
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,234
<i>Worlds with a completely
different history...</i>

485
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,612
<i>...chemistry and evolution from our planet?</i>

486
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,326
<i>There's a distant world
I wanna take you to.</i>

487
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:17,158
<i>A world far different from our own,
but one that may harbor life.</i>

488
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:21,295
<i>If it does,
it promises to be unlike anything...</i>

489
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,127
<i>...we've ever seen before.</i>

490
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,444
Clouds and haze completely hide
the surface of Titan...

491
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,731
...Saturn's giant moon.

492
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,491
Titan reminds me a little bit of home.

493
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,529
Like Earth, it has an atmosphere
that's mostly nitrogen.

494
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,742
But it's four times denser.

495
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,533
Titan's air has no oxygen at all.

496
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:06,048
And it's far colder than anywhere on Earth.
But still, I wanna go there.

497
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,845
<i>We have to descend through
a couple hundred kilometers of smog...</i>

498
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,597
<i>...before we can even see the surface.</i>

499
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:19,603
<i>But hidden beneath
lies a weirdly familiar landscape.</i>

500
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:31,649
Titan is the only other world
in the solar system where it ever rains.

501
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,285
<i>It has rivers and coastlines.</i>

502
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:45,288
Titan has hundreds of lakes. One of them
larger than Lake Superior in North America.

503
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:49,253
Vapor rising from the lakes condenses
and falls again as rain.

504
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,011
<i>The rain feeds rivers...</i>

505
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:59,393
<i>...which carve valleys into the landscape,
just like on Earth.</i>

506
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,937
But with one big difference.

507
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,474
On Titan, the seas and the rain...

508
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,690
...are made not of water,
but of methane and ethane.

509
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,527
On Earth, those molecules form natural gas.

510
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,532
<i>On frigid Titan, they're liquid.</i>

511
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:27,622
Titan has lots of water
but all of it is frozen hard as rock.

512
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:32,543
In fact, the landscape and mountains
are made mainly of water ice.

513
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,882
At hundreds of degrees below zero...

514
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,548
...Titan is far too cold
for water to ever be liquid.

515
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,104
<i>Astrobiologists since Carl Sagan
have wondered...</i>

516
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,983
<i>...if life might swim
in Titan's hydrocarbon lakes.</i>

517
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,645
The chemical basis for such life...

518
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,441
...would have to be entirely different
from anything we know.

519
00:37:55,607 --> 00:38:00,488
All life on Earth depends on liquid water,
and Titan's surface has none of that.

520
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,951
But we can imagine other kinds of life.

521
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:07,164
There might be creatures that
inhale hydrogen instead of oxygen.

522
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:10,422
And exhale methane
instead of carbon dioxide.

523
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,050
They might use acetylene
instead of sugar as an energy source.

524
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,553
How could we find out if such creatures...

525
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:21,012
...rule a hidden empire
beneath the oil-dark waves?

526
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,868
<i>We're diving down deep
into the Kraken Sea...</i>

527
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,246
<i>...named for the mythic
Norse sea monster.</i>

528
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:49,749
<i>Even if there is one of those down there,
we probably couldn't see it.</i>

529
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,209
<i>It's so dark.</i>

530
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,756
<i>If you took all the oil
and natural gas on Earth...</i>

531
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,764
<i>...it would amount to but a tiny fraction
of Titan's reserves.</i>

532
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,603
<i>Let's turn on some lights.</i>

533
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:14,607
<i>We're now 200 meters beneath the surface.</i>

534
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,987
<i>Did you see something?
Over there, by that vent.</i>

535
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:27,077
<i>Maybe it was just my imagination.
I guess we'll have to come back...</i>

536
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,493
<i>...if we want to find out for sure.</i>

537
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:36,333
<i>There's one last story I want to tell you.</i>

538
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,549
And it's the greatest story
science has ever told.

539
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:49,100
<i>It's the story of life on our world.</i>

540
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,878
Welcome to the Earth
of four billion years ago.

541
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,833
This was our planet before life.

542
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,548
Nobody knows how life got started.

543
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,133
Most of the evidence
from that time was destroyed...

544
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,674
...by impact and erosion.

545
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,515
Science works on the frontier
between knowledge and ignorance.

546
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,896
We're not afraid to admit
what we don't know.

547
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,728
There's no shame in that.

548
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,861
The only shame is to pretend
that we have all the answers.

549
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,441
Maybe someone watching this...

550
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:44,826
...will be the first to solve the mystery
of how life on Earth began.

551
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,793
The evidence from living microbes...

552
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,422
...suggest that their earliest ancestors
preferred high temperatures.

553
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:02,712
Life on Earth may have arisen in hot water
around submerged volcanic vents.

554
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,926
<i>In Carl Sagan's original Cosmos series...</i>

555
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,767
<i>...he traced the unbroken thread
that stretches...</i>

556
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,182
<i>...directly from the
one-celled organisms...</i>

557
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:19,649
<i>...of nearly four billion years ago to you.</i>

558
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,111
<i>Four billion years in 40 seconds.</i>

559
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,617
<i>From creatures
who had yet to discern day from night...</i>

560
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:31,498
<i>...to beings who are exploring the cosmos.</i>

561
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,791
SAGAN: <i>Those are some of the things
that molecules do...</i>

562
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,461
<i>...given four billion years of evolution.</i>
