NARRATOR: In the spring of 1970,

92
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,466
despite the uproar over
the invasion of Cambodia

93
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:32,533
and the killing of four
students at Kent State,

94
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:35,365
President Nixon's hold on what he called

95
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:39,266
"the great silent majority" seemed secure.

96
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:43,033
A Gallup poll showed that most Americans

97
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,832
blamed the students, not
the national guardsmen,

98
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,000
for what had happened.

99
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,165
(shouting, clamoring)

100
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:53,466
At an antiwar demonstration in Manhattan,

101
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:56,565
hundreds of construction
workers in hard hats

102
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:58,932
attacked protestors,

103
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,833
sending 70 to the hospital.

104
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:07,466
And when workers marched on City Hall

105
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,466
a few days later,

106
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:12,665
Nixon wrote the president of their union

107
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:14,665
to say how pleased he was

108
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,266

109
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:18,565

Viet Cong flag and fly it

and wave it and bring it up this avenue

123

and get away with it...
and get away with it...

124
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,865
that's unpatriotic to me.

NARRATOR: When American
troops withdrew from Cambodia

126
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,165
at the end of June,

127
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:01,432
the White House reported
that they had killed

128
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:05,365
11,349 enemy troops,

129
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,966
captured 22,000 weapons

130
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:14,699
and had destroyed 11,688
bunkers and buildings.

131
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,865
But after so many years of fighting,

132
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:21,365
more and more Americans
were tired of the war,

133
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,766
wanted to get out of Southeast Asia,

134
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:28,699
and did not want the president
to expand the conflict further.

135
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,699
Among their representatives in Congress,

136
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,365
antiwar sentiment had steadily grown.

137
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:38,399
As the president searched
for a face-saving way

138
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,365
to end the war, he continued
to withdraw troops.

139
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,033
CROWD (chanting): U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

140
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:46,899
But even as American casualty figures fell,

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,665
the gulf between Americans at home widened,

142
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:53,333
tearing communities, neighborhoods,

143
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:55,865
even families apart.

144
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:59,033
CROWD (chanting): No more war! No more war!

145
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,766
Nixon was convinced...

146
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:03,000
just as Lyndon Johnson had been...

147
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,500
that the antiwar movement was somehow

148
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,632
being directed from Hanoi,

149
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,432
Beijing and Moscow.

150
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,966
"Within the iron gates of the White House

151
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,565
a siege mentality was settling in,"

152
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:18,266

153

circle closer around us,

on Campus Unrest and is
majoring in political science.

181
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,566
Is that right? Right.

182
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:40,533
NARRATOR: Eva Jefferson,

183
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:43,133
whose father had served in Vietnam,

184
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,033
was now the student body president

185
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,432
at Northwestern University.

186
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,133
After Kent State,

187
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:52,232
she had forcefully stopped angry protestors

188
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:56,133
from burning down the ROTC
building at her school,

189
00:08:56,232 --> 00:09:00,133
and later testified before
a presidential commission

190
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:04,133
looking into the causes of student unrest.

191
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:07,033
She had warned then that some students

192
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,966
were becoming so frustrated

193
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,966
that they felt they had no choice

194
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:14,265
but to engage in violence.

195
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:16,633
And right now it's a privilege to welcome

196
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:18,432
the vice president of the United States,

197
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,700
Spiro T. Agnew.

198
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,133
(audience applauding)

199
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:25,633
AGNEW: Let me

200
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,665
take brief exception to
one thing you've said,

201
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:30,076
that the only way to get the attention

202
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
of the society is to bomb buildings.

203
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,033
What I attempted to do

204
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:36,000
before the Scranton
Committee was to explain

205
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,665
what could motivate someone
to blow up a building.

206
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:41,633
I did not say I endorse this,
and if you read my testimony

207
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:44,200
quite carefully, you'll know that I didn't.

208
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:47,033
And it's this type of-of
just picking up on what,

209
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,932
allegedly, I said instead of
really studying what I said

210
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,500
that-that really disturbs me.

211
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,241
(quietly): May I respond?
Because you're making people

212
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:55,432
afraid of their own children.

213
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,609
Yet they're your children,
they're my parents' children,

214
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:58,908
they're the children of this country.

215
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,932
Yet you're making people afraid of them.

216
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,966
And I think this is the
greatest disservice.

217
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:05,666
There's an honest difference
of agreement on issues,

218
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:08,232
but-but when you make people
afraid of each other,

219
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:11,200
you-you isolate people, and
maybe this is your goal,

220
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,500
but I think this is...

221
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,466
this could only have a disastrous effect

222
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:16,700
on the country. (applause)

223
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,633
Let me say first that isolating people

224
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:20,832
is not my goal.

225
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:23,765
If that were true I
wouldn't be here tonight.

226
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:25,799
And let me take exception to that

227
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:28,765
oft-repeated rationale that, uh,

228
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:31,200
violence is the only way to get results.

229
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,799
I was trying to explain to you
the rationale of some students

230
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,066
who are openly revolutionary.

231
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:37,432
You're not listening to what I'm saying.

232
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,976
I'm-I'm really distressed. Just what are...
what are you advocating?

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,009
EVA JEFFERSON PATERSON: They
were trying to politically

234
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,332
benefit from making us out to be

235
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:47,966
these scary, horrible, violent people.

236
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:50,633
We weren't. We were against the war.

237
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:52,100
We thought the war was wrong.

238
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,533
We thought we were lied to.

239
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,200
And we were in the streets.

240
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:59,166
America has always had a
rich tradition of protests.

241
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:02,765
We were founded by protesting England.

242
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:05,100
So to make people afraid of their kids,

243
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,280
I think, was wrong, but
that's what they were about.

244
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,533
They were fearmongers.

245
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,765
BAO NINH:

246
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,332
PHAN QUANG TUE: It was fratricide.

247
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:56,832
You can say, "Well, but-but
they are communist."

248
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:59,166
Okay, they're communist.

249
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:01,932
"They are the worst Vietnamese
in the entire world.

250
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,865
We were the good Vietnamese."

251
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:06,732
But let's face Vietnamese
killing Vietnamese.

252
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:08,966
How-how do you deny that?

253
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,732
If you don't call that fratricide,

254
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:17,466
what do you call that?

255
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,000
What do you... how do we...

256
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,033
I explain that to-to my children?

257
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:27,765
NARRATOR: The Cambodian incursion had

258
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:31,133
at least temporarily reduced
the flow of North Vietnamese

259
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:34,932
men and supplies through that country,

260
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,000
but they were still streaming down

261
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,832
the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos.

262
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:42,732
The White House wanted them stopped.

263
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:46,399
But this time, South Vietnamese troops

264
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,100
would have to try to do the job alone.

265
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,133
By the end of 1970, both houses of Congress

266
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,000
had barred all U.S. ground personnel,

267
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,166
even advisors and special forces,

268
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:02,166
from crossing the border.

269
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:06,066
On February 8, 1971,

270
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:10,466
17,000 ARVN troops began moving into Laos

271
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,332
to destroy the enemy's jungle bases

272
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:17,100
and to cut off the Ho Chi Minh trail.

273
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,600
The Americans could only
provide air support.

274
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,600
Nixon and his National Security Advisor,

275
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,799
Henry Kissinger, believed
that a successful operation

276
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,033
would boost morale in Saigon

277
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:34,533
and prove to Hanoi and the American public

278
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:38,533
that the ARVN could fight
and win on their own,

279
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:42,633
that Vietnamization could work.

280
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:46,832
Their target was the North
Vietnamese logistics hub,

281
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:50,200
the abandoned town of Tchepone.

282
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,365
U.S. intelligence

283
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,265
believed there were no more

284
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:58,799
than 22,000 North Vietnamese
troops in the area.

285
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:02,932
But there would eventually
turn out to be 60,000,

286
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:06,765
and their commanders knew
there was only one route

287
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:09,966
the ARVN was likely to take.

288
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,966
Harry Hue, who had been
fighting the communists

289
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:16,600
for eight years, was in the invasion force.

290
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,566
HUE (speaking English):

291
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:46,732
(explosion)

292
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:50,432
NARRATOR: Although individual
ARVN units fought bravely,

293
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:53,000
the invasion was a failure.

294
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,332
Almost half of the 17,000 South Vietnamese

295
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:15,865
who entered Laos

296
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:19,100
would be killed, wounded or captured.

297
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,066
HUE:

298
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,600
BAO NINH:

299
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,832
NARRATOR: In late March,

300
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:23,600
as the surviving ARVN forces

301
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,265
straggled back across the border

302
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:27,500
into South Vietnam,

303
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,432
crowds of weeping women,
children and old men...

304
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,566
dressed in white, the color of mourning...

305
00:16:34,665 --> 00:16:38,165
begged for news of the
soldiers who were missing.

306
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:42,633
In Vietnam, the dead must
receive proper burial

307
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:46,566
so that their restless
souls can have peace,

308
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,665
and their families needed to know

309
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:50,332
the time of their deaths

310
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:53,466
so that they could honor them each year.

311
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Even before the invasion was over,

312
00:16:58,098 --> 00:17:00,500
President Nixon had told an aide,

313
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:02,665
"We must claim victory,

314
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,232
whatever the outcome."

315
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:41,732
Consequently, tonight,

316
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:46,032
I can report that
Vietnamization has succeeded.

317
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,333
Because of the increased strength

318
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:49,799
of the South Vietnamese,

319
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,432
because of the success of
the Cambodian operation,

320
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:53,732
because of the achievements

321
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,833
of the South Vietnamese operation in Laos,

322
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:58,465
I am announcing an increase

323
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:00,833
in the rate of American withdrawals.

324
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:03,333
We have it in our power to leave Vietnam

325
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,566
in a way that offers a brave people

326
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:08,299
a realistic hope of freedom.

327
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,700
We have it in our power

328
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,965
to prove to our friends in the world

329
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,833
that America's sense of responsibility

330
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:18,299
remains the world's greatest
single hope of peace.

331
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,700
And generations in the future

332
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,200
will look back at this difficult,

333
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:29,965
trying time in America's history,

334
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,566
and they will be proud

335
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:35,865
that we demonstrated

336
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:38,532
that we had the courage

337
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:42,000
and the character of a great people.

338
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:42,965
OPERATOR: Dr. Kissinger, sir.

339
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,566
NIXON: Yeah.

340
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,566
KISSINGER: Mr. President?

341
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:46,732
NIXON: Yeah. Hi, Henry.

342
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,275
KISSINGER: This was the best
speech you've delivered

343
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,419
since you've been in office.

344
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
NIXON: Yeah.

345
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,965
I'll tell you one thing, this was, uh...

346
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,165
This little speech was a work of art.

347
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,900
I mean, I-I know a little
something about speechwriting.

348
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,200
And it was no act, because
no actor could do it.

349
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,309
No actor in Hollywood could
have done that that well.

350
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,633
KISSINGER: It's the best...

351
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:05,008
NIXON: I thought that was
done well, didn't you think?

352
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:06,408
KISSINGER: First of all, no
actor could have written it,

353
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:07,633
to begin with.

354
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:09,441
You couldn't have done it
unless you had meant it.

355
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:10,700
NIXON: Yeah.

356
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,066
And if it doesn't work, I don't care.

357
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:15,299

Lieutenant William Calley...

455
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,566
and only Lieutenant Calley...

456
00:23:50,665 --> 00:23:53,232
guilty of murdering Vietnamese civilians

457
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,333
at My Lai back in 1968.

458
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:03,566
He was sentenced to life
imprisonment at hard labor.

General Samuel Koster,

461
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:11,365
who had watched some of the
slaughter from a helicopter

462
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:14,365
and done nothing to stop it,
was now the superintendent

463
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:17,665
of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

464
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:21,566
He was forced to resign.

The other 23 officers and men

466
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:27,032
who had been indicted were either acquitted

467
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,799
or had their cases dismissed.

468
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,333
The Calley verdict proved as controversial

469
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,633
as the war itself.

What is your initial reaction
to this verdict, sir?

480
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,965

481
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,932
'Cause you send in a man into combat,

482
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:07,333
you train him to be a... a killer,

483
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:09,599
and then, when he does, why then,

484
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,532
uh, you prosecute him?

485
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:17,099
NARRATOR: Some believed everyone
involved should have gone to jail;

486
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,266
others believed that Calley
had been made a scapegoat

487
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:24,133
for the criminal misdeeds of his superiors.

488
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:28,099
And still others felt a
systemic failure of leadership

489
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,465
had occurred in a chain of command

490
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:35,200
that stretched all the way up
to the commander in chief.

491
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:39,532
According to a Gallup poll,

492
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:44,833
79% of the American public
disagreed with the verdict.

493
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:48,333
Nixon decided to intervene.

494
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,133
Calley spent just three days behind bars.

495
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,965
The president ordered him transferred

496
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:00,200
from federal prison to house arrest

497
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,465

00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,400
who had successfully prosecuted Calley,

501
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,665
wrote Nixon, accusing him of compromising

502
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:15,333
"such a fundamental moral principle

503
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:17,833

00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:23,532
A military appeals court

506
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:27,365
eventually reduced
Calley's term to 20 years,

507
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:30,333
the secretary of the army cut it to ten,

508
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:32,900
and after just three-and-a-half years

509
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,932
under house arrest, he was paroled.

510
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,566
TIM O'BRIEN: Who's responsible?

511
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:49,133

512
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,665

up against a baby's head

515
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:01,299
and shot the brains out of that baby...

516
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,165
nothing happened to them.

517
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:06,532

518

up the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

519
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,665
And they said we walked 900 kilometers...

520
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:28,400
540 miles in 57 days.

521
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,266
And we met all these
people going both ways.

522
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:35,833
We met civilians coming south.

523
00:27:35,932 --> 00:27:38,665
We met soldiers going north and south.

524
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:41,965
We met people humping artillery rounds.

525
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:43,333
We met a...

526
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:45,299
I remember a whole unit,

527
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,333
a company-size unit, of women.

528
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:52,700
On the way, in one of these villages,

529
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,299
I stole a uniform.

530
00:27:57,865 --> 00:27:59,599
Just khaki pants and khaki shirt.

531
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,932
And I stole it.

532
00:28:01,032 --> 00:28:04,432
And I folded it up and I put it in my pack.

00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:09,732
army doctor Hal Kushner

535
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,599
had been a prisoner of the Viet Cong

536
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,032
in South Vietnam for more than three years.

537
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,700
He had survived ill treatment
and a host of illnesses,

538
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,099
and he had buried 13 of
his fellow captives,

539
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,032
who had died of starvation

540
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:29,665
and sickness and despair.

541
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:33,566
Now, he and the other
survivors from his camp

542
00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:37,299
were being moved all the
way to North Vietnam.

543
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:41,333
Kushner and his companions

544
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:43,799
eventually reached the city of Vinh,

545
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,599
where they boarded a train to Hanoi.

546
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,732
KUSHNER: And I put on this fresh uniform,

547
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,599
and when I got off the train

548
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,400
I was met with this officer in a jeep.

549
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,099
And he just looked at me and he said,

550
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,376
"You're an officer, aren't you?

551
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,532
You come here."

552
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,900
And he just... I felt very
proud that I looked good

553
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,900
when I came off that train.

554
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,599
NARRATOR: Kushner joined
hundreds of American captives

555
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,200
who were scattered among five prisons

556
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:19,400
in and around Hanoi.

557
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,066
KUSHNER: We hadn't been there
long when the word came down

558
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,900
from the American senior ranking officer

559
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,299
that nobody would go home
unless everybody went home.

560
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,365
That nobody would cooperate
with the Vietnamese.

561
00:29:32,465 --> 00:29:34,400
(indistinct voice on radio)

562
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:41,333
But we heard him on the camp radio once...

563
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:43,333
(radio transmission continuing)

564
00:29:43,432 --> 00:29:46,365
...telling us that we should cooperate.

565
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:51,400
And it was obvious, from his
voice and his inflection,

566
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,532
that he had been tortured and beaten

567
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:56,532
and was being made to say that.

568
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,700
And that's what they did.

569
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,200
NARRATOR: Eventually, Kushner,
like most of the prisoners,

570
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,000
would be forced to record a statement

571
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:08,032
against the war.

572
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,799
(light clicks on)

573
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,133
KUSHNER (on recording):

574
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:44,008
KUSHNER: They wanted propaganda statements

575
00:30:44,032 --> 00:30:45,599
to say the war was criminal,

576
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,200
to say that we were criminals.

577
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,500
And they used our weakness against us.

578
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,000
(light clicks off)

579
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:55,066
("Gimme Shelter" by the
Rolling Stones playing)

580
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:58,965
CROWD (chanting): No more war!
No more war! No more war!

581
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:02,833
No more war! No more war!

582
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:04,932
JOHN MUSGRAVE: The first
time in our history

583
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,500
that veterans came home
from a war and said...

584
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,032
while the war is still going on...

585
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,133
and said, "This war's got to stop."

586
00:31:12,232 --> 00:31:15,099
And the American people

587
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,532
might not listen to a bunch
of long-haired hippie kids.

588
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:19,465
What do they know?

589
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:22,333
But the working class, the
great "silent majority"...

590
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:24,865
Richard Nixon always talked
about his "silent majority"

591
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:27,465
that would back him by being silent...

592
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:30,032
we were their kids.

593
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,766
And it finally dawned on me...

594
00:31:32,865 --> 00:31:34,932
and this was a long, painful process...

595
00:31:35,032 --> 00:31:37,900
that... that I wasn't helping anybody

596
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,099
by keeping my mouth shut.

597
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,365
NARRATOR: Less than three
weeks after Lieutenant Calley

598
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:47,133
was found guilty, some 2,000 members

599
00:31:47,232 --> 00:31:49,165
of an organization called

600
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:51,732
Vietnam Veterans Against the War

601
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:56,599
and their followers descended
upon Washington, D.C.

602
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,633
MICK JAGGER: ♪ Ooh, storm is threatening

603

♪ It's just a shot away. ♪

612
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:33,532
VVAW was a-a... it was great therapy.

613
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:35,700
We were working it out ourselves.

614
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,066
Vets taking care of vets.

615
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,865
We were generals in our own right.

616
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:41,500
And we didn't join anything.

617
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,165
We became something.

618
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:45,365
And that, yes, I was a Marine,

619
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,200
but I was first and foremost

620
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,566
a citizen of the United States of America.

621
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:53,432
And being a citizen, I had
certain responsibilities.

622
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:56,599
And the largest of those responsibilities

623
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,000
is standing up to your
government and saying "no"

624
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:02,133
when it's doing something that you think

625
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,932
is not in this nation's best interest.

626
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:10,232
That is the most important
job that every citizen has.

627
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:14,000
ROLLING STONES: ♪ Rape, murder

628
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:17,232
MUSGRAVE: I served my country as honorably,

629
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,432
when I was in Vietnam
Veterans Against the War,

630
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:24,066
as I did as a United States Marine.

631
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:27,500
And, in fact, I conducted
myself as a Marine

632
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:30,299
the whole time I was in VVAW.

633
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,932
I... My-my whole life,

634
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:34,766
I conduct myself as a Marine.

635
00:33:34,865 --> 00:33:38,200
NARRATOR: Navy Lieutenant John Kerry,

636
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:41,599
who had commanded a swift
boat in the Mekong Delta

637
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,200
and was one of the organization's leaders,

638
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:45,633
was invited to address

639
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,865
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,

640
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:50,932
still chaired by J. William Fulbright.

641
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:52,432
Thank you.

642
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:55,965
MUSGRAVE: I went up for the presentation.

643
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:58,266
And it was standing room only.

644
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:02,166
And I was crammed up against
the wall in the very back.

645
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:05,300
And when John...

646
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,199
gave that presentation... (gavel bangs)

647
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,800
...I felt like he was
speaking for all of us.

648
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,266
KERRY: We could come back to this
country and we could be quiet.

649
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:15,865
We could hold our silence.

650
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:19,432
We could not tell what went
on in Vietnam, but we feel,

651
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:22,365
because of what threatens this country,

652
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:24,233
we have to speak out.

653
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,166
Millions of men who have been

654
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:29,333
taught to deal and to trade in violence

655
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:31,733
and who were given the chance to die

656
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,032
for the biggest nothing in history,

657
00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:37,766
men who have returned with a sense of anger

658
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:39,266
and a sense of betrayal

659
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:41,733
which no one has yet grasped.

660
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,465
We rationalized destroying villages

661
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:46,099
in order to save them.

662
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,266
We saw America lose her sense of morality,

663
00:34:48,365 --> 00:34:51,300
as she accepted very coolly a My Lai

664
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,800
and refused to give up the
image of American soldiers

665
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,599
that hand out chocolate
bars and chewing gum.

666
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,266
We learnt the meaning of free-fire zones,

667
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:01,865
shoot anything that moves,

668
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:04,132
and we watched while
America placed a cheapness

669
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:06,400
on the lives of Orientals.

670
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,400
We watched the United States'
falsification of body counts...

671
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,932
in fact, the glorification of body counts.

672
00:35:14,032 --> 00:35:16,599
We watched while men charged up hills

673
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,833
because a general said
that hill has to be taken.

674
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:22,632
And after losing one
platoon or two platoons,

675
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:24,032
they marched away

676
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:26,032
to leave the hill for the reoccupation

677
00:35:26,132 --> 00:35:29,000
of the North Vietnamese.

678
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,666
And we are asking Americans
to think about that.

679
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:33,932
Because how do you ask a man

680
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,766
to be the last man to die in Vietnam?

681
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:41,500
How do you ask a man to be the
last man to die for a mistake?

682
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,632
And so, when, 30 years from now,

683
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:47,432
our brothers go down the
street without a leg,

684
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:50,099
without an arm or a face,

685
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:52,833
and small boys ask why,

686
00:35:52,932 --> 00:35:55,699
we will be able to say "Vietnam"

687
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,365
and not mean a filthy, obscene memory

688
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:04,766
but mean instead the place
where America finally turned

689
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:09,565
and where soldiers like us
helped it in the turning.

690
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,400
Thank you.

691
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,432
(cheers and applause)

692
00:36:17,932 --> 00:36:20,833
MUSGRAVE: I thought, "I have never heard

693
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:23,766
"so... such an incredible speech

694
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:26,300
that says exactly what I'm feeling."

695
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,766
You know? It was extraordinary.

696
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:32,233
Extraordinary.

697
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:35,900
NARRATOR: But some veterans
remembered a different part

698
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,833
of Kerry's testimony,

699
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:41,565
testimony in which he repeated
accounts of atrocities

700
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:45,465
he had heard from other American veterans.

701
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:48,733
KERRY: They told the stories of times

702
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:53,800
that they had personally raped,
cut off ears, cut off heads,

703
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,666
taped wires from portable
telephones to human genitals

704
00:36:57,766 --> 00:36:59,465
and turned up the power,

705
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:02,900
cut off limbs, blown up bodies,

706
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,565
randomly shot at civilians,

707
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:09,900
razed villages in fashion
reminiscent of Genghis Khan...

708
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,432
GIOIA: What I saw in Vietnam
was not the soldier

709
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:14,432
that Mr. Kerry or his colleagues

710
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,565
were describing at that time.

711
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:19,099
There was no widespread atrocity.

712
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,839
There was... there were a couple of units

713
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:23,365
that went right off the rails,
and we can talk about that.

714
00:37:23,465 --> 00:37:26,099
But they were not out-of-control animals,

715
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,233
which was the way they were portrayed.

716
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,900
And what was even worse was
they were alluding to the fact

717
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,320
that you would take ordinary kids

718
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,865
and turn them into these savages,

719
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:37,465
war criminals, and the...

720
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:38,932
that the military was doing that.

721
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:41,599
And it didn't. Didn't happen that way.

722
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:44,065
I'm still very angry about that.

729
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,500

this big wire and wood fence

been ordered not to arrest

786
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:29,432
any of the veterans, because,

787
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:32,032
Pat Buchanan, a White House aide, wrote,

788
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:35,500

far more sympathetic fashion

"than other demonstrators.

793
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:48,065

00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,666
blocking bridges and traffic circles,

803
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:13,099

804
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,599

NARRATOR: Some 12,000 were arrested...

811

7,000 on a single day,

812
00:41:31,932 --> 00:41:35,400
the largest number of arrests in 24 hours

813
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,900
in United States history.

814
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,365
BILL ZIMMERMAN: I realized,
coming away from Washington,

815
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,766
that our whole strategy was wrong

816
00:41:43,865 --> 00:41:47,500
and that we were becoming
more and more militant

817
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,365
at a time when more and more Americans

818
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:51,965
were opposing the war

819
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:54,565
but were turned off by our militancy.

820
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:57,565
So we were doing exactly the wrong thing.

821
00:41:57,666 --> 00:42:01,132
NARRATOR: The White House
was initially pleased.

822
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:04,300
Public sympathy for the
veterans was largely forgotten

823
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,333
in the face of days of
battle in the streets.

824
00:42:08,432 --> 00:42:11,465
Polls showed that most Americans approved

825
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:13,365
of the arrests.

826
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:20,565
But those same polls also showed

827
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,365
that most Americans no longer believed

828
00:42:23,465 --> 00:42:27,166
they were being told the
truth about Vietnam.

829
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,833
MUSGRAVE: When I got home, my...
so my dad's pissed off.

830
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:38,666
'Cause he's-he's a true believer, you know?

831
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,432
He was already receiving threats

832
00:42:42,532 --> 00:42:45,666
because I'd thrown away their medals.

833
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:50,400
And that pissed my dad off then.

834
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,132
And you would've thought I
hadn't done anything wrong.

835
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:56,266
Because then somebody outside
the family was messing with me.

836
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,400
And he said, "Son, don't worry.

837
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,400
"Those were your medals. You paid for 'em.

838
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,876
"You can do anything you want with 'em.

839
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,965
"They want to jack with
us, they'll face us both.

840
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:05,705
We'll-we'll take 'em on in the driveway."

841
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,465
You know? "Yo, Dad."

Heaven for Little Girls")

844
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,800
NARRATOR: On June 12, 1971,

845
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,132
Richard Nixon's daughter, Tricia,

846
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:25,766
married Edward Cox in the
White House Rose Garden.

847
00:43:25,865 --> 00:43:29,465
The country watched it all on television.

848
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,065
The wedding was still news the next day.

849
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:39,666
But another story on the front
page of theNew York Times

850
00:43:39,766 --> 00:43:42,565
caught the president's attention.

851
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:45,733
The article, by Neil Sheehan,

852
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,532
was the first report of
what came to be called

853
00:43:48,632 --> 00:43:50,400
the Pentagon Papers,

854
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,065
7,000 pages of highly classified documents

855
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,132
and historical narrative,

856
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,465
compiled secretly at the orders

857
00:43:58,565 --> 00:44:02,333
of former Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara.

858
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:05,666
He had hoped a study of the
decision-making process

859
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:09,266
that had led the United States
to become so deeply involved

860
00:44:09,365 --> 00:44:12,599
in Vietnam would help future policymakers

861
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:15,300
avoid similar errors.

862
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,932
SHEEHAN: I thought I knew a great deal.

863
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,065
I thought I knew most of
what was worth knowing

864
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,400
about the war.

865
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,199
And, suddenly, I didn't.

866
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,266
It wasn't a reporter's version of an event.

867
00:44:29,365 --> 00:44:31,199
It wasthe ir version of an event.

868
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,532
It was their telegrams, their orders,

869
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:35,465
their memoranda, et cetera.

870
00:44:49,932 --> 00:44:53,000
NARRATOR: The documents proved
that American presidents

871
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:54,932
and their closest advisors

872
00:44:55,032 --> 00:44:57,000
had steered the United States

873
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:59,800
toward deeper involvement in Vietnam,

874
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,300
despite their own grave doubts
about the chances for victory.

875
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:15,666
They had known that the Saigon government

876
00:45:15,766 --> 00:45:18,166
was weak and incompetent...

877
00:45:25,532 --> 00:45:29,465
...that the enemy was
disciplined and resilient...

878
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:39,333
...and that the bombing of
the North wasn't working.

879
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,965
Yet, they had routinely
lied about all these things

880
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:53,599
to Congress and the American people.

881
00:46:17,766 --> 00:46:19,432
(sighs)

882
00:46:19,532 --> 00:46:22,465
I certainly don't endorse

883
00:46:22,565 --> 00:46:27,465
anyone releasing top-secret
material to the press.

884
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:33,065
Um, on the other hand, uh...

885
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:36,300
I was very concerned

886
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,833
about the fact that the, uh,

887
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:44,199
government was not being up
front with the American people

888
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,965
in certain respects with the Vietnam War.

889
00:46:48,065 --> 00:46:51,233
NARRATOR: Two copies of the
report had been stored

890
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:54,666
at the RAND Corporation,
a California think tank,

891
00:46:54,766 --> 00:46:56,733
where Daniel Ellsberg,

892
00:46:56,833 --> 00:47:01,532
one of the study's 36 authors,
worked as an analyst.

893
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:04,565
Ellsberg had once supported the war.

894
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:06,565
He'd served in the Pentagon,

895
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:09,065
and spent two years working
for the State Department

896
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:11,300
in Vietnam.

897
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,800
But he had come to see the
war as profoundly immoral,

898
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,400
and hoped that if Americans understood

899
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,833
how administration after
administration had misled them

900
00:47:22,932 --> 00:47:25,400
about what was being done in their name,

901
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,032
they might help bring it to an end.

902
00:47:28,132 --> 00:47:31,865
He and Anthony Russo,
another RAND employee,

903
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:35,365
secretly copied most of the report.

904
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:39,565
Ellsberg offered it to three
leading antiwar senators,

905
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:43,565
hoping they would be willing
to reveal its contents.

906
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:46,300
None dared do it.

907
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,900
Meanwhile, Neil Sheehan
of theNew York Times,

908
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,032
who had been reporting
on Vietnam since 1962,

909
00:47:54,132 --> 00:47:57,900
and had already secretly
read some of the documents,

910
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,965
asked Ellsberg to show
him the whole report.

911
00:48:02,065 --> 00:48:05,099
SHEEHAN: At that point, I was
very passionate about the war.

912
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,632
I felt that it was really wrong,

913
00:48:08,733 --> 00:48:10,599
because we were getting a lot of Americans

914
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:12,932
and a lot of Vietnamese
killed for no purpose.

915
00:48:13,032 --> 00:48:16,766
We were gonna lose this war.

916
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:21,065
And so I vowed to myself
when I saw this material

917
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,932
that this is never gonna go back

918
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:24,599
into a government safe again.

919
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,365
The American public had paid for it

920
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:29,132
with the lives of their sons
and with their treasure,

921
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:30,932
and it's gonna be published.

922
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:32,599
NIXON: That piece in theTimes

923
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:33,900
is, of course,

924
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,065
a massive security leak from
the Pentagon, you know.

925
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:38,865
ROGERS: Yeah.

926
00:48:38,965 --> 00:48:42,000
NIXON: It all relates, of course,
to everything up until we came in.

927
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:43,699
ROGERS: Yeah.

928
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,233
NIXON: And it's, uh, it's ver...
it's hard on Johnson,

929
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:49,666
it's hard on Kennedy, it's hard on Lodge.

930
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:53,166
NARRATOR: At first, Nixon
was not unduly disturbed

931
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:55,666
by the newspaper's revelations.

932
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,300
They reflected badly on his
Democratic predecessors,

933
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,766
not on him.

934
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:05,065
But Henry Kissinger quickly convinced Nixon

935
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:06,965
that if theTime s were permitted

936
00:49:07,065 --> 00:49:10,800
to reveal the classified
secrets of earlier presidents,

937
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,900
it was only a matter of time
until someone leaked his own.

938
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,833
The Justice Department obtained
a temporary court order

939
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:23,500
forbidding theTi mes from
publishing further installments

940
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,632
on the grounds of national security.

941
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:30,432
But soon, both theBoston Globe

942
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:34,400
and theWashington Pos t were
also printing excerpts.

943
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:38,565
On June 30, 1971,

944
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:41,333
the United States Supreme Court,

945
00:49:41,432 --> 00:49:43,599
citing the First Amendment,

946
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:47,266
ruled six to three that
theTimes had the right

947
00:49:47,365 --> 00:49:50,833
to publish the stolen documents.

948
00:49:50,932 --> 00:49:53,032
SHEEHAN: And I went down into the basement

949
00:49:53,132 --> 00:49:55,432
to wait for the presses to start to roll,

950
00:49:55,532 --> 00:49:58,132
and they had these huge
round reams of paper.

951
00:49:58,233 --> 00:49:59,333
(whirring)

952
00:49:59,432 --> 00:50:01,008
And, finally, the presses started to roll.

953
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:05,465
And it was just an exquisite
moment of vindication

954
00:50:05,565 --> 00:50:07,699
of the freedom of the press in this country

955
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,400
and how important it is.

956
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,465
(rhythmic rattling)

957
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:14,233
KARL MARLANTES: That changed

958
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,233
our whole attitude toward government.

959
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,699
Up until then, the president wouldn't lie.

960
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,932
After then, they always lie.

961
00:50:21,032 --> 00:50:23,500
NARRATOR: The day the presses
began to roll again,

962
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,833
Nixon ordered attorney
general John Mitchell

963
00:50:26,932 --> 00:50:30,500
to try to discredit Daniel
Ellsberg, who had just

964
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,800
been indicted by a federal grand jury

965
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,065
for theft and conspiracy

966
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:39,132
under the Espionage Act of 1917.

967
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:18,300
NARRATOR: Nixon feared Ellsberg
possessed more classified documents

968
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,833
that would show that he himself had lied

969
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:24,699
about the secret bombing
of Cambodia and Laos,

970
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,532
and he believed that Ellsberg had had help

971
00:51:27,632 --> 00:51:31,065
and wanted to know the names
of his co-conspirators.

972
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,500
The president created a private,

973
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,900
clandestine investigative
unit within the White House.

974
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,900
It came to be called "The Plumbers."

975
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,532
John Ehrlichman, one of
Nixon's closest aides,

976
00:51:43,632 --> 00:51:47,000
eventually ordered them
to burglarize the office

977
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:50,032
of Ellsberg's Los Angeles psychiatrist

978
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:52,099
in search of material

979
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:55,900
with which he could be
blackmailed into silence.

980
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,199
Nixon may have privately
feared something else as well.

981
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,099
He was told that the safe
at another think tank,

982
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,800
the Brookings Institution
in Washington, D.C.,

983
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,965
contained files that might
reveal the secret role

984
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:14,932
his campaign had played in
torpedoing the peace talks

985
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:18,233
on the eve of his election
three years earlier,

986
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:22,932
which President Johnson had
then considered treason.

987
00:52:23,032 --> 00:52:26,733
Nixon wanted his "plumbers"
to break into Brookings,

988
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:31,166
crack the safe, and remove the files.

989
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:33,465
None of it was legal.

990
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:36,699
Nixon did not care.

991
00:53:07,432 --> 00:53:11,666
NARRATOR: The Brookings break-in
would never take place.

992
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:14,233
The burglars would be unable

993
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:17,432
to find Ellsberg's file
in his doctor's office.

994
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:20,965
But Nixon's obsession with his enemies

995
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:24,800
would be the undoing of his presidency.

996
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:29,565
("Embryonic Journey" by
Jefferson Airplane playing)

997
00:53:33,532 --> 00:53:35,500
(laughter and chatter)

998
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:44,346
(indistinct voice of man
speaking French over microphone)

999
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,666
JACK TODD: Once a month, I have a dream

1000
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:52,300
that I'm... I'm back... I'm
back in basic training.

1001
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,833
But I'm the age I am now,

1002
00:53:53,932 --> 00:53:56,199
which is way too old to be in the military.

1003
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,666
But, you know, somehow
I've gotten a waiver,

1004
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:00,365
and I'm going through all the training,

1005
00:54:00,465 --> 00:54:02,532
and there's some major war going on.

1006
00:54:02,632 --> 00:54:05,766
And I'm going to get there,
and I'm going to be a hero

1007
00:54:05,865 --> 00:54:11,166
and vindicate myself and be
taken back by my country.

1008
00:54:11,266 --> 00:54:13,099
(car horn honks)

1009
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:17,432
NARRATOR: Jack Todd had crossed
into Canada in early 1970,

1010
00:54:17,532 --> 00:54:19,266
rather than take part

1011
00:54:19,365 --> 00:54:22,000
in what he believed to
be a dishonorable war.

1012
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,166
He found himself living in a
strange underground world

1013
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,333
of deserters and draft evaders

1014
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:34,733
and the disaffected Canadians
who gathered around them.

1015
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:38,900
In 1971, he was living in Montreal,

1016
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,032
restless and often depressed,

1017
00:54:41,132 --> 00:54:44,733
increasingly alienated from his country,

1018
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,965
but also anxious always for news from home,

1019
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:50,833
and eager to know how his boyhood friends

1020
00:54:50,932 --> 00:54:53,965
from Scottsbluff, Nebraska, were doing.

1021
00:54:54,065 --> 00:54:56,666
One, named Ron Bales,

1022
00:54:56,766 --> 00:54:59,833
had lived just down the street.

1023
00:54:59,932 --> 00:55:04,699
And, uh... my mother sent me a letter, um,

1024
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,965
and I remember taking
the clipping out of it.

1025
00:55:07,065 --> 00:55:10,565
I had walked up to Mount Royal
in Montreal to read the letter.

1026
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:13,532
And the clipping was from
theScottsbluff Star-Herald,

1027
00:55:13,632 --> 00:55:16,400
and it was about Ron
being killed in Vietnam.

1028
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:22,599
Why? Why?

1029
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:26,666
It was long after we knew
how wrong the war was,

1030
00:55:26,766 --> 00:55:30,833
and guys like Ron were
still dying, you know.

1031
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,599
Why?

1032
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,233
The government today restricted the use

1033
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,833
of the weed killer 2,4,5-T on the ground

1034
00:55:40,932 --> 00:55:42,833
that the chemical has caused birth defects

1035
00:55:42,932 --> 00:55:45,465
in some laboratory animals.

1036
00:55:47,365 --> 00:55:52,065
NARRATOR: Since 1962, American
and South Vietnamese forces

1037
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:55,532
had sprayed some 20 million
gallons of herbicides

1038
00:55:55,632 --> 00:55:59,833
over roughly one quarter of South Vietnam.

1039
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:03,099
The idea had been to reduce casualties

1040
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:06,666
by clearing areas around U.S.
installations,

1041
00:56:06,766 --> 00:56:10,965
and to deny the enemy
crops and forest cover.

1042
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:15,132
The most frequently used
defoliant was Agent Orange,

1043
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:18,132
which contained 2,4,5-T.

1044
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:20,300
When environmentalists convinced

1045
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,465
the Nixon administration
to ban the weed killer

1046
00:56:23,565 --> 00:56:25,132
on American farms,

1047
00:56:25,233 --> 00:56:28,032
the Pentagon had reluctantly agreed

1048
00:56:28,132 --> 00:56:31,766
to stop using Agent Orange in Vietnam.

1049
00:56:31,865 --> 00:56:36,599
The ecological damage
defoliants did was obvious.

1050
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:40,699
The damage done to soldiers and civilians

1051
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,000
would be the subject of
angry debate for decades.

1052
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,199
(crowd shouting in Vietnamese)

1053
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,032
TED KOPPEL: Opposition
to the Saigon government

1054
00:56:54,132 --> 00:56:56,465
is not just Viet Cong.

1055
00:56:56,565 --> 00:56:58,065
TUE: How many governments

1056
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:01,166
actually care for the Vietnamese people?

1057
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:05,000
KOPPEL: The student antiwar,
anti-American movement

1058
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:07,532
is larger than its small
demonstrations indicate.

1059
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,400
TUE: You don't need military aid...

1060
00:57:12,465 --> 00:57:14,865
...to promote democracy in Vietnam.

1061
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:18,233
To return to the Vietnamese people

1062
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:20,666
their right that...

1063
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:22,932
their right to speak freely.

1064
00:57:23,032 --> 00:57:25,699
You don't need even one penny.

1065
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,900
You don't need to consult the White House,

1066
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,932
you don't need to care
about the American media,

1067
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,532
you don't need French,
you don't need Chinese,

1068
00:57:34,632 --> 00:57:36,199
you don't need Americans.

1069
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,733
If you really care for Vietnam
then you turn back inside.

1070
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:44,365
NARRATOR: South Vietnamese
president Nguyen Van Thieu

1071
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:46,432
was campaigning for reelection.

1072
00:57:46,532 --> 00:57:48,865
The Americans had insisted on it

1073
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,632
and urged him not to rig the race,

1074
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:54,733
for fear it would resemble too closely

1075
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:57,266
the fraudulent communist "elections"

1076
00:57:57,365 --> 00:58:00,766
routinely denounced by the United States.

1077
00:58:00,865 --> 00:58:02,432
But Thieu made sure

1078
00:58:02,532 --> 00:58:05,432
no serious candidates ran against him,

1079
00:58:05,532 --> 00:58:09,300
and claimed to have won 94% of the vote.

1080
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,099
It became known as "the one-man election,"

1081
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:14,365
and added to the ranks

1082
00:58:14,465 --> 00:58:17,465
of what was called the "Third Force":

1083
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:21,333
South Vietnamese hoping for
a negotiated settlement

1084
00:58:21,432 --> 00:58:23,599
and an end to the bloodshed.

1085
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:42,465
NARRATOR: By the middle of 1971,

1086
00:58:42,565 --> 00:58:45,465
Nixon and Kissinger were looking for a way

1087
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:48,965
to get all U.S. troops out of Vietnam

1088
00:58:49,065 --> 00:58:51,565
before his re-election campaign began

1089
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:53,565
the following year,

1090
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:56,065
but to do so without causing

1091
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:59,099
Saigon to fall too soon.

1092
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,300
NARRATOR: At the secret talks in Paris,

1093
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,465
Kissinger had offered his
North Vietnamese counterpart,

1094
00:59:41,565 --> 00:59:44,766
Le Duc Tho, the most
significant concessions

1095
00:59:44,865 --> 00:59:47,833
the United States had yet made:

1096
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:51,432
North Vietnam could keep
its troops in the South...

1097
00:59:51,532 --> 00:59:53,432
tens of thousands of them.

1098
00:59:53,532 --> 00:59:57,932
And in exchange for the release
of American prisoners of war,

1099
00:59:58,032 --> 00:59:59,632
all American troops

1100
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:03,000
would be withdrawn within seven months.

1101
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:08,565
Le Duc Tho countered with
a new offer of his own:

1102
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,865
Hanoi would release the prisoners

1103
01:00:10,965 --> 01:00:14,766
simultaneously with the
departure of U.S. forces.

1104
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:18,032
But he still insisted
that Washington remove

1105
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:21,599
President Thieu from power.

1106
01:00:21,699 --> 01:00:24,465
Kissinger was encouraged
that the North Vietnamese

1107
01:00:24,565 --> 01:00:28,333
seemed, for the first time,
to be negotiating seriously.

1108
01:00:28,432 --> 01:00:33,199
He could almost "taste
peace," he told a friend.

1109
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,865
Thieu knew nothing

1110
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:38,099
about the new American
concessions to Hanoi.

1111
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:42,065
He was worried about something else.

1112
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:47,199
ANNOUNCER: NBC News interrupts
regular programming

1113
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:49,032
to bring you a special report.

1114
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:51,599
The announcement I shall
now read is being issued

1115
01:00:51,699 --> 01:00:56,365
simultaneously in Peking
and in the United States.

1116
01:00:56,465 --> 01:00:58,132
NARRATOR: Richard Nixon,

1117
01:00:58,233 --> 01:01:01,333
famous for the ferocity
of his anticommunism,

1118
01:01:01,432 --> 01:01:03,965
astonished the world by announcing

1119
01:01:04,065 --> 01:01:07,599
that he was planning to
restore relations with China

1120
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:11,065
that had been severed for
more than two decades.

1121
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:14,800
The United States had
gone to war in Vietnam

1122
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,932
in part to block Chinese expansionism.

1123
01:01:18,032 --> 01:01:22,166
What would Nixon's visit
mean for Thieu's future

1124
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:24,500
or for that of his country?

1125
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:27,766
Thieu was afraid he knew.

1126
01:01:27,865 --> 01:01:30,500
"America has been looking
for a new mistress,"

1127
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:31,900
he told an aide,

1128
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,733
"and now Nixon has discovered China.

1129
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:38,565
"He does not want to have
the old mistress around.

1130
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:42,400
Vietnam has become old and ugly."

1131
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:58,699
KUSHNER: I believe it was
in the fall of 1971.

1132
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,400
And they called us out and
they hung a bed sheet

1133
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:10,166
and they had a projector and they showed us

1134
01:02:10,266 --> 01:02:13,733
color and black and white movies

1135
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:17,132
of these protests in Washington.

1136
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,166
(shouting)

1137
01:02:21,932 --> 01:02:23,865
And in the same film

1138
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:26,132
it showed John Kerry.

1139
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:28,365
And I remember he was very articulate,

1140
01:02:28,465 --> 01:02:30,632
very, very well spoken,

1141
01:02:30,733 --> 01:02:33,699
very fluent

1142
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,400
and a good spokesman

1143
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,900
for his cause.

1144
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,065
Someone has to die so that President Nixon

1145
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:42,766
won't be... and these are his words...

1146
01:02:42,865 --> 01:02:46,599
"the first president to lose a war."

1147
01:02:46,699 --> 01:02:47,865
And I remember very well,

1148
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,500
he's sitting with his fatigue jacket

1149
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:52,199
and long hair

1150
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,432
and testifying about atrocities

1151
01:02:54,532 --> 01:02:56,465
and war crimes that...

1152
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:58,565
we perpetrated.

1153
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:01,632
Cut off limbs, blown up bodies,

1154
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:04,000
randomly shot at civilians...

1155
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:06,065
KUSHNER: But I was shocked by what he said.

1156
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:07,900
And I didn't believe it.

1157
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,365
I didn't believe it at all.

1158
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:15,965
I mean, I'm sophisticated
to know, and I knew then,

1159
01:03:16,065 --> 01:03:18,565
that bad things happen in war
and they happen on both sides,

1160
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:22,300
and I had seen the evidence
of the other side too, also.

1161
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,699
And I knew it.

1162
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,032
And... but still, to hear the testimony

1163
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:31,065
and to hear it used as a weapon

1164
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:33,699
against our further prosecution of this war

1165
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:38,632
that we were suffering for
was very powerful indeed.

1166
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:41,365
NARRATOR: A few months later

1167
01:03:41,465 --> 01:03:44,632
Kushner got an even bigger shock.

1168
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:47,000
VALERIE KUSHNER (on recording):
My son has no father.

1169
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:50,699
This Christmas Day we celebrate
the birth of a son to Mary

1170
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,365
and this Christmas Day
some other mother's son

1171
01:03:53,465 --> 01:03:55,800
will die in Vietnam.

1172
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,465
That death takes away all
that was taught to us

1173
01:03:58,565 --> 01:04:01,132
by Christ's birth.

1174
01:04:01,233 --> 01:04:03,532
KUSHNER: The whole time I was in the South

1175
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:05,965
I never got one letter,
one bit of information.

1176
01:04:06,065 --> 01:04:08,099
When I got to North
Vietnam I got no letter,

1177
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:10,632
no bit of information, nothing.

1178
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:16,365
Then, I think it may have
been Christmas of '71,

1179
01:04:16,465 --> 01:04:20,900
my wife wrote an op-ed piece
in theNew York Times.

1180
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,465
She had become politically active.

1181
01:04:24,565 --> 01:04:26,800
NARRATOR: The families of POWs

1182
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,565
overwhelmingly supported
the Nixon administration.

1183
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:33,565
Valerie Kushner did not,

1184
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:35,300
and the North Vietnamese were quick

1185
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,632
to exploit her antiwar views.

1186
01:04:38,733 --> 01:04:40,565
They broadcast a message

1187
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:43,599
they had permitted her
husband to record for her.

1188
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:46,400
It was the first time
she had heard his voice

1189
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,432
in four years.

1190
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:53,500
KUSHNER (on recording): I
received the glasses, Val,

1191
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,365
and my eyes have improved considerably.

1192
01:04:56,465 --> 01:04:59,099
Please let me know about Brother John.

1193
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,666
He or she is almost four now,

1194
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:04,333
and he or she is old enough to understand

1195
01:05:04,432 --> 01:05:07,865
where Daddy is and that I love him or her

1196
01:05:07,965 --> 01:05:11,233
immeasurably despite our never meeting.

1197
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:14,965
I calculate that T-Bird
is now in second grade,

1198
01:05:15,065 --> 01:05:17,099
and I know she is doing well.

1199
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:19,000
She is a grown-up lady now

1200
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:22,932
and I hope you have plans for
piano or ballet lessons soon.

1201
01:05:23,032 --> 01:05:25,532
Happy eighth birthday, dear T-Bird,

1202
01:05:25,632 --> 01:05:27,099
and Merry Christmas.

1203
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:29,432
When I left you I promised to come home

1204
01:05:29,532 --> 01:05:31,065
before you were five.

1205
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:34,900
I didn't fulfill that promise,
but when I do return,

1206
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,565
I will never leave you again.

1207
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:40,365
His optimism about the
whole situation amazes me.

1208
01:05:40,465 --> 01:05:41,833
I'm just very happy

1209
01:05:41,932 --> 01:05:44,300
that he can't see this morning's newspaper.

1210
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,365
Because I-I don't have the same optimism

1211
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:49,132
or the same confidence in this government

1212
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:52,032
that he seems to have.

1213
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,465
NARRATOR: President Nixon's visit
to China in February of 1972

1214
01:06:01,565 --> 01:06:04,099
not only alarmed President Thieu,

1215
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:07,065
it worried Hanoi as well.

1216
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:10,300
The North Vietnamese
remembered how Ho Chi Minh

1217
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,300
had felt betrayed in 1954

1218
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,000
when Moscow and Beijing had compelled them

1219
01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:20,233
to sign the Geneva Accords,
dividing Vietnam in two.

1220
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:23,432
Now, they were concerned
that warmer relations

1221
01:06:23,532 --> 01:06:25,800
between the United States and China

1222
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,699
might soon mean less support from Beijing.

1223
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,632
Nixon was also planning to travel to Moscow

1224
01:06:33,733 --> 01:06:37,199
to meet with Soviet
premier Leonid Brezhnev,

1225
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,099
seeking to ease tensions

1226
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:43,000
with North Vietnam's
other communist patron.

1227
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:47,800
Before that summit took place,
First Secretary Le Duan,

1228
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,766
the man who headed the Politburo in Hanoi,

1229
01:06:50,865 --> 01:06:54,233
decided to undertake a
new kind of offensive.

1230
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:58,032
It would be conventional warfare this time,

1231
01:06:58,132 --> 01:07:02,000
and on a scale he had
never before attempted.

1232
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:04,900
Le Duan had several goals in mind:

1233
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,333
to strengthen his hand at the peace talks

1234
01:07:07,432 --> 01:07:09,865
by altering the military balance of power

1235
01:07:09,965 --> 01:07:11,532
in South Vietnam,

1236
01:07:11,632 --> 01:07:15,032
to show that the ARVN could
not stand on their own,

1237
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:18,833
and to convince the Soviets and the Chinese

1238
01:07:18,932 --> 01:07:22,800
his revolution was still worth supporting.

1239
01:07:26,932 --> 01:07:30,865
The assault began on March 30, 1972.

1240
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:34,400
14 North Vietnamese infantry divisions...

1241
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,132
more than 120,000 men...

1242
01:07:37,233 --> 01:07:39,733
now, for the first time,

1243
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:43,766
supported by hundreds of
Soviet and Chinese-made tanks

1244
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:48,932
and other armored vehicles,
attacked on three fronts:

1245
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:52,699
across the demilitarized zone,

1246
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:57,199
in the Central Highlands

1247
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:01,766
and west of Saigon.

1248
01:08:01,865 --> 01:08:06,900
Americans would call it
"The Easter Offensive."

1249
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,800
To the South Vietnamese,

1250
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:13,432
it would be remembered as
"The Summer of Flames."

1251
01:08:13,533 --> 01:08:16,600
REPORTER: The South Vietnamese
Army knew this day was coming:

1252
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:17,966
the day without Americans.

1253
01:08:18,065 --> 01:08:19,399
It was to be the big test,

1254
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,733
both for them

1255
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:23,765
and for President Nixon's
Vietnamization program.

1256
01:08:23,865 --> 01:08:26,733
The results in so far are not encouraging.

1257
01:08:26,832 --> 01:08:29,800
Whole battalions of the
government's third division

1258
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:32,199
joined the refugees on the road south.

1259
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:36,132
They had been outnumbered,
overpowered, overwhelmed.

1260
01:08:36,233 --> 01:08:38,432
NARRATOR: An entire ARVN regiment

1261
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:40,733
surrendered at Camp Carroll.

1262
01:08:40,832 --> 01:08:42,600
North Vietnamese troops

1263
01:08:42,699 --> 01:08:45,500
then swiftly overran Quang Tri Province,

1264
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,565
driving tens of thousands of
terrified refugees southward.

1265
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:54,199
They nearly cut South Vietnam in half

1266
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:57,033
through the Central Highlands

1267
01:08:57,132 --> 01:09:01,332
and drove toward Saigon,
hoping to seize large areas

1268
01:09:01,432 --> 01:09:04,365
along the Cambodian border.

1269
01:09:04,466 --> 01:09:07,265
It looked as if it were going to be

1270
01:09:07,365 --> 01:09:10,033
a total defeat for the ARVN.

1271
01:09:10,132 --> 01:09:14,065
There were only 60,000 U.S.
military personnel

1272
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:16,132
left in South Vietnam,

1273
01:09:16,233 --> 01:09:19,233
and very few of them were combat troops.

1274
01:09:21,765 --> 01:09:24,865
Suddenly, the survival of
everything Nixon and Kissinger

1275
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:27,199
had worked for was in peril.

1276
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:31,632
They had to do something... and fast.

1277
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,233
NARRATOR: Nixon ordered
up Operation Linebacker...

1278
01:09:57,332 --> 01:09:59,832
massive air attacks

1279
01:09:59,932 --> 01:10:01,332
on the advancing North Vietnamese.

1280
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:05,233
"The bastards have never been bombed

1281
01:10:05,332 --> 01:10:08,265
"like they're going to
be this time," he said.

1282
01:10:11,966 --> 01:10:15,166
The most crucial battle
of the Easter Offensive

1283
01:10:15,265 --> 01:10:17,000
was fought at An Loc,

1284
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,666
a city that commanded Route 13,

1285
01:10:19,765 --> 01:10:23,000
a paved highway that led
directly to Saigon,

1286
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,399
just 60 miles away.

1287
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,600
North Vietnamese artillery fire

1288
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:32,632
and a massive infantry and armor attack

1289
01:10:32,733 --> 01:10:34,832
drove the city's ARVN defenders

1290
01:10:34,932 --> 01:10:39,233
into an area less than a mile square.

1291
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:44,666
Repeated efforts to reinforce
and resupply them failed.

1292
01:10:44,765 --> 01:10:48,065
The ARVN bravely held out.

1293
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:50,600
JAMES WILLBANKS: The
number one thing we did

1294
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:53,300
was coordinate the air strikes.

1295
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:55,832
General Hollingsworth
went to General Abrams

1296
01:10:55,932 --> 01:10:58,033
and begged for all the B-52s he could get,

1297
01:10:58,132 --> 01:10:59,966
and on the 10th and 11th of May,

1298
01:11:00,065 --> 01:11:05,765
he planned a B-52 strike every
50 minutes for 24 hours.

1299
01:11:16,432 --> 01:11:17,666
NARRATOR: In the end,

1300
01:11:17,765 --> 01:11:22,166
American airpower made the difference.

1301
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:30,365
The North Vietnamese and
their armored columns,

1302
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:31,899
massed in the open,

1303
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,832
proved easy targets for American pilots.

1304
01:11:35,932 --> 01:11:39,899
"This," one American advisor said,

1305
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,966
"was the kind of war we came to fight."

1306
01:11:54,632 --> 01:11:57,600
PHAM LUC:

1307
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:37,600
(explosion)

1308
01:12:37,699 --> 01:12:41,000
NARRATOR: The North Vietnamese
suffered 10,000 casualties

1309
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,832
at An Loc alone

1310
01:12:42,932 --> 01:12:47,065
and lost most of their
tanks and heavy artillery.

1311
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,666
(explosions continue)

1312
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,899
WILLBANKS: The bottom line
was that all the air power

1313
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,600
in the world would not make a difference

1314
01:12:54,699 --> 01:12:56,108
if the ARVN hadn't stood and fought.

1315
01:12:56,132 --> 01:12:57,565
(people shouting)

1316
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:01,033
They had held Kon Tum,
they had held An Loc,

1317
01:13:01,132 --> 01:13:02,800
they had re-taken Quang Tri.

1318
01:13:02,899 --> 01:13:04,966
They had taken the best
that the North Vietnamese

1319
01:13:05,065 --> 01:13:06,699
had to throw at them.

1320
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,033
So I thought if we continue
to maintain that support,

1321
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:11,332
perhaps they had a chance.

1322
01:13:11,432 --> 01:13:15,332
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: The
Easter Offensive, to me,

1323
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:18,666
showed that the South
Vietnamese could fight,

1324
01:13:18,765 --> 01:13:21,733
but only up to a certain point.

1325
01:13:21,832 --> 01:13:24,500
So, my question would be,

1326
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,500
what would happen when the Americans left

1327
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,166
with their B-52s, you know?

1328
01:13:29,265 --> 01:13:30,765
(protestors chanting)

1329
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,932
NARRATOR: Americans may have
approved of the renewed use

1330
01:13:34,033 --> 01:13:37,300
of American air power to
stop the communist advance

1331
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:38,765
into the South,

1332
01:13:38,865 --> 01:13:43,432
but Nixon had also ordered
American planes to resume

1333
01:13:43,533 --> 01:13:46,733
sustained bombing of North Vietnam,

1334
01:13:46,832 --> 01:13:50,399
which had been halted since
the Johnson administration.

1335
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,300
Some saw the new bombing,
which vastly exceeded

1336
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:56,399
all previous campaigns,

1337
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:01,233
as evidence that a war Nixon
had promised was winding down

1338
01:14:01,332 --> 01:14:04,100
was once again being escalated.

1339
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:07,533
(plane soaring)

1340
01:14:07,632 --> 01:14:09,065
LESLIE GELB: The bombing campaign

1341
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,632
was much more extensive

1342
01:14:10,733 --> 01:14:15,199
than the bombing campaign
under Lyndon Johnson.

1343
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,365
And from a standpoint

1344
01:14:16,466 --> 01:14:18,966
of pressuring them to make concessions

1345
01:14:19,065 --> 01:14:20,899
at the negotiating table,

1346
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,365
historically, that's how you did it.

1347
01:14:23,466 --> 01:14:25,699
Only it didn't work with these guys.

1348
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,632
(bombs exploding)

1349
01:14:27,733 --> 01:14:29,399
They took the pounding.

1350
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:33,265
(men yelling in Vietnamese)

1351
01:14:36,533 --> 01:14:40,132
NARRATOR: Le Minh Khue,
who had served four years

1352
01:14:40,233 --> 01:14:43,600
as a Youth Volunteer on
the Ho Chi Minh trail,

1353
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:46,332
was now back home in North Vietnam.

1354
01:14:47,632 --> 01:14:50,832
LE MINH KHUE:

1355
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,300
NARRATOR: Among the thousands
of South Vietnamese

1356
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:34,100
who lost their lives in
the Easter Offensive

1357
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:37,365
was the brother of Phan Quang Tue.

1358
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:40,000
PHAN QUANG TUE: I had a brother, Tuan.

1359
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:44,199
And we were raised together.

1360
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:48,000
He would have been now 67.

1361
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,832
When his plane was shot down

1362
01:15:50,932 --> 01:15:55,000
and later on they weren't
able to recover him,

1363
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,666
his body, so he disappeared,

1364
01:15:57,765 --> 01:16:02,132
he was missing in action,
he was 26 years old.

1365
01:16:02,233 --> 01:16:05,600
He has his full life ahead of him.

1366
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:08,699
(voice breaking): Tuan never
had a chance to live his life.

1367
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,432
And I can never overcome the feeling,

1368
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:18,632
as to himself

1369
01:16:18,733 --> 01:16:20,966
and his generation,

1370
01:16:21,065 --> 01:16:24,300
sacrifice their lives for what?

1371
01:16:26,132 --> 01:16:30,466
And the frustrating thing is
that even Vietnamese themself

1372
01:16:30,565 --> 01:16:32,500
do not seem to value that loss.

1373
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,800
NIXON: There's only one
way to stop the killing.

1374
01:16:41,899 --> 01:16:45,533
That is to keep the weapons
of war out of the hands

1375
01:16:45,632 --> 01:16:51,365
of the international
outlaws of North Vietnam.

1376
01:16:51,466 --> 01:16:52,699
Throughout the war in Vietnam,

1377
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,565
the United States has exercised
a degree of restraint

1378
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,800
unprecedented in the annals of war...

1379
01:16:57,899 --> 01:16:59,399
(planes flying overhead)

1380
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,300
NARRATOR: Le Duan's Easter
Offensive, like Tet,

1381
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:04,632
had been a great gamble.

1382
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:07,466
So was Nixon's next move.

1383
01:17:07,565 --> 01:17:10,600
The massive North Vietnamese
assault had failed,

1384
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:12,100
the president said,

1385
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:15,233
but it could never have been
mounted in the first place

1386
01:17:15,332 --> 01:17:17,832
without weapons and
supplies provided by China

1387
01:17:17,932 --> 01:17:20,500
and the Soviet Union.

1388
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,765
Accordingly, he ordered 11,000 mines laid

1389
01:17:24,865 --> 01:17:28,265
in North Vietnamese waters
to block further access

1390
01:17:28,365 --> 01:17:30,033
to Haiphong harbor.

1391
01:17:30,132 --> 01:17:33,865
It was something the Joint
Chiefs had been asking for

1392
01:17:33,966 --> 01:17:35,800
for years.

1393
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:38,033
The scheduled summit with the Soviets

1394
01:17:38,132 --> 01:17:39,832
was just two weeks away,

1395
01:17:39,932 --> 01:17:42,132
and some advisors had urged the president

1396
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:45,166
not to take any action
that directly threatened

1397
01:17:45,265 --> 01:17:49,033
Soviet ships, for fear
they would cancel it.

1398
01:17:49,132 --> 01:17:51,733
Nixon thought he had to take the risk.

1399
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:55,899
And so he spoke directly to Moscow.

1400
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,432
Let us not slide back
toward the dark shadows

1401
01:17:59,533 --> 01:18:02,365
of a previous age.

1402
01:18:02,466 --> 01:18:07,132
We do not ask you to
sacrifice your principles

1403
01:18:07,233 --> 01:18:09,233
or your friends,

1404
01:18:09,332 --> 01:18:12,666
but neither should you
permit Hanoi's intransigence

1405
01:18:12,765 --> 01:18:15,365
to blot out the prospects we together

1406
01:18:15,466 --> 01:18:16,832
have so patiently prepared.

1407
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:22,399
NARRATOR: Nixon's gamble paid off.

1408
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,065
The Soviets and the Chinese denounced

1409
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:29,600
the president's action,
but then did nothing.

1410
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:34,765
On May 26, the United States
and the Soviet Union signed

1411
01:18:34,865 --> 01:18:38,800
an historic Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,

1412
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:42,100
the first agreement to
limit nuclear armaments

1413
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:44,565
since the Cold War began.

1414
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:47,733
For the Soviet Union, for China,

1415
01:18:47,832 --> 01:18:50,199
as well as for the United States,

1416
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:54,800
Vietnam's significance
was steadily receding.

1417
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,166
NIXON: I know.

1418
01:19:57,065 --> 01:19:59,000
(camera shutter clicks)

1419
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:05,765
NARRATOR: On the morning of June 8, 1972,

1420
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:10,265
Nick Ut, a 21-year-old South
Vietnamese photographer

1421
01:20:10,365 --> 01:20:12,600
working for the Associated Press,

1422
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:16,132
was accompanying ARVN
troops on Highway One,

1423
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:18,699
moving toward a village called Trang Bang,

1424
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,565
to dislodge North Vietnamese forces

1425
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:25,432
that had occupied it during
the Easter Offensive.

1426
01:20:25,533 --> 01:20:28,699
Ut was beginning to put his cameras away,

1427
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,733
ready to return to Saigon,

1428
01:20:30,832 --> 01:20:35,565
when he saw a South Vietnamese
fighter suddenly dip down

1429
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:37,699
toward the fleeing refugees,

1430
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,699
whom the pilot mistook for the enemy.

1431
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,033
(explosions)

1432
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:49,932
(camera shutter clicking)

1433
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:57,399
(speaking English):

1434
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,132
(speaking Vietnamese)

1435
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:09,199
NARRATOR: Ut drove the badly
burned girl, Kim Phuc,

1436
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,533
and several other injured children

1437
01:22:11,632 --> 01:22:13,865
to a hospital in Saigon.

1438
01:22:13,966 --> 01:22:18,332
She had been burned over 30% of her body.

1439
01:22:18,432 --> 01:22:21,666
Then, Ut raced to the AP darkroom

1440
01:22:21,765 --> 01:22:25,166
to find out what he had caught on film.

1441
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:46,265
NARRATOR: His photo
editor in Saigon told him

1442
01:22:46,365 --> 01:22:49,332
they could not send the
picture out on the wire,

1443
01:22:49,432 --> 01:22:51,800
because the girl was naked.

1444
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:54,332
But then Ut's boss,

1445
01:22:54,432 --> 01:22:58,100
the legendary combat
photographer Horst Faas,

1446
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:00,132
saw the pictures.

1447
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,265
UT:

1448
01:23:12,065 --> 01:23:15,966
NARRATOR: Nick Ut's photograph appeared

1449
01:23:16,065 --> 01:23:18,865
on front pages around the world

1450
01:23:18,966 --> 01:23:22,899
and won the Pulitzer Prize.

1451
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,899
For many Americans,

1452
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,233
even many of those who
had supported the war,

1453
01:23:29,332 --> 01:23:33,932
the image seemed to signal
that enough was enough.

1454
01:23:37,533 --> 01:23:39,899
Kim Phuc would survive.

1455
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,432
She eventually left Vietnam
and settled outside Toronto.

1456
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:55,100
(cheers and applause)

1457
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,265
(rhythmic clapping)

1458
01:24:00,865 --> 01:24:04,865
I introduce Valerie Kushner of Virginia

1459
01:24:04,966 --> 01:24:07,632
to second the nomination
of George McGovern.

1460
01:24:07,733 --> 01:24:09,932
(applause and cheering)

1461
01:24:10,033 --> 01:24:13,632
Mr. Chairman, Democrats,

1462
01:24:13,733 --> 01:24:18,199
my participation in this
convention is a tribute

1463
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,466
to the reforms instituted
by the Democratic Party,

1464
01:24:21,565 --> 01:24:25,500
for I am a woman, and I am under 30.

1465
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,166
But I also represent an
even smaller minority:

1466
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:32,000
the wives of Americans who are missing

1467
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,533
or imprisoned in Southeast Asia.

1468
01:24:34,632 --> 01:24:38,166
(cheers and applause)

1469
01:24:38,265 --> 01:24:40,932
NARRATOR: Valerie Kushner,

1470
01:24:41,033 --> 01:24:44,500
hoping to get her husband,
Hal, home as soon as possible,

1471
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,533
had become an ardent
supporter of the candidacy

1472
01:24:47,632 --> 01:24:51,233
of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota.

1473
01:24:51,332 --> 01:24:55,365
A decorated bomber pilot in World War II,

1474
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:58,166
McGovern had called for an early end

1475
01:24:58,265 --> 01:24:59,565
to the bombing of the North,

1476
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:02,765
a halt to Congressional
funding for the war,

1477
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:04,765
and immediate withdrawal

1478
01:25:04,865 --> 01:25:09,432
from Vietnam once the POWs were released.

1479
01:25:09,533 --> 01:25:12,932
I knew that he would bring my husband home.

1480
01:25:13,033 --> 01:25:15,666
(applause)

1481
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:21,865
But even more important, he
will bring America home.

1482
01:25:21,966 --> 01:25:24,932
(applause and cheering)

1483
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:28,033
And it is for that reason

1484
01:25:28,132 --> 01:25:30,399
that I am proud to second the nomination

1485
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:35,233
of our next president, Senator George S.
McGovern.

1486
01:25:35,332 --> 01:25:38,265
(applause and cheering)

1487
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,033
NARRATOR: By the time her candidate

1488
01:25:43,132 --> 01:25:45,533
finally accepted the nomination,

1489
01:25:45,632 --> 01:25:48,265
it was 2:48 in the morning.

1490
01:25:48,365 --> 01:25:51,300
Most Americans were asleep.

1491
01:25:51,399 --> 01:25:56,233
McGOVERN: During four
administrations of both parties,

1492
01:25:56,332 --> 01:26:01,300
a terrible war has been
charted behind closed doors.

1493
01:26:01,399 --> 01:26:03,432
(cheers and applause)

1494
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,899
I want those doors opened,

1495
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
and I want that war closed.

1496
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,765
(raucous cheers and applause)

1497
01:26:11,865 --> 01:26:13,332
(static)

1498
01:26:13,432 --> 01:26:17,132
NARRATOR: McGovern's
campaign quickly collapsed.

1499
01:26:17,233 --> 01:26:20,432
He botched the selection
of his running mate,

1500
01:26:20,533 --> 01:26:23,800
and secretly asked an aide in Paris

1501
01:26:23,899 --> 01:26:27,166
to talk with the North
Vietnamese about POWs,

1502
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:32,365
and then denied he'd meddled
in the peace process.

1503
01:26:32,466 --> 01:26:34,432
Organized labor,

1504
01:26:34,533 --> 01:26:37,600
traditionally the Democrats'
most reliable ally,

1505
01:26:37,699 --> 01:26:40,533
refused to endorse the party's candidate

1506
01:26:40,632 --> 01:26:44,166
for the first time in 20 years.

1507
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:50,000
McGovern's poll numbers eroded
steadily over the summer.

1508
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:53,033
Still, hoping to find material

1509
01:26:53,132 --> 01:26:56,033
that might be used to smear the opposition,

1510
01:26:56,132 --> 01:26:59,765
Nixon's aides had already
authorized the Plumbers

1511
01:26:59,865 --> 01:27:02,065
to make another break-in,

1512
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:05,800
this time at Democratic
National Headquarters

1513
01:27:05,899 --> 01:27:08,699
in the Washington, D.C., apartment complex

1514
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,733
called the Watergate.

1515
01:27:11,832 --> 01:27:13,832
They had been caught.

1516
01:27:13,932 --> 01:27:16,565
JOHN CHANCELLOR: One of the most
fascinating and exotic stories

1517
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:18,365
ever to come out of Washington, D.C.,

1518
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,399
is the talk of the Capitol today.

1519
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,466
Five men were arrested early Saturday

1520
01:27:22,565 --> 01:27:25,365
while trying to install
eavesdropping equipment

1521
01:27:25,466 --> 01:27:27,565
at the Democratic National Committee.

1522
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:29,865
And it turns out that one
of them has an office

1523
01:27:29,966 --> 01:27:32,233
in the headquarters of the Committee

1524
01:27:32,332 --> 01:27:34,065
for the Re-Election of the President.

1525
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:37,466

Jane Fonda was...

1533
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:12,765
was one of our major fantasies.

1534

You know? I mean, major fantasies.

1535
01:28:17,065 --> 01:28:20,300
And, uh, we couldn't believe it

1536
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:24,733
when that fantasy went to North Vietnam.

1537
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,399
She was held to a different
standard of conduct

1538

by being our fantasy, you
know, our dream girl.

1539

NARRATOR: Over the years, a steady stream

1547
01:28:58,033 --> 01:29:01,533
of Americans opposed to the
war would visit Hanoi,

1548
01:29:01,632 --> 01:29:04,865
including the folk singer Joan Baez,

1549
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:08,533
David Dellinger of the
War Resisters League,

1550
01:29:08,632 --> 01:29:11,832
the writer Susan Sontag,

1551
01:29:11,932 --> 01:29:16,300
and Tom Hayden of the
Indochina Peace Campaign.

1552
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:19,533
But no visitor made more headlines

1553
01:29:19,632 --> 01:29:21,966
than the actress Jane Fonda.

1554
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:25,399
During two weeks in the summer of 1972,

1555
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:29,733
she broadcast at least ten
times over Radio Hanoi,

1556
01:29:29,832 --> 01:29:32,199
denouncing American POWs

1557
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,666
for having committed war crimes,

1558
01:29:34,765 --> 01:29:37,265
urging the North Vietnamese to hold out

1559
01:29:37,365 --> 01:29:40,733
against American imperialism.

1560
01:29:40,832 --> 01:29:44,199
Many Americans would never forgive her

1561
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,565
for what she did and said.

1562
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:50,100
FONDA: According to international law,

1563
01:29:50,199 --> 01:29:52,600
these men are war criminals.

1564
01:29:52,699 --> 01:29:54,166
That's according to law,

1565
01:29:54,265 --> 01:29:55,576
according to the Nuremberg principles,

1566
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,000
according to the Geneva Accord, and others.

1567
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,000
They should be tried in front of a court

1568
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,533
and probably executed for what they did.

1569
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:07,199
MUSGRAVE: She's taken a lot
of heat for what she did.

1570
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,865
And deservedly so.

1571
01:30:09,966 --> 01:30:13,466
She did some things that were terrible.

1572
01:30:13,565 --> 01:30:16,132
And-and, yes,

1573
01:30:16,233 --> 01:30:18,733
we have a right to be pissed off at her.

1574
01:30:18,832 --> 01:30:21,733
But, you know,

1575
01:30:21,832 --> 01:30:24,565
she wasn't the only one.

1576
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:29,166
She's just the only one
we fantasized about.

1577
01:30:30,166 --> 01:30:34,600
(cheers and applause)

1578
01:30:39,365 --> 01:30:41,500
AUDIENCE: Four more years!

1579
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,432
Four more years! Four more years!

1582
01:30:49,033 --> 01:30:52,065
We have ended America's ground combat role.

No draftees are being sent to Vietnam.

1584
01:30:54,832 --> 01:30:57,733
We have reduced our casualties by 98%.

1585
01:30:57,832 --> 01:30:59,632
We've gone the extra mile.

1586
01:30:59,733 --> 01:31:02,432
In fact, we've gone tens
of thousands of miles

1587
01:31:02,533 --> 01:31:04,932
trying to seek a negotiated
settlement of the war.

1588
01:31:05,033 --> 01:31:06,699
(applause)

1589
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,500
There are three things,
however, that we have not

1590
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,632
and that we will not offer.

1591
01:31:11,733 --> 01:31:14,832
We will never abandon our prisoners of war.

1592
01:31:14,932 --> 01:31:16,332
(cheers and applause)

1593
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:23,832
And, second,

1594
01:31:23,932 --> 01:31:27,500
we will not join our enemies

1595
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,100
in imposing a communist
government on our ally,

1596
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,533
the 17 million people of South Vietnam.

1597
01:31:33,632 --> 01:31:36,332
(cheers and applause)

1598
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:41,565
And we will never stain the honor

1599
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:43,733
of the United States of America.

1600
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,765
(cheers)

1601
01:32:26,765 --> 01:32:29,865
NARRATOR: Back in Paris, Henry
Kissinger was determined

1602
01:32:29,966 --> 01:32:34,399
to hammer out a peace agreement
before Election Day.

1603
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,765
Now Le Duc Tho made a key concession.

1604
01:32:37,865 --> 01:32:40,065
Hanoi no longer insisted

1605
01:32:40,166 --> 01:32:43,699
that President Thieu had to go.

1606
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,533
JOHN NEGROPONTE: There was
somehow this compulsion

1607
01:32:46,632 --> 01:32:50,132
to come to some kind of an agreement.

1608
01:32:50,233 --> 01:32:53,132
I remember Le Duc Tho when he
produced the draft agreement

1609
01:32:53,233 --> 01:32:59,466
in October 8 of '72 to Kissinger, saying,

1610
01:32:59,565 --> 01:33:00,865
"You're in a hurry, aren't you?

1611
01:33:00,966 --> 01:33:02,865
You want to do this quickly."

1612
01:33:02,966 --> 01:33:06,533
And-and the response was, "Yes."

1613
01:33:06,632 --> 01:33:10,065
NARRATOR: The two sides
soon had a tentative deal,

1614
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:12,065
a "cease-fire in place"

1615
01:33:12,166 --> 01:33:14,565
to be followed within 60 days

1616
01:33:14,666 --> 01:33:17,565
by a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops

1617
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:21,166
and the return of all American POWs.

1618
01:33:21,265 --> 01:33:25,432
The United States stopped
bombing the North.

1619
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:31,033
No one had told President
Thieu any of the terms.

1620
01:33:32,666 --> 01:33:36,365
The day before Kissinger was to
arrive in Saigon to brief him,

1621
01:33:36,466 --> 01:33:40,100
Thieu was handed a document
found in an enemy bunker

1622
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:42,332
in Quang Tin Province.

1623
01:33:42,432 --> 01:33:46,765
It was entitled "General
Instructions for Cease-Fire."

1624
01:33:46,865 --> 01:33:51,533
It meant that communist cadres
in an isolated province

1625
01:33:51,632 --> 01:33:55,966
of his own country already
knew more about what Kissinger

1626
01:33:56,065 --> 01:34:01,000
and Le Duc Tho had agreed
to in Paris than he did.

1627
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:04,432
NEGROPONTE: And imagine
being given an agreement

1628
01:34:04,533 --> 01:34:09,899
concerning the fate of
your own country and, uh,

1629
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,666
being told that you really don't have

1630
01:34:11,765 --> 01:34:15,332
any input in the matter.

1631
01:34:15,432 --> 01:34:18,899
And, oh, by the way, we
didn't even yet have

1632
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,800
the Vietnamese translation,

1633
01:34:20,899 --> 01:34:22,632
because that hadn't been completed.

1634
01:34:22,733 --> 01:34:26,199
And we gave him the English version.

1635
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:29,533
So, I mean, as a professional diplomat,

1636
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:32,800
somebody who's been in this
business all my life, uh,

1637
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:35,565
I've got to tell you,
that just an awful lot

1638
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:38,365
of diplomatic rules were broken there.

1639
01:34:38,466 --> 01:34:42,300
NARRATOR: Thieu refused
to accept the terms.

1640
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:45,565
Allowing North Vietnamese
troops to remain in the South

1641
01:34:45,666 --> 01:34:48,733
would be the death of his country.

1642
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:53,000
Nonetheless, after Kissinger returned home

1643
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,533
12 days before the election,

1644
01:34:55,632 --> 01:34:59,800
he told the press, "Peace is at hand."

1645
01:34:59,899 --> 01:35:02,365
("Tail Dragger" by Link Wray playing)

1646
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:08,399
On November 7, 1972,

1647
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,565
Richard Nixon won a stunning victory.

1648
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:16,399
He was reelected with more
than 60% of the popular vote...

1649
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:22,399
521 electoral votes to McGovern's 17.

1650
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:26,199
He took every single state
except Massachusetts

1651
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,800
and the District of Columbia.

1652
01:35:28,899 --> 01:35:32,000
Now, the president resolved to rid himself

1653
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:37,666
of Vietnam completely before
his second inauguration.

1654
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:40,533
To calm Thieu's fears of what was to come,

1655
01:35:40,632 --> 01:35:43,466
Nixon launched another massive airlift

1656
01:35:43,565 --> 01:35:46,399
of military equipment to South Vietnam.

1657
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,500
"If we had given this aid
to the North Vietnamese,"

1658
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,399
one American general said,

1659
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:55,800
"they could have fought us for
the rest of the century."

1660
01:35:55,899 --> 01:35:59,765
The Paris peace talks resumed.

1661
01:35:59,865 --> 01:36:03,132
But then, Le Duc Tho suddenly announced

1662
01:36:03,233 --> 01:36:07,399
he needed to return to
Hanoi for consultation.

1663
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,408
NEGROPONTE: We could only
conclude that maybe they were

1664
01:36:09,432 --> 01:36:10,899
having some doubts about whether

1665
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,899
they wanted to go through
with the agreement,

1666
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,600
because we had sent so many supplies

1667
01:36:15,699 --> 01:36:18,800
to Saigon in the intervening weeks.

1668
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:21,500
NARRATOR: There turned out to be dissension

1669
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,132
on the communist side as well.

1670
01:36:24,233 --> 01:36:27,699
Hanoi, like Washington, had
not bothered to consult

1671
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,932
with its southern comrades.

1672
01:36:30,033 --> 01:36:32,733
It had dropped the two
demands that meant the most

1673
01:36:32,832 --> 01:36:36,765
to the Viet Cong... the removal
of Thieu, and the release

1674
01:36:36,865 --> 01:36:40,000
of some 30,000 of their prisoners.

1675
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,065
"Hanoi's message was clear,"

1676
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:45,533
one bitter Viet Cong official said.

1677
01:36:45,632 --> 01:36:49,432
"It cared more about
American prisoners of war

1678
01:36:49,533 --> 01:36:52,199
than it did for us."

1679
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:55,832
Nixon ordered Kissinger
to suspend the talks,

1680
01:36:55,932 --> 01:36:58,865
and then he resumed the
bombing of North Vietnam

1681
01:36:58,966 --> 01:37:01,132
to further punish Hanoi,

1682
01:37:01,233 --> 01:37:04,065
and to signal to both Hanoi and Saigon

1683
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:07,733
that the United States
might use its airpower

1684
01:37:07,832 --> 01:37:10,000
to defend South Vietnam

1685
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:14,500
even after a peace agreement was signed.

1686
01:37:15,899 --> 01:37:17,733
On December 18,

1687
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:21,199
Nixon unleashed round-the-clock air strikes

1688
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,365
that flattened targets
around Hanoi and Haiphong.

1689
01:37:24,466 --> 01:37:26,199
(explosions)

1690
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:29,466
It would be remembered as
the Christmas Bombing.

1691
01:37:29,565 --> 01:37:32,899
(bombs exploding, people shouting)

1692
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,765
HAL KUSHNER: And all of a sudden,

1693
01:37:34,865 --> 01:37:36,865
around Christmastime,

1694
01:37:36,966 --> 01:37:39,265
we hear an Arc Light operation,

1695
01:37:39,365 --> 01:37:41,832
B-52s... bom-bom-bom-bom-bom.

1696
01:37:41,932 --> 01:37:43,800
And it's all around, and
it is just exploding.

1697
01:37:43,899 --> 01:37:48,699
And everyone knew they were B-52s.

1698
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,033
And is... in the two
years that I was there,

1699
01:37:51,132 --> 01:37:53,800
that was the first time
I ever heard a bomb.

1700
01:37:53,899 --> 01:37:55,332
And it was close.

1701
01:37:55,432 --> 01:37:57,699
It was really close.

1702
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,932
It was frightening, but
we were still cheering.

1703
01:38:00,033 --> 01:38:03,699
I mean, we were cheering because
something was happening.

1704
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,033
(explosions)

1705
01:38:06,132 --> 01:38:07,932
HUY DUC:

1706
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,166
NARRATOR: Around the world,

1707
01:38:38,265 --> 01:38:41,500
antiwar demonstrators
returned to the streets.

1708
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,699
The prime minister of Sweden
compared the United States

1709
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,432
to Nazi Germany.

1710
01:38:46,533 --> 01:38:48,632
The Pope called the bombing,

1711
01:38:48,733 --> 01:38:51,432
which killed more than 1,600 civilians,

1712
01:38:51,533 --> 01:38:54,632
"the object of daily grief."

1713
01:38:54,733 --> 01:38:59,033
James Reston of theNew York
Times pronounced the raids

1714
01:38:59,132 --> 01:39:00,932
"war by tantrum."

1715
01:39:01,033 --> 01:39:05,466
Republican Senator William
Saxbe of Ohio said

1716
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:10,166
the president had taken
leave of his senses.

1717
01:39:10,265 --> 01:39:11,800
(gunfire)

1718
01:39:11,899 --> 01:39:15,865
North Vietnam shot down 15 B-52s,

1719
01:39:15,966 --> 01:39:20,233
along with 11 other aircraft.

1720
01:39:20,332 --> 01:39:24,300
93 crewmen were reported missing.

1721
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:29,065
45 new prisoners of war
were locked up in Hanoi,

1722
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:33,765
one of whom died in captivity.

1723
01:39:33,865 --> 01:39:38,765
Meanwhile, both the Chinese
and the Soviets pressed Hanoi

1724
01:39:38,865 --> 01:39:41,365
to resume negotiations.

1725
01:39:41,466 --> 01:39:45,065
"The most important thing is
to let the Americans leave,"

1726
01:39:45,166 --> 01:39:48,332
Zhou Enlai told a North
Vietnamese official.

1727
01:39:48,432 --> 01:39:53,132
"The situation will change
in six months or a year."

1728
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:59,265
On December 26, Hanoi
signaled its willingness

1729
01:39:59,365 --> 01:40:01,600
to return to Paris.

1730
01:40:01,699 --> 01:40:06,265
It would take just six days
to reach a final agreement.

1731
01:40:06,365 --> 01:40:12,565
NEGROPONTE: We bombed them into
accepting our concessions.

1732
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:16,765
We bombed them into
accepting our concessions.

1733
01:40:16,865 --> 01:40:20,600
And I stand by that statement,
because, in effect,

1734
01:40:20,699 --> 01:40:26,932
what we did was to carry out
this massive bombing campaign

1735
01:40:27,033 --> 01:40:31,832
in order to basically get
back to pretty much exactly

1736
01:40:31,932 --> 01:40:35,565
where we were at the end of October in '72.

1737
01:40:37,533 --> 01:40:40,466
NARRATOR: President Thieu
still balked at signing on.

1738
01:40:40,565 --> 01:40:42,832
Nixon was adamant.

1739
01:40:42,932 --> 01:40:45,932
Thieu had to go along with
what Washington and Hanoi

1740
01:40:46,033 --> 01:40:47,600
had worked out.

1741
01:40:47,699 --> 01:40:50,399
But without informing Congress,

1742
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:53,399
the president assured Thieu in writing

1743
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:57,233
that the United States would
"respond with full force"

1744
01:40:57,332 --> 01:41:00,932
if the North ever violated the agreement.

1745
01:41:01,033 --> 01:41:04,565
"The Americans really leave
me no choice," Thieu said.

1746
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:08,533
"Either sign or they will cut off aid.

1747
01:41:08,632 --> 01:41:12,733
"On the other hand, we have an
absolute guarantee from Nixon

1748
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:15,033
"to defend the country.

1749
01:41:15,132 --> 01:41:19,600
"I am going to agree to sign
and hold him to his word.

1750
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:23,399
He is an honest man and I
am going to trust him."

1751
01:41:32,065 --> 01:41:36,132
On January 22, 1973,

1752
01:41:36,233 --> 01:41:40,132
at his ranch in the Hill Country of Texas,

1753
01:41:40,233 --> 01:41:43,166
Lyndon Baines Johnson,

1754
01:41:43,265 --> 01:41:45,865
the president who had
committed the United States

1755
01:41:45,966 --> 01:41:48,832
to a ground war in Vietnam,

1756
01:41:48,932 --> 01:41:53,233
and had seen that war undercut
his domestic social programs

1757
01:41:53,332 --> 01:41:56,332
and end his political career,

1758
01:41:56,432 --> 01:41:58,600
died of congestive heart failure.

1759
01:42:03,832 --> 01:42:08,632
The following evening, Richard
Nixon spoke to the nation.

1760
01:42:08,733 --> 01:42:11,332
28 years after the United States

1761
01:42:11,432 --> 01:42:14,233
first became involved in Vietnam,

1762
01:42:14,332 --> 01:42:17,199
it was finally getting out.

1763
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:18,733
NIXON: I have asked for this radio

1764
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:21,100
and television time tonight

1765
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:24,666
for the purpose of announcing that we today

1766
01:42:24,765 --> 01:42:28,033
have concluded an agreement to end the war

1767
01:42:28,132 --> 01:42:32,132
and bring peace with honor in
Vietnam and in Southeast Asia.

1768
01:42:32,233 --> 01:42:35,632
A cease-fire, internationally supervised,

1769
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:39,533
will begin at 7:00 p.m.
this Saturday, January 27,

1770
01:42:39,632 --> 01:42:41,365
Washington time.

1771
01:42:41,466 --> 01:42:43,466
Within 60 days from this Saturday,

1772
01:42:43,565 --> 01:42:47,800
all Americans held prisoners
of war throughout Indochina

1773
01:42:47,899 --> 01:42:50,332
will be released.

1774
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:56,932
NARRATOR: American prisoners
of war, 591 of them,

1775
01:42:57,033 --> 01:43:00,233
were to be released in batches of 40.

1776
01:43:00,332 --> 01:43:03,233
Those who had been in captivity the longest

1777
01:43:03,332 --> 01:43:05,899
were to come home first.

1778
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,932
Today the largest contingents of
repatriated prisoners so far,

1779
01:43:10,033 --> 01:43:11,800
60 men, were flown from Clark

1780
01:43:11,899 --> 01:43:13,765
to Travis Air Force Base, California.

1781
01:43:13,865 --> 01:43:15,776
ROGER PETERSON: Today's
most dramatic moment came

1782
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:18,399
when Everett Alvarez made his
happy trek down the ramp,

1783
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:19,600
home at last.

1784
01:43:19,699 --> 01:43:21,108
For almost as long as most Americans

1785
01:43:21,132 --> 01:43:22,600
have been aware of Vietnam,

1786
01:43:22,699 --> 01:43:26,533
Lieutenant Commander Alvarez
has been a prisoner in Hanoi.

1787
01:43:26,632 --> 01:43:29,466
He was shot down August 5, 1964,
during the first raids flown

1788
01:43:29,565 --> 01:43:32,533
in retaliation for the
Tonkin Gulf incident.

1789
01:43:32,632 --> 01:43:34,432
And finally, today, he was home.

1790
01:43:34,533 --> 01:43:36,899
For years and years,

1791
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:43,233
we dreamed of this day, and we kept faith.

1792
01:43:43,332 --> 01:43:48,033
Faith in God, in our president,

1793
01:43:48,132 --> 01:43:49,699
and in our country.

01:44:15,033 --> 01:44:17,565
And I walked out in the sunlight.

1801
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:20,500
And the first thing I saw
was a girl in a miniskirt.

1802
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:23,265
She was a reporter for one
of the news organizations.

1803
01:44:23,365 --> 01:44:25,300
I'd never seen a real-life miniskirt.

01:44:33,466 --> 01:44:35,500
and American authorities on one side,

1807
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,100
and there was a brigadier
general, Air Force general

1808
01:44:38,199 --> 01:44:40,500
in Class A uniform.

1809
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:43,765
And he looked magnificent.

1810
01:44:43,865 --> 01:44:46,666
And I looked at him...

1811
01:44:46,765 --> 01:44:48,500
(voice breaking): and he had breadth,

1812
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:52,600
he had thickness that we didn't have.

1813
01:44:52,699 --> 01:44:55,865
And his hair was... he
had on a garrison cap.

1814
01:44:55,966 --> 01:44:59,000
And his hair was plump and moist,

1815
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,600
and our hair was like straw, you know.

1816
01:45:01,699 --> 01:45:03,899
It was dry and we were skinny.

1817
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
(clears throat)

1818
01:45:06,332 --> 01:45:08,033
And I went out and I saluted,

1819
01:45:08,132 --> 01:45:10,800
which was a courtesy
that had been denied us

1820
01:45:10,899 --> 01:45:13,632
for so many years.

1821
01:45:13,733 --> 01:45:16,132
And he saluted me, and he...

1822
01:45:16,233 --> 01:45:18,199
I shook hands with him and he hugged me,

1823
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,733
he actually hugged me,

1824
01:45:19,832 --> 01:45:23,432
and he said, "Welcome home, Major.

1825
01:45:23,533 --> 01:45:25,132
We're glad to see you, doctor."

1826
01:45:25,233 --> 01:45:28,000
And the tears were
streaming down his cheeks.

1827
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:31,132

escorted me on this C-141.

the last American combat
troops would leave Vietnam.
