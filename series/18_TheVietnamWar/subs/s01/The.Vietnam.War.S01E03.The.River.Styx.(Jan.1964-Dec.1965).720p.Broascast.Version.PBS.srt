DYLAN: ♪ Oh, my name, it is nothin' ♪

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,141
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: Well, I
wanted to name him after his dad,

38
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:07,966
Denton Winslow Crocker.

39
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:11,699
So that was the name we chose.

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,066
He was a colicky little baby.

41
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:18,066
And, uh, so we were up
night and day with him.

42
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:21,432
And my husband was a wonderful dad

43
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,699
and very loving and attentive.

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,665
He'd walk the floor with him.

45
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:29,566
And then he said one day,
"He's a regular little mogul

46
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:32,699
the way he rules our lives."

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,000
So that's where the name came from.

48
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,566
We called him Mogie.

49
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:41,265
NARRATOR: Mogie Crocker
was born June 3, 1947,

50
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,733
the oldest of four children.

51
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,633
His father was a biology teacher,

52
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,865
and Mogie was raised in college towns:

53
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:53,265
Ithaca, Amherst, and
finally Saratoga Springs,

54
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:58,066
to which the family moved
in 1960, when he was 13.

55
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:02,032
My mother read books to all of us.

56
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,365
My brother was definitely the one

57
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,133
who probably gravitated
towards them more than I did.

58
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,332
He really feasted on books.

59
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:12,165
NARRATOR: Mogie was an unusual boy.

60
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:15,633
Intelligent, independent-minded,
and too nearsighted

61
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,765
to do well at team sports,

62
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,733
he loved books about American
history and American heroes.

63
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:24,165
At 12, he started a diary

64
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:27,400
in which he kept track of Cold War events.

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,765
"I hate Reds!" he wrote,

66
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:32,533
and he admired most those
who had proved willing

67
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:36,466
to sacrifice themselves for a cause.

68
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,466
President John F. Kennedy's
call for every American

69
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:43,265
to ask what he or she could
do for their country

70
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:47,932
had mirrored ideas he'd held
since he was a small boy.

71
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,033
One evening when I was reading to Denton

72
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:56,932
before he went to sleep, I
chose a passage fromHenry V,

73
00:03:57,032 --> 00:04:02,300
which is, "He today that
sheds his blood with me

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,532
"shall be my brother.

75
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:09,466
"And gentlemen in England now a-bed

76
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,065
"shall think themselves accurs'd

77
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:16,300
"they were not here and
hold their manhood cheap

78
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,300
while any speaks that fought
with us upon St. Crispin's Day."

79
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,600

DYLAN: ♪ If another war comes...

81
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,500
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: I think
that it was that sort of thing

82
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,466
that made Denton want to be

83
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:36,100

LYNDON JOHNSON: I just stayed awake
last night thinking about this thing.

87
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:58,665
The more I think of it, I don't
know what in the hell...

88
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,065
it looks like to me we're
getting into another Korea.

89
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:02,865
It just worries the hell out of me.

90
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:05,533
I don't see what we can ever
hope to get out of there with

91
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:06,800
once we're committed.

92
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,932
I don't think it's worth fighting for

93
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,466
and I don't think we can get out.

94
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:12,209
And it's just the biggest
damn mess I ever saw.

95
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,841
McGEORGE BUNDY: It is, it's an awful mess.

96
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,699
JOHNSON: I just thought about
ordering those kids in there,

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,509
and what in the hell am I
ordering them out there for?

98
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,976
BUNDY: One thing that has occurred to me...

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,476
JOHNSON: What the hell
is Vietnam worth to me?

100
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,132
What is it worth to this country?

101
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,600
BUNDY: Yeah, yeah.

102
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,908
JOHNSON: Now, of course, if you
start running the communists,

103
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:28,908
they may just chase you right
into your own kitchen.

104
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:31,533
BUNDY: Yeah. That's the trouble.

105
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,500
And that is what the rest
of that half of the world

106
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,033
is going to think if this
thing comes apart on us.

107
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:39,641
LYNDON JOHNSON: It's damned
easy to get in a war,

108
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:41,375
but it's going to be awfully
hard to ever extricate yourself

109
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,432
if you get in.

110
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,899
BUNDY: It's very easy...

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,509
JOHNSON: I'd like to hear Walter and
McNamara to evaluate this thing.

112
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,533
BUNDY: To debate it?

113
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:47,832
JOHNSON: Yeah.

114
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,692
BUNDY: All right, what's
a possible time...?

115
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:54,399
NARRATOR: Tragedy had brought
Lyndon Johnson to the presidency

116
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,632
in November of 1963.

117
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,399
And he would not feel
himself fully in charge

118
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,399
until he had faced the
voters the following year.

119
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,865
But his ambitions for his
country were as great

120
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:11,266
as those of his hero, Franklin Roosevelt.

121
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:13,332
During his years in the White House,

122
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:15,632
he would lead the struggle to win passage

123
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:19,800
of more than 200 important
pieces of legislation...

124
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:25,365
the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
the Voting Rights Act of 1965,

125
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:29,832
federal aid to education,
Head Start, Medicare,

126
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:33,132
and a whole series of bills
aimed at ending poverty

127
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:36,266
in America, all intended to create

128
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:39,165
what he called "The Great Society."

129
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:43,932
In foreign affairs, Johnson
was less self-assured.

130
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,199
"Foreigners are not like
the folks I'm used to,"

131
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,899
he once said.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,600
To deal with them, he retained in office

133
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,399
all of John Kennedy's top advisors...

134
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,533
Dean Rusk at State,

135
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:58,100
Robert McNamara at Defense,

136
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,132
McGeorge Bundy as his
National Security Advisor.

137
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:07,399
"I need you," he told them,
more than his predecessor had.

138
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,199
Publicly, Johnson pledged

139
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,699
that "This nation will keep its commitments

140
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,865
from South Vietnam to West Berlin."

141
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:18,565
But privately, Vietnam
filled him with dread.

142
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:21,033
"It's going to be hell in
a handbasket out there,"

143
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:23,832
his ambassador told him.

144
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:27,132
"I want the South Vietnamese
to get off their butts

145
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,899
"and get out into those jungles

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,199
and whip the hell out of some
communists," the president said.

147
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,000
"And then I want 'em to leave me alone,

148
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,165
"because I've got some bigger things to do

149
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,300
right here at home."

150
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:45,332
Johnson had opposed the military
coup that had overthrown

151
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:49,600
and murdered South Vietnamese
president Ngo Dinh Diem,

152
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,165
fearing it would make a
bad situation worse.

153
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,466
It had.

154
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:58,833
(gunfire, shouting)

155
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:05,432
The National Liberation
Front... the Viet Cong...

156
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:08,600
was making coordinated attacks
throughout the countryside,

157
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,132
some 400 of them in just two weeks.

158
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,865
NARRATOR: An estimated 40% of the
South Vietnamese countryside,

159
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,500
and more than 50% of the people,

160
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,432
were effectively in the
hands of the Viet Cong.

161
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:50,265
And the Vietnamese generals who
had overthrown Ngo Dinh Diem

162
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:53,966
were bickering among themselves.

163
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,100
The assassination of Ngo
Dinh Diem set in motion

164
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,133
a series of coups.

165
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:03,466
Each government was less
effective than the one before.

166
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:06,966
NARRATOR: In January 1964,

167
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,600
with U.S. encouragement,

168
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,365
General Nguyen Khanh
staged yet another coup.

169
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:18,100
In March, Johnson sent McNamara
to Vietnam with instructions

170
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,533
to show the people that
Khanh was "our boy."

171
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,799
SAM WILSON: Johnson said, "Let's get him
out and get him speaking to people,

172
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,466
"and let McNamara go with him as well

173
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:33,000
"so that people can see
that the United States

174
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,265
is solidly behind this man."

175
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,633
We fully support the
people of South Vietnam.

176
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:42,332
BUI DIEM (speaking English):

177
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:56,200
When Khanh gave a tedious, long,
laborious speech ending up with,

178
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,033
"Vietnam (speaking Vietnamese),
Vietnam (speaking Vietnamese),

179
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,700
Vietnam a thousand years."

180
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,066
McNamara leaned over to the
microphone and said...

181
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,200
(attempting to repeat Vietnamese phrase)

182
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:12,166
BUI DIEM:

183
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:13,509
(McNamara attempting to
repeat Vietnamese phrase)

184
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,042
What he was saying was something like,

185
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:18,600
"The little duck, he wants to lie down."

186
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,976
(attempting to repeat Vietnamese phrase)

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,232
WILSON: He wasn't aware
of the tonal difference.

188
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:28,700
And McNamara grabbed one
fist and held them up.

189
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,033
And the crowd practically

190
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:32,232
disintegrated on the cobblestones.

191
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,100
NARRATOR: "No more of this coup shit,"

192
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,765
President Johnson told his advisors.

193
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:42,799
But Khanh, too, lacked popular legitimacy,

194
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,466
and other generals continued
to jockey for power.

195
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:50,033
Washington turned a deaf
ear to Buddhist calls

196
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,665
for the genuinely representative government

197
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:56,600
they'd hoped they'd get
when Diem was overthrown.

198
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,033
Between January 1964 and June of 1965,

199
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:06,000
there would be eight different governments.

200
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,566
All of their leaders were
so close to the Americans

201
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,166
that they were seen as puppets.

202
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:13,000
(shouting, whistling)

203
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,166
One weary Johnson aide suggested

204
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:18,033
that the national symbol of South Vietnam

205
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,932
should be a turnstile.

206
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,966
MURRAY FROMSON: These demonstrating
students seem to symbolize

207
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:26,899
the kind of anarchy that is
descending on Saigon these days.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,466
This kind of political backbiting is having

209
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,665
serious consequences in the countryside,

210
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,966
for until a strong government
begins to function

211
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,466
here in Saigon,

212
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,865
the war against the communists
will continue to founder.

213
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:47,466
DONG SI NGUYEN:

214
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:20,432
NARRATOR: Ho Chi Minh was still a
beloved figure in North Vietnam,

215
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:24,265
still concerned that his
country remained fragile,

216
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:27,799
still wary that stepping up
the conflict in the South

217
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,000
might force the Americans to
take a still more active role.

218
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,299
But Ho now shared power with
younger, more impatient leaders.

219
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,299
There had been change and
turmoil in North Vietnam, too,

220
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,832
just as there had been in
Saigon and Washington,

221
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,832
though Americans knew
almost nothing about it.

222
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:54,299
HUY DUC:

223
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:05,765
NARRATOR: At the Ninth Party
Plenum that began in Hanoi

224
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:09,265
on November 22, 1963,

225
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:12,265
the day President Kennedy
was killed in Dallas,

226
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:17,332
the Politburo had argued over
how best to proceed in the war.

227
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:20,799
North Vietnam's two communist patrons,

228
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:26,466
the Soviet Union and China, were
giving them conflicting advice.

229
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:28,399
NGUYEN NGOC:

230
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:44,000
NARRATOR: In two weeks of
sometimes bitter debate,

231
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,932
Ho Chi Minh, who favored
the Soviet strategy,

232
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:50,799
was outmaneuvered by party
First Secretary Le Duan,

233
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,365
who sided with the Chinese.

234
00:13:54,466 --> 00:14:00,066
NGUYEN NGOC:

235
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,332
NARRATOR: Le Duan believed
that with Diem gone,

236
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:19,633
and the Saigon government in disarray,

237
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:24,133
it was time to move quickly in 1964.

238
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:29,332
He proposed a two-phase plan
for victory in South Vietnam.

239
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:32,066
The first phase would destroy ARVN forces

240
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:34,932
through big, "decisive battles";

241
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:38,732
the second, an attack on the
cities, Le Duan believed,

242
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:42,633
would then set off popular
revolts within them.

243
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:44,765
Party leaders and others

244
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,365
suspected of having opposed the plan

245
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,765
were denounced as "revisionists," demoted,

246
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:53,166
dismissed, imprisoned.

247
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:56,832
Hundreds were sent to "re-education camps."

248
00:14:56,932 --> 00:15:01,932
"Uncle Ho wavers," Le Duan said,
"but I have only one goal...

249
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,799
final victory."

250
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:07,966
WOMAN: Secretary McNamara on line 0.

251
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,100
JOHNSON: Bob?

252
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,700
McNAMARA: Yes, Mr. President?

253
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,208
JOHNSON: I hate to bother you, but...

254
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:13,133
McNAMARA: No trouble at all.

255
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:14,899
JOHNSON: Tell me, have we got anybody

256
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,865
that's got a military mind that
can give us some military plans

257
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:19,533
for winning that war?

258
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,600
Let's get some more of
something, my friend,

259
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,208
because I'm going to have a heart attack

260
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:24,408
if you don't get me something.

261
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:26,533
We need somebody over there that can get us

262
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,000
some better plans than we got,

263
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,033
because what we got is
what we've had since '54.

264
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,633
We're not getting it done.

265
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,133
We're-we're losing.

266
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,232
McNAMARA: Well, it's one
reason I want to go back.

267
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:37,609
Kick 'em in the tail a little bit

268
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:38,708
will help here at this point.

269
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:39,765
JOHNSON: Yeah.

270
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,100
What I want is somebody
to lay up some plans

271
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,165
to trap these guys and
whup hell out of 'em.

272
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:46,432
Kill some of 'em.

273
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,100
That's what I want to do.

274
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
McNAMARA: I'll try and bring something back

275
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:51,308
that will meet that objective.

276
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:52,665
JOHNSON: Okay, Bob.

277
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:53,799
McNAMARA: Thank you.

278
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:54,899
(phone hangs up)

279
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:59,432
NARRATOR: When his counselors
urged him to do so,

280
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:03,732
Johnson increased the number
of American military personnel

281
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:08,765
from 16,000 to more than
23,000 by the end of the year.

282
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:11,899
But he wanted his own team in Saigon.

283
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,432
He replaced Henry Cabot Lodge,

284
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:18,066
making General Maxwell
Taylor his ambassador,

285
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:22,865
and selected 49-year-old
General William Westmoreland,

286
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:26,700
a decorated commander from WWII and Korea,

287
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,665
to lead the American military effort.

288
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:34,000
The president hoped to force
Hanoi to abandon its support

289
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,165
for the guerrilla struggle in the South

290
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:40,165
by gradually escalating military pressure.

291
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:44,799
He authorized American pilots
to bomb North Vietnamese troops

292
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:49,500
and installations in the
neighboring country of Laos.

293
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,432
And he directed the military

294
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,700
to oversee South Vietnamese shelling

295
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,333
of North Vietnamese islands
and raids on coastal bases.

296
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:02,932
All of it was to be conducted in secret.

297
00:17:03,032 --> 00:17:05,633
The American people were not to be told.

298
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:08,932
It was an election year.

299
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:12,700
Meanwhile, the Joint Chiefs
of Staff felt strongly

300
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,365
that the United States was fighting

301
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,165
on the enemy's terms

302
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:20,066
and urged far more drastic
and dramatic action...

303
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:24,432
air strikes against "critical
targets" in North Vietnam itself

304
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:28,732
and the deployment of U.S.
forces in South Vietnam...

305
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,665
boots on the ground.

306
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:34,932
Johnson refused, fearing
that such aggressive moves

307
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:37,200
would pull China into the conflict

308
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:42,200
just as it had entered
the Korean War in 1950.

309
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,376
JOHNSON: They say get in or get out.

310
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,266
McGEORGE BUNDY: Yeah.

311
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,633
JOHNSON: And I told them,

312
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,833
we haven't got any Congress
that will go with us,

313
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,232
and we haven't got any
mothers that will go with us

314
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,266
in the war, and I got to win an election

315
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:57,333
and then you can make a decision.

316
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:59,432
(crowd cheering)

317
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:01,208
NARRATOR: Polls showed him
with a commanding lead

318
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:03,333
over his likely Republican opponent,

319
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:07,066
Senator Barry F. Goldwater of Arizona,

320
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:10,833
a blunt, uncompromising
critic of what he charged

321
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:13,000
was the administration's weakness

322
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,700
in the face of communist aggression.

323
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,039
BARRY GOLDWATER: Why does he
put off facing the question

324
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:21,032
of what to do about Vietnam?

325
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,266
Does he hope that he can wait
until after the election

326
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:26,865
to confront the American public with the...

327
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:30,365
BILL EHRHART: Here were these communists
who were overrunning Southeast Asia

328
00:18:30,465 --> 00:18:33,633
and Johnson's doing nothing about it.

329
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:34,900
My opponent has not told you

330
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,542
what he plans to do about the Cold War.

331
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,799
I rode around the back of a
flatbed truck in Perkasie

332
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,732
with a bunch of my classmates

333
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,099
singing Barry Goldwater campaign songs

334
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,432
because Lyndon Johnson was not tough enough

335
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:49,165
on those communists.

336
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:54,665
NARRATOR: Johnson felt he did not
yet have the political capital

337
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:59,365
to take further action in
Vietnam, but he asked his aide,

338
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:03,200
William Bundy, to draft a
congressional resolution

339
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,333
authorizing him to use force if needed

340
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:09,732
to be sent to Capitol Hill
when the time was right.

341
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:17,865
On July 30, 1964, South Vietnamese ships

342
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,599
under the direction of the U.S. military

343
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,833
shelled two North Vietnamese
islands in the Gulf of Tonkin.

344
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:30,833
The tiny North Vietnamese
Navy was put on high alert.

345
00:19:30,932 --> 00:19:33,900
What followed was one of
the most controversial

346
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,400
and consequential events
in American history.

347
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,266
On the afternoon of August 2,

348
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:43,865
the destroyerU.S.S.
Maddox was moving slowly

349
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,266
through international waters in the gulf

350
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:50,099
on an intelligence-gathering
mission in support

351
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,066
of further South Vietnamese
action against the North.

352
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:58,465
The commander of a North
Vietnamese torpedo-boat squadron

353
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:01,133
moved to attack theMaddox.

354
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:06,099
The Americans opened fire and missed.

355
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,066
North Vietnamese torpedoes also missed.

356
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,932
But carrier-based U.S. planes damaged

357
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:16,000
two of the North Vietnamese boats

358
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,099
and left a third dead in the water.

359
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,532
Ho Chi Minh was shocked to
hear of his navy's attack

360
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:27,099
and demanded to know who had ordered it.

361
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,833
The officer on duty was
officially reprimanded

362
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:31,833
for impulsiveness.

363
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:36,532
No one may ever know who
gave the order to attack.

364
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:40,599
To this day, even the
Vietnamese cannot agree.

365
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,432
But some believe it was Le Duan.

366
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:47,266
HUY DUC:

367
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:30,926
NARRATOR: Back in Washington,

368
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:33,932
the Joint Chiefs urged
immediate retaliation

369
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,799
against North Vietnam.

370
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,633
The president refused.

371
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:41,200
Instead, the White House issued a warning

372
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,299
about the "grave consequences"
that would follow

373
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,099
what it called "any further
unprovoked" attacks...

374
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,299
even though Johnson knew the
attack had been provoked

375
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,099
by the South Vietnamese raids
on North Vietnam's islands.

376
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,000
Both sides were playing a dangerous game.

377
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:07,000
On August 4, American radio
operators mistranslated

378
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:08,766
North Vietnamese radio traffic

379
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:14,633
and concluded a new military
operation was imminent.

380
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:16,799
Actually, Hanoi had simply called upon

381
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,965
torpedo boat commanders to
be ready for a new raid

382
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:23,432
by the South Vietnamese.

383
00:22:23,532 --> 00:22:28,133
TheMad dox and another
destroyer, theTurner Joy,

384
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:31,232
braced for a fresh attack.

385
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,965
So did the White House.

386
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:34,665
LYNDON JOHNSON: Go ahead, Mac.

387
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:37,232
McNAMARA: I-I personally
would recommend to you,

388
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,200
after a second attack on our ships,

389
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:43,099
that we do retaliate against
the coast of North Vietnam

390
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,665
some way or other...

391
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:48,266
JOHNSON: What I was thinking about
when I was eating breakfast:

392
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:51,133
when they move on us and they shoot at us,

393
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:52,876
I think we not only ought to shoot at them,

394
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,266
but almost simultaneously
pull one of these things

395
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:57,408
that you've been doing on one
of their bridges or something.

396
00:22:57,432 --> 00:22:58,532
McNAMARA: Exactly.

397
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,299
I quite agree with you, Mr. President.

398
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,042
JOHNSON: But I wish we could have something

399
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:03,900
that we've already picked out,

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,465
and just hit about three of
them damn quick, right after.

401
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:10,900
NARRATOR: No second attack ever happened,

402
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,133
but at the time, anxious
American sonar operators

403
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:19,932
aboard theMaddo x andTurner Joy
convinced themselves one had.

404
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:24,665
The attack was probable but not
certain, Johnson was told,

405
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:27,766
and since it had probably occurred,

406
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:31,965
the president decided it
should not go unanswered.

407
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,700
JOHNSON: Aggression by terror
against the peaceful villagers

408
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:42,299
of South Vietnam has now been
joined by open aggression

409
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,532
on the high seas against the
United States of America.

410
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,400
Yet our response, for the present,

411
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,965
will be limited and fitting.

412
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:58,500
We Americans know, although
others appear to forget,

413
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,232
the risk of spreading conflict.

414
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:06,833
We still seek no wider war.

415
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:10,299
EVERETT ALVAREZ: If that came to
be where we would be called upon

416
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,266
to carry out our responsibilities,

417
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:15,965
and having been well trained for this,

418
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:17,633
I never really gave it much thought.

419
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:20,000
It was part of my duty.

420
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:23,566
NARRATOR: Lieutenant Everett
Alvarez from Salinas, California,

421
00:24:23,665 --> 00:24:27,200
was aboard the U.S.S.
carrier Constellation.

422
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,865
His squadron of Skyhawk A-4 planes

423
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:33,566
was ordered to attack
torpedo boat installations

424
00:24:33,665 --> 00:24:38,200
and oil facilities near
the port of Hon Gai.

425
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:43,066
For the first time, American
pilots were going to drop bombs

426
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:45,200
on North Vietnam.

427
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:47,775
ALVAREZ: When we approached the target

428
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,432
coming down from altitude,

429
00:24:49,532 --> 00:24:52,633
it was obvious that they could
pick us up on their radar.

430
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:55,266
I remember my knees shaking.

431
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:58,266
And I was saying, "Holy
smokes, I'm going into war."

432
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,200
"This is war."

433
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,932
I was a bit scared.

434
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:09,766
Once we went in and they
started firing at us,

435
00:25:09,865 --> 00:25:12,165
the fear went away.

436
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:16,932
Everything became smooth,
deathly quiet in the cockpit.

437
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:19,766
It was sort of like a symphony

438
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:25,266
in the sense that my plane was
just like a ballet in the sky,

439
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:28,865
and I was just performing what I was doing.

440
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:32,099
And then I got hit.

441
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,266
MAN: Mayday, Mayday.

442
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,532
(instruments beeping)

443
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,333
NARRATOR: Coastal
militiamen captured Alvarez

444
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:40,865
and turned him over to the
North Vietnamese military.

445
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:46,700
ALVAREZ: One fella was yelling at me
in Vietnamese and saying something.

446
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,766
I started talking to him in Spanish.

447
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:51,732
Don't ask me why.

448
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:54,932
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

449
00:25:56,865 --> 00:26:02,000
After when they discovered U.S.A.
on my ID card

450
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:07,000
and then they started
speaking to me in English.

451
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:11,200
NARRATOR: Alvarez assumed he would
be treated as a prisoner of war.

452
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:13,532
ALVAREZ: I was sticking
to the code of conduct,

453
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,900
which is giving them name,
rank, service number,

454
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,232
and date of birth.

455
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:22,766
But they quickly reminded me
that there was no state of war,

456
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:25,400
no declaration of war.

457
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,232
So I could not be considered
a prisoner of war.

458
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:32,165
I recall thinking about it,

459
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,865
and I says, "You know what?

460
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:35,400
They're right."

461
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,766
NARRATOR: Everett Alvarez was
the first American airman

462
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:42,232
to be shot out of the
sky over North Vietnam

463
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,032
and the first to be imprisoned there.

464
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,865
Now, the president sent up to Capitol Hill

465
00:26:49,965 --> 00:26:53,665
the resolution he had asked his
aide William Bundy to draft

466
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:56,200
two months earlier.

467
00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:00,133
JAMES WILLBANKS: Johnson is sort
of prepositioned to move anyway,

468
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:04,000
and it gives him really the
incident that he needs

469
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:06,665
to go to Congress and ask for a resolution

470
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:08,799
that will allow him to
deal with what he sees

471
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,566
as aggression in Vietnam.

472
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:13,000
And what he gets is the
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution,

473
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:16,700
which is, what he says, like
"Grandma's nightshirt"...

474
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,232
it covers everything.

475
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:22,700
I think what Johnson is looking
for is the opportunity,

476
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,599
the right time to send a
message to North Vietnam

477
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,665
that we're serious about
supporting South Vietnam.

478
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:32,865
That message is sent,

479
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:34,700
I think we misread the enemy

480
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,066
because they're just as serious as we are.

481
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:41,566
NARRATOR: On August 7, 1964,

482
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:45,333
by a vote of 88-2, the Senate passed

483
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:49,465
what came to be called the
Tonkin Gulf Resolution.

484
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:53,833
In the House, not a single
congressman opposed it.

485
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:57,732
Senator Goldwater could
no longer plausibly claim

486
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,900
Johnson was failing to fight back

487
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,732
against North Vietnam, while
those voters concerned

488
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,865
that the United States was in danger

489
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:08,299
of becoming too deeply involved

490
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,299
admired the president's measured response.

491
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,133
Support for Johnson's handling
of the war jumped overnight

492
00:28:16,232 --> 00:28:19,700
from 42% to 72%.

493
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,799
The American public
believed their president.

494
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,432
Le Duan and his comrades in Hanoi did not.

495
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:30,165
They had little faith in
the president's claim

496
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:32,299
that he sought no wider war.

497
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,299
They resolved to step up their efforts

498
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,900
to win the struggle in the South

499
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,032
before the United States
escalated its presence

500
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,465
by sending in combat troops.

501
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:45,732
For the first time,

502
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,432
Hanoi began sending North
Vietnamese regulars

503
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:51,165
into the South, down the network of paths

504
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:54,500
they had hacked out of the Laotian jungle...

505
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,599
the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

506
00:28:57,865 --> 00:28:59,633
PETER KALISCHER: This is Bien Hoa Air Base,

507
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:01,266
the biggest in South Vietnam,

508
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:05,032
hours after being hit by a
communist mortar barrage.

509
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:08,200
NARRATOR: On November 1,
Viet Cong guerrillas shelled

510
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:12,365
the American airbase at
Bien Hoa near Saigon.

511
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:14,766
Five Americans died.

512
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,900
Thirty were wounded.

513
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,165
Five B-57 bombers were
destroyed on the ground

514
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:23,165
and 15 more were damaged.

515
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:24,965
PETER KALISCHER: Mr. Ambassador,

516
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:27,099
do you think this shows any new capability

517
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,232
that they've got, the Viet Cong?

518
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,665
Uh, I would simply say they've
never done this before.

519
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,833
NARRATOR: The Joint Chiefs
advised the president to mount

520
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:41,432
an immediate all-out air attack
on 94 targets in the North

521
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:44,766
and to send in regular
Army and Marine units...

522
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:48,833
not more advisors... to
South Vietnam as well.

523
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:50,333
He would not do it.

524
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:52,932
The election was just two days away.

525
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:59,400
Lyndon Baines Johnson won the
presidency in his own right,

526
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
and he won it by a landslide.

527
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,700
Within a month, the president would approve

528
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:08,400
what was called a "graduated response"...

529
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,400
limited air attacks on the
Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos

530
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,465
and "tit for tat" retaliatory raids

531
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:18,465
on North Vietnamese targets.

532
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:22,465
But he refused to undertake
sustained bombing of the North

533
00:30:22,566 --> 00:30:26,566
until the South Vietnamese got
their own house in order.

534
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,500
In private, Johnson doubted that
airpower alone would ever work

535
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,066
and believed that he would
eventually have to send in

536
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:37,432
ground troops,

537
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:41,165
though he was not yet
willing publicly to say so.

538
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:50,900
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: In the
fall of '64, Denton was 17

539
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,333
and he was determined
to go into the service.

540
00:30:55,432 --> 00:30:59,299
NARRATOR: Mogie Crocker had
been restless since the summer.

541
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,465
After the Gulf of Tonkin
incident, he had confided

542
00:31:02,566 --> 00:31:05,099
to his sister that he
wanted to join the Navy,

543
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,665
but he knew his parents would
not sign the consent form

544
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:13,266
that would have allowed a
17-year-old to enlist.

545
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:17,099
He was talking about wanting
to go into the service

546
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,633
and that his attempts to
go underage had failed.

547
00:31:19,732 --> 00:31:23,165
And that he wanted my parents
to support him in that.

548
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:25,665
NARRATOR: His parents tried to persuade him

549
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:27,833
that he could be more useful to his country

550
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:32,500
with a college education than
as just another private.

551
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,365
Mogie was adamant.

552
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:39,032
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: Monday
morning he left for school.

553
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,766
And I watched him leave.

554
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:43,799
But that night he didn't come in for supper

555
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,000
and he hadn't called.

556
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:48,465
The day that my brother ran away has to be

557
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:52,865
one of the most bizarre
experiences in my life.

558
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:56,099
I eventually happened to
look in my piggy bank

559
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,732
and he had taken the money I
had and left a note for me.

560
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,500
He had promised he would pay me back.

561
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,333
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: He was
gone about four months

562
00:32:05,432 --> 00:32:08,732
and said that he would not come home

563
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:11,266
unless we agreed to sign for him.

564
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:15,599
And he wouldn't be 18 until June.

565
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,066
But we did agree and he did come home.

566
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:23,665
My husband felt it was an
honor-bound agreement.

567
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:26,766
I was hoping that I could change his mind.

568
00:32:29,665 --> 00:32:31,566
("The Marines' Hymn" plays)

569
00:32:31,665 --> 00:32:35,465
PHILIP BRADY: To my mind, the Marine
Corps represented the very best.

570
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:36,932
And it does.

571
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:39,532
They are the best.

572
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:42,099
And I wanted to be part of the best.

573
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,865
I was competitive.

574
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:45,032
I was pugnacious.

575
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:47,133
But I wanted to get in the Marine Corps

576
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,833
and go to the first war I could find.

577
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:53,200
NARRATOR: Lieutenant Philip Brady,
from Port Washington, New York,

578
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:56,066
arrived in Saigon just a few days

579
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:58,400
after Lyndon Johnson's election,

580
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,133
one of the new advisors
sent to help shore up

581
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:04,066
the South Vietnamese military.

582
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:08,432
We must ensure that women and
children are not injured.

583
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:11,833
NARRATOR: General Westmoreland
himself greeted the newcomers.

584
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:15,799
He was an impressive-looking
man with an impressive record.

585
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,099
Many of the men he'd led in
Tunisia, Sicily, and Normandy

586
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,799
during World War II called him Superman.

587
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,066
He'd fought with distinction in Korea,

588
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:28,900
commanded the 101st Airborne,

589
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,732
served as superintendent of West Point.

590
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,165
TIME magazine called him

591
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:37,665
"the sinewy personification of
the American fighting man."

592
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:38,900
But at the same time,

593
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,099
win the hearts and the minds of the people.

594
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,865
BRADY: General Westmoreland
told us that we were down

595
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:46,633
on the five-yard line and
we just needed a few more

596
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:50,633
to go get the touchdown.

597
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:53,732
Then I went out and then
I got on the ground.

598
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,465
And then I found out, "Don't you realize?

599
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:58,865
We're losing this war."

600
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:03,532
NARRATOR: Lieutenant Brady was assigned
to assist Captain Frank Eller,

601
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:05,900
senior advisor to the 4th Battalion

602
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,199
of the Vietnamese Marine
Corps, an elite unit

603
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,532
whose members called themselves
the "Killer Sharks."

604
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:17,400
You were told that you were
going over there to guide,

605
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,632
educate, and elevate essentially
these "little fellas"

606
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:23,699
on how to fight a war

607
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,865
when, in fact, they knew
exactly how to fight the war.

608
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,065
You were just an appendage.

609
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,766
You were there simply to guide
assets that they didn't have:

610
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:37,199
American artillery, American air strikes.

611
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,900
NARRATOR: Brady did his best to get to know

612
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,266
the South Vietnamese marines in his unit.

613
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:48,500
TRAN NGOC TOAN (speaking English):

614
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,266
NARRATOR: Lieutenant Tran Ngoc
Toan, the son of a trucker,

615
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:15,699
had escaped life with a hostile stepmother

616
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,365
by entering the South Vietnamese
Military Academy at Dalat.

617
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:24,800
He'd been fighting the Viet
Cong for more than two years.

618
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,309
Toan was one of the junior officers.

619
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,699
I think he was a...

620
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,200
I think he was a company commander.

621
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:31,432
I knew him, I liked him.

622
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:34,599
He was a Dalat graduate, which
is like their West Point.

623
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,500
Very dedicated.

624
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:51,166
NARRATOR: Brady, Toan, and the 4th
South Vietnamese Marine Battalion

625
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:54,465
were stationed near the Bien
Hoa Airbase in reserve,

626
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:58,432
waiting to be called into action.

627
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,333
There were new rumors now,

628
00:36:00,432 --> 00:36:04,965
of larger enemy units moving
through the countryside.

629
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:07,965
Le Duan's plan to win a
quick and decisive victory

630
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,800
was underway.

631
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:18,333
NGUYEN VAN TONG:

632
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,666
NARRATOR: Nguyen Van Tong
was a political officer

633
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:13,833
in the newly created
Viet Cong 9th Division,

634
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:17,865
one of perhaps 2,000 Viet Cong
and North Vietnamese troops

635
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:22,733
who had for weeks been quietly
filtering into Phuoc Tuy,

636
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,766
a supposedly "pacified" province

637
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:28,233
less than 40 miles southeast of Saigon.

638
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,632
NGUYEN VAN TONG:

639
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:52,599
NARRATOR: The target for
Tong and his comrades

640
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:55,500
was the strategic hamlet of Binh Gia,

641
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,000
home to some 6,000 Catholic
anticommunist refugees.

642
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:04,333
Their plan was to seize the hamlet

643
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:08,166
and then annihilate the forces
Saigon was sure to send

644
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:09,766
to retake it.

645
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:12,233
To ensure success,

646
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,733
tons of heavy weapons were
smuggled onto the coast

647
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,699
under cover of darkness...

648
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,865
mortars, machine guns, recoilless rifles

649
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,766
capable of blasting tanks.

650
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:26,465
The communists had never attempted

651
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:29,432
anything on this scale before.

652
00:38:29,532 --> 00:38:32,733
Before dawn on December 28,

653
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:36,932
Viet Cong advance units easily
overwhelmed the village militia

654
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:38,766
and occupied Binh Gia.

655
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:40,099
(shouting, gunfire)

656
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,699
When two crack South
Vietnamese Ranger companies

657
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,932
were helicoptered in the next day,

658
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:51,000
they were ambushed and shot to pieces.

659
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,400
On the morning of the 30th,

660
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,766
Philip Brady, his friend Tran Ngoc Toan,

661
00:38:56,865 --> 00:39:00,699
and the 4th Marine Battalion
were flown in to relieve

662
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,365
and reinforce the Rangers.

663
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:06,932
The enemy withdrew east of the village.

664
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:15,666
NGUYEN VAN TONG:

665
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:40,932
All of a sudden you could
see the tracers come out

666
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:44,532
of the plantation, hit the
helicopter, it crashed.

667
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,632
We were ordered to go down
and retrieve the remains

668
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:49,565
the following morning.

669
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,465
NGUYEN VAN TONG:

670
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:26,233
BRADY: The lead company got to the remains

671
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,166
and then was pounced on and mauled badly.

672
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:32,632
(gunfire)

673
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,865
NARRATOR: Twelve South Vietnamese
Marines from Toan's unit were killed

674
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:40,465
getting to the downed helicopter.

675
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:42,333
Their comrades wrapped them in ponchos

676
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:46,632
and laid them out next
to the dead Americans.

677
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:49,500
An American chopper dropped
into the clearing.

678
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,132
The American crew jumped out under fire,

679
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,365
picked up the four Americans,

680
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:58,132
climbed back into their
chopper, and took off again.

681
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,465
TRAN NGOC TOAN:

682
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:14,400
NARRATOR: For three hours, Toan and
his men stayed with their own dead

683
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,666
waiting for a helicopter to
carry them off the battlefield.

684
00:41:20,432 --> 00:41:23,666
BRADY: Meanwhile, I am
getting a little bit antsy

685
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:26,099
because, first of all, we're losing light.

686
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,833
Second of all, we are now
outside of artillery range.

687
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:32,266
We've got to get out of there.

688
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,565
TRAN NGOC TOAN:

689
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,733
BRADY: I went to the Major
Nho, his name was, and I said,

690
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,932
"Major, we have to get out of here now."

691
00:41:49,032 --> 00:41:53,432
And Nho said, "Don't you
forget I am a major,

692
00:41:53,532 --> 00:41:54,599
and you are a lieutenant,"

693
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:57,833
turned on his heel and walked away.

694
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:03,266
Ten minutes later all hell broke loose.

695
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:07,465
TRAN NGOC TOAN:

696
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:08,965
(man shouts in Vietnamese)

697
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,266
NARRATOR: The shelling
eventually died down.

698
00:42:26,365 --> 00:42:28,766
But then bugles blew,

699
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:31,365
and wave after wave of enemy troops

700
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,632
advanced toward the badly outnumbered men.

701
00:42:36,965 --> 00:42:40,465
BRADY: It was as if you turned
a soundtrack of shooting...

702
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:45,865
And just went (imitates rapid gunfire).

703
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:47,032
Just like that.

704
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:48,833
All of a sudden it came out of nowhere.

705
00:42:52,465 --> 00:42:55,766
We used what little air strikes
we had left with helicopters,

706
00:42:55,865 --> 00:43:00,099
calling in the strikes on our
position to slow it down.

707
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:03,266
There was no way.

708
00:43:03,365 --> 00:43:05,300
TRAN NGOC TOAN:

709
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
(explosions)

710
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,699
BRADY: What we did was we tried to get out.

711
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,733
Twenty-six of us broke through.

712
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,599
Eleven ultimately made it.

713
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,699
(gunfire)

714
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:51,932
NARRATOR: All that night,

715
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:54,132
the Viet Cong moved among the trees,

716
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:55,965
carrying away their wounded

717
00:43:56,065 --> 00:43:58,965
and shooting any South Vietnamese troops

718
00:43:59,065 --> 00:44:01,233
they found alive.

719
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:02,900
TRAN NGOC TOAN:

720
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
NARRATOR: Cradling his rifle in his arms,

721
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,532
Toan began trying to crawl toward Binh Gia.

722
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:36,833
He was not found for three days.

723
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:42,766
TRAN NGOC TOAN:

724
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,432
NARRATOR: When it was all over, five
Americans had died at Binh Gia.

725
00:45:14,532 --> 00:45:19,432
Thirty-two Viet Cong bodies had
been left on the battlefield.

726
00:45:19,532 --> 00:45:23,065
200 South Vietnamese were killed;

727
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:27,699
200 more were wounded.

728
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,065
NGUYEN VAN TONG:

729
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:45,300
BRADY: What it really said was

730
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,699
they were capable of
marshaling this kind of force.

731
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,976
The Vietnamese officers I
talked to in the Marine Corps

732
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,666
figured they had six months before the end.

733
00:45:54,766 --> 00:45:58,233
NARRATOR: The big question after Binh Gia,

734
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:00,632
an American officer at headquarters said,

735
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:03,699
is how a thousand or more enemy troops

736
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,233
"could wander around the
countryside so close to Saigon

737
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:09,199
"without being discovered.

738
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,132
That tells you something about this war."

739
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,632
Hanoi was exultant.

740
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:19,833
Ho Chi Minh called it "a
little Dien Bien Phu."

741
00:46:19,932 --> 00:46:24,300
Le Duan was convinced his
strategy was working.

742
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,666
"The liberation war of South
Vietnam has progressed

743
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:30,266
by leaps and bounds," he said.

744
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:33,800
"After the battle of Ap Bac two years ago,

745
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,733
"the enemy knew it would
be difficult to defeat us.

746
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:40,766
"After Binh Gia, the enemy realizes

747
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:45,900
that he is in the process
of being defeated by us."

748
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,699
NGUYEN VAN TONG:

749
00:47:00,532 --> 00:47:01,841
JOHNSON: I, Lyndon Baines Johnson,

750
00:47:01,865 --> 00:47:03,800
do solemnly swear...

751
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,166
NARRATOR: Twenty-six days after
the Binh Gia battle ended

752
00:47:07,266 --> 00:47:10,500
and just a week after President
Johnson's inauguration,

753
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:13,865
McGeorge Bundy handed the
president a memorandum.

754
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:16,032
I will to the best of my ability.

755
00:47:16,132 --> 00:47:19,865
NARRATOR: The current strategy was
clearly not working, it said.

756
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:23,365
The Viet Cong were on the
move and on the rise,

757
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:26,833
supplied and now steadily reinforced

758
00:47:26,932 --> 00:47:29,666
with soldiers from North Vietnam.

759
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:34,400
If an independent South
Vietnam was to survive,

760
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,666
the United States needed to act fast.

761
00:47:37,766 --> 00:47:41,666
The administration faced
two choices, Bundy said.

762
00:47:41,766 --> 00:47:44,233
It could go along as it had been going

763
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:48,266
and try to negotiate some kind
of face-saving settlement.

764
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:53,166
Or they could use still more
American military power

765
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:56,900
to force the North to abandon its
goal of uniting the country.

766
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,166
Bundy and McNamara favored that option.

767
00:48:01,266 --> 00:48:04,132
Unless the president chose it, they said,

768
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:06,132
South Vietnam would fall.

769
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:09,900
"I don't think anything,"
Johnson told McNamara,

770
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,800
"is going to be as bad as losing."

771
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:20,166
Then, a little over a week later,

772
00:48:20,266 --> 00:48:23,766
guerrillas struck an American
helicopter base at Pleiku

773
00:48:23,865 --> 00:48:25,565
in the Central Highlands,

774
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:30,365
killing eight American advisors
and wounding over 100 more.

775
00:48:30,465 --> 00:48:32,400
McNAMARA: Approximately 24 hours ago,

776
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,900
the first attack in the Pleiku area...

777
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,599
NARRATOR: Johnson immediately
approved an air strike

778
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:40,500
on a North Vietnamese army barracks.

779
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:45,132
On February 10, 1965,

780
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:48,400
the Viet Cong blew up a hotel in Qui Nhon,

781
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:54,932
killing 23 Americans and pinning
21 more beneath the rubble.

782
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,400
Johnson ordered another airstrike.

783
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,900
Anxiety about what seemed to be happening

784
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,500
spread around the world.

785
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:07,432
France, which had spent
nearly a century in Vietnam,

786
00:49:07,532 --> 00:49:11,800
now called for an end to all
foreign involvement there.

787
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,432
The British prime minister urged restraint.

788
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:19,166
Many leaders of the
president's own party agreed,

789
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:21,766
though not in public.

790
00:49:21,865 --> 00:49:23,932
In a private memorandum,

791
00:49:24,032 --> 00:49:26,565
Johnson's own vice
president, Hubert Humphrey,

792
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:29,932
warned him that widening
the war would undercut

793
00:49:30,032 --> 00:49:34,666
the Great Society, damage
America's image overseas,

794
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:39,199
and end any hope of improving
relations with the Soviet Union.

795
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:42,900
Johnson never responded.

796
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,032
Instead, on March 2, 1965,

797
00:49:46,132 --> 00:49:49,666
the United States began a
systematic bombardment

798
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:51,666
of targets in North Vietnam,

799
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:55,699
code-named Operation Rolling Thunder.

800
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:00,766
It was meant to be a "mounting
crescendo" of air raids,

801
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:02,365
Ambassador Taylor wrote,

802
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:05,500
intended to bolster morale in the South

803
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,300
and destroy morale in the North.

804
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,365
WILSON: The thesis behind Rolling Thunder,

805
00:50:13,465 --> 00:50:19,065
as I understood it, was that
as we ratcheted up the tempo

806
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:23,733
and the volume of this effort
against the North Vietnamese,

807
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,699
sooner or later they would cry uncle.

808
00:50:29,365 --> 00:50:32,065
And there'd be a pause,

809
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:36,699
and we would begin to negotiate
our way out of this situation.

810
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,599
This became an article of faith.

811
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:43,465
And this article of faith was
a fallacious assumption.

812
00:50:43,565 --> 00:50:46,000
They weren't going to give up.

813
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:50,365
They read us better than we read them.

814
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:54,400
NARRATOR: The president
insisted on strict secrecy...

815
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,699
the American people were not to be told

816
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,099
that the administration
had changed its policy

817
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,032
from retaliatory airstrikes
to systematic bombing;

818
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:08,365
that he had, in fact, widened the war.

819
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,065
They jointly agreed that
joint retaliatory action

820
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:13,666
was required.

821
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:17,500
NARRATOR: General Westmoreland,
who had initially been hesitant

822
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,300
about committing ground troops to Vietnam,

823
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,000
now asked for two battalions
of Marines... 3,500 men...

824
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:27,432
to protect the Danang airbase

825
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:31,000
from which fighter-bombers
were hitting the North.

826
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:35,032
Ambassador Taylor, who had
once called for ground troops,

827
00:51:35,132 --> 00:51:37,733
now objected to the whole idea.

828
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:41,266
"Once you put that first
soldier ashore," he wrote,

829
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:45,266
"you never know how many others
are going to follow him."

830
00:51:45,365 --> 00:51:49,266
But the president felt he had no
choice but to give Westmoreland

831
00:51:49,365 --> 00:51:51,400
what he asked for.

832
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:56,432
He knew he would be blamed if
more American advisors died.

833
00:51:56,532 --> 00:52:00,500
"I feel like a jackass caught
in a Texas hailstorm,"

834
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,099
he complained.

835
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:07,333
"I can't run, I can't hide,
and I can't make it stop."

836
00:52:07,432 --> 00:52:08,876
("Hello Vietnam" by Johnnie Wright playing)

837
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,800
In March of 1965,

838
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,699
Johnson finally took the
action he had managed to avoid

839
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,865
for so long.

840
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:18,166
WRIGHT: ♪ Kiss me goodbye...

841
00:52:18,266 --> 00:52:21,266
NARRATOR: He was putting American
ground troops in Vietnam.

842
00:52:24,032 --> 00:52:29,500
WRIGHT: ♪ Goodbye, my
sweetheart; hello, Vietnam ♪

843
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,333
NARRATOR: The government of South
Vietnam was not even consulted;

844
00:52:33,432 --> 00:52:37,900
the United States of America
had larger considerations.

845
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:44,500
GARD: Clearly, we saw it
in terms of the Cold War.

846
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:48,666
Assistant Secretary of Defense
John McNaughton said...

847
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,266
He said our interests there

848
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:55,766
were 70% to avoid humiliation,

849
00:52:55,865 --> 00:52:59,599
20% to contain China,

850
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:03,099
and ten percent to help the Vietnamese.

851
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,065
NARRATOR: Johnson quietly
told his good friend,

852
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:10,365
Senator Richard Russell of Georgia,

853
00:53:10,465 --> 00:53:12,800
what was about to happen.

854
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,661
JOHNSON: I guess we got no choice,
but it scares the death out of me.

855
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:17,041
I think everybody's going to think,

856
00:53:17,065 --> 00:53:18,532
"We're landing the Marines.

857
00:53:18,632 --> 00:53:20,300
We're off to battle."

858
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,932
Of course, if they come up there,

859
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,242
they're going to get them in a fight.

860
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,599
And if they ruin those airplanes,

861
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:26,675
everybody is going to give me
hell for not securing them,

862
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:28,508
just like they did last
time they made a raid.

863
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:29,833
RUSSELL: Yeah.

864
00:53:29,932 --> 00:53:31,209
JOHNSON: What do you... what do you think?

865
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:32,900
RUSSELL: Well, Mr. President,

866
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,142
it scares the life out of me.

867
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:35,606
But I don't know how to back up now.

868
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,865
It looks to me like we
just got in this thing,

869
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,065
and there's no way out.

870
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:40,432
JOHNSON: I don't know.

871
00:53:40,532 --> 00:53:43,432
Dick, the great trouble I'm under...

872
00:53:43,532 --> 00:53:46,599
A man can fight if he can see daylight

873
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:48,233
down the road somewhere.

874
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:50,199
But there ain't no daylight in Vietnam.

875
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,233
There's not a bit.

876
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,599
NARRATOR: On March 8, 1965, Dr.
Phan Huy Quat,

877
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:01,733
yet another prime minister
of South Vietnam,

878
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:05,699
called his chief of staff, Bui Diem.

879
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,333
BUI DIEM:

880
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,699
NARRATOR: The Marines
were landing at Danang

881
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,965
on the east coast of South
Vietnam, some 100 miles south

882
00:54:46,065 --> 00:54:48,065
of the demilitarized zone

883
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:51,199
that divided the North from the South.

884
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,833
They were prepared to
fight their way ashore.

885
00:54:54,932 --> 00:54:56,900
They did not need to.

886
00:54:58,599 --> 00:54:59,759
PHILIP CAPUTO: What struck me

887
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:04,900
was how beautiful Vietnam was to look at.

888
00:55:06,865 --> 00:55:09,900
There were just these endless acres

889
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,300
of these jade-green rice paddies.

890
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,465
And these lovely villages
inside these groves

891
00:55:16,565 --> 00:55:19,132
of bamboo and palm trees.

892
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:24,333
And way off in the distance
these bluish jungled mountains,

893
00:55:24,432 --> 00:55:27,500
and they looked like Shangri-La.

894
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,699
And I remember seeing this
line of Vietnamese women,

895
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,599
or schoolgirls I think they were.

896
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:36,800
They actually looked like
angels come to earth

897
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,199
or something like that.

898
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:43,632
So it was really quite striking
but a little unsettling

899
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:44,800
because...

900
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,432
so how can a place like this...

901
00:55:46,532 --> 00:55:49,932
so beautiful and so enchanting... be at war?

902
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,532
DUONG VAN MAI: My father was very happy.

903
00:55:53,632 --> 00:55:56,599
We're such a small and poor country

904
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:01,166
and the Americans have decided
to come in to save us

905
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:04,800
not only with their money, their resources,

906
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,766
but even with their own lives.

907
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,632
We were very grateful.

908
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,032
We thought the...

909
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:14,032
sure enough with this power, the
Americans are going to win.

910
00:56:14,132 --> 00:56:18,065
NARRATOR: Seeing foreign troops
marching past his village,

911
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:23,733
an old man emerged from his home
shouting, "Vivent les FranÃ§ais!"

912
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,865
He thought the French had returned.

913
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:29,632
"The problem around here,"

914
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:34,065
a Marine captain leading a
patrol told a reporter,

915
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:37,000
"is who the hell is who?"

916
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:40,965
WILSON: As a voting member
of Saigon Mission Council,

917
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:45,532
I was opposed to the entry of
American ground combat forces.

918
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,865
I felt if the Vietnamese
had to beat them off

919
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:55,166
with a bloody stump, they
had to do it themselves.

920
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:59,333
We had to do everything we
humanly could to help them,

921
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:02,132
but we could not win it for them.

922
00:57:03,766 --> 00:57:07,766
So, I think we crossed the
River Styx at that point.

923
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:13,166
TRAN NGOC TOAN:

924
00:57:34,932 --> 00:57:37,709
BILL ZIMMERMAN: The first protest I
went to against the war in Vietnam

925
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:41,865
was a protest at a Dow Chemical facility.

926
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,500
Dow was manufacturing napalm.

927
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,599
They were dropping napalm
on villages in Vietnam.

928
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:53,233
It was a very disappointing experience

929
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:56,400
because only 40 people came.

930
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,099
And we seemed very out of place

931
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:02,266
and very ineffectual, impotent,

932
00:58:02,365 --> 00:58:06,432
standing outside with 40 people.

933
00:58:06,532 --> 00:58:11,099
NARRATOR: Most Americans
understood little about Indochina,

934
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:14,833
rarely knew anyone actually
involved in the fighting,

935
00:58:14,932 --> 00:58:18,233
saw no reason to question
the government's assertion

936
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:21,065
that the United States had vital interests

937
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:23,733
8,000 miles from home.

938
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,408
("I Ain't Marching Anymore"
by Phil Ochs playing)

939
00:58:25,432 --> 00:58:28,465
Still, there was a small but
growing number of people

940
00:58:28,565 --> 00:58:32,432
who had begun to oppose the war
for any number of reasons...

941
00:58:32,532 --> 00:58:36,965
because they thought it unjust or immoral,

942
00:58:37,065 --> 00:58:39,800
believed it was unconstitutional

943
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,532
or simply not in the national interest.

944
00:58:43,632 --> 00:58:46,965
OCHS: ♪ Oh I marched to the
battle of New Orleans ♪

945
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,932
NARRATOR: Two weeks after the
Marines landed at Danang,

946
00:58:50,032 --> 00:58:53,800
members of the University of
Michigan faculty organized

947
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,766
a night-long discussion between professors

948
00:58:56,865 --> 00:59:02,300
and some 3,000 students about
the escalation of the war.

949
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,065
The demonstration was called a teach-in

950
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,900
because the idea originated

951
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,699
with a group of university professors.

952
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,065
What do you hope to accomplish?

953
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:13,733
DR. ERIC WOLF: I'd like to open
up communication between people

954
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:16,000
and the government because I believe

955
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:18,000
that they are not telling
us what is going on,

956
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:20,499
and the people have the right
to know, and we have the right

957
00:59:20,565 --> 00:59:22,300
to tell the government what we think.

958
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,300
NARRATOR: Soon, there were teach-ins
on most major university campuses.

959
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,565
There is no morally wonderful way out.

960
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:35,599
NARRATOR: NYU in Manhattan, the
University of Wisconsin in Madison,

961
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:40,432
the University of California in Berkeley.

962
00:59:40,532 --> 00:59:43,666
The teach-ins were really raucous affairs.

963
00:59:43,766 --> 00:59:46,300
A lot of contention.

964
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,733
STUDENT: We want to discuss

965
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:50,632
is what's wrong with the
Vietnam War, and...

968
00:59:54,365 --> 00:59:55,766
REPORTER: Do you endorse

969
00:59:55,865 --> 00:59:57,766
the administration's
policy in South Vietnam?

970
00:59:57,865 --> 00:59:59,465
Whole-heartedly.

971
00:59:59,565 --> 01:00:01,008
ZIMMERMAN: There were plenty of times

972
01:00:01,032 --> 01:00:02,932
when people who were supportive of the war

973
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,333
came to these teach-ins

974
01:00:04,432 --> 01:00:07,465
to try to give an alternative
anticommunist point of view.

975
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:09,766
They were often shouted down.

976
01:00:09,865 --> 01:00:11,733
(crowd booing)

977
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:15,699
NARRATOR: The bombing of the
North and the Marines' arrival

978
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,800
also drew protestors to
Washington that spring.

979
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,532
The demonstration was organized

980
01:00:21,632 --> 01:00:26,365
by the Students for a
Democratic Society... the SDS.

981
01:00:26,465 --> 01:00:31,266
I saw SDS calling for a
demonstration at the White House

982
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:33,900
in the spring of 1965.

983
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,032
I didn't want to go because I
didn't want to be disappointed

984
01:00:37,132 --> 01:00:38,666
in the same way again and, you know,

985
01:00:38,766 --> 01:00:40,333
go all the way to Washington

986
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:42,209
and stand outside the White
House with 40 people.

987
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:43,766
(crowd cheering)

988
01:00:43,865 --> 01:00:46,833
25,000 people attended that rally.

989
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:51,166
And that suddenly told me

990
01:00:51,266 --> 01:00:54,766
and others I was working with at the time

991
01:00:54,865 --> 01:00:58,565
that it might be possible to
build an antiwar movement.

992
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:06,075
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: It was
quite astounding to think

993
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:08,833
that he had that degree of commitment.

994
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:11,065
And it made sense

995
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:16,400
in what we knew of him,
as drastic as it was.

996
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,976
("It's My Life" by the Animals playing)

997
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,565
NARRATOR: Nothing Mogie Crocker's
parents could say or do

998
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:22,632
since Mogie had come home

999
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:25,199
shook his determination to serve,

1000
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,233
and recent developments in Vietnam

1001
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,965
had only strengthened his resolve.

1002
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:34,199
He wanted to become a paratrooper
and get into combat.

1003
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,766
His parents finally, reluctantly,

1004
01:01:36,865 --> 01:01:39,733
agreed to let him go, and on March 15,

1005
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:43,532
a week after the first
Marines landed at Danang,

1006
01:01:43,632 --> 01:01:48,800
Denton Crocker, Jr. entered
the United States Army.

1007
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,132
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: So Denton
bounced down the steps one morning

1008
01:01:52,233 --> 01:01:55,432
and was off to Fort Dix.

1009
01:01:55,532 --> 01:01:59,132
It was in a way a sort of relief, actually,

1010
01:01:59,233 --> 01:02:02,099
that the conflict and the anxiety

1011
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:05,500
over whether he would or
would not go was done.

1012
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:06,965
And he was happy.

1013
01:02:07,065 --> 01:02:10,500
And we just tried to believe
that this was the right thing

1014
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:12,465
for him to do.

1015
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,099
LE MINH KHUE:

1016
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:06,099
NARRATOR: Le Minh Khue was
orphaned as a small girl,

1017
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,132
her parents victims of
the brutal land reforms

1018
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:11,900
the communists had imposed.

1019
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,500
She was raised by her aunt and uncle,

1020
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:18,699
who encouraged her to
read American literature.

1021
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,532
She was 16 when Operation
Rolling Thunder began.

1022
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:28,233
LE MINH KHUE:

1023
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,465
NARRATOR: Khue was assigned
to an organization called

1024
01:04:01,565 --> 01:04:04,365
the "Youth Shock Brigades
Against the Americans

1025
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:06,400
for National Salvation,"

1026
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,865
and along with thousands
of other young people

1027
01:04:09,965 --> 01:04:14,199
was sent south to work keeping
open the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

1028
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,065
LE MINH KHUE:

1029
01:04:53,766 --> 01:04:55,666
NARRATOR: As Johnson had feared,

1030
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:59,500
it quickly became clear that
the bombing campaign alone

1031
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,266
was not working.

1032
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:05,565
Troops and supplies continued
steadily to filter down

1033
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:07,865
the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

1034
01:05:07,965 --> 01:05:10,699
General Westmoreland and the Joint Chiefs

1035
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,333
called for more men, tens
of thousands of them.

1036
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:17,666
The president was cautious.

1037
01:05:17,766 --> 01:05:20,500
He wanted to do "enough, but
not too much," he said.

1038
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:24,500
But he quietly agreed to send
two more Marine battalions

1039
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:30,065
and changed their mission from
base security to active combat.

1040
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,432
For the first time,

1041
01:05:31,532 --> 01:05:33,965
American troops were being asked

1042
01:05:34,065 --> 01:05:37,166
to fight on their own in Vietnam.

1043
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,699
Johnson did not want that fact revealed

1044
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,233
to the American public either.

1045
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:45,065
But the bombing of the North

1046
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,632
and rumors of harsher measures to come

1047
01:05:47,733 --> 01:05:51,065
had heightened concern around the world.

1048
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:53,965
UN Secretary-General U Thant had proposed

1049
01:05:54,065 --> 01:05:56,300
a three-month ceasefire.

1050
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,199
Great Britain, America's closest ally,

1051
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:03,032
publicly offered to
reconvene the Geneva Talks

1052
01:06:03,132 --> 01:06:06,065
that had divided Vietnam in 1954,

1053
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:09,666
with the goal of reuniting it.

1054
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:12,865
JOHNSON: The people of South
Vietnam be allowed to guide

1055
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:14,300
their own country...

1056
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,666
NARRATOR: On April 7, at
Johns Hopkins University,

1057
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:19,965
Johnson sought to persuade the world

1058
01:06:20,065 --> 01:06:22,333
of America's good intentions

1059
01:06:22,432 --> 01:06:26,800
and again to calm American
fears of a wider war.

1060
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,266
In recent months, attacks on
South Vietnam were stepped up.

1061
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:37,233
Thus, it became necessary for
us to increase our response

1062
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:40,532
and to make attacks by air.

1063
01:06:40,632 --> 01:06:44,233
This is not a change of purpose.

1064
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:49,733
It is a change in what we
believe that purpose requires.

1065
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:53,699
NARRATOR: Nothing was said about
the new orders sending Marines

1066
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,365
directly into combat.

1067
01:06:56,465 --> 01:07:01,166
Instead, the president called
for "unconditional discussions"

1068
01:07:01,266 --> 01:07:04,599
with Hanoi, and as an old New Dealer,

1069
01:07:04,699 --> 01:07:07,432
proposed a massive development program

1070
01:07:07,532 --> 01:07:09,500
for all of Southeast Asia.

1071
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,233
JOHNSON: The vast Mekong River can provide

1072
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,900
food and water and power

1073
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,500
on a scale to dwarf even our own TVA.

1074
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,532
(gunfire)

1075
01:07:19,632 --> 01:07:21,766
BRADY: I was outside of the village.

1076
01:07:21,865 --> 01:07:24,132
We're getting some fire from the village.

1077
01:07:24,233 --> 01:07:26,465
I had the little transistor radio.

1078
01:07:26,565 --> 01:07:29,632
And I'm sitting there listening to LBJ.

1079
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:31,599
JOHNSON: ...will use our
power with restraint

1080
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:33,699
and with all the wisdom...

1081
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,233
At the same time we got to lay
some nape on the village.

1082
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,132
So I'm calling in the nape

1083
01:07:39,233 --> 01:07:42,632
and listening to the president talk peace.

1084
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:45,766
JOHNSON: We will try to keep
conflict from spreading.

1085
01:07:45,865 --> 01:07:48,565
BRADY: It was surreal.

1086
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:50,699
JOHNSON: We have no desire to devastate

1087
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,032
that which the people of
North Vietnam have built

1088
01:07:55,132 --> 01:07:58,300
with toil and sacrifice.

1089
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:04,432
This war, like most wars, is
filled with terrible irony.

1090
01:08:04,532 --> 01:08:06,233
What do the people of North Vietnam want?

1091
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:07,800
(sirens wailing)

1092
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:15,300
NARRATOR: Hanoi denounced the
president's offer as a trick.

1093
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:18,399
Johnson's advisors and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff

1094
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,600
continued to debate how many
men would actually be needed

1095
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:26,000
and how rapidly they should be deployed.

1096
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:30,466
Meanwhile, the president sent
the first Army combat troops

1097
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:31,765
to the country.

1098
01:08:31,865 --> 01:08:34,065
It was increasingly clear

1099
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:37,966
that the United States was
in it for the long haul.

1100
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:49,065
You can't just be a neutral
witness to something like war.

1101
01:08:56,865 --> 01:09:00,800
It crawls down your throat.

1102
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:06,033
It eats you alive from
the inside and the out.

1103
01:09:10,432 --> 01:09:15,100
It's not something that you
can stand back and be neutral

1104
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:21,466
and objective and all of
those things we try to be

1105
01:09:21,565 --> 01:09:25,100
as reporters, journalists, photographers.

1106
01:09:27,699 --> 01:09:30,432
It doesn't work that way.

1107
01:09:32,932 --> 01:09:36,966
MAN (on radio): ...defense and they're
real quick... and check it out...

1108
01:09:37,065 --> 01:09:40,765
NARRATOR: The growing presence of
American combat troops in Vietnam

1109
01:09:40,865 --> 01:09:44,832
attracted flocks of journalists.

1110
01:09:44,932 --> 01:09:47,033
There was no press censorship,

1111
01:09:47,132 --> 01:09:50,466
as there had been in World War II.

1112
01:09:50,565 --> 01:09:54,865
Reporters just had to agree
to follow military guidelines

1113
01:09:54,966 --> 01:09:57,300
so as not to compromise the security

1114
01:09:57,399 --> 01:09:59,666
of ongoing operations.

1115
01:09:59,765 --> 01:10:02,065
It was dangerous work.

1116
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:06,500
More than 200 journalists
and photographers would die

1117
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,699
covering the fighting in Southeast Asia.

1118
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,065
Joseph Lee Galloway was
a young UPI reporter

1119
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:16,466
from Refugio, Texas.

1120
01:10:16,565 --> 01:10:20,300
He stopped in Saigon just long
enough to get his credentials.

1121
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:23,399
Then he headed for Danang.

1122
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,699
GALLOWAY: The Marines
originally came ashore there

1123
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,332
to guard the airbase.

1124
01:10:29,432 --> 01:10:35,432
And they quickly figured out you
can't just guard an airbase.

1125
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:37,265
You've got to spread out

1126
01:10:37,365 --> 01:10:38,709
because they're going to mortar it,

1127
01:10:38,733 --> 01:10:40,565
they're going to shoot rockets.

1128
01:10:40,666 --> 01:10:44,365
So you've got to reach out 15 or 20 miles.

1129
01:10:44,466 --> 01:10:48,399
That means you've got to run
operations that far out.

1130
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,966
And once you're doing that,

1131
01:10:50,065 --> 01:10:52,365
you're no longer guarding an airbase...

1132
01:10:52,466 --> 01:10:54,166
(gunfire)

1133
01:10:54,265 --> 01:10:57,466
...you're operating in hostile territory.

1134
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:02,332
(soldiers cheering)

1135
01:11:06,565 --> 01:11:09,000
NGUYEN THANH SON:

1136
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,300
CAPUTO: It wasn't so much the
Viet Cong that were intimidating

1137
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:35,666
at that point as it was the terrain.

1138
01:11:35,765 --> 01:11:40,399
Going from Point A to Point B in the jungle

1139
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,800
was so difficult.

1140
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:46,233
As it happened to me
once, it took four hours

1141
01:11:46,332 --> 01:11:48,432
to move a half a mile,

1142
01:11:48,533 --> 01:11:51,733
cutting through this bush with machetes.

1143
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,899
GALLOWAY: The Viet Cong knew the terrain
far better than the Marines did,

1144
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,699
and ran circles around them.

1145
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,233
(gunfire)

1146
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,332
MOGIE CROCKER (dramatized):
Fort Dix, June 10, 1965.

1147
01:12:21,432 --> 01:12:23,000
Dear Mum,

1148
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:27,000
Basic is now all over and I am
presently waiting for orders.

1149
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,300
Waiting for orders could be very dull

1150
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:31,159
but I have found there
are excellent chances

1151
01:12:31,233 --> 01:12:32,966
to do some reading.

1152
01:12:33,065 --> 01:12:35,233
Recently I have read Wuthering Heights,

1153
01:12:35,332 --> 01:12:40,100
Animal Farm, Seven Pillars
of Wisdom, andLord Jim.

1154
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:41,899
I hope you are all well.

1155
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,500
Love, Mogie.

1156
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,932
NARRATOR: Mogie Crocker was
allowed two weeks at home

1157
01:12:48,033 --> 01:12:50,832
before shipping out to Vietnam.

1158
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:54,509
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: We
were at dinner one evening

1159
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:57,800
just talking, I guess, in
generalities about the war

1160
01:12:57,899 --> 01:13:00,132
and the general situation.

1161
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:04,932
And Mogie said, "Of course
if I were a Vietnamese,

1162
01:13:05,033 --> 01:13:07,832
I would be on the side of the Viet Cong."

1163
01:13:07,932 --> 01:13:11,666
That... I puzzled over that.

1164
01:13:11,765 --> 01:13:15,100
I suppose relating like to
our American Revolution

1165
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,666
that he saw their need
for their own freedom.

1166
01:13:18,765 --> 01:13:20,932
But as an American citizen,

1167
01:13:21,033 --> 01:13:25,832
he saw the larger picture of
trying to prevent communism.

1168
01:13:25,932 --> 01:13:28,666
CAROL CROCKER: I remember
one night in particular

1169
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:30,432
he and I were up late.

1170
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:35,600
And he suddenly leaned
his head in his hands.

1171
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:38,832
And he said, "I don't want to go back."

1172
01:13:40,065 --> 01:13:42,399
I was dumbstruck.

1173
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:48,100
And said to him, "But this
is what you want to do."

1174
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:51,632
It had never occurred to me
that he was torn about this,

1175
01:13:51,733 --> 01:13:55,199
that he was afraid and yet
was determined to go.

1176
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,699
("Play With Fire" by the
Rolling Stones playing)

1177
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,565
NARRATOR: In South Vietnam, things
were steadily growing worse.

1178
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:14,166
JAGGER: ♪ Well, you've
got your diamond. ♪

1179
01:14:14,265 --> 01:14:17,332
NARRATOR: In May, the Viet Cong,

1180
01:14:17,432 --> 01:14:21,132
supported now by four regiments
of North Vietnamese regulars...

1181
01:14:21,233 --> 01:14:23,733
approximately 5,000 men...

1182
01:14:23,832 --> 01:14:27,600
were destroying the equivalent
of a South Vietnamese battalion

1183
01:14:27,699 --> 01:14:29,432
every week.

1184
01:14:29,533 --> 01:14:31,365
JAGGER: ♪ But don't play with me

1185
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:33,600
♪ Because you're playing with fire. ♪

1186
01:14:33,699 --> 01:14:38,699
NARRATOR: South Vietnam now seemed
only weeks from complete collapse.

1187
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,466
Desperate, General Westmoreland requested

1188
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:47,533
tens of thousands of more
American troops right away.

1189
01:14:47,632 --> 01:14:50,365
But neither the continuing bombing

1190
01:14:50,466 --> 01:14:54,166
nor the growing likelihood of
full-scale American intervention

1191
01:14:54,265 --> 01:14:57,565
seemed to intimidate Hanoi.

1192
01:14:57,666 --> 01:15:00,533
Le Duan, having failed to win the war

1193
01:15:00,632 --> 01:15:03,332
before the United States
sent in ground troops,

1194
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,565
was now persuaded the American public,

1195
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:10,100
like the French public before
them, would eventually weary

1196
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:15,832
of a costly, bloody war being
waged so far from home.

1197
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:21,000
By contrast, he said, "The North
will not count the cost."

1198
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,666
Le Duan's confidence was bolstered

1199
01:15:23,765 --> 01:15:26,332
by the help American
intervention had forced

1200
01:15:26,432 --> 01:15:30,000
the Soviet Union and China to offer him.

1201
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:34,265
Moscow agreed to supply vast
amounts of modern weaponry

1202
01:15:34,365 --> 01:15:35,733
and materiel.

1203
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:40,666
Hanoi would eventually become
the most heavily defended city

1204
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:42,033
on Earth.

1205
01:15:42,132 --> 01:15:45,265
And China agreed to send support troops,

1206
01:15:45,365 --> 01:15:48,600
freeing North Vietnamese
soldiers for combat

1207
01:15:48,699 --> 01:15:50,265
in the South.

1208
01:15:50,365 --> 01:15:55,565
320,000 Chinese would eventually
serve behind the lines

1209
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,765
in the North.

1210
01:15:58,865 --> 01:16:00,966
"We will fight," Le Duan promised,

1211
01:16:01,065 --> 01:16:04,332
"whatever way the United States wants."

1212
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,733
JOHN NEGROPONTE: In June of 1965,

1213
01:16:08,832 --> 01:16:11,300
Secretary McNamara, the
Secretary of Defense,

1214
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:12,666
came out to Saigon.

1215
01:16:12,765 --> 01:16:16,300
There were a lot of captains
and majors and lieutenants.

1216
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:20,365
And every person said to Mr. McNamara,

1217
01:16:20,466 --> 01:16:22,865
"The situation is so dire

1218
01:16:22,966 --> 01:16:25,666
we must bring in United States forces."

1219
01:16:25,765 --> 01:16:28,666
So, whatever doubts we may have had,

1220
01:16:28,765 --> 01:16:30,565
whatever people may say after the fact,

1221
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:33,466
I recall distinctly at the time

1222
01:16:33,565 --> 01:16:36,365
telling the Secretary of Defense
that I thought we needed

1223
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:37,533
to bring troops in there.

1224
01:16:38,832 --> 01:16:40,199
NARRATOR: For three weeks,

1225
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,600
the president and his advisors
argued over how to respond

1226
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:47,300
to Westmoreland's urgent
request for more troops,

1227
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:51,966
differing mostly over how
many should be sent how fast.

1228
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:56,565
Undersecretary of State
George Ball made the argument

1229
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:59,332
against further escalation.

1230
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:03,399
He told the president the
war could not be won.

1231
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,533
The American people will grow weary of it.

1232
01:17:06,632 --> 01:17:08,699
Our troops will get bogged down

1233
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,233
"in the jungles and rice
paddies," he warned,

1234
01:17:11,332 --> 01:17:14,899
"while we slowly blow
the country to pieces."

1235
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,365
No one else agreed.

JAGGER: ♪ But don't play with me...

sent Westmoreland 50,000 men.

1238
01:17:26,233 --> 01:17:31,666
But he pledged another
50,000 by the end of 1965,

1239
01:17:31,765 --> 01:17:34,699
and still more if they were needed.

JOHN SCALI: Does the fact

1246
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:20,332
that you are sending
additional forces to Vietnam

1247
01:18:20,432 --> 01:18:23,365

1248
01:18:23,466 --> 01:18:27,000
of using American forces to
guard American installations

1249
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,265
and to act as an emergency backup?

1250
01:18:29,365 --> 01:18:32,565
It does not imply any
change in policy whatever.

1251
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,666
It does not imply any change of objective.

1252
01:18:35,765 --> 01:18:36,865
Uh...

1253
01:18:39,065 --> 01:18:40,966

1255
01:18:42,365 --> 01:18:44,899
NARRATOR: Most television
reports from Vietnam

1256
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,332
echoed the newsreels
Americans had flocked to see

1257
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:52,765
during the Second World War...
enthusiastic, unquestioning,

1258
01:18:52,865 --> 01:18:57,765
good guys fighting and defeating bad guys.

1259
01:18:57,865 --> 01:19:02,233
But at dinnertime on August 5, 1965,

1260
01:19:02,332 --> 01:19:05,132
Americans saw another side of the war.

1261
01:19:06,765 --> 01:19:09,365
MORLEY SAFER: We're on the
outskirts of the village of Cam Ne

1262
01:19:09,466 --> 01:19:11,233
with elements of the 1st Battalion...

1263
01:19:11,332 --> 01:19:14,800
NARRATOR: CBS correspondent
Morley Safer and his crew

1264
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:18,132
went on patrol with Marines near Danang.

1265
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:21,332
Their orders were first to search a cluster

1266
01:19:21,432 --> 01:19:25,332
of four villages for
caches of arms and rice

1267
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:30,265
meant for the enemy and
then to destroy them all.

1268
01:19:33,632 --> 01:19:36,666
This is what the war in
Vietnam is all about.

1269
01:19:36,765 --> 01:19:40,432
(speaking Vietnamese)

1270
01:19:40,533 --> 01:19:43,966
The old and the very young.

1271
01:19:44,065 --> 01:19:46,832
The Marines have burned

1272
01:19:46,932 --> 01:19:48,832
this old couple's cottage

1273
01:19:48,932 --> 01:19:50,699
because fire was coming from here.

1274
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,432
And now when you walk into the village

1275
01:19:52,533 --> 01:19:54,199
you see no young people at all.

1276
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:58,832
(woman speaking Vietnamese)

1277
01:19:58,932 --> 01:20:02,100
The day's operation burned down 150 houses,

1278
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:05,432
wounded three women, killed one baby,

1279
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:10,966
wounded one Marine, and
netted these four prisoners.

1280
01:20:11,065 --> 01:20:14,033
Today's operation is the
frustration of Vietnam

1281
01:20:14,132 --> 01:20:15,932
in miniature.

1282
01:20:16,033 --> 01:20:18,365
There is little doubt
that American firepower

1283
01:20:18,466 --> 01:20:20,699
can win a military victory here.

1284
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:25,565
But to a Vietnamese peasant
whose home is a...

1285
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:27,899
means a lifetime of backbreaking labor,

1286
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,800
it will take more than
presidential promises

1287
01:20:30,899 --> 01:20:33,765
to convince him that we are on his side.

1288
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,420
NARRATOR: The next morning,
the president called

1289
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:41,666
his friend Frank Stanton, the head of CBS.

1290
01:20:41,765 --> 01:20:44,932
"Hello, Frank, this is your president.

1291
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:47,199
Are you trying to fuck me?"

1292
01:20:48,632 --> 01:20:52,000
Safer had defaced the
American flag, Johnson said.

1293
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:56,466
He was probably an agent of
the Kremlin, had to be fired.

1294
01:20:56,565 --> 01:21:00,733
The Marines claimed Safer had
provided a zippo lighter

1295
01:21:00,832 --> 01:21:04,600
and asked the Marines to
burn the hut for the camera.

1296
01:21:04,699 --> 01:21:07,000
A major at the Danang Marine press office

1297
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:11,132
called CBS the "Communist
Broadcasting System."

1298
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:13,666
But after the operation,

1299
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:19,033
Safer interviewed some of the
Marines who'd burned Cam Ne.

1300
01:21:19,132 --> 01:21:21,365
Do you ever have any private thoughts,

1301
01:21:21,466 --> 01:21:23,966
any private regrets about
some of these people

1302
01:21:24,065 --> 01:21:25,365
you are leaving homeless?

1303
01:21:25,466 --> 01:21:26,699
I feel no remorse.

1304
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,976
I don't imagine anybody else does.

1305
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,240
You can't expect to do your job

1306
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,699
and feel pity for these people.

1307
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,100
NARRATOR: When some viewers
registered their shock,

1308
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:39,233
Westmoreland admitted, "We
have a genuine problem

1309
01:21:39,332 --> 01:21:43,199
"which will be with us as
long as we are in Vietnam.

1310
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:48,332
"Commanders must exercise
restraint unnatural to war

1311
01:21:48,432 --> 01:21:52,300
and judgment not often
required of young men."

1312
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,233
CAPUTO: You kind of thought at first

1313
01:22:01,332 --> 01:22:03,966
that it was going to be
like the Gis, you know,

1314
01:22:04,065 --> 01:22:06,699
rolling through Paris after the liberation.

1315
01:22:08,832 --> 01:22:11,600
Well, you know, it sure
didn't work out that way.

1316
01:22:13,733 --> 01:22:15,966
I can remember once going
in this one ville.

1317
01:22:16,065 --> 01:22:19,332
And I remember finding this
entire Vietnamese family

1318
01:22:19,432 --> 01:22:22,199
cowering in a bunker.

1319
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,832
And they were terrified of us.

1320
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,065
And I remember thinking to myself, I said,

1321
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:36,332
"Well, I wonder if back
in the colonial days,

1322
01:22:36,432 --> 01:22:39,533
"when the Redcoats barged
into Ipswich, Massachusetts,

1323
01:22:39,632 --> 01:22:40,666
"or wherever,

1324
01:22:40,765 --> 01:22:44,365
"if this is how Americans must have felt

1325
01:22:44,466 --> 01:22:48,033

soldiers coming in here."

01:26:40,765 --> 01:26:44,332
of the perimeter wire of the U.S.
Special Forces outpost

1383
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:45,800
at Plei Me,

1384
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:50,533
which was defended by a 12-man team of U.S.
Green Berets,

1385
01:26:50,632 --> 01:26:56,500
14 ARVN, and some 400 mountain tribesmen.

1386
01:27:02,565 --> 01:27:05,265
Nine of the 12 Green Berets were hit.

1387
01:27:05,365 --> 01:27:08,100
They managed to hold out for two days

1388
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:14,600
before 15 more Green Berets and
160 South Vietnamese Rangers

1389
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:19,265
were helicoptered in, commanded
by Major Charles Beckwith,

1390
01:27:19,365 --> 01:27:23,365
known to his fellow soldiers
as Chargin' Charlie.

1391
01:27:23,466 --> 01:27:24,365
(explosion)

1392
01:27:24,466 --> 01:27:25,800
The next day,

1393
01:27:25,899 --> 01:27:28,466
Joe Galloway managed to
talk a helicopter pilot

1394
01:27:28,565 --> 01:27:31,966
into flying him into the besieged camp.

1395
01:27:32,065 --> 01:27:36,865
GALLOWAY: That's where I met
Major Charles Beckwith.

1396
01:27:36,966 --> 01:27:40,332
He said, "I need everything in the world.

1397
01:27:40,432 --> 01:27:44,365
"And what has the Army
in its wisdom sent me

1398
01:27:44,466 --> 01:27:47,565
but a godforsaken reporter?"

1399
01:27:47,666 --> 01:27:50,699
He drug me over and showed me

1400
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,565
a 30-caliber air-cooled machine gun.

1401
01:27:54,666 --> 01:27:57,265
He showed me how to load
it, how to clear a jam.

1402
01:27:57,365 --> 01:28:01,365
NARRATOR: "You can shoot the little
brown men outside the wire,"

1403
01:28:01,466 --> 01:28:03,365
Beckwith told Galloway.

1404
01:28:03,466 --> 01:28:05,399
"You may not shoot the little brown men

1405
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:09,100
inside the wire; they are mine."

1406
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,000
GALLOWAY: And I'm sitting there thinking,

1407
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:13,932
"Ah, I'm a civilian noncombatant."

1408
01:28:14,033 --> 01:28:17,300
I tried that line on Beckwith and he said,

1409
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:20,233
"Ain't no such thing in
these mountains, son."

1410
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:24,432
NARRATOR: For nearly a week, the
North Vietnamese launched assault

1411
01:28:24,533 --> 01:28:27,166
after assault on Plei Me.

1412
01:28:27,265 --> 01:28:31,365
It was only after American bombs and napalm

1413
01:28:31,466 --> 01:28:34,565
turned the surrounding
terrain into a moonscape

1414
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:37,733
that the enemy withdrew.

1415
01:28:37,832 --> 01:28:41,800
JOHN LAURENCE: What kind of fighters
are the Viet Cong that you met here?

1416
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:47,632
I would give anything to have
200 of them under my command.

1417
01:28:47,733 --> 01:28:49,632
They're the finest soldiers I've ever seen.

1418
01:28:49,733 --> 01:28:50,932
The Viet Cong.

1419
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:52,332
That's right.

1420
01:28:52,432 --> 01:28:54,175
They're dedicated, and
they're good soldiers.

1421
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:55,632
They're the best I've ever seen.

1422
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,600
NARRATOR: Despite the losses his
men had suffered at Plei Me,

1423
01:29:01,699 --> 01:29:05,033
the North Vietnamese commander,
General Chu Huy Man,

1424
01:29:05,132 --> 01:29:07,033
was eager for another confrontation

1425
01:29:07,132 --> 01:29:08,899
with the Americans.

1426
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,466
He was determined to
learn how to fight them.

1427
01:29:12,565 --> 01:29:15,865
Reinforcements streaming
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail

1428
01:29:15,966 --> 01:29:18,065
to the la Drang Valley included

1429
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:22,300
a newly minted second
lieutenant, Lo Khac Tam,

1430
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:25,565
who had volunteered to fight in the South.

1431
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,966
NARRATOR: On the morning
of November 14, 1965,

1432
01:29:50,065 --> 01:29:54,199
1st Cavalry helicopters
belonging to the 1st Battalion

1433
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:56,399
of the 7th Regiment...

1434
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,300
George Armstrong Custer's old outfit...

1435
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:03,033
flew west along the la Drang
toward the Chu Pong Massif,

1436
01:30:03,132 --> 01:30:05,033
looking for the enemy.

1437
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:10,466
Their commander, Kentucky-born
Korean-War veteran

1438
01:30:10,565 --> 01:30:12,666
Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore,

1439
01:30:12,765 --> 01:30:15,399
had been told there was
a large enemy base camp

1440
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,300
somewhere on its slopes.

1441
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:21,132
His orders were to take his
understrength outfit...

1442
01:30:21,233 --> 01:30:27,733
29 officers and just 411 men...
find the enemy and kill him.

1443
01:30:27,832 --> 01:30:31,800
There were two clearings large
enough for Moore to bring in

1444
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:33,800
eight choppers at once.

1445
01:30:33,899 --> 01:30:38,832
He chose the one closest to the
mountain... Landing Zone X-Ray.

1446
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:45,800
Moore made a point of
leading from the front.

1447
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:48,600
He was the first man off the first chopper.

1448
01:30:53,132 --> 01:30:57,533
He sent four six-man squads
100 yards in every direction.

1449
01:30:57,632 --> 01:31:00,399
The la Drang Valley was so beautiful,

1450
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,533
one soldier remembered,

1451
01:31:02,632 --> 01:31:05,699
it reminded him of a
national park back home.

1452
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:10,033
Within minutes, Moore's
men captured a deserter.

1453
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:11,565
Terrified and trembling,

1454
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:14,466
he said there were three
battalions of soldiers

1455
01:31:14,565 --> 01:31:18,100
on the mountain... 1,600 men.

1456
01:31:18,199 --> 01:31:21,000
They wanted very much to
kill Americans, he said,

1457
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:24,765
but so far had been unable to find any.

1458
01:31:24,865 --> 01:31:27,800
Moore quickly set up a command post

1459
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:32,166
behind one of the huge termite
mounds that dotted the clearing.

1460
01:31:32,265 --> 01:31:34,432
It would take until mid-afternoon

1461
01:31:34,533 --> 01:31:37,966
for all of his men to be ferried in.

1462
01:31:39,132 --> 01:31:41,033
He had no time to waste.

1463
01:31:41,132 --> 01:31:43,565
"We needed to get off the landing zone

1464
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:47,765
and get at them before they could
hit us," Moore remembered.

1465
01:31:47,865 --> 01:31:51,832
He sent two companies up the
slope toward the hidden enemy.

1466
01:31:51,932 --> 01:31:55,632
Most of the North Vietnamese,
like the Americans,

1467
01:31:55,733 --> 01:31:57,365
were new to combat.

1468
01:31:58,832 --> 01:32:01,100
They were ordered to fix bayonets.

1469
01:32:03,233 --> 01:32:04,932
LO KHAC TAM:

1470
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,600
NARRATOR: Colonel Moore
had no way of knowing

1471
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:22,100
that instead of 1,600 enemy
soldiers on the mountain,

1472
01:32:22,199 --> 01:32:27,865
there were 3,000... seven
times his strength.

1473
01:32:40,733 --> 01:32:42,033
(gunfire)

1474
01:32:42,132 --> 01:32:44,800
Within minutes, the
Americans found themselves

1475
01:32:44,899 --> 01:32:49,332
under attack from hundreds of
North Vietnamese soldiers.

1476
01:32:49,432 --> 01:32:52,932
In the fighting, an
overeager second lieutenant

1477
01:32:53,033 --> 01:32:56,065
led his platoon of 28 men too far away

1478
01:32:56,166 --> 01:32:59,565
from the rest of his company
and was surrounded.

1479
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:01,033
(gunfire, shouting)

1480
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:03,765
The lieutenant was killed.

1481
01:33:03,865 --> 01:33:08,033
The sergeant who took his place
was shot through the head.

1482
01:33:08,132 --> 01:33:12,666
By late afternoon, only seven
of the trapped platoon's men

1483
01:33:12,765 --> 01:33:16,065
were still capable of firing back.

1484
01:33:16,166 --> 01:33:19,432
(gunfire, shouting)

1485
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:29,332
Moore was now engaged in three
simultaneous struggles...

1486
01:33:29,432 --> 01:33:33,432
to defend the landing zone,
attack the North Vietnamese,

1487
01:33:33,533 --> 01:33:37,399
and find a way to rescue
his trapped patrol.

1488
01:33:40,332 --> 01:33:44,466
That night, Joe Galloway again
managed to talk his way

1489
01:33:44,565 --> 01:33:47,300
onto a chopper taking ammunition and water

1490
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:49,199
to the besieged Americans.

1491
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,432
As the helicopter
approached the battlefield,

1492
01:33:52,533 --> 01:33:55,065
Galloway was sitting on
a crate of grenades,

1493
01:33:55,166 --> 01:33:58,432
peering out into the darkness.

1494
01:33:58,533 --> 01:34:03,500
GALLOWAY: And I could see these
little pin pricks of light

1495
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,166
coming down the mountain.

1496
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:11,065
This was the enemy approaching
for the next day's attacks.

1497
01:34:12,666 --> 01:34:15,432
We flew in there.

1498
01:34:15,533 --> 01:34:19,699
As they pulled on out, it was dead dark.

1499
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,966
And we're lying there waiting
for someone to come tell us

1500
01:34:23,065 --> 01:34:24,332
what to do.

1501
01:34:27,466 --> 01:34:32,365
And the next morning, all of a
sudden the bottom fell out.

1502
01:34:34,832 --> 01:34:36,600
(gunfire)

1503
01:34:36,699 --> 01:34:40,733
There was an explosion of fire.

1504
01:34:42,166 --> 01:34:46,666
The noise is horrendous, unimaginable.

1505
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:49,800
(rapid gunfire, followed by short bursts)

1506
01:34:54,033 --> 01:34:56,899
(gunfire, shouting)

1507
01:34:58,966 --> 01:35:01,733
And in the middle of all of this, you know,

1508
01:35:01,832 --> 01:35:04,600
I-I just flattened out on the ground

1509
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:08,865
because all that was being
fired seemed to be about two,

1510
01:35:08,966 --> 01:35:12,265
two-and-a-half feet off the ground.

1511
01:35:12,365 --> 01:35:16,500
(gunfire, whistling)

1512
01:35:19,265 --> 01:35:22,033
NARRATOR: Hundreds of enemy
soldiers hurled themselves

1513
01:35:22,132 --> 01:35:23,432
at the Americans.

1514
01:35:24,932 --> 01:35:28,699
They wore webbed helmets
camouflaged with grass,

1515
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:33,632
and as they came, blowing
whistles, screaming,

1516
01:35:33,733 --> 01:35:37,932
they looked like "little trees,"
one American remembered.

1517
01:35:38,033 --> 01:35:40,733
They were trying to overrun us.

1518
01:35:40,832 --> 01:35:43,065
And they came close.

1519
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:45,365
They came close.

1520
01:35:52,733 --> 01:35:55,100
(gunfire, shouting)

1521
01:36:01,332 --> 01:36:04,699
But we had two things going for us.

1522
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:09,432
We had a great commander
and great soldiers.

1523
01:36:09,533 --> 01:36:16,033
And we had air and artillery
support out the yin-yang.

1524
01:36:16,132 --> 01:36:18,800
We had it, and they didn't.

1525
01:36:22,765 --> 01:36:27,500
NARRATOR: But using that air and
artillery support could be dangerous.

1526
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,533
Each of Moore's units carefully
marked its position with smoke

1527
01:36:31,632 --> 01:36:34,533
to keep from being mistaken for the enemy

1528
01:36:34,632 --> 01:36:36,899
by American airmen overhead.

1529
01:36:39,832 --> 01:36:41,265
LO KHAC TAM:

1530
01:36:48,432 --> 01:36:52,432
NARRATOR: Some 18,000 artillery
shells would be called in

1531
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:53,800
over the course of the battle,

1532
01:36:53,899 --> 01:36:58,865
some of them landing just 25
yards from Moore's own men.

1533
01:36:58,966 --> 01:37:04,432
Helicopter gunships fired
3,000 rockets into the enemy.

1534
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:06,966
The forward air controller

1535
01:37:07,065 --> 01:37:10,600
called for every available
aircraft in South Vietnam

1536
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:12,166
to come and help.

1537
01:37:12,265 --> 01:37:17,733
Warplanes, including B-52
long-range strategic bombers,

1538
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:21,966
were stacked at 1,000-foot
intervals above the battlefield,

1539
01:37:22,065 --> 01:37:25,199
from 7,000 to 35,000 feet,

1540
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:29,733
impatiently awaiting targets
to strafe or bomb or burn.

1541
01:37:32,065 --> 01:37:36,733
"By God," Moore said, "they sent
us over here to kill communists

1542
01:37:36,832 --> 01:37:38,332
and that's what we're doing."

1543
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,199
I looked up...

1544
01:37:48,065 --> 01:37:55,365
and there were two jets aiming
directly at our command post.

1545
01:37:55,466 --> 01:38:01,600
He's dropped two cans of napalm
and it's coming toward us,

1546
01:38:01,699 --> 01:38:05,632
loblolly, end over end.

1547
01:38:05,733 --> 01:38:10,432
And these kids, two or three
of 'em, plus a sergeant,

1548
01:38:10,533 --> 01:38:14,765
had dug a hole or two over on the edge.

1549
01:38:14,865 --> 01:38:19,800
And I looked as the thing exploded...

1550
01:38:23,932 --> 01:38:28,500
And two of them were dancing in that fire.

1551
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,432
And there's a rush, a roar,

1552
01:38:32,533 --> 01:38:36,600
from the air that's being consumed

1553
01:38:36,699 --> 01:38:42,632
and drawn in as this-this
hell come to earth

1554
01:38:42,733 --> 01:38:44,399
is burning there.

1555
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:49,666
And as that dies back a little,
then you can hear the screams.

1556
01:38:51,865 --> 01:38:56,800
And someone yells, "Get this man's feet."

1557
01:38:56,899 --> 01:39:03,765
And I reach down and the boots crumble,

1558
01:39:03,865 --> 01:39:07,966
and the flesh is cooked off of his ankles.

1559
01:39:08,065 --> 01:39:12,166
And I feel those bones in
the palms of my hands.

1560
01:39:12,265 --> 01:39:14,966

out of Rigby, Idaho.

NARRATOR: By 10:00 that morning,

1564
01:39:40,699 --> 01:39:44,365
American airpower had beaten
back the enemy assault.

1565
01:39:45,733 --> 01:39:47,865
The survivors from the trapped platoon

1566
01:39:47,966 --> 01:39:50,000
were rescued that afternoon.

1567
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:53,865
They had been pinned to
the ground and under fire

1568
01:39:53,966 --> 01:39:56,733
for so long that they had to be coaxed

1569
01:39:56,832 --> 01:39:59,065
into getting to their feet again.

1570
01:40:05,699 --> 01:40:07,733
On the morning of the next day,

1571

against the same sector

1572
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:14,399
of Moore's line four more times

1573
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:17,899

and two nights of combat,

1581
01:41:04,966 --> 01:41:08,132
helicopters began lifting
out the American survivors

1582
01:41:08,233 --> 01:41:11,100
and gathering up the dead.

1583
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,865
SOLDIER: When you look at them,

1584
01:41:12,966 --> 01:41:16,100
it doesn't even resemble a human body.

1585
01:41:16,199 --> 01:41:19,365
It just, it looks just like a mannequin.

"That couldn't happen to me."

It always galls me when I read or hear

1589
01:41:31,365 --> 01:41:33,466
about the World War II generation

1590
01:41:33,565 --> 01:41:35,365
as the greatest generation.

1591
01:41:35,466 --> 01:41:38,399
These kids were just as
gallant and as courageous

1592
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,699
as anybody who fought in World War II.

at Landing Zone X-Ray
in the la Drang Valley

Please convey to the American people

1597
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:01,733
what a tremendous fighting
man we have here.

1598
01:42:01,832 --> 01:42:07,199
He's courageous, he's
aggressive, and he's kind.

1599
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:11,065
And he'll go where you tell him to go.

1600
01:42:11,166 --> 01:42:13,666
And he's got self-discipline.

1601
01:42:13,765 --> 01:42:17,033
And he's got good unit discipline.

1602
01:42:17,132 --> 01:42:19,332
He's just an outstanding man.

1603
01:42:19,432 --> 01:42:20,932
And...

1604
01:42:22,432 --> 01:42:25,399
Having commanded this
battalion for 18 months...

1605
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,966
You must excuse my emotion here,

1606
01:42:30,065 --> 01:42:35,600
but when I see some of these men
go out the way they have...

1607
01:42:43,332 --> 01:42:45,365
I haven't...

1608

NARRATOR: Hal Moore refused to leave

1611
01:42:52,966 --> 01:42:57,600
until every single man in his
command had been accounted for.

1612
01:42:57,699 --> 01:43:02,800
He had been the first of his men
to step onto Landing Zone X-Ray,

1613
01:43:02,899 --> 01:43:06,166
and he made sure he was
the last to leave it.

suffered terrible losses

1616
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:47,233
in the la Drang Valley

1617
01:43:47,332 --> 01:43:51,000
and many of the survivors were traumatized.

1618
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:54,800
"The units were enveloped
in an atmosphere of gloom,"

1619
01:43:54,899 --> 01:43:56,865
a North Vietnamese colonel remembered.

1620
01:43:56,966 --> 01:44:01,265
Some men would not leave
their rope hammocks.

1621
01:44:01,365 --> 01:44:03,300
Some refused to wash.

1622
01:44:03,399 --> 01:44:08,600
One soldier wrote a poem
expressive of their plight:

1623
01:44:08,699 --> 01:44:11,365
"The crab lies still on the chopping block

1624
01:44:11,466 --> 01:44:15,500
Never knowing when the knife will fall."

1625
01:44:21,233 --> 01:44:26,932
GALLOWAY: In the la Drang we killed
ten of them for every one of us.

1626
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:32,733
That's a ten-to-one kill ratio
is how the military puts that.

1627
01:44:36,132 --> 01:44:42,500
But the enemy, he was fully
prepared to pay that price

1628
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:46,966
and more for the value of
the lessons he learned.

That means you've got to get so close,

1632
01:45:09,332 --> 01:45:15,865
they can't use the artillery and
the aerial bombardments on you

1633
01:45:15,966 --> 01:45:18,399
for fear of killing their own.

1634

Get in so close that it's man-on-man.

And then everything is even.

1636
01:45:27,733 --> 01:45:31,166
The Vietnamese suffered hundreds of dead

1637
01:45:31,265 --> 01:45:34,100
attacking Hal Moore's
battalion at LZ X-Ray.

1638
01:45:34,199 --> 01:45:39,932
But then they ambushed another
battalion a couple of days later

1639
01:45:40,033 --> 01:45:43,199
and wiped it out.

NARRATOR: In the fighting
near Landing Zone Albany,

1641
01:45:45,966 --> 01:45:49,865
the enemy had gotten too close
for artillery to be called in.

1642

Out of some 425 Americans
involved, 155 were killed.

124 more were wounded.

Both sides claimed victory
in the la Drang Valley.

The Americans talked up
the number of enemy dead

1646

at Landing Zone X-Ray.

01:46:17,632 --> 01:46:19,765

01:46:29,399 --> 01:46:34,800
that this conflict will end any time soon,

1652
01:46:34,899 --> 01:46:39,466
and we could find that we have
more difficult days ahead.

1653
01:46:39,565 --> 01:46:42,365
Certainly we must be prepared for this.

1654
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:55,000
EHRHART: In the fall of my
senior year, November 1965,

1655
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:58,432
was that huge battle at
the la Drang Valley,

1656
01:46:58,533 --> 01:47:01,432
which was the first time
there was actually confirmed

1657
01:47:01,533 --> 01:47:03,932
North Vietnamese regular
soldiers as opposed

1658
01:47:04,033 --> 01:47:05,666
to Viet Cong.

1659
01:47:05,765 --> 01:47:08,666
And of course my way of
interpreting that was,

1660
01:47:08,765 --> 01:47:10,265
"There it is, that's the proof.

1661
01:47:10,365 --> 01:47:12,265
The North Vietnamese are
the aggressors here."

1662
01:47:12,365 --> 01:47:16,765
And that's when I began
thinking in terms of

1663
01:47:16,865 --> 01:47:19,265
maybe I don't want to go
to college right away.

1664
01:47:19,365 --> 01:47:22,565
Maybe I'll join the Marines.

1665
01:47:22,666 --> 01:47:23,808
And it was always the Marines.

1666
01:47:23,832 --> 01:47:25,565
I never... there was no question.

1667
01:47:25,666 --> 01:47:27,308

and the Johnson

In spite of the Americans'
new airborne mobility,

1675
01:47:46,699 --> 01:47:49,132
the enemy had been able to choose

1676

the place and time of battle.

1681
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:09,466
nine North Vietnamese regiments, not three.

Hanoi seemed to be escalating, too.

"Westy, the American people
don't care about the ten.

Westmoreland, who had

before I was there...

1719
01:50:07,233 --> 01:50:08,466
that the war was unwinnable.

1720
01:50:08,565 --> 01:50:10,365
That's what makes me mad.

1721
01:50:10,466 --> 01:50:12,666
Making a mistake, people can do that.

1722
01:50:12,765 --> 01:50:14,432
But covering up mistakes,

1723
01:50:14,533 --> 01:50:18,699
then you're killing
people for your own ego.

1724
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:21,966
And that makes me mad.

1725
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,675
NARRATOR: Tens of thousands
of American troops

1726
01:50:25,699 --> 01:50:29,500
continued to prepare to deploy to Vietnam

1727
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:30,699
from all over the country,

1728
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:34,233
and General Westmoreland and his commanders

1729
01:50:34,332 --> 01:50:36,432
drew up plans for major offensives

1730
01:50:36,533 --> 01:50:39,699
in the new year of 1966.

1731
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:47,000
Meanwhile, hoping the Soviets
might help bring Hanoi

1732
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:50,966
to the bargaining table,
McNamara urged the president

1733
01:50:51,065 --> 01:50:55,300
to declare a halt to the
bombing of North Vietnam.

1734
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:57,932
Over the objections of the military,

1735
01:50:58,033 --> 01:51:00,699
who worried it would give
the enemy time to rebuild

1736
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:05,065
its defenses, Johnson
agreed to stop the bombing

1737
01:51:05,166 --> 01:51:07,899
on Christmas Eve.

1738
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,132
If it achieved nothing else, he said,

1739
01:51:10,233 --> 01:51:12,432
it would show the American people

1740
01:51:12,533 --> 01:51:15,865
that before he committed more
of their sons to battle,

1741
01:51:15,966 --> 01:51:19,000
"We have gone the last mile."

1742
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:24,265
("Little Drummer Boy" by Burl Ives playing)

1743
01:51:24,365 --> 01:51:29,832
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: Well, Christmas
always meant a great deal in our family.

1744
01:51:29,932 --> 01:51:34,332
We sent packages to Denton, of course.

1745
01:51:34,432 --> 01:51:36,500
Then a neighbor mentioned to me

1746
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:41,033
that she heard a local
television station was offering

1747
01:51:41,132 --> 01:51:44,932
free tapes to be made to
send to a soldier overseas.

1748
01:51:45,033 --> 01:51:49,699
We dressed up for the cameras.

1749
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:52,533
The idea was that we would
each just say something

1750
01:51:52,632 --> 01:51:55,865
about what we were doing and wish him well.

1751
01:51:58,033 --> 01:52:00,533
It was a horrible day for me.

1752
01:52:00,632 --> 01:52:05,565
It made it so real that he was far away.

1753
01:52:05,666 --> 01:52:08,932
Well, Mogie, here we are.

1754
01:52:09,033 --> 01:52:12,733
It's... let's see what day is today.

1755
01:52:12,832 --> 01:52:14,033
Here it is, Saturday...

1756
01:52:14,132 --> 01:52:15,132
November 13.

1757
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:17,300
November 13,

1758
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:22,466
and station WTEN has given
us a chance to talk to you.

1759
01:52:22,565 --> 01:52:25,000
We all wish you a Merry Christmas

1760
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:26,332
to start out with.

1761
01:52:27,765 --> 01:52:30,100
Rand, what do you got to say to Mogie?

1762
01:52:30,199 --> 01:52:31,466
Merry Christmas.

1763
01:52:31,565 --> 01:52:32,600
Merry Christmas.

1764
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,733
Merry Christmas, darling.

1765
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:37,100
We sent your packages

1766
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:39,041
and there's one that's
waiting for you at home.

1767
01:52:39,065 --> 01:52:40,666
It's a record of fife and drum music

1768
01:52:40,765 --> 01:52:43,365
that we got for you at Williamsburg.

1769
01:52:43,466 --> 01:52:44,466
Candy?

1770
01:52:46,265 --> 01:52:52,000
My teacher isn't very nice,
and she always is crabby,

1771
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,565
and I don't like school at all.

1772
01:52:54,666 --> 01:52:56,600
Now I'm a brownie.

1773
01:52:56,699 --> 01:52:58,265
Merry Christmas.

1774
01:52:59,765 --> 01:53:01,033
Happy Christmas, Mogie.

1775
01:53:01,132 --> 01:53:02,899
I think I'm getting new skis for Christmas.

1776
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,040
So when you get home, we
can get together sometime.

1777
01:53:05,132 --> 01:53:08,600
We do all wish you a very Merry Christmas,

1778
01:53:08,699 --> 01:53:10,899
and we'll be thinking of
you on Christmas Day.

1779
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:15,560
