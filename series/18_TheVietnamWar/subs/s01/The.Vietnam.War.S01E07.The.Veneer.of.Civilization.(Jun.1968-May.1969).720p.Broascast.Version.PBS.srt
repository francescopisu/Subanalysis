had great virtues.

45
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,566
It was a safe place to grow up.

46
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,466

O'BRIEN: I remember the day
my draft notice arrived.

57
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:14,000
It was a summer afternoon,
maybe June of '68.

58
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,665
And I remember taking that
envelope into the house

59
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,265
and putting it on the kitchen table

60
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,233
where my mom and dad were having lunch.

61
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:22,599
And they didn't even read it.

62
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:25,165
They just looked at it
and knew what it was.

63
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:27,466
And the silence of that lunch...

64
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:30,900
I didn't speak, my mom didn't
speak, my dad didn't speak...

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,432
was just that piece of paper

66
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,599
lying at the center of the table.

67
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:39,233
It was enough to make me cry
to this day, not for myself,

68
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:40,932
but for my mom and dad,

69
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:44,533
who both of them had been in
the Navy during World War II,

70
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:48,500
had believed in service to one's
country and all those values.

71
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,566
HOWARD TUCKNER: ...considers all
civilians potential enemies...

72
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:58,000
O'BRIEN: On the one hand I did think
the war was less than righteous.

73
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,133
On the other hand I love my country.

74
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:08,932
And I valued my life in a small
town and my friends and family.

75
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:13,165
And so the summer of '68, I
wrestled with what to do,

76
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,832
was for me, at least, more torturous

77
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:20,365
and devastating and emotionally painful

78
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,233
than anything that happened in Vietnam.

79
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:28,932
In the end I just capitulated.

80
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:34,966
And one day I got on a bus
with other recent graduates,

81
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,300
and we went over to Sioux
Falls about 60 miles away,

82
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,100
and raised our hands and got in the Army.

83
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,500
But it wasn't a decision, it was
a forfeiture of a decision.

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,832
It was letting my body go,

85
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:49,899
turning a switch in my conscience,

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
just turning it off,

87
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,500
so it wouldn't be barking at me saying,

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,766
"You're doing a bad and evil and
stupid and unpatriotic thing."

89
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,365
Last week's casualty figures in
the Vietnam War released today

90
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:16,132

injustice, over human rights...

104
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:31,466
seemed to have spread everywhere.

105
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:38,132
The pressure to bring an end
to the war was building.

106
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,832
President Lyndon Johnson
had already decided

107
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,632
not to run again,

108
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:46,533
assassinations and unrest
had staggered the nation,

109
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:50,800
and the country was preparing
to choose a new president.

110
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,165
Meanwhile, American and North
Vietnamese diplomats in Paris

111
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,565
were getting nowhere.

112

all bombing of North Vietnam.

of defense, Clark Clifford,

117
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,899
who had turned from hawk to dove

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,266
after just a few months in office,

119
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:20,665
begged the president to call a total halt.

120
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,533
"We can only hope for success
at the bargaining table,"

121
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:25,132
he told Johnson.

122
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,832
"We are in a war we cannot win."

123
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:31,665
The president refused to stop the bombing.

124
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,766
Over the following months,

125
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,432
there would be reports of
progress on the battlefield

126
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,632
and in the countryside.

127
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:49,399
But that progress came so
slowly and at so high a cost

128

in human lives that the war against the war

129

00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:00,065
pitting classes and generations
against one another,

131
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:04,000
spreading distrust of political
leaders who seemed unable

132
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,365
or unwilling to bring
the fighting to an end.

that the U.S. Marine outpost at Khe Sanh,

MAX CLELAND: Johnson had
said in the fall of '67,

157
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,332
and as we went into '68,

158
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:36,332
"I don't want no damn Dien Bien Phu."

159
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:41,365
So the whole American military,
from the Joint Chiefs on down,

160
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:45,299
whether they believed in
saving Khe Sanh or not,

161
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,466
were hell-bent for leather
to make damn sure

the siege was broken.

163
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,500
Now the telltale moment
of that is that a week

164
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,799
after the siege was broken,

165
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,399
they plowed the base
under and abandoned it.

166
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,600
That was Vietnam in a microcosm.

00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,765
He's grumpy in the morning.

177
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,832
Sometimes staff officers would
schedule appointments with him

178
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:38,966
in the morning

179
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:40,986
for, with generals who
were causing him trouble.

180
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:45,566
NARRATOR: Abrams was a welcome
new face for the American war.

181
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:50,399
Reporters found him more frank
and open than his predecessor.

182
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,533
"The overall public affairs
policy of this command,"

183
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,432
he told his subordinates,

184
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,765
"will be to let results
speak for themselves."

185
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:02,633
"Occasionally," one officer
said, "we are allowed

186
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:07,666
to state frankly that we didn't
do a damn thing this month."

187
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:11,232
Many soldiers would believe
for the rest of their lives

188
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:13,932
that if Abrams had taken command sooner,

189
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,399
the outcome could have been different.

190
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,299
VINCENT OKAMOTO: You're
told very succinctly,

191
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,365
"We need to rack up as
much body count as we can.

192
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:32,265
How many gooks did you kill today?"

193
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:34,700
And it was the kill ratio that determined

194
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,899
whether or not you called
it a victory or a loss.

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,566
So if you killed 20 North Vietnamese

196
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,765
and lost only two people,

197
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:47,165
they declared a great victory
for that particular firefight.

198
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:52,399
NARRATOR: Lieutenant Vincent Okamoto
was born during World War II

199
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,100
in a Japanese-American internment camp

200
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,600
at Poston, Arizona, the seventh
son of Japanese immigrants.

201
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,666
All six of his brothers
had served in uniform...

202
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:08,033
two fought with the celebrated
442nd Regimental Combat Team

203
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,932
in Italy and France,

204
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:13,133
the most highly decorated
unit of that war...

205
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:18,265
and so, when Okamoto's country
went to war in Vietnam,

206
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:20,466
he believed he should go, too.

207
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:26,432
He was now a platoon leader with
Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion,

208
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:32,265
27th Regiment, 25th Infantry
Division, based at Cu Chi,

209
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:37,133
some 20 miles northwest of
Saigon, an area honeycombed

210
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:40,299
with miles of Viet Cong tunnels.

211
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,566
OKAMOTO: My parents are
Japanese immigrants.

212
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,566
I had rice literally every day of my life

213
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:51,865
until I went into the military.

214
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:58,399
So we were conducting a cordon
and search of a village.

215
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,799
Didn't find any weapons,

216
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:05,365
didn't find any communist
literature or whatever.

217
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:08,000
So we took a prolonged lunch break.

218
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,432
Everybody wants to get out of the sun.

219
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:14,732
Well, my RTO, my medic and I

220
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:16,899
went into this particular
house, and there was...

221
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,166
there were three women, and a babe in arms,

222
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:22,865
and a kid about four years old.

223
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:26,932
And she was cooking... rice.

224
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,299
Well, here, here's Okamoto, Mrs.
Okamoto's son,

225
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,100
that hadn't had rice now... hot,
steamed rice... for months.

226
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,932
I'm looking at it, it
looks pretty good to me.

227
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,966
So I-I get my interpreter.

228
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:42,332
I said, "Hey, tell this woman, the grandma,

229
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:45,765
"that I'll give her a pack of cigarettes,

230
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:49,932
"my C-ration turkey loaf,
and a can of peaches

231
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:52,566
for some of that steamed rice
and that fish and vegetables."

232
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:55,432
It was great.

233
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,332
And I asked for seconds.

234
00:13:57,432 --> 00:14:00,466
My RTO says, "Damn, ain't
these people poor enough

235
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:03,100
without you eating their food?"

236
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,365
I said, "You know, hell,
they got enough rice here

237
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:08,066
to feed a dozen men."

238
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,299
And then, it just dawned,

239
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,432
they did have enough rice
to feed a dozen men.

240
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:16,332
So I had my interpreter ask the woman,

241
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:18,500
"Who's all this rice for?"

242
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,100
(speaking Vietnamese)

243
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,700
"I don't know, I don't know."

244
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,399
So we started looking around again.

245
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,165
We found a tunnel mouth.

246
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,033
I was given a grenade.

247
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,765
After the smoke cleared,
we pulled, I think,

248
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:42,000
seven or eight bodies to the town square.

249
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,365
And we wanted to see who
would cry over these people.

250
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,500
And then we'd have more people to question.

251
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,932
The women that lived in that house,

252
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,566
and I had eaten their rice,

253
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,332
they're all squatting down, wailing.

254
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,072
And you couldn't identify these, these...

255
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,666
they're just charred bodies.

256
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:05,232
Um...

257
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:07,332
And I think that was the first time I knew

258
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:10,066
that I personally had killed people.

259
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:14,232
I got an "Attaboy" from the supervisor.

260
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:15,732
But, uh...

261
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,066
it wasn't something that you
can say had glory in it,

262
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,500
or you felt a real sense of accomplishment.

263
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:26,500
NARRATOR: Over that summer,
Okamoto was wounded two times

264
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,665
and made 22 helicopter assaults,

265
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:33,299
four of them as commander of Bravo Company.

266
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,732
On the morning of August 23,
he made his 23rd assault.

267
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:43,033
Nineteen helicopters ferried
the first and second platoons

268
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:47,633
to a new landing zone near Cambodia.

269
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:50,700
Their task was to dig in, stay put,

270
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,700
and somehow block a battalion
of North Vietnamese troops,

271
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,000
who were trying to escape
across the border.

272
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,033
Okamoto's unit was reinforced by a platoon

273
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:05,732
of mechanized infantry,
three APCs, and a tank,

274
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,932
but they were still badly outnumbered.

275
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:14,000
He and the fewer than 150
men under his command

276
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,066
spent the rest of that
day and all of the next

277
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,332
preparing as best they could for an attack,

278
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:22,166
setting Claymore mines

279
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:25,765
and hanging three coils of razor wire.

280
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:31,500
OKAMOTO: August the 24th,
about 10:00 that night,

281
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,133
we got hit with a very
heavy mortar barrage.

282
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:36,500
(shouting, explosions)

283
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,100
Within the first I would say ten seconds,

284
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,732
all three of those armored
personnel carriers and tanks

285
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:46,232
were knocked out with
rocket-propelled grenades.

286
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,399
NARRATOR: Trip flares briefly
lit up the landscape.

287
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,133
Scores of enemy troops were running at them

288
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,232
through the elephant grass.

289
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,500
(gunfire)

290
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:04,532
VC mortar shells blasted two
gaps in the razor wire.

291
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:08,299
If Okamoto and his outnumbered
men couldn't plug them,

292
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,865
they were sure to be overrun.

293
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:14,700
He and the four men closest
to him held their M-16s

294
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,665
above their heads and fired blindly.

295
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:21,432
The enemy kept coming.

296
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:23,165
OKAMOTO: I had my four people.

297
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:26,732
And through the light
of the flares, I said,

298
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,700
"A couple you guys go and
man the machine guns

299
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,200
out on those APCs."

300
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,365
Well, the response I got was, like, uh...

301
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,333
"Fuck you, I ain't going up there."

302
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:40,532
So I ran to the first armored
personnel carrier, and I...

303
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:44,133
pulled the, the gunner
out of the turret, dead.

304
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:47,700
I jumped in there, manned the machine gun,

305
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,532
and fired until it ran out of ammo.

306
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:54,500
NARRATOR: Okamoto moved to
the second disabled APC

307
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,465
and then the third, emptying their guns.

308
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:01,766
OKAMOTO: And they were still coming at us.

309
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:05,500
So I crawled out there, till I
was about ten meters from 'em.

310
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,165
And I killed 'em with hand grenades.

311
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:11,965
NARRATOR: Two enemy grenades fell near him

312
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,532
and he managed to throw both back.

313
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:18,365
But a third landed just beyond his reach.

314
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:22,099
Shrapnel fragments peppered
his legs and back.

315
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:27,032
OKAMOTO: I just knew for
sure I was going to die.

316
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,165
"Okamoto, you're not going
to make it out of here.

317
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,500
"Mom's going to take it hard,

318
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:33,799
but, you know, you're not going
to make it out of here."

319
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,232
And that's liberating.

320
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,665
When you know you're going
to die, you don't...

321
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,099
the fear leaves.

322
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,000
At least in my case, I
was no longer afraid.

323
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,176
I was just mad because here
are all these little guys

324
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,232
trying to kill my ass.

325
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,165
And if that's the case,

326
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:51,066
then I'm going to make it as
tough on them as I possibly can

327
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,165
before I go down.

328
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:57,732
I killed a lot of brave men that night.

329
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,965
And I rationalized that by telling myself,

330
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,900
"Well, maybe what you did... just maybe...

331
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,465
saved the lives of a
couple of your people."

332
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:13,165
NARRATOR: During the night, the
enemy had slipped into Cambodia,

333
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:16,633
dragging as many of their
dead with them as they could.

334
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,799
A third of Okamoto's company had been lost.

335
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,300
("The Lord Is in This Place" by
Fairport Convention playing)

336
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,833
For his efforts that day,

337
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:31,766
Vincent Okamoto received the
Distinguished Service Cross,

338
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:35,333
the Army's second highest honor.

339
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:37,833
Before his tour of duty ended,

340
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:41,833
he would become the most highly
decorated Japanese-American

341
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,633
to survive the Vietnam War.

342
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,066
OKAMOTO: You know what?

343
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:50,566
(sighs)

344
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:53,066
The real heroes are the men that died.

345
00:19:56,532 --> 00:20:00,133
19-, 20-year-old high school dropouts.

346
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,566
They didn't have escape
routes that the elite

347
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:06,333
and the wealthy and the privileged had.

348
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:07,432
And that was unfair.

349
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,266
And so they looked upon
military service as...

350
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:15,032
(sighs)

351
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,700
...like the weather.

352
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,665
You had to go in, and you'd do it.

353
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:25,066
But to see these kids, who
had the least to gain,

354
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:26,575
there wasn't anything to look forward to;

355
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,965
they weren't going to be rewarded

356
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:31,032
for their service in Vietnam.

357
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:36,766
And yet their infinite patience,
their loyalty to each other,

358
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:41,266
their courage under fire
was just phenomenal.

359
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:44,900
And you would ask yourself,

360
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,865
"How does America produce
young men like this?"

361
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:04,032
HUY DUC:

362
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:32,766
NARRATOR: At first, Radio Hanoi
had portrayed the Tet Offensive

363
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:35,633
as a series of "tremendous victories"

364
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:39,232
in which "hundreds of thousands
of people have risen up

365
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:43,333
and destroyed enemy positions."

366
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:47,232
"But after a couple of weeks,"
one North Vietnamese remembered,

367
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,133
"we didn't hear any more news.

368
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:52,500
"The Saigon regime was still there

369
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,865
"and the U.S. planes were still bombing.

370
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:59,665
It was obvious the radio
wasn't telling the truth."

371
00:22:04,165 --> 00:22:06,900
Casualty figures were never revealed,

372
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,599
but to North Vietnamese citizens
secretly listening to reports

373
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,299
on the BBC and Radio Saigon,

374
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,665
it was clear that they had been heavy.

375
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:21,333
PHAM LUC:

376
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,232
HUY DUC:

377
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:23,766
NARRATOR: In late August 1968, Le Duan
and the North Vietnamese leadership

378
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:26,833
launched still another offensive.

379
00:23:26,932 --> 00:23:30,633
The result was the same
as Tet and Mini-Tet.

380
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,965
They lost 17,000 more men.

381
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,865
Thousands of fresh recruits
had to be ordered south

382
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:43,133
to replace them.

383
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:45,833
"The war began to seem like an open pit,"

384
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:48,400
one North Vietnamese remembered.

385
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,633
"The more young people were lost
there, the more they sent."

386
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,333
The sons of some party officials

387
00:23:56,432 --> 00:24:00,232
and their friends were sent
abroad to escape the draft.

388
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,566
University students were exempted.

389
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:05,232
People with money bribed recruiters

390
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,599
to overlook their offspring

391
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,465
or paid physicians to declare
them unfit to serve.

392
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,532
HUY DUC:

393
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,633
NARRATOR: Most draftees were poor
people from the countryside,

394
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:34,599
especially receptive to the slogans

395
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,333
and promises of the revolution.

396
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:40,633
Thousands of replacements made their way

397
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:42,599
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail

398
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,032
past burned-out vehicles
and military graveyards,

399
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:50,299
the stones neatly marked
with the names of the dead

400
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,732
and the date each had died.

401
00:24:54,732 --> 00:24:57,900
They encountered small
groups of wounded men

402
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,333
moving in the other direction.

403
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,133
Those without arms walked.

404
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,032
Legless men rode in camouflaged trucks.

405
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:08,566
There were blinded soldiers

406
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:12,865
and others who had been
hideously burned by napalm.

407
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:15,465
"You'll see all kinds of
pleasures in the South,"

408
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:20,099
the weary wounded told the young
men moving toward the war.

409
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,599
"Everyone was frightened," a
political officer remembered,

410
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,700
"especially when we met those men.

411
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,932
It was like looking at our future selves."

412
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,133
The youngest delegate of
the New Jersey delegation

413
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:38,766
casts his vote for the next
president of the United States,

414
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:39,900
Richard Nixon.

415
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,665
We've got 18.

416
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:45,799
David, we doubled it, 18.

417
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,333
NARRATOR: Richard Nixon
had been a prominent

418
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:51,365
and controversial figure
in American politics

419
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:54,365
for more than two decades.

420
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,732
He'd been a congressman and senator,

421
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,799
best known for his fierce anticommunism,

422
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,099
then served eight years

423
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,266
as Dwight Eisenhower's vice president.

424
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:08,232
He narrowly lost the presidential race

425
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:11,099
to John Kennedy in 1960

426
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,365
and was defeated again two years later

427
00:26:13,465 --> 00:26:16,599
trying to become governor of California.

428
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,865
His career seemed to be over.

429
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:25,000
But then, in one of the most
extraordinary comebacks

430
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:27,232
in U.S. political history,

431
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,665
he had outsmarted and out-maneuvered

432
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:31,633
and out-campaigned his rivals

433
00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:36,432
to win the 1968 Republican nomination.

434
00:26:36,532 --> 00:26:38,365
MAN: Richard M. Nixon...

435
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:39,965
(cheering and applause)

436
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:45,900
His pick for vice president
was the tough-talking

437
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,266
but largely unknown governor
of Maryland, Spiro Agnew.

438
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,333
Nixon made the case for himself

439
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:57,965
as the man who could bring a
fractured America together

440
00:26:58,066 --> 00:27:02,000
and bring an honorable end to the war.

441
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:05,732
When the strongest nation in
the world can be tied down

442
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:09,732
for four years in a war in
Vietnam with no end in sight;

443
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,708
when the richest nation
in the world can't manage

444
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:13,633
its own economy;

445
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,633
when the nation with the greatest tradition

446
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:19,500
of the rule of law is plagued
by unprecedented lawlessness;

447
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,799
when a nation that has
been known for a century

448
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,299
for equality of opportunity

449
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,799
is torn by unprecedented racial violence;

450
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,965
and when the president of the United States

451
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,732
cannot travel abroad or
to any major city at home

452
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,432
without fear of a hostile demonstration,

453
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:38,900
then it's time for new leadership

454
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,700
for the United States of America.

455
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,900
(cheering)

456
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,633
Good evening from Chicago,

457
00:27:51,732 --> 00:27:53,932
where the 35th National
Democratic Convention

458
00:27:54,032 --> 00:27:57,566
opens tomorrow with the promise
of turmoil inside this hall

459
00:27:57,665 --> 00:27:59,532
and a threat of violence without.

460
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:03,465
JOHN LAURENCE: Both sides moved in
their troops on a balmy Sunday morning

461
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,766
for the confrontation of Chicago.

462
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:07,833
Some 6,000 crack Army troops,

463
00:28:07,932 --> 00:28:10,732
riot trained and ready for action...

464
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:14,365
The Army soldiers moved out to
secret locations around the city

465
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:17,032
after one of the largest troop
movements in domestic history.

466
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,865
NARRATOR: Some 15,000 protestors
had gathered in Chicago,

467
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:27,365
most to register their
anguish over the war...

468
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,599
Some bent on disrupting the convention.

469
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:39,633
Richard J. Daley, the
Democratic mayor of Chicago,

470
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:43,566
was determined that there
be no trouble in his city.

471
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:49,665
Twelve thousand Chicago
policemen were on alert.

472
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:53,099
In addition to the 6,000 U.S. Army troops,

473
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,965
there were 6,000 more
armed National Guardsmen

474
00:28:57,066 --> 00:29:00,932
and a thousand intelligence
agents from the FBI,

475
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:04,165
the CIA, and the military.

476
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,432
Mayor Daley cordoned off
the Chicago Amphitheater

477
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:10,066
where the convention was being held

478
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,599
and denied the protestors permits to march

479
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,299
or to sleep in the city's parks.

480
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,575
INTERVIEWER: Are you planning
to go without the permit

481
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,732
if you don't get the permit?

482
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,200
RENNIE DAVIS: Given the fact

483
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:25,865
that for many months we
have notified this city

484
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:29,700
and this nation that we wish
to hold a demonstration,

485
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,566
an assembly in Chicago

486
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:34,165
to register our convictions about the war,

487
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:37,665
the tens of thousands of people
coming to the city of Chicago

488
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:39,532
constitute a permit.

489
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,766
Our fight is with the militarism

490
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,566
that is developing in this country

491
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:48,500
in the response to legitimate
political and social grievances

492
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,465
by bringing in troops

493
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:53,432
rather than dealing with the
real issues and real problems.

494
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:59,172
CRONKITE: In the name of
security, freedom of the press,

495
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,432
freedom of movement, perhaps as far

496
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:03,566
as the demonstrators
themselves are concerned,

497
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:07,766
even freedom of speech have
been severely restricted here.

498
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:12,932
A democratic convention is about
to begin in a police state.

499
00:30:13,032 --> 00:30:15,599
There just doesn't seem to
be any other way to say it.

500
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:20,200
JOHN BAILEY: Will the
delegates please be seated.

501
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:22,232
NARRATOR: Vice President Hubert Humphrey,

502
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:25,766
President Johnson's chosen
successor, was the frontrunner.

503
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:30,000
He had always been a hero to
his party's liberal wing,

504
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:33,000
but because he had loyally
supported the president

505
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:36,965
and the war, many delegates,
and most of the demonstrators

506
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:41,200
outside the convention hall,
backed his antiwar rival,

507
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,066
Senator Eugene McCarthy.

508
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:47,266
(muffled shouting on megaphone)

509
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:49,833
On the second night of the convention,

510
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,000
the police drove hundreds of demonstrators

511
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:55,965
out of Lincoln Park with
clubs and tear gas.

512
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,732
(sirens wailing)

513
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,109
JOHN CHANCELLOR: The delegates wearing
bands of black crepe on their arms...

514
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:07,299
NARRATOR: The next afternoon,
the Democrats heatedly debated

515
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,900
a plank in the party platform
calling for an end to the war.

516
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,500
When Humphrey supporters voted it down,

517
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,266
the antiwar delegates erupted.

518
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:21,841
CHANCELLOR: ...who have joined New York
in this extraordinary demonstration

519
00:31:21,865 --> 00:31:26,365
of antiwar sentiment on
the convention floor.

520
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:28,441
("Street Fighting Man" by
the Rolling Stones playing)

521
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:30,708
DOUGLAS KIKER (on TV): The demonstrators
resisted when police attempted to arrest

522
00:31:30,732 --> 00:31:33,032
a young man who tried to
rip down an American flag.

523
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:35,232
PROTESTOR: Watch... watch these fuckers.

524
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,165
Don't turn your back on these fuckers!

525
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,900
MICK JAGGER: ♪ Everywhere I
hear the sound of marching... ♪

526
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,341
PHILIP CAPUTO: The cops were all...

527
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:46,925
they were guys from the neighborhoods...

528
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,599
Italians, Polish guys, Irish guys.

529
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,032
Probably some of them had been in Vietnam.

530
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,633
And if they hadn't been,

531
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:58,766
they certainly had cousins
or brothers who were.

532
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:03,165
NARRATOR: Philip Caputo, who had
fought with the Marines in Vietnam,

533
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:05,066
was now a reporter,

534
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:09,066
assigned to cover the
conflict in American streets.

535
00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:11,965
Get a picture of them throwing the rocks!

536
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,066
CAPUTO: So all of a sudden
the streets are filled

537
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:18,333
with these kids who don't
look like college kids

538
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,932
are supposed to look in the cops' view.

539
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:22,833
(protestors shouting, sirens wailing)

540
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:24,532
(explosion)

541
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:26,313
And some of them were committing vandalism

542
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,099
and yelling obscenities.

543
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,665
And I think a lot of policemen saw that

544
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:40,032
as abusing the privileges that
they had and scorning them.

545
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:41,532
They are provoking us

546
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:44,566
but we do not want to confront
them now... move back, please.

(screaming)

553
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:19,000
That's a report, on film, from
Grant Park, downtown Chicago.

554
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,633
NARRATOR: That evening,
thousands of demonstrators,

555
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:26,833
barred from getting anywhere
near the convention,

556
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:30,833
were marching toward
Democratic Party headquarters

557
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:34,066
in the Hilton Hotel on
Michigan Avenue instead.

558
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:37,566
ALINE SAARINEN: The marchers seem
to have come from everywhere

559
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:41,099
and now are coming up
south on Michigan Avenue

560
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,566
back toward the point where

561
00:33:42,665 --> 00:33:46,500
the police were blocking them before.

562
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,042
NATIONAL GUARDSMAN: Get your hands up!

563
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,599
Hands up!

564
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,932
Come on!

565
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:55,900
(shouting)

566
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:02,766
Come on now! Go! Go!

567
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:06,565
I place before you for the
Democratic nomination

568
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:09,365
as president of the United States

569
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:13,733
the name of Senator Eugene J.
McCarthy of Minnesota.

570
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:17,900
(cheers and applause)

571
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,233
Downtown Chicago at Balbo
and Michigan Avenues,

572
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:26,000
there has been in progress for
some time a peace demonstration.

573
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,365
The police have come to put it down.

574
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:30,965
The National Guard has been called to help.

575
00:34:31,065 --> 00:34:34,465
(crowd chanting "sieg heil" at police)

576
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:45,965
(chanting continues)

577
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:50,300

578
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:56,865

580

Get him! Get him!

GABE PRESSMAN: ...people screaming...

582
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:13,108
JAMES WILLBANKS: I turned
on the television.

583
00:35:13,132 --> 00:35:14,976
I don't think I was too
particularly thoughtful

584
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,300
as a junior in college,

585
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,666
but I thought the country was
coming apart at the seams.

586
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:21,900
It looked like we were
devolving into madness.

587
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:27,532
And I couldn't tell, was it
protestors or the police

588
00:35:27,632 --> 00:35:28,632
or was everybody insane?

589
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:32,532
(crowd chanting)

590
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:34,333
(gavel pounding)

591
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,065
NARRATOR: At the convention
there was more confusion.

592
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:40,166
Some antiwar delegates once pledged

593
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:43,465
to the murdered Robert Kennedy
now threw their support

594
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:45,565
behind yet another candidate,

595
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:49,266
South Dakota senator George McGovern.

596
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:52,599
ABRAHAM RIBICOFF: And with George McGovern
as president of the United States,

597
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:56,599
we wouldn't have to have Gestapo tactics

598
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:00,465
in the streets of Chicago.

599
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:07,233
(crowd reacts boisterously)

600
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,666
PRESSMAN: The persistent
chanting by the crowd,

601
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:11,965
"The whole world is watching."

602
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:15,266
NARRATOR: LBJ, watching
the chaos on television,

603
00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:17,233
considered flying to Chicago

604
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:20,465
and getting back in the race himself.

605
00:36:20,565 --> 00:36:23,500
Mayor Daley told the president
he'd have enough delegates

606
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,400
to win the nomination,

607
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,800
but the Secret Service warned it
could not guarantee his safety.

608
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:38,766
RON FERRIZZI: I got to Australia the
last week of August 1968... R&R.

609
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:41,365
I never really wanted to go on R&R.

610
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,965
I felt that, how can you relax?

611
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,733
So I turn on the TV and the first scene...

612
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,000
The TV gets bright.

613
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,599
The first scene on... it was the camera...

614
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:56,599
was a close-up, was over the
shoulder of this storm trooper

615
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:58,900
who had a kid by the scruff of his shirt.

616
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,532
And he smacks him with his bat.

617
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:04,632
And there's blood and
everything and all this jumble.

618
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:07,400
And then the camera pans
out and it's far away.

619
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,142
And these riots and there's
fighting going on.

620
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,733
And I go, "Oh, my God,

621
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,532
the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia."

622
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:15,532
And then ditto, ditto, ditto,
"Chicago Democratic Convention,

623
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:17,400
United States of America."

624
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,000
And I said... you know,
at that moment my...

625
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,000
I-I was politicized.

I realized that anybody who
really cared for America

631
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,766
was sent halfway around the
world chasing some ghost

Humphrey won the nomination
on the first ballot.

646

He told the press how pleased he was,

but he confessed to his wife
that the convention had left him

feeling heartbroken, battered, and beaten,

649
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:42,599
as if he'd survived a shipwreck.

650
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:47,233
A presidential commission would
declare what had happened

651
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:51,565

but in a Gallup poll,

56% of Americans approved

00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,733
of the way the police had
handled the demonstrators.

656
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:09,900
nearly half a million Chicagoans

I really can't tell you too
much about this country

except the rice paddies stink.

660
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:27,432
And it's just miles and miles
of nothing but rice paddies.

661
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,932
And they got dikes in them.

662
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:30,032

("Road to Marscota" by

666
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,300
NARRATOR: On August 29, the day after
police and demonstrators clashed

667
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,166
in Chicago, 20-year-old
private Michael Holmes

668
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:49,599
arrived in Vietnam.

669
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:53,632
He was born and brought up in
the tiny town of Williamsville,

670
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:56,333
in the heart of the Missouri Ozarks.

671
00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:58,833
His father and mother ran the general store

672
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:01,565
where Michael worked
every day after school.

673
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:05,599
He floated the rivers,
hunted deer and squirrels,

674
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:08,699
and was going steady with
a girl named Darlene.

675
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,699
He had trouble keeping up in high school,

676
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,333
did not complete community
college and, as a result,

677
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:20,365
was immediately drafted into the Army.

678
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:25,500
In Vietnam, he was assigned to
F Troop, 17th Armored Cavalry,

679
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,965
196th Light Infantry Brigade,

680
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:31,632
stationed at an isolated firebase

681
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:36,865
22 miles south of Danang called Baldy.

682
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:39,400
HOLMES (on tape): So you ask
what the size of Baldy was.

683
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,300
Well, it's just about
as big as Williamsville

684
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,565
and maybe a little bit bigger.

685
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:49,865
I sent you a picture of me and
a bunch of the other guys.

686
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,465
It's not really that bad.

687
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:57,199
It's... in a way I like it.

688
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,333
It's just being away from home

689
00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:01,166
and everything that I don't like.

690
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,266
NARRATOR: In Williamsville, family
and friends gathered to listen

691
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,733
to Michael's reports from Vietnam

692
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:15,099
and to fill him in on what
was happening back home.

00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:21,465
and we thought we'd all
say something for you.

695
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:26,465
And you could hear our voice
and feel like you's back home.

696
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:27,465
And we're looking forward...

697
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:28,900
HAROLD (on tape): Hello, Mike.

698
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,809
I've been doing a lot of
squirrel hunting lately,

699
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,965
and killing quite a few.

700
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:36,333
Well, the Ozarks really look
beautiful this time of year.

701
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:37,733
Looking forward to seeing you.

702
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,473
JERRY (on tape): Uh, this is Jerry, Mike.

703
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:42,733
I think Ricky and Carol broke up, Mike.

704
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,632
Ricky, he's really prowling now.

705
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:47,532
GLENDA (on tape): Mike, this is Glenda.

706
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:50,833
Um, I got a boyfriend,
and his name's Danny.

707
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:52,132
And...

708
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:53,865
GLEN (on tape): Mike, this is Glen.

709
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:56,300
All these other boys been
talking about hunting,

710
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,132
I'm gonna talk about girls.

711
00:41:58,233 --> 00:42:01,065
(chuckling): Girls and fast cars.

712
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:04,132
Gene Bilbury got him a new Bonneville.

713
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:07,632
MICHAEL'S MOTHER (on tape):
Michael, this is Mother.

714
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:11,099
The picture you sent us was real
good, it looked just like you.

715
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,065
I even liked that moustache,
and I didn't think I would.

716
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,666
And we miss you a lot.

717
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:18,709
MICHAEL'S FATHER (on tape):
This is your dad talking.

718
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:23,532
We think that you'll be okay,
just don't be nosing around

719
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:26,166
where you don't have any business

720
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:29,666
and get hold of a booby trap or something.

721
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:33,833
This is about the end of this
tape, so goodbye for now.

722
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:46,733
HOLMES (on tape): We burned down
a whole lot of hooches today

723
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:50,000
of these people who don't
cooperate with us, you know.

724
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,779
Yeah, I don't I don't really understand it

725
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:57,099
because if, if they are, you know, not VC,

726
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,233
and we do that to them,
you know, treat them bad,

727
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,300
then they're gonna turn VC.

728
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,932
The Army does everything backward.

729
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,632
NARRATOR: One morning that fall,
several APCs from F Troop

730
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:17,699
moved cautiously up Highway
One toward Danang.

731
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,199
Michael Holmes rode in the second vehicle.

732
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,000
(explosion)

733
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:35,699
His APC hit a 300-pound bomb
buried beneath the road.

734
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,099
Three of his friends died instantly.

735
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,532
Holmes was thrown clear

736
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:45,932
and woke up five hours
later in the hospital.

737
00:43:49,065 --> 00:43:51,132
HOLMES (on tape): Hello, Mom, Pop.

738
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,500
This is me.

739
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,465
Up to this point I didn't know

740
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,833
if there was really a
war going on over here.

741
00:43:57,932 --> 00:44:01,733
I just thought maybe they was
playing a game or something.

742
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:05,365
But I could've reached out and
touched two of those people.

743
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:07,500
I knew them real good.

744
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,175
And please don't worry
about me getting hurt

745
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:12,266
because I'm not hurt all that bad.

746
00:44:12,365 --> 00:44:15,666
Two more Purple Hearts and
I'm out of the field,

747
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:19,532
and I think maybe I get to get
out of the country altogether.

748
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:30,333
NARRATOR: Six months later, Michael
Holmes was on patrol, walking point,

749
00:44:30,432 --> 00:44:34,599
when he was killed by a
North Vietnamese soldier.

750
00:44:43,032 --> 00:44:45,099
LIZ TROTTA: This is Long An province.

751
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:48,532
Since 1962, it has been an
important testing ground

752
00:44:48,632 --> 00:44:50,733
for the pacification program.

753
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:55,632
Amidst the flat rice fields and
coconut trees lies Loc Tien Mot.

754
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:59,300
The hamlet chief says only more
troops will make his people safe

755
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,099
from the Viet Cong.

756
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,465
During the night, he adds,

757
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:05,699
the guerrillas go from house
to house collecting taxes.

758
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,632
The government may have left
its traces of pacification.

759
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:11,632
The Viet Cong have not left.

760
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:14,865
Liz Trotta, NBC News, South Vietnam.

761
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,166
NARRATOR: Since the Viet Cong
had been so badly weakened

762
00:45:19,266 --> 00:45:22,800
in the Tet Offensive and the two
offensives that followed it,

763
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,666
General Abrams believed

764
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:27,365
that hundreds of thousands of ARVN troops

765
00:45:27,465 --> 00:45:30,166
could now be freed to
secure the countryside

766
00:45:30,266 --> 00:45:33,132
and win support for the
government in Saigon.

767
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,965
But permanent security was not possible

768
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:41,300
unless the Viet Cong
political infrastructure...

769
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,199
the tax collectors and village chiefs,

770
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,132
runners and spies and sympathizers...

771
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:52,065
were killed, captured,
or persuaded to defect.

772
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:58,333
To do that, the CIA had
created the Phoenix Program.

773
00:45:58,432 --> 00:46:01,400
RICHARD THRELKELD: The villagers
of Thuy Xuan have been assembled

774
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,199
in the village schoolyard,

775
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,699
where teams of government
interrogators are trying

776
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,333
to pick out from among them
the members of the Viet Cong

777
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:11,233
who live here.

778
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:14,599
This sort of Phoenix
exercise is a weekly event

779
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:17,565
in districts throughout South Vietnam.

780
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,932
NARRATOR: After recovering from his wounds,

781
00:46:22,032 --> 00:46:25,965
Lieutenant Vincent Okamoto
became an intelligence officer

782
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:29,266
attached to the program.

783
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:30,742
The Phoenix Program was
premised on the fact

784
00:46:30,766 --> 00:46:32,976
that the North Vietnamese coming
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail,

785
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,532
when they went into South Vietnam,

786
00:46:34,632 --> 00:46:36,175
they were strangers,
just like the Americans.

787
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:39,733
They didn't know the terrain,
they didn't know the people.

788
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:43,166
So in order for them to
function operationally,

789
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:45,500
they needed the Viet Cong infrastructure.

790
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,932
And so the project was
to eliminate those guys.

791
00:46:50,032 --> 00:46:52,666
And I think it made a great deal of sense.

792
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:57,865
STUART HERRINGTON: The communists
thought Phoenix was very effective.

793
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:00,465
They saw it as a significant threat

794
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:02,865
to the viability of the revolution

795
00:47:02,965 --> 00:47:07,432
because to the extent that you
could take a sharp pointed knife

796
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,233
and carve out the Viet Cong,

797
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:11,532
the shadow Viet Cong,
the shadow government,

798
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:14,800
then their means of control
over the civilian population

799
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,965
in the South was dealt a death blow.

800
00:47:19,266 --> 00:47:22,233
NARRATOR: The pressure the Phoenix
Program put on the Viet Cong

801
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:26,532
caused dangerous signs of what
one communist official described

802
00:47:26,632 --> 00:47:30,766
as "wavering" among his
followers in the Mekong Delta...

803
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:34,565
depression, discouragement,
and widespread drunkenness

804
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:38,733
even among men going into battle.

805
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:44,132
But Phoenix's targeting was only
as good as the intelligence

806
00:47:44,233 --> 00:47:49,599
upon which it was based,
and that varied widely.

807
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:53,099
DAVID CULHANE: This film, made
by a CBS stringer cameraman

808
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,300
some weeks ago shows
South Vietnamese forces

809
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,699
interrogating an old man

810
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,032
identified as a minor VC official.

811
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,575
NARRATOR: In the Phoenix Program,

812
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,666
Americans served in an advisory capacity;

813
00:48:07,766 --> 00:48:11,000
most of the day-to-day
enforcement was left to

814
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:14,500
the South Vietnamese Provincial
Reconnaissance Units...

815
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:16,532
the PRUs...

816
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:18,965
who sometimes were more interested

817
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:23,599
in settling old scores than
in rooting out communists.

818
00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:28,532
OKAMOTO: It was scary because
it was subject to abuse,

819
00:48:28,632 --> 00:48:31,900
and was abused.

820
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,666
Again, the geniuses in Saigon
would use their computers

821
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:40,300
to come up with the blacklists.

822
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,900
You get the list, and you check
with other intelligence officers

823
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,932
in the district.

824
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:49,800
And you try to pool that information.

825
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,932
Next night, or a couple nights later,

826
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:54,565
a bunch of cowboys from the
PRUs would go out there.

827
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:58,266
And, you know, knock on the door,

828
00:48:58,365 --> 00:48:59,666
"April Fool, motherfucker!"

829
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:00,766
And boom.

830
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,000
There wasn't any real accountability.

831
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:09,932
NARRATOR: Later, the director
of the Phoenix Program

832
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:13,500
admitted to Congress that
no one knew how many

833
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,199
of the more than 20,000 who had
been killed were innocent.

834
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,565
And although the program did succeed

835
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:25,500
in degrading the Viet Cong infrastructure,

836
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,266
the government of Nguyen Van Thieu remained

837
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,365
as unpopular as ever.

838
00:49:33,266 --> 00:49:36,632
A poll taken in the Delta
province of Long An

839
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:41,065
would show 35% of the people
ready to vote for Thieu,

840
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:45,166
20% favoring the National Liberation Front,

841
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:50,099
and 45% backing someone, anyone,

842
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:52,599
opposed to both the Viet Cong

843
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:56,565
and the American-backed regime in Saigon.

844
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:02,733
MAN: In Vietnam there's a wound

845
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,932
that does not cease its bleeding.

846
00:50:05,032 --> 00:50:10,565
I'm talking about the scream
of death and the wound of war.

847
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:12,632
We did not come to talk with you, Mr.
Humphrey.

848
00:50:12,733 --> 00:50:14,565
We have come to arrest you.

849
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:16,233
Now you've had equal time.

850
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,166
Shut up!

851
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:19,166
(mixture of boos and cheers)

852
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,900
NARRATOR: Hubert Humphrey's
presidential campaign was in trouble.

853
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,400
Richard Nixon was comfortably
ahead in the polls

854
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,365
and refused to debate.

855
00:50:28,465 --> 00:50:31,032
"I've come to the conclusion

856
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:33,099
that there's no way to win the war,"

857
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,699
he told three of his
speechwriters in private.

858
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,632
"But we have to say the opposite,

859
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:41,833
just to keep some bargaining leverage."

860
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:46,233
Compounding Humphrey's problem
was a third-party candidate,

861
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,733
George Wallace,

862
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:50,900
the segregationist former
governor of Alabama.

863
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,400
He was sure to peel away some white voters

864
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,833
who normally voted Democratic.

865
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:02,000
Humphrey had confided his
doubts about the war to Johnson

866
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:06,300
early on, but had always
remained stubbornly loyal to him

867
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,666
in public.

868
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:11,565
Now his advisors told him
that if he wanted to win

869
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:13,865
he had to break with the president

870
00:51:13,965 --> 00:51:17,632
and make a bold gesture
toward ending the war.

871
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:22,565
On September 30, he called for a total halt

872
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:25,400
to the bombing of North Vietnam.

873
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,932
HUMPHREY: I would stop
the bombing of the North

874
00:51:28,032 --> 00:51:31,333
as an acceptable risk for peace

875
00:51:31,432 --> 00:51:36,032
because I believe it could lead
to success in the negotiations

876
00:51:36,132 --> 00:51:37,965
and thereby shorten the war.

877
00:51:38,065 --> 00:51:42,000
This would be the best
protection for our troops.

878
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,432
NARRATOR: Johnson felt
betrayed and refused to speak

879
00:51:45,532 --> 00:51:47,733
to his own vice president for a time.

880
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:52,833
But on October 31, just five
days before the election,

881
00:51:52,932 --> 00:51:56,500
the president himself made
a surprise announcement.

882
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:02,766
He was stopping all
bombing of North Vietnam.

883
00:52:02,865 --> 00:52:06,465
There had been real
progress in Paris, he said.

884
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:10,766
Hanoi had agreed for the first
time to talk with Saigon,

885
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:15,500
and the United States had agreed
to include the Viet Cong.

886
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,166
It suddenly looked as
if peace were possible.

887
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,032
Humphrey was jubilant.

888
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:25,865
His poll numbers rose overnight.

889
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:30,333
He was confident he would now
be able to overtake Nixon.

890
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:33,800
But then, on November 2,

891
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,666
with just three days to go until
Americans went to the polls,

892
00:52:37,766 --> 00:52:40,599
President Thieu suddenly announced

893
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,865
that the South Vietnamese
government would not attend

894
00:52:43,965 --> 00:52:46,233
the proposed talks after all.

895
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:50,632
A representative of the Nixon campaign

896
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:54,733
at the candidate's personal
direction had secretly contacted

897
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,300
the Saigon government

898
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,233
urging Thieu to stay away from the talks,

899
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:02,032
promising that once Nixon was elected,

900
00:53:02,132 --> 00:53:06,333
he would drive a harder bargain
with Hanoi than Humphrey would.

901
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:11,800
Thanks to a CIA bug planted
in Thieu's Saigon office

902
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,465
and an FBI wiretap on the
South Vietnamese embassy

903
00:53:15,565 --> 00:53:19,432
in Washington, Johnson got
wind of what had happened

904
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:21,833
and called his friend Everett Dirksen,

905
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,333
the Republican Senate minority leader,

906
00:53:24,432 --> 00:53:29,132
to warn him that the Nixon
people were committing treason.

907
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:31,108
LYNDON JOHNSON: I'm reading
their hand, Everett.

908
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:33,000
I don't want to get this in the campaign.

909
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,400
DIRKSEN: That's right.

910
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,742
And they oughtn't to be doing this.

911
00:53:35,766 --> 00:53:36,833
This is treason. I know.

912
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:39,032
And I think it would shock America

913
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:43,065
if a principal candidate was
playing with a source like this

914
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,565
on a matter this important.

915
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:45,800
Yeah.

916
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,132
I know this...

917
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:49,865
that they're contacting a foreign power

918
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:51,199
in the middle of a war.

919
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,333
That's a mistake.

920
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:53,733
And it's a damn bad mistake.

921
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,132
RICHARD NIXON: Mr. President?

922
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,132
JOHNSON: Yes.

923
00:53:58,233 --> 00:53:59,932
This is Dick Nixon. Yes, Dick.

924
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:01,365
I just went on Meet the Press

925
00:54:01,465 --> 00:54:06,800
and said that I had given
you my personal assurance

926
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,965
that I would do everything
possible to cooperate

927
00:54:10,065 --> 00:54:13,000
both before the election and if
elected, after the election.

928
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,500
I just wanted you to know

929
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:17,800
that I feel very, very strongly about this

930
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,400
and any rumblings around

931
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,199
about somebody trying to sabotage

932
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,800
the Saigon government's attitude

933
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,199
certainly has no...

934
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,599
absolutely no credibility
as far as I am concerned.

935
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:33,965
That's, that's...

936
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:35,532
I'm very happy to hear that, Dick,

937
00:54:35,632 --> 00:54:38,500
because that is taking place.

938
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:42,333
My God, I would never do
anything to encourage Saigon

939
00:54:42,432 --> 00:54:44,008
not to come to the table because basically,

940
00:54:44,032 --> 00:54:46,300
that was what you got.

941
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,532
Well, that's good, Dick.

942
00:54:47,632 --> 00:54:49,632
We've got to get this
goddamned war off the plate,

943
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:52,075
the quicker the better, and the
hell with the political credit.

944
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:53,099
Believe me.

945
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:54,199
Thank you, Dick.

946
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,900
NARRATOR: Nixon was lying
and Johnson knew it.

947
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,900
But to go public with the information,

948
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,666
the president would have
to reveal the methods

949
00:55:06,766 --> 00:55:07,900
by which he had learned

950
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,199
of the Republican candidate's duplicity.

951
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,766
He was unwilling to do so.

952
00:55:13,865 --> 00:55:17,400
Nixon's secret was safe.

953
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,632
The American public was never told

954
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:24,000
that the regime for which
35,000 Americans had died

955
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:26,365
had been willing to boycott peace talks

956
00:55:26,465 --> 00:55:30,032
to help elect Richard Nixon
or that he had been willing

957
00:55:30,132 --> 00:55:35,733
to delay an end to the bloodshed
in order to get elected.

958
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:40,266
REPORTER: At 10:45 this morning,
Eastern Standard Time...

959
00:55:40,365 --> 00:55:45,565
NARRATOR: On Election Day, Richard
Milhous Nixon won the presidency

960
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:49,099
with 43.4 percent of the vote.

961
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,300
Hubert Humphrey received 42.7 percent.

962
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,733
The Nixon campaign's secret
maneuvering may have helped him

963
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:04,266
win the election, but the
president-elect's fear

964
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:07,532
that that maneuvering
might someday be exposed

965
00:56:07,632 --> 00:56:10,000
would be part of his undoing.

966
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:16,266
Thieu waited several
weeks after the election

967
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:21,532
before agreeing to send
a delegation to Paris.

968
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:26,465
There, everything stalled over
the seating arrangements.

969
00:56:26,565 --> 00:56:31,400
The North Vietnamese had
insisted on a square table,

970
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,932
with separate sides for all
four parties to the talks...

971
00:56:35,032 --> 00:56:39,632
Hanoi, the Viet Cong, Saigon,
and the United States.

972
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:44,965
Saigon refused to take part
unless Hanoi and the Viet Cong

973
00:56:45,065 --> 00:56:47,432
sat on the same side of the table.

974
00:56:47,532 --> 00:56:51,465
The standoff went on for ten weeks.

975
00:56:54,432 --> 00:56:58,400
It was the Soviets who finally
came up with a solution:

976
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,699
a round table.

977
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,932
(gunfire)

978
00:57:06,032 --> 00:57:08,532
RADIO OPERATOR: Type of injury
is urgent, shrapnel wounds.

979
00:57:08,632 --> 00:57:09,965
(gunfire)

980
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:11,932
The area is insecure.

981
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:16,833
MEDIC: Keep your head down.

982
00:57:19,032 --> 00:57:20,900
RADIO OPERATOR: Got some fire.

983
00:57:23,865 --> 00:57:27,266
KARL MARLANTES: You have these
19-year-old kids with these huge hearts.

984
00:57:27,365 --> 00:57:30,432
They will do what you ask them.

985
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:34,833
The issue is are you asking them
to do something worthwhile?

986
00:57:34,932 --> 00:57:36,065
That's up to the adults.

987
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,500
And that's where the failure comes.

988
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:41,166
The failure isn't the kids
saying, "I'm not gonna do this."

989
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:43,699
Because that's not the way they are built.

990
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,032
19-year-olds don't know
to take a raincoat on

991
00:57:46,132 --> 00:57:47,699
when it's raining, all right?

992
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,099
That's-that's why they're
so good at being warriors.

993
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:51,699
They'll do it.

994
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,200
They won't even ask you a question.

995
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:57,065
"All right, we'll do it."

996
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:59,900
The responsibility is on
the grownups to make sure

997
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,532
they're not being wasted

998
00:58:01,632 --> 00:58:05,632
because they'll do what they're
told, and they'll do it well.

999
00:58:08,532 --> 00:58:12,333
NARRATOR: Karl Marlantes was
born in Astoria, Oregon,

1000
00:58:12,432 --> 00:58:15,666
the son of a veteran of
the Battle of the Bulge.

1001
00:58:15,766 --> 00:58:18,699
He had joined the Marine
Reserves the summer before

1002
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,733
his freshman year at Yale,

1003
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:25,032
eager to prove himself
and defend his country.

1004
00:58:25,132 --> 00:58:27,000
When he became a Rhodes scholar,

1005
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:30,632
the Marines allowed him to
defer going on active duty,

1006
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:34,432
and instead of serving in
Vietnam, he went to Oxford

1007
00:58:34,532 --> 00:58:38,833
in the fall of 1967.

1008
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,000
A few months after he got there,

1009
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:44,733
he wrote to his parents back home.

1010
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:46,541
MARLANTES: "It is with
a little apprehension

1011
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:49,865
"that I write this letter.

1012
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:52,000
"I have given up my scholarship,

1013
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:56,465
"and I will be on active duty as of May 3.

1014
00:58:56,565 --> 00:59:00,000
"As you know, I feel the U.S.
is absolutely wrong

1015
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:01,965
"to be in the war.

1016
00:59:02,065 --> 00:59:04,632
"A lot of people are dying
for no good reason.

1017
00:59:04,733 --> 00:59:09,266
"I can only feel an increasing
rage and frustration.

1018
00:59:09,365 --> 00:59:11,766
And a complete feeling of helplessness."

1019
00:59:13,432 --> 00:59:19,000
"I have, in effect, been hiding,
and I'll not do it anymore.

1020
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:24,032
"I guess I'm about to do
a highly immoral thing.

1021
00:59:24,132 --> 00:59:25,199
"I will be taking part

1022
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,599
"in one of the greatest
crimes of our century,

1023
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:32,532
"and I will be doing so out
of frustration, bitterness,

1024
00:59:32,632 --> 00:59:36,199
"and a sense of the absurd that
I have only come to appreciate

1025
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,000
"in its entirety in the past year.

1026
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:41,900
From now on my logic will be changed."

1027
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,733
"I can do something.

1028
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:48,500
"That is, I can do my
very best to get 40 kids

1029
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:50,932
"out of Vietnam alive,

1030
00:59:51,032 --> 00:59:54,432
"and if I have to turn into
an evil machine to do it,

1031
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:56,400
then by God I will."

1032
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:03,432
It was my friends, guys
that I trained with.

1033
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:08,300
I felt like I was going
to let the side down.

1034
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,365
That by not joining in with
them and sharing the burden

1035
01:00:11,465 --> 01:00:14,532
that I wouldn't be a decent person.

1036
01:00:14,632 --> 01:00:17,532
It's a mixed bag because I went
over there and killed people

1037
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:19,432
for, you know... is that why I did that?

1038
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:23,099
O'BRIEN: Do you go off and kill people

1039
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:25,166
if you're not pretty sure it's right?

1040
01:00:25,266 --> 01:00:28,766
And if your nation isn't
pretty sure it's right?

1041
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:33,000
If there isn't some
consensus, do you do that?

1042
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,333
I was at Fort Lewis, Washington,

1043
01:00:37,432 --> 01:00:41,365
and Canada was, what, a
90-minute bus ride away.

1044
01:00:41,465 --> 01:00:43,733
I wrote my mom and dad and asked for money.

1045
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:46,900
I asked for my passport.

1046
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,432
And they sent them to me
with, again, no questions.

1047
01:00:49,532 --> 01:00:51,209
Like, "What do you want the passport for?"

1048
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:52,833
They just sent it.

1049
01:00:52,932 --> 01:00:54,432
And I kept all this stuff stashed,

1050
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:57,300
including civilian clothes
stashed in my footlocker,

1051
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,099
thinking maybe I'll... maybe I'll do it.

1052
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:01,075
("Bookends Theme" by Simon

1053
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:03,733
It was this kind of "maybe" thing going on

1054
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:07,365
all throughout this training
as Vietnam got closer

1055
01:01:07,465 --> 01:01:09,932
and closer and closer.

1056
01:01:10,032 --> 01:01:13,266
What prevented me from doing it?

1057
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:16,699
I think it was pretty simple and stupid.

1058
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,333
It was a fear of embarrassment,

1059
01:01:20,432 --> 01:01:24,865
a fear of ridicule and humiliation.

1060
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:28,900
What my girlfriend would have thought of me

1061
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,500
and the people in the Gobbler
Cafe in downtown Worthington.

1062
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:36,199
The Kiwanis boys and the country club boys

1063
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,632
and that small town I grew up in,

1064
01:01:38,733 --> 01:01:41,099
the things they'd say about me.

1065
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:47,166

sissy for going to Canada."

Long ago it must be

1070
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,400
O'BRIEN: I couldn't summon
the courage to say no

to those nameless, faceless
people who really, in essence,

1072

this was the United States of America.

1073

And I couldn't say no to them.

1074
01:02:19,932 --> 01:02:25,733
And I had to live with it now
for, you know, 40 years.

1075
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:31,532
That's a long time to live
with a failure of conscience

1076
01:02:31,632 --> 01:02:36,632
and a failure of nerve.

1077
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:40,465
And the nightmare of Vietnam
for me is not the bombs

1078
01:02:40,565 --> 01:02:41,900
and the bullets.

01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,500
(voice breaking): It's
that failure of nerve

1080
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,199
that I so regret.

1081
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:12,233
HAL KUSHNER: In the fall of 1968 was
probably the toughest time we had.

1082
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:22,333
Our daily life was a continuing
struggle for survival.

1083
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:29,800
Our food ration was three
cups of rice per day.

1084
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:35,300
We slept on a large bamboo pallet.

1085
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,365
Sometimes there were ten or
12 people on one pallet.

1086
01:03:39,465 --> 01:03:41,766
And we were sick.

1087
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:43,932
We were very sick.

1088
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:48,465
Four people died within...

1089
01:03:48,565 --> 01:03:50,099
a month.

1090
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:52,965
And then two more died
very shortly after that.

1091
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:58,065
NARRATOR: Thirteen Americans would die

1092
01:03:58,166 --> 01:04:01,965
during Captain Hal Kushner's
time in jungle prison camps

1093
01:04:02,065 --> 01:04:03,632
in South Vietnam.

1094
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,932
He was a doctor but had no medications,

1095
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:10,632
no antibiotics or saline solution

1096
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:13,032
with which to treat his comrades.

1097
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:17,565
All he could do was bury
each in a bamboo coffin

1098
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:21,266
and make sure the spot was
marked with a heap of stones

1099
01:04:21,365 --> 01:04:24,032
daubed with Mercurochrome.

1100
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:28,965
KUSHNER: We had nothing to eat.

1101
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:32,833
And I thought that I was just going insane.

1102
01:04:32,932 --> 01:04:36,199
So we were sitting around
and with this little fire.

1103
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,300
And we saw the camp commander's cat,

1104
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,965
who had free rein of the camp.

1105
01:04:40,065 --> 01:04:41,400
And he came down to our area.

1106
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,532
And we were starving to death.

1107
01:04:43,632 --> 01:04:47,000
So someone suggested, "Let's eat the cat."

1108
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,400
So we killed the cat.

1109
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,432
And we cut the head off
and we cut the paws off.

1110
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:58,833
And we had this little
carcass of about two pounds.

1111
01:04:58,932 --> 01:05:03,000
And one of the guards came down,
and we told him it was a weasel,

1112
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,599
and we threw a rock at it and killed it.

1113
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:07,333
And then he looked around

1114
01:05:07,432 --> 01:05:10,766
and someone had neglected
to bury one of the paws.

1115
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,365
And he saw the paw.

1116
01:05:12,465 --> 01:05:16,065
And he knew instantly that it
was the camp commander's cat.

1117
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,632
And things got very serious.

1118
01:05:20,733 --> 01:05:23,833
And they lined us up and
they said, "Who did this?"

1119
01:05:23,932 --> 01:05:25,199
Nobody said anything.

1120
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,132
I thought they were going to kill us all.

1121
01:05:27,233 --> 01:05:29,032
Just execute us.

1122
01:05:29,132 --> 01:05:34,266
And one of the people who
was a ringleader in this

1123
01:05:34,365 --> 01:05:36,565
said he did it.

1124
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:40,233
And I said that I did it also.

1125
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:42,465
And we all said we did it.

1126
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,432
"I am Spartacus," you know?

1127
01:05:44,532 --> 01:05:46,199
It was that.

1128
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:50,432
So they called that person and me out.

1129
01:05:50,532 --> 01:05:54,099
And the guard kicked him and
beat him to the ground,

1130
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:56,266
and just beat him unmercifully.

1131
01:05:57,733 --> 01:06:01,099
And they hit me in the face
with fists and didn't beat me

1132
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:03,065
as badly as they beat him.

1133
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:07,099
And then tied me with commo
wire very tightly to a hooch

1134
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:10,733
and left me for a day.

1135
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,632
And with the carcass of the
cat draped around my neck.

1136
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:16,266
And I was so crazy I thought,

1137
01:06:16,365 --> 01:06:18,365
"Maybe they're going to
let me eat this cat."

1138
01:06:18,465 --> 01:06:21,000
But I had to bury it.

1139
01:06:21,099 --> 01:06:26,166
So, the fellow that they beat
very badly died two weeks later.

1140
01:06:27,632 --> 01:06:31,500
But to me the tragedy of it
was we didn't get the cat.

1141
01:06:37,365 --> 01:06:39,666
CHARLES COLLINGWOOD: For the
capital of a nation at war,

1142
01:06:39,766 --> 01:06:43,365
Saigon abounds with a
phenomenal number of young men

1143
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:46,465
of draft age in sharp, civilian clothes.

1144
01:06:46,565 --> 01:06:49,900
Saigon cowboys they're called.

1145
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,532
It's a war profiteer's economy,
fanned by the forced draft

1146
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:55,000
of American money.

1147
01:06:55,099 --> 01:06:56,666
They count it a good year in Saigon

1148
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:59,099
when the prices only go up by 25%.

1149
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:04,865
NARRATOR: Years of American presence,

1150
01:07:04,965 --> 01:07:09,233
and the tens of billions of U.S.
dollars that came with it,

1151
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,865
had transformed much of South Vietnam,

1152
01:07:11,965 --> 01:07:15,632
creating a false economy
that was utterly dependent

1153
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:19,300
on that presence becoming perpetual.

1154
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,632
GEORGE LEWIS: Since the U.S. began
its big buildup in the mid-'60s,

1155
01:07:22,733 --> 01:07:25,199
millions of dollars worth of
goods have entered the country

1156
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,865
each month.

1157
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:29,900
Some economists say ten
percent or more of the cargo

1158
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,599
is diverted into black market channels.

1159
01:07:36,365 --> 01:07:38,900
NARRATOR: With so much money
flowing into the country,

1160
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,266
corruption and crime inevitably grew.

1161
01:07:44,865 --> 01:07:47,199
Government officials were on the take.

1162
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,166
So were many ARVN officers.

1163
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:53,733
Policemen could not be trusted.

1164
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:00,932
PHAN QUANG TUE: Who benefit from
the financial aspect of the war?

1165
01:08:02,065 --> 01:08:03,599
Generals.

1166
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:05,900
Don't deny that.

1167
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,399
Then they get the money,
then they become richer.

1168
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:14,765
We have a term, and I call it,
they were war profiteers,

1169
01:08:14,865 --> 01:08:19,065
from Thieu and Ky down to every echelon.

1170
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:21,632
HERRINGTON: The Vietnamese had a saying:

1171
01:08:21,733 --> 01:08:24,832
a house leaks from the roof on down.

1172
01:08:24,932 --> 01:08:27,865
(saying phrase in Vietnamese)

1173
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:34,600
And that was, of course, their
way to elliptically refer

1174
01:08:34,699 --> 01:08:38,300
to the ever-present, nagging
problem of corruption.

1175
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:43,800
JOE GALLOWAY: They were stealing
from us and selling to anybody.

1176
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:45,579
Two-man helicopter, you want one of those?

1177
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:48,600
They got it in a box in the back.

1178
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:52,966
Probably get it for 12,000 bucks
if you negotiated strongly.

1179
01:08:54,432 --> 01:08:58,132
The corruption was endemic.

1180
01:08:58,233 --> 01:09:01,365
And we tolerated it.

1181
01:09:01,466 --> 01:09:05,899
NARRATOR: Tons of American goods
piled up on Saigon's docks.

1182
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,565
Some Gis took advantage, too.

1183
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:13,533
U.S. products flowed out
the back doors of PXs.

1184
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:16,666
In just one year,

1185
01:09:16,765 --> 01:09:23,065
the black market cost the U.S.
military $2 billion.

1186
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:25,966
COLLINGWOOD: The impact of the war
has disrupted the ancient patterns

1187
01:09:26,065 --> 01:09:28,065
of Vietnamese life.

1188
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:31,166
The cities are crowded to the
bursting point with people

1189
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:34,100
uprooted from the land
and the ancestral values

1190
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:36,533
of a rural-oriented society

1191
01:09:36,632 --> 01:09:39,265
but who have found nothing to replace them.

1192
01:09:39,365 --> 01:09:42,632
NARRATOR: Before U.S. troops arrived,

1193
01:09:42,733 --> 01:09:46,765
eight out of ten South
Vietnamese lived in villages.

1194
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:50,199
By the end of the 1960s,

1195
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,699
almost half would be
crowded into urban areas.

1196
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,832
Saigon's population
tripled to three million.

1197
01:09:58,932 --> 01:10:03,233
Half the refugees had no permanent shelter.

1198
01:10:05,632 --> 01:10:08,332
Cholera and typhoid killed thousands.

1199
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:14,600
Hungry children roamed the
streets, scavenging, begging,

1200
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:19,000
searching for jobs to
do or pockets to pick.

1201
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:23,666
Tens of thousands of young
women left their village homes

1202
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:28,865
and came to Saigon to become
bar girls and prostitutes.

1203
01:10:34,632 --> 01:10:36,033
The communist government in Hanoi

1204
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:38,233
tried to make the most of it,

1205
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:42,899
accusing the United States and
its puppet government in Saigon

1206
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,132
of destroying Vietnamese
culture in the South.

1207
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,399
But the citizens of Saigon were far freer

1208
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,065
than the North Vietnamese.

1209
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:59,500
The South Vietnamese people
could express their views,

1210
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,065
for and against their government,

1211
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:06,199
in the pages of hundreds of
newspapers and magazines.

1212
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,666
And they held demonstrations denouncing

1213
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:13,765
the rampant corruption and
demanding religious freedom

1214
01:11:13,865 --> 01:11:16,300
and better treatment for veterans.

1215
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,699
For all of its problems,
one man remembered,

1216
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,265
Saigon was "filthy and free."

1217
01:11:28,365 --> 01:11:29,899
(car horn honking)

1218
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,199
NGUYEN NGOC:

1219

(gunfire)

1220
01:13:00,565 --> 01:13:03,533
NARRATOR: In the densely
populated Mekong Delta,

1221
01:13:03,632 --> 01:13:08,365
the war in the countryside
suddenly intensified.

1222
01:13:08,466 --> 01:13:10,733
General Abrams assigned the commander

1223
01:13:10,832 --> 01:13:15,132
of the 9th Infantry Division,
General Julian J. Ewell,

1224
01:13:15,233 --> 01:13:18,033
the job of destroying
the remaining Viet Cong

1225
01:13:18,132 --> 01:13:20,432
south of Saigon.

1226
01:13:20,533 --> 01:13:25,000
His operation was called Speedy Express.

1227
01:13:26,733 --> 01:13:31,365
"The hearts and minds approach
can be overdone," Ewell said.

1228
01:13:31,466 --> 01:13:35,865
"In the Delta the only way to
overcome VC control and terror

1229
01:13:35,966 --> 01:13:39,033
is by brute force."

1230
01:13:40,533 --> 01:13:43,666
Patrols would pursue the
enemy around the clock.

1231
01:13:43,765 --> 01:13:47,166
The night sky was filled with helicopters,

1232
01:13:47,265 --> 01:13:49,832
some armed with instruments
that could detect

1233
01:13:49,932 --> 01:13:51,932
traces of carbon and ammonia

1234
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:54,899
that meant human beings were below,

1235
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,199
though not which side they were on.

1236
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,533
In areas designated "free-fire zones,"

1237
01:14:02,632 --> 01:14:05,332
anyone out after curfew could be shot.

1238
01:14:07,332 --> 01:14:11,199
During the day, anyone
seen running was targeted.

1239
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,699
Colonel Robert Gard was one of
Ewell's artillery commanders.

1240
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,865
ROBERT GARD: If someone was told that
anyone who runs away should be assumed

1241
01:14:22,966 --> 01:14:26,699
to be an enemy, I certainly
would disagree with that.

1242
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,600
That's totally improper.

1243
01:14:28,699 --> 01:14:32,332
People run away because they're afraid.

1244
01:14:32,432 --> 01:14:36,500
I've seen instances of farmers,

1245
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,300
when you descend in a helicopter suddenly,

1246
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:42,399
and they freeze, and they're
frightened, and they run.

1247
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:47,166
You can't just make a blanket judgment.

1248
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:51,765
NARRATOR: General Ewell boasted of
his unit's statistical record...

1249
01:14:51,865 --> 01:14:57,466
10,899 Viet Cong killed in six months

1250
01:14:57,565 --> 01:15:00,765
with a loss of only 242 Americans,

1251
01:15:00,865 --> 01:15:06,466
an astonishing kill ratio of 45-to-1.

1252
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,666
GARD: To say that we killed
only enemy combatants,

1253
01:15:13,765 --> 01:15:17,365
and to talk about ratios of 40-to-1

1254
01:15:17,466 --> 01:15:20,565
simply defies my imagination.

1255
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,399
NARRATOR: At Abrams' recommendation,
Ewell was promoted,

1256
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:29,832
but the Army Inspector General
would eventually estimate

1257
01:15:29,932 --> 01:15:33,000
that more than half of
the roughly 11,000 kills

1258
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,432
claimed by the 9th Infantry

1259
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:38,533
had been unarmed, innocent civilians.

1260
01:15:42,265 --> 01:15:45,166
No one was ever held accountable.

CAROL CROCKER: I think moving away
from one's family's ideologies

1271
01:16:45,832 --> 01:16:52,600
is a scary balance on a
very tricky precipice

1272
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:56,466
because they have been the focal point

1273
01:16:56,565 --> 01:16:57,966
of how we judge how we're doing.

1274
01:16:58,065 --> 01:17:02,733
And I was now trying to judge
my decisions and my actions

1275
01:17:02,832 --> 01:17:06,932
on the basis of my own
ideas and own thoughts.

1276
01:17:07,033 --> 01:17:10,199
NARRATOR: The war was
already uncomfortably close

1277
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,666
to Carol Crocker.

1278
01:17:12,765 --> 01:17:15,533
Her brother Mogie had volunteered to fight

1279
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:20,500
and had been killed in Vietnam in 1966.

1280
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,265
She was still grieving.

1281
01:17:24,533 --> 01:17:28,399
That fall, Carol had entered
Goucher College in Baltimore,

1282
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:33,399
an all-women's school with a
long conservative tradition.

1283
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,432
CAROL CROCKER: We dressed for dinner.

1284
01:17:35,533 --> 01:17:38,600
We had an 11:00 curfew.

1285
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:44,033
Obviously no boys or men
were allowed in the dorms.

1286
01:17:44,132 --> 01:17:46,100
That was the rule.

1287
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:48,209
("Piece of My Heart" by Big
Brother and the Holding Company)

1288
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:51,966
It could not have even been
any later than the beginning

1289
01:17:52,065 --> 01:17:57,832
of the second semester that most
of the rules that were in place

1290
01:17:57,932 --> 01:18:02,800
and had been in place for many,
many years, no longer existed.

1294

CAROL CROCKER: The challenge

1295
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,600
to campuses countrywide was

1296
01:18:16,699 --> 01:18:18,332
how do we maintain our student body

1297
01:18:18,432 --> 01:18:24,065
to behave in a civil
manner, and teach them,

1298
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:27,033
and not have them try to burn us down?

1299
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:29,600

1302

CAROL CROCKER: Our guy friends,
we were spending time and talking

1303
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:38,233
and they were scared.

1304
01:18:38,332 --> 01:18:40,199
And they were worried.

1305
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,399
And they weren't sure what
they were going to do.

1306
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,199
And more discussion was happening about

1307
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:51,100
whether this was a valid war.

1308
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:55,800
And this was really, for me, the
first time I opened my ears

1309
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:58,300
to the war in a way other than

1310
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:01,865
that it was about my brother's death.

1311
01:19:01,966 --> 01:19:04,666
I honored him.

1312
01:19:04,765 --> 01:19:09,199
I respected him for doing
what he believed in.

1313
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,233
But I did not agree with him.

JOPLIN: ♪ Come on, come on,

1315
01:19:16,065 --> 01:19:19,565
NARRATOR: Eva Jefferson was a
sophomore at Northwestern.

1316
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:22,865
A serviceman's daughter, she
had entered college convinced

1317
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:26,666
the American government would
never mislead its citizens.

1318
01:19:26,765 --> 01:19:30,500
But for her, too, things
had begun to change.

1319
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,399
Earlier that year,

1320
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,765
when a handful of black
Northwestern students decided

1321
01:19:35,865 --> 01:19:38,033
to occupy the bursar's office

1322
01:19:38,132 --> 01:19:41,600
demanding African-American
studies, she joined them,

1323
01:19:41,699 --> 01:19:45,565
then called her parents to
tell them what she'd done.

1324
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:48,466
EVA JEFFERSON PATERSON: And I said,
"Mom and Dad, guess where I am?

1325
01:19:48,565 --> 01:19:50,233
We just took over the bursar's office."

1326
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:52,166
They were horrified.

1327
01:19:52,265 --> 01:19:55,332
And upon reflection, of
course they were horrified.

1328
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:56,875
And they said, "If you
don't get out of there

1329
01:19:56,899 --> 01:19:58,241
we're going to cut off your money."

1330
01:19:58,265 --> 01:20:00,666
So that was the moment
in my own consciousness

1331
01:20:00,765 --> 01:20:02,800
when I became independent.

1332
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:05,166
I thought, "Well, they're
going to cut off my money.

1333
01:20:05,265 --> 01:20:06,899
C'est la vie."

1334
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,100
NARRATOR: "The University met
all our demands in three days,"

1335
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,500
she remembered.

1336
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,300
"If you asked for black studies on Friday,

1337
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:17,466
you got it on Monday."

1338
01:20:17,565 --> 01:20:21,865
PATERSON: It felt like something
was happening that was profound,

1339
01:20:21,966 --> 01:20:23,733
that was irreversible.

1340
01:20:23,832 --> 01:20:25,733
But also you're 18, 19 years old.

1341
01:20:25,832 --> 01:20:26,832
It's exciting.

1342
01:20:28,765 --> 01:20:31,932
I felt as though a revolution was coming.

1343
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:35,832
And I thought the revolution
would be won by our side.

1344
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,800
NARRATOR: Relations between parents
and children, brothers and sisters,

1345
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:51,065
were changing everywhere.

1346
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:54,932
ANNE HARRISON BOWMAN: When I stood in the
living room and I was hugging two brothers,

1347
01:20:55,033 --> 01:20:57,365
it didn't matter to me about their choices

1348
01:20:57,466 --> 01:21:01,666
or that they were on two
different sides of the fence.

1349
01:21:01,765 --> 01:21:05,800
All I knew was that they
were both my brothers

1350
01:21:05,899 --> 01:21:08,565
and they were both back in the
same room and there we were.

1351
01:21:08,666 --> 01:21:12,765
NARRATOR: Captain Matt
Harrison, Jr.... Chips...

1352
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:18,832
had graduated West Point,
served a tour in Vietnam

1353
01:21:18,932 --> 01:21:23,033
and took part in two of the
war's bloodiest battles...

1354
01:21:23,132 --> 01:21:26,765
Hill 1338 and Hill 875.

1355
01:21:29,033 --> 01:21:32,699
He was back stateside
in the autumn of 1968,

1356
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,832
when the family began to worry
about his younger brother, Bob,

1357
01:21:36,932 --> 01:21:40,932
whom his siblings sometimes called Robin.

1358
01:21:41,033 --> 01:21:45,966
MATT HARRISON: He and I were just
great pals since we were growing up

1359
01:21:46,065 --> 01:21:50,065
because we moved every year or two years.

1360
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:52,265
And, you know, new set of friends

1361
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:53,666
but always had my brother.

1362
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,332
BOWMAN: Bob was in ROTC

1363
01:21:57,432 --> 01:22:01,533
and polished and buffed his
shoes and had short hair

1364
01:22:01,632 --> 01:22:05,500
and said "Yes, sir" and "Yes, ma'am."

1365
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,832
And then we moved to California
his senior year in high school.

1366
01:22:09,932 --> 01:22:16,365
And he was the consummate blond
surfer boy and cutting school.

1367
01:22:16,466 --> 01:22:18,632
And he was immediately very popular

1368
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,100
and having a great time.

1369
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:26,332
NARRATOR: Robin did not go to West Point,

1370
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:29,166
entered Marin Junior College instead,

1371
01:22:29,265 --> 01:22:32,199
and then shocked his family by signing on

1372
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:36,100
with the Marine... not the Army... Reserves.

1373
01:22:37,832 --> 01:22:42,000
HARRISON: At some point Robin
became convinced that...

1374
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:46,265
that the war was wrong, and not
only wrong, it was immoral.

1375
01:22:46,365 --> 01:22:51,533
So he quit going to the Reserve weekends,

1376
01:22:51,632 --> 01:22:54,666
and because of that he was activated...

1377
01:22:54,765 --> 01:22:59,832
and was very likely now he was
going to be going to Vietnam

1378
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:03,166
as a Marine Corps rifleman.

1379
01:23:03,265 --> 01:23:05,565
I didn't think being a
Marine Corps rifleman

1380
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:08,565
was a very safe occupation.

1381
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:11,666
And I didn't think Robin
would be a particularly good

1382
01:23:11,765 --> 01:23:13,565
Marine Corps rifleman.

1383
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:18,033
And so I just thought that this
was a very bad outcome for him

1384
01:23:18,132 --> 01:23:19,600
and for the family.

1385
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:27,365
NARRATOR: Matt Harrison knew
that under military regulations,

1386
01:23:27,466 --> 01:23:30,832
if one brother was already
in a combat zone,

1387
01:23:30,932 --> 01:23:34,199
a second brother need not
accept assignment there.

1388
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,832
So to keep Robin out of the war,

1389
01:23:37,932 --> 01:23:42,699
he volunteered for a
second tour in Vietnam.

1390
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,500
HARRISON: I was back in Vietnam
I think in less than 30 days.

1391
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,065
I was a seasoned veteran.

1392
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:51,399
I was going to go command a company.

1393
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,399
My chances of getting hurt were
a lot less than Robin's were.

1394
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,432
And if I did choose to make it a career,

1395
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:58,565
the fact that I had had a second tour

1396
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,776
as a rifle company commander
was going to be good for me.

1397
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,832
And so, you know, it
wasn't entirely selfless.

1398
01:24:03,932 --> 01:24:08,365
I honestly don't remember a
tremendous amount of dialogue

1399
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:10,399
between my mom and dad.

1400
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,600
I think they felt like if Bob had gone,

1401
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:15,533
he would have been killed.

1402
01:24:15,632 --> 01:24:21,100
Whereas I think they felt that
Chips was going to be okay.

1403
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:26,065
I can't imagine, having
had a son now go to Iraq,

1404
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:31,565
how my mother could have gotten
through every single day at all,

1405
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:37,065
without believing very firmly
that he was going to be fine.

1406
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:42,632
NARRATOR: Matt Harrison's
decision to serve a second tour

1407
01:24:42,733 --> 01:24:46,000
did not fully protect his brother Robin.

1408
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,632
He went AWOL, was court-martialed

1409
01:24:48,733 --> 01:24:51,533
and sentenced to three months hard labor.

1410
01:24:51,632 --> 01:24:53,966
The sentence was suspended.

1411
01:24:54,065 --> 01:24:55,733
He returned to the Marines,

1412
01:24:55,832 --> 01:24:58,000
served as a chaplain's assistant,

1413
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,399
applied for conscientious objector status,

1414
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:05,865
and then went AWOL again.

1415
01:25:05,966 --> 01:25:08,675
VICTORIA HARRISON: I remember the
FBI coming and knocking on the door

1416
01:25:08,699 --> 01:25:10,733
and looking for him.

1417
01:25:10,832 --> 01:25:14,565
They asked if Robert Harrison was there

1418
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:18,466
and I just knew this wasn't good

1419
01:25:18,565 --> 01:25:21,832
and said "No" and slammed the door.

1420
01:25:21,932 --> 01:25:26,899
And Bob went out the back

1421
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,332
and ran out to the main street.

1422
01:25:29,432 --> 01:25:34,399
And as I understand it,
got in a car and left

1423
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,500
and that was the last I saw of him.

1424
01:25:42,265 --> 01:25:45,932
BOWMAN: I don't think a military
mom at the time would want

1425
01:25:46,033 --> 01:25:47,533
to announce, "My son has gone AWOL.

1426
01:25:47,632 --> 01:25:49,533
"My son has run to Canada.

1427
01:25:49,632 --> 01:25:52,632
"My son is all the words that
were associated with it,

1428
01:25:52,733 --> 01:25:56,666
a deserter, a coward."

1429
01:25:56,765 --> 01:25:59,166
All of the things that
these guys were called.

1430
01:26:01,466 --> 01:26:04,500
I don't think that's what those
guys thought they were doing.

1431
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,666
I do not think they thought
they were deserting.

1432
01:26:06,765 --> 01:26:08,666
I do not think they thought
they were cowards.

1433
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:11,765
In fact, I think they thought
they were very brave.

1434
01:26:15,765 --> 01:26:18,565
NARRATOR: When Matt Harrison
assumed command of Alpha Company,

1435
01:26:18,666 --> 01:26:24,000
2nd Battalion, 14th Regiment
of the 25th Infantry Division,

1436
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,600
his Army had changed.

1437
01:26:29,466 --> 01:26:32,565
HARRISON: I was commanding
a company of draftees,

1438
01:26:32,666 --> 01:26:35,000
almost none of whom wanted to be there.

1439
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,765
They didn't want to be in the Army

1440
01:26:36,865 --> 01:26:38,699
and they certainly didn't want to be

1441
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,699
an infantryman in Vietnam.

1442
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,166
There were times when it was very difficult

1443
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:46,565
to keep the men under control,

1444
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:49,000
particularly if we had taken
casualties on the way

1445
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,600
into a village.

1446
01:26:52,233 --> 01:26:56,966
One of the things I learned
is the veneer of civilization

1447
01:26:57,065 --> 01:26:59,733
is very thin... very thin...

1448
01:26:59,832 --> 01:27:04,932
on me, probably on you,
and I think on everybody.

1449
01:27:06,733 --> 01:27:09,132
I just saw over and over again

1450
01:27:09,233 --> 01:27:13,199
some nice young guy out
of Huron, South Dakota,

1451
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,432
who back in Huron helped old
ladies across the street

1452
01:27:16,533 --> 01:27:19,300
and went to church every Sunday.

1453
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:26,533
It did not take long for that
veneer of civilization to erode.

1454
01:27:26,632 --> 01:27:30,699
And he was now capable of doing things

1455
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,800
that just simply are inhuman.

1456
01:27:36,166 --> 01:27:39,800
I was not willing to allow
it to happen on my watch

1457
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:42,399
and I didn't think it was
good for the soldiers

1458
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,932
to do those kinds of things.

1459
01:27:44,033 --> 01:27:48,100
Now, I'm not saying that we
didn't do some horrific things.

1460
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:49,199
We did.

1461
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:54,699
But there's a difference
between being spontaneous

1462
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,300
and being premeditated.

1463
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:07,899
NARRATOR: Many years later,
Robin Harrison, still adrift,

1464
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,065
got caught up in the world of drugs

1465
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:16,565
and died 10,000 miles from home
in a hotel room in Hong Kong,

1466
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:19,865
another casualty, his
brother Matt believed,

1467
01:28:19,966 --> 01:28:22,699
of the war in Vietnam.

1468
01:28:25,765 --> 01:28:29,399

Steppenwolf playing)

MERRILL McPEAK: I dropped
a bomb one afternoon

1476
01:28:53,733 --> 01:28:56,600
that must have had a broken
fin or something on the bomb.

1477
01:28:56,699 --> 01:29:00,000
It just went crazy, went
over and hit, you know,

1478
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,699
a mile away from where I was aiming.

1479
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:09,466
And it started a series
of secondary explosions,

1480
01:29:09,565 --> 01:29:12,699
meaning that I had hit an ammunition dump,

1481
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,276
or a cache of ammunition or something.

1482
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,132
So it cooked off for 15 minutes.

1483
01:29:16,233 --> 01:29:19,932
As we were leaving, the
thing was still blowing up.

1484
01:29:20,033 --> 01:29:22,632
The best result I achieved in a year,

1485
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:25,966
it was a result of a gross miss
from what I was aiming at.

1486
01:29:26,065 --> 01:29:30,600
Now that's the exact reverse of
how you want to use air power.

1487
01:29:32,365 --> 01:29:35,466
NARRATOR: Major Merrill McPeak
was a crack fighter pilot

1488
01:29:35,565 --> 01:29:39,632
when he arrived in Vietnam in late 1968.

1489
01:29:39,733 --> 01:29:43,600
At first, he had helped provide
air support for the Army,

1490
01:29:43,699 --> 01:29:48,065
with a guaranteed number of
sorties per day, he remembered,

1491
01:29:48,166 --> 01:29:51,132
"whether or not they had
anything in front of them

1492
01:29:51,233 --> 01:29:52,533
worth blowing up."

1493
01:29:54,966 --> 01:29:58,000
MERRILL McPEAK: At the end of any
sortie where we dropped bombs

1494
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,065
on what we called "trees in contact"

1495
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:02,733
because there was nothing
important down there,

1496
01:30:02,832 --> 01:30:05,699
we would always get back a
list of bomb damage assessment

1497
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,265
from the forward air controller.

1498
01:30:07,365 --> 01:30:12,466
And it would be, like, "12
supply sources destroyed,

1499
01:30:12,565 --> 01:30:14,932
two structures collapsed."

1500
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:16,432
All these metrics.

1501
01:30:16,533 --> 01:30:18,399
It was phony.

1502
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,666
Just a waste of time.

1503
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:25,100
NARRATOR: Then, McPeak was
assigned to a top-secret squadron

1504
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:27,865
seeking to pinpoint men and supplies

1505
01:30:27,966 --> 01:30:31,199
moving on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos.

1506
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:35,300
He and his fellow pilots
called their unit Misty,

1507
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:38,533
after its radio call sign.

1508
01:30:38,632 --> 01:30:40,265
McPEAK: I spent four months in Misty.

1509
01:30:40,365 --> 01:30:43,932
And that was the best
four months of the war,

1510
01:30:44,033 --> 01:30:45,432
as far as I'm concerned,

1511
01:30:45,533 --> 01:30:48,932
because what we were doing
was simple, straightforward,

1512
01:30:49,033 --> 01:30:50,432
and made sense.

1513
01:30:50,533 --> 01:30:54,265
We want to stop traffic from
A to B down this dirt road.

1514
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:57,300
That I can understand.

1515
01:30:57,399 --> 01:31:00,565
Somebody in Saigon wasn't saying,

1516
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:03,365
"Go bomb trees at
such-and-such a location."

1517
01:31:03,466 --> 01:31:06,265
We went out and actually found the target.

1518
01:31:15,632 --> 01:31:17,332
NARRATOR: It was dangerous work.

1519
01:31:17,432 --> 01:31:22,265
One out of five pilots was shot down.

1520
01:31:24,632 --> 01:31:26,033
(radio chatter)

1521
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:34,699
Misty put up seven sorties
a day from dawn to dusk,

1522
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,966
on the lookout for signs
of human activity...

1523
01:31:38,065 --> 01:31:43,265
gardens, encampments, roadside
trees coated with dust,

1524
01:31:43,365 --> 01:31:47,432
or wet roads on either side of fords

1525
01:31:47,533 --> 01:31:52,533
that signaled a truck convoy
had recently passed through.

1526
01:31:56,565 --> 01:31:59,666
McPEAK: I have enormous respect
for those truck drivers.

1527
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,233
They left their homes in the North,

1528
01:32:03,332 --> 01:32:07,199
and they weren't drafted for a year or two.

1529
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,899
They just left and didn't know

1530
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,966
if they were ever going to come back.

1531
01:32:12,733 --> 01:32:16,432
NARRATOR: Although McPeak and his
fellow pilots did not know it,

1532
01:32:16,533 --> 01:32:18,199
among the drivers threading their way

1533
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:22,065
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail by
night were hundreds of women.

1534
01:32:25,033 --> 01:32:29,132
NGUYEN NGUYET ANH:

1535
01:32:47,365 --> 01:32:50,966
NARRATOR: For three years, Nguyen
Nguyet Anh drove her section

1536
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:57,666
of the Trail, ferrying
arms and supplies south,

1537
01:32:57,765 --> 01:33:02,432
then heading back north with
cargoes of wounded men.

1538
01:33:04,932 --> 01:33:06,733
NGUYEN NGUYET ANH:

1539
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:17,865
McPEAK: They drove in stages.

1540
01:33:17,966 --> 01:33:20,899
So they knew 15, 20 clicks of the road.

1541
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,466
And they drove from A to B and back to A.

1542
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:29,699
And then they rested, during the daytime,

1543
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,800
and then the next night, they
drove from A to B and back to A.

1544
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:38,666
They had kind of memorized the
road, which was very important,

1545
01:33:38,765 --> 01:33:41,365
because they were running
without lights at night.

1546
01:34:06,765 --> 01:34:07,966
(jet engine roars)

1547
01:34:17,365 --> 01:34:20,932
McPEAK: One time I stumbled across
a bunch of trucks backed up,

1548
01:34:21,033 --> 01:34:23,365
and that was a great morning for me.

1549
01:34:23,466 --> 01:34:25,699
Occasionally one of 'em would break down,

1550
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,600
in a spot where the trucks behind it

1551
01:34:27,699 --> 01:34:29,642
would get trapped and
couldn't back out of there.

1552
01:34:29,666 --> 01:34:34,699
So you try to strafe the last
truck, so that it can't move.

1553
01:34:37,166 --> 01:34:39,899
And these are one-lane roads.

1554
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,199
So once you get the back truck disabled,

1555
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:45,533
then you just call in fighters.

1556
01:34:46,966 --> 01:34:49,300
You're shooting fish in a barrel.

1557
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,699
NARRATOR: As she drove the Ho Chi
Minh Trail, Anh thought constantly

1558
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,500
of her fiancÃ© Tran Cong Thang,

1559
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:05,832
an army engineer she'd fallen in
love with four years earlier.

1560
01:35:05,932 --> 01:35:10,065
He was also stationed
somewhere on the Trail.

1561
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:13,699
NGUYEN NGUYET ANH:

1562
01:35:27,765 --> 01:35:29,699
TRAN CONG THANG:

1563
01:36:04,865 --> 01:36:09,699
NARRATOR: Over 20,000 engineers,
soldiers, and truck drivers died

1564
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,966
along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

1565
01:36:13,065 --> 01:36:17,233
72 military cemeteries would
eventually be required

1566
01:36:17,332 --> 01:36:19,600
to hold their remains.

1567
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:26,432
TRAN CONG THANG:

1568
01:36:40,132 --> 01:36:42,899
McPEAK: We dropped more
tonnage of munitions

1569
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,166
than the United States
dropped in World War II,

1570
01:36:48,265 --> 01:36:51,132
most of it aimed at the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

1571
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,699
We did not stop traffic down the trail.

1572
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,233
And that is a big disappointment for me.

1573
01:36:59,332 --> 01:37:01,832
To this day, it irritates me.

1574
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,332
The real failures were
made at the policy level.

1575
01:37:09,432 --> 01:37:12,800
We were fighting on the wrong side.

1576
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:16,533
The South, the government
in the South was corrupt.

1577
01:37:16,632 --> 01:37:18,865
And its people knew it.

1578
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:19,966
And we knew it.

1579
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:22,666
I'll tell you something,

1580
01:37:22,765 --> 01:37:25,065
those truck drivers fought very well.

1581
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:29,733
I would have been proud to fight with them.

1582
01:37:29,832 --> 01:37:32,300
So one of the things you got
to do when you go to war

1583
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:33,932
is pick the right side, okay.

1584
01:37:34,033 --> 01:37:35,300
Get the right allies.

1585
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,000
NARRATOR: Merrill McPeak would
serve 37 years and retire

1586
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:46,600
as Air Force chief of staff.

1587
01:37:49,233 --> 01:37:53,065
Nguyen Nguyet Anh and Tran
Cong Thang were reunited

1588
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:55,832
after the war and married.

1589
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,365
The peace we seek to win

1590
01:38:03,466 --> 01:38:08,033
is not victory over any other people,

1591
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:12,500
but the peace that comes
with healing in its wings;

1592
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:15,466
with compassion for those
who have suffered;

1593
01:38:15,565 --> 01:38:18,466
with understanding for
those who have opposed us;

1594
01:38:18,565 --> 01:38:22,100
with the opportunity for all
the peoples of this earth

1595
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:24,033
to choose their own destiny.

1596
01:38:24,132 --> 01:38:26,733
("Lonely Road" by the Sandals playing)

1597
01:38:26,832 --> 01:38:28,265
NARRATOR: Like Lyndon Johnson,

1598
01:38:28,365 --> 01:38:33,132
Richard Nixon had an ambitious
agenda for his presidency...

1599
01:38:33,233 --> 01:38:37,399
easing a quarter of a century of
tensions with the Soviet Union

1600
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,666
and opening the door to China,

1601
01:38:39,765 --> 01:38:43,565
whose existence the United
States had refused to recognize

1602
01:38:43,666 --> 01:38:47,565
since the communists took over in 1949.

1603
01:38:47,666 --> 01:38:50,765
But as it had with Johnson,

1604
01:38:50,865 --> 01:38:55,265
the ongoing war in Vietnam
threatened all those plans.

1605
01:38:57,233 --> 01:39:02,565
37,563 Americans had died there

1606
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:05,365
by the time he took the oath of office.

1607
01:39:05,466 --> 01:39:09,199
"I'm not going to end up like LBJ,

1608
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:11,233
"holed up in the White House,

1609
01:39:11,332 --> 01:39:13,466
afraid to show my face on the street,"

1610
01:39:13,565 --> 01:39:15,600
Richard Nixon told an aide.

1611
01:39:15,699 --> 01:39:17,565
"I'm going to stop that war.

1612
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:19,132
Fast."

1613
01:39:19,233 --> 01:39:23,765
Nixon's national security
advisor was Henry Kissinger.

1614
01:39:23,865 --> 01:39:28,199
A refugee from Nazi Germany, he
had taught government at Harvard

1615
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:32,033
and was already a well-known
advocate of a foreign policy

1616
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:35,666
based on pragmatism, not ideology.

1617
01:39:35,765 --> 01:39:40,466
"Give us six months," Kissinger
told a group of Quakers

1618
01:39:40,565 --> 01:39:42,733
demonstrating on Pennsylvania Avenue,

1619
01:39:42,832 --> 01:39:47,300
"and if we haven't ended the
war by then, you can come back

1620
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:49,500
and tear down the White House fence."

1621
01:39:52,432 --> 01:39:58,100
In February of 1969, the North
launched yet another offensive.

1622
01:40:00,699 --> 01:40:05,600
This time, they killed 1,100
Americans in just three weeks.

1623
01:40:09,432 --> 01:40:11,865
Nixon did not feel he could retaliate

1624
01:40:11,966 --> 01:40:14,300
by resuming the bombing of the North

1625
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:18,199
for fear of provoking the
antiwar movement at home.

1626
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:24,432
So in March, he secretly ordered
B-52s to begin attacking

1627
01:40:24,533 --> 01:40:26,699
the North Vietnamese bases within Cambodia,

1628
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:31,065
which had offered sanctuary
to the enemy for years.

1629
01:40:32,765 --> 01:40:35,466
The American public was told
nothing about the bombing.

1630
01:40:35,565 --> 01:40:39,466
Congress was kept in the dark, as well.

1631
01:40:39,565 --> 01:40:43,265
Even members of Nixon's own cabinet

1632
01:40:43,365 --> 01:40:45,733
were not initially informed.

1633
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:52,300
When theNew York Ti mes finally
discovered what was happening,

1634
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:55,666
the White House denied any
bombing was taking place

1635
01:40:55,765 --> 01:40:59,466
and ordered that illegal wiretaps be placed

1636
01:40:59,565 --> 01:41:02,065
on the telephones of 17 reporters

1637
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:03,800
and government officials

1638
01:41:03,899 --> 01:41:07,666
in an effort to find out
who had leaked the story.

1639
01:41:07,765 --> 01:41:10,800
"We will not make the same old mistakes,"

1640
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:13,033
Henry Kissinger had joked to an aide

1641
01:41:13,132 --> 01:41:15,765
shortly after coming to Washington.

1642
01:41:15,865 --> 01:41:18,000
"We will make our own."

1643
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,132
The war went on.

1644
01:41:23,233 --> 01:41:26,399
(helicopter blades whirring, men shouting)

1645
01:41:29,365 --> 01:41:32,565
(gunfire)

1646
01:41:32,666 --> 01:41:36,332
MARLANTES: There's basically
two sides to heroism.

1647
01:41:36,432 --> 01:41:38,565
One is that I want to be special.

1648
01:41:38,666 --> 01:41:41,100
I want people to look at me,
I'm an important person.

1649
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:42,899
I've done heroic deeds.

1650
01:41:45,699 --> 01:41:49,132
The other side is simply
somebody's got to do something

1651
01:41:49,233 --> 01:41:53,765
to save these people, my platoon
or my company, from destruction.

1652
01:41:53,865 --> 01:41:59,132
The exact same act can be done
with one attitude or the other.

1653
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:07,000
NARRATOR: After leaving Oxford,
First Lieutenant Karl Marlantes

1654
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:10,666
found himself executive
officer of Charlie Company,

1655
01:42:10,765 --> 01:42:14,632
First Battalion, Fourth
Marines, Third Marine Division,

1656
01:42:14,733 --> 01:42:17,265
just south of the DMZ.

1657
01:42:17,365 --> 01:42:21,265
His unit was fighting the same sort of war

1658
01:42:21,365 --> 01:42:24,733
over the same terrain that
Marines had been fighting now

1659
01:42:24,832 --> 01:42:26,399
for four years.

1660
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:28,375
MARLANTES: You would hear,
"Well, it's going to be

1661
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:31,300
Operation Purple Martin I
or Operation Scotland II."

1662
01:42:31,399 --> 01:42:33,365
And, and it'd be like, "Yeah, whatever."

1663
01:42:33,466 --> 01:42:36,632
What that meant to us was that someday soon

1664
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:38,765
some choppers are going
to show up and drop us

1665
01:42:38,865 --> 01:42:41,300
into the jungle someplace
or a valley north of us

1666
01:42:41,399 --> 01:42:42,639
or wherever it was going to be.

1667
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:44,166
And then we'd be off the hill

1668
01:42:44,265 --> 01:42:46,166
and we'd be humping, as we called it.

1669
01:42:50,132 --> 01:42:54,500
NARRATOR: On March 5, 1969,
Marlantes' company was ordered

1670
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,065
to attack a regiment of
North Vietnamese regulars

1671
01:42:58,166 --> 01:43:03,300
dug in on the slopes of a hill
the Americans called 484.

1672
01:43:03,399 --> 01:43:07,399
A few days earlier, his
unit had taken the hill

1673
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:10,565
and then, under heavy
fire, had abandoned it.

1674
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:15,166
This time air strikes meant
to soften up the enemy

1675
01:43:15,265 --> 01:43:17,399
hit the wrong hill.

1676
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:22,033
Charlie Company was ordered
to advance anyway.

1677
01:43:22,132 --> 01:43:24,800
Marlantes led the way.

1678
01:43:26,132 --> 01:43:27,932
MARLANTES: It was a very steep hill.

1679
01:43:28,033 --> 01:43:32,065
And you don't charge because
you have a lot of weight.

1680
01:43:32,166 --> 01:43:34,466
And we had started walking up
and we had probably gotten

1681
01:43:34,565 --> 01:43:36,332
about a third of the way up the hill

1682
01:43:36,432 --> 01:43:37,800
and then they unleashed on us.

1683
01:43:41,399 --> 01:43:43,308
We were in the middle of
this horrible shit sandwich.

1684
01:43:43,332 --> 01:43:45,432
(gunfire, explosions)

1685
01:43:45,533 --> 01:43:47,533
NARRATOR: The Marines took
what cover they could.

1686
01:43:47,632 --> 01:43:51,432
Marlantes realized that if
they continued up the slope

1687
01:43:51,533 --> 01:43:54,733
they would face machine gun fire,

1688
01:43:54,832 --> 01:43:56,365
but if they stayed where they were,

1689
01:43:56,466 --> 01:43:58,932
mortar shells would surely find them.

1690
01:43:59,033 --> 01:44:00,399
(explosion)

1691
01:44:02,432 --> 01:44:04,265
MARLANTES: And then I stood up

1692
01:44:04,365 --> 01:44:06,332
and went up the hill.

1693
01:44:06,432 --> 01:44:09,332
And I thought it was...
I was all by myself.

1694
01:44:09,432 --> 01:44:11,565
And I was running at this point

1695
01:44:11,666 --> 01:44:15,800
because I wanted to cover
that ground fast as I could.

1696
01:44:15,899 --> 01:44:18,632
And I caught some movement
out of the corner of my eye,

1697
01:44:18,733 --> 01:44:21,632
and I rolled to the ground
to come up with my rifle

1698
01:44:21,733 --> 01:44:24,733
to shoot the person.

1699
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:27,632
And it was a kid from my platoon.

1700
01:44:27,733 --> 01:44:31,100
And then I looked behind
him, there was more kids.

1701
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:34,332
They had all come behind me.

1702
01:44:34,432 --> 01:44:36,699
It felt to me like I was there for a week

1703
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,332
but I think I was probably by myself

1704
01:44:38,432 --> 01:44:42,533
four seconds, five seconds.

1705
01:44:42,632 --> 01:44:47,699
The entire platoon just
stood up and out they came.

1706
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:50,365
It remains to me a moment that is just

1707
01:44:50,466 --> 01:44:56,632
almost inexpressible of the
heart that these kids had.

1708
01:44:56,733 --> 01:44:57,733
(explosion, gunfire)

1709
01:44:57,832 --> 01:45:00,132
And then we just hit those bunkers.

1710
01:45:00,233 --> 01:45:04,065
NARRATOR: The Marines cleared
the bunkers one by one.

1711
01:45:11,865 --> 01:45:17,332
For his bravery, Marlantes
was awarded the Navy Cross.

1712
01:45:17,432 --> 01:45:21,332
MARLANTES: Combat is like crack cocaine.

1713
01:45:21,432 --> 01:45:25,565
It's an enormous high but
it has enormous costs.

1714
01:45:25,666 --> 01:45:29,733
Any sane person would never do crack.

1715
01:45:29,832 --> 01:45:32,565
Combat is like that.

1716
01:45:32,666 --> 01:45:36,265
You're scared, you're
terrified, you're miserable,

1717
01:45:36,365 --> 01:45:38,966
but then the fighting starts...

1718
01:45:39,065 --> 01:45:42,765
(gunfire)

1719
01:45:42,865 --> 01:45:45,399
...and suddenly everything is at stake...

1720
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,365
your life, your friend's lives.

1721
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:49,733
It's almost transcendence

1722
01:45:49,832 --> 01:45:52,365
because you're no longer a person.

1723
01:45:52,466 --> 01:45:54,966
You lose that sense; you're just...
you're just the platoon.

1724
01:45:55,065 --> 01:45:58,432
And the platoon can't be beat.

1725
01:45:58,533 --> 01:46:00,466
And not to mention there's a savage joy

1726
01:46:00,565 --> 01:46:03,300
in overcoming your enemy,
just a savage joy.

1727
01:46:03,399 --> 01:46:06,365
And I think that we make
a big mistake if we say,

1728
01:46:06,466 --> 01:46:07,632
"Oh, war is hell."

1729
01:46:07,733 --> 01:46:09,932
We all know the "war is hell" story.

1730
01:46:10,033 --> 01:46:11,533
It is.

1731
01:46:11,632 --> 01:46:16,432
But there's an enormously
exhilarating part of it.

1732
01:46:16,533 --> 01:46:17,699
(explosion)

1733
01:46:19,899 --> 01:46:22,332
