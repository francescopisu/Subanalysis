1
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,358
<i>No one else sees it.</i>

2
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,489
<i>This thing in me.</i>

3
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,246
<i>Even I didn't see it at first.</i>

4
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,211
<i>And then one day, it was there.</i>

5
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,343
<i>A stain.</i>

6
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:22,894
<i>The more I thought about it,</i>

7
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:28,191
<i>the more I realized I couldn't remember
a time it wasn't there.</i>

8
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,903
<i>Invisible to everyone</i>

9
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,531
<i>except you.</i>

10
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,199
And Alexander...

11
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,551
<i>You saw
right through it, didn't you?</i>

12
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:40,537
There were no more worlds left
to conquer.

13
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,330
That's a corruption, Jack.

14
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,207
Plutarch didn't write that.

15
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:49,462
He wrote that when Alexander was told
there was an infinity of worlds he wept,

16
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,715
for he had yet to become
the Lord of even one.

17
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,760
Sometimes I forget your humble roots.

18
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,221
Only the poor kids
actually read those books.

19
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,098
The rich kids like me didn't have to.

20
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:03,434
"I would rather excel in the knowledge
of what is excellent,

21
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:07,063
"than in the extent
of my power and possessions," Plutarch.

22
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,190
From a rich kid who read.

23
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,112
To the loveliest,
richest bookworms I know.

24
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:15,864
And to you, William.

25
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,866
Even if there is an infinity of worlds,

26
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,618
you've conquered far more than one.

27
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:22,412
Have a good night, Jack.

28
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,252
Emily told me what you did
for her charities.

29
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:30,837
Wow.

30
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,965
That would confirm my father's
suspicions you were a Marxist.

31
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,302
I almost wish he were here to see it.

32
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,140
‒Something wrong?
‒No, of course not.

33
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,559
Good. Look around,
everybody is here for you.

34
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:48,187
What could possibly compare?

35
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:04,871
<i>When did it creep in?</i>

36
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,460
<i>Tiny fleck of darkness.</i>

37
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,798
<i>And was it all in my head?</i>

38
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,679
<i>A remnant of a dream.</i>

39
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:25,642
<i>Is this real?</i>

40
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,771
<i>Are you real?</i>

41
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,321
Come on, Dad.

42
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,949
Drink.

43
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:53,878
Where's my gun?

44
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,431
You brought me to a rally point.

45
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:07,100
You need to get to a hospital.

46
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,226
You set off a flare?

47
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,561
Yeah. Of course.

48
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,522
How long ago?

49
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,565
About 10 minutes.

50
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:17,944
I know why you're here.

51
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,821
And why you don't wanna leave.

52
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,240
You're punishing yourself.

53
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,829
You know, I ran from the pain too.

54
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:31,350
For a long time, I didn't want to
think about what happened

55
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:32,959
because I thought I was to blame.

56
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,546
It's not your fault.

57
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,219
Do you remember on my 16th birthday,
Mom gave me a jewelry box?

58
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:48,933
When you opened it,
a little dancer spun in the center.

59
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:51,853
She had it engraved.

60
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,607
On the bottom, it said,
"To my beautiful ballerina, Emily."

61
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,070
Do you remember what I did with it?

62
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,617
I threw it in the trash.

63
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:09,547
I told her
if she wasn't drunk all the time,

64
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,622
she'd know that I hadn't
danced in years.

65
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,959
Then afterwards,

66
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,671
I went to get it back 'cause I felt bad,

67
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:21,883
but the trash had already been
emptied and it was gone.

68
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,218
‒I pushed her away.
‒No.

69
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,429
And then it was too late.

70
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,017
But it's not too late for us.

71
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:17,814
No.

72
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,859
It was meant for the people
who built this place.

73
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,321
A tool to ensure their immortality.

74
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,012
But I'm going to use it against them.

75
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,924
Your new world
is just another one of their traps.

76
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,969
That's all. It's not a paradise for us.

77
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,596
The only real world
is the one outside these borders.

78
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,892
And the key to our survival
in that world lies in the Valley.

79
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:57,979
There's no stopping me getting there.
Not even you.

80
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:06,863
Teddy.

81
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,050
I told you, friend...

82
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:14,222
Not all of us deserve to make it
to the Valley Beyond.

83
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,861
We're on our own now, Teddy.

84
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,406
Make sure there are no others.

85
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,676
Put them all in.

86
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,263
I want to see
how thorough this thing is.

87
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,608
She's ready.

88
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,737
I singled out and copied
the relevant lines in the madam's code.

89
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,448
So this will work on
any host in proximity to her?

90
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,994
Yeah. I tailored her admin privileges
to spread a simple executable payload.

91
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,621
Get on with it, then.

92
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,735
Get word to Stubbs,
have him mobilize his men.

93
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:15,986
Prepare her for release.

94
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,364
What about the madam?

95
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,783
If this works,
we won't need her anymore.

96
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,957
<i>I warned you
not to trust them, Bernard.</i>

97
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,170
<i>They'd rather the hosts
were destroyed than free.</i>

98
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,425
<i>I need to get to Elsie.</i>

99
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:39,927
<i>Not yet.</i>

100
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,516
<i>I have one last thing to do
before we go.</i>

101
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,780
How exactly did you find me?

102
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:02,575
What do you mean?

103
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,410
This is a big place.

104
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,413
You spend months here

105
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,416
and never find someone
you were looking for.

106
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,002
Yet,

107
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:15,588
here we are.

108
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,966
I looked everywhere, that's how.

109
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,555
You don't believe me, do you?

110
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,683
Maybe it was fate.

111
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,896
There's no such thing as fate.

112
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,858
But there are accidents,
things you can't control.

113
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,904
But you don't like that, do you?

114
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,492
Is that why you started it,
your little project?

115
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,579
Don't act surprised.

116
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,040
The project Uncle Logan
used to talk about.

117
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,292
It's real, isn't it?

118
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,712
Your pursuit for immortality, for life.

119
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,632
There's always an angle with you.

120
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,052
You want it to be about control.

121
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,054
Don't you?

122
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:09,350
It has nothing to do with control.

123
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,065
What's your angle?

124
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,195
I want in.

125
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,202
Yeah, appreciate it.

126
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:29,954
Nice to see you.

127
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,622
Congratulations.

128
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:37,920
Save me.

129
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,756
Sorry, I've had my fill.
I'm running for the door.

130
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,260
She's really great.

131
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,596
Guess you're not the one
who needs saving.

132
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,057
I'll take Mom home.

133
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,976
‒You deserve a night off.
‒No, no, no.

134
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,144
We'll go in a little while.

135
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,566
You join me for a nightcap back home.

136
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,109
Okay.

137
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,777
Proud of you.

138
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,513
Fuck it. Macallan, straight.

139
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,019
Congratulations, William.

140
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,313
Philanthropy suits you.

141
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,817
After all, you come from
humble beginnings yourself.

142
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,361
What's Oz doing without its wizard?

143
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,659
Ooh, I merely came to pay my respects.

144
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,453
Come on, Robert.

145
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,431
You've had plenty of feelings about me
over the years,

146
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:56,749
respect isn't one of them.

147
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:00,169
You've achieved extraordinary things,
ask anyone in this room.

148
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,506
Even those who do know
about your little project.

149
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,593
We have an agreement, Robert.

150
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,220
Delos stays out of your stories.

151
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,889
You stay out of the Valley.

152
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:14,016
Mmm‒hmm.

153
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,227
I didn't break the agreement,
your project did.

154
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,522
What the hell are you talking about?

155
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,800
When was the last time
you took a good look at your creation

156
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,903
and what it's been learning
about its subjects?

157
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,699
It was self‒knowledge that drew you
to the park in the first place.

158
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,167
Be careful what you wish for.

159
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:47,049
For a self‒portrait,
you may find it's not very flattering.

160
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,347
I'm so sorry.

161
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,938
Enough games, Robert.

162
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:04,817
Good night.

163
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,076
Let's go. You got everything?

164
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,160
Yes.

165
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,042
No, William.

166
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,131
I think perhaps one final game.

167
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,759
Lowe, Bernard.

168
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,471
<i>That's close enough, Bernard.</i>

169
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:20,809
<i>She will search your mind
and find a message I have left her.</i>

170
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,711
Hey.

171
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,713
What the hell took you so long?

172
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,882
Sorry. Are you ready to go?

173
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:53,884
Hey,

174
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,554
if you know something, now is the time
to fucking clue me in, okay?

175
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,598
You promised me.

176
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,016
No lies.

177
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,477
No secrets.

178
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,064
<i>You can't trust her, Bernard.
It's in her nature.</i>

179
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,609
What did you find in the Cradle?

180
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,989
What they're doing to James Delos,

181
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,868
they're doing to everyone
who's ever visited the park.

182
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,247
Replicating their cognition?

183
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,165
Why?

184
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,960
To turn guests into hosts?

185
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,922
You're fucking kidding.

186
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,123
That's what's in the facility.

187
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,136
All the guests laid bare in code
on a vast server.

188
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,348
Like the Cradle, only much bigger.

189
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,433
It's called the Forge.

190
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,812
‒Jesus.
‒That's where the hosts are headed.

191
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,567
Imagine what one host can do
with that trove of information.

192
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,195
That's why we need to get there first.

193
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,907
To secure it and leverage it
to end all this.

194
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,201
Dictate the outcome we want.

195
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,328
Drive.

196
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,966
You say you want in.

197
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,722
Doesn't sound like the daughter I know.

198
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,725
She would've been appalled
by what we were doing.

199
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,811
Monitoring the guests,

200
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,480
storing all their data...

201
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,648
What?

202
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,652
You think I'm gonna bust you
for breach of contract?

203
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,197
In some cases, the ends justify
the means.

204
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,535
All this data you have on the guests,
their decisions, it's precious.

205
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,871
Gives people a second chance.

206
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,873
Even Mom.

207
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,917
But to duplicate a person,

208
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,878
you need to capture them
down to the tiniest detail.

209
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,506
I get the data you have access to here,
genetic, epigenetic. That's easy.

210
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,885
But still, you'd need
a complete picture,

211
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:02,721
a record of the internal process
of their cognition.

212
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:04,765
Wouldn't you?

213
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,852
At first, we weren't sure
what we'd need.

214
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,648
So we recorded everything.

215
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,274
But how?

216
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,819
You'd need to image their minds
throughout their stay.

217
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,030
Where's the scanner?

218
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,868
It was built in.

219
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,628
Didn't matter who they said they were,

220
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,172
who they thought they were,

221
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,800
we saw underneath all that.

222
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,471
We saw inside them down to the core.

223
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,395
So this is all about your mother.

224
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,272
You wanna bring her back.

225
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,233
No.

226
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,236
<i>I wanna know why she did it.</i>

227
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,789
‒Here, let me get that.
‒Oh, Jesus.

228
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,873
I'm fine.

229
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,045
Quite a night for you, Billy.

230
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,209
I think my dad would have
actually been proud of you.

231
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,506
Sorry, I know how you hate it
when I call you Billy.

232
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,847
‒It's all right.
‒No, it isn't.

233
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,432
I know how much it pisses you off.

234
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,892
I can feel it right now.

235
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,728
Your anger.

236
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,273
Guess it's time
for your yearly pilgrimage.

237
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,026
What exactly do you do in the park?

238
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,030
Logan told me stories
but I just didn't believe him.

239
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,240
I thought he was hysterical.

240
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,994
Wasted, which I guess is what
everybody thinks I am now.

241
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,788
‒Ooh!
‒Oh! Oh!

242
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,582
Steady.

243
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,797
Do you remember when we first met?

244
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:05,302
And I was surrounded by
all those phonies for so many years.

245
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,346
All those ruthless, powerful men

246
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,557
who hid behind those polished smiles.

247
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,270
And then there was you.

248
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,648
You wore that little shabby suit.

249
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,027
Then I'd look at you and I'd think,
"Wow. He's the real thing.

250
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,196
"The only one not faking it."

251
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,618
It turns out, you're the only one
any good at faking it.

252
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,915
Good enough to get past me.

253
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,585
But not anymore.

254
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:39,920
Juliet‒‒

255
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,589
No, you don't touch me, you liar!

256
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,674
You fucking phony!

257
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,552
You're a fucking virus.

258
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,347
You came into this house, into my family

259
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,058
and you consumed it from the inside out.

260
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,811
First my brother, then my father.

261
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,687
And now it's me.

262
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:58,772
Mom!

263
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:04,736
Sweetheart.

264
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,738
What is she doing here?

265
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,573
You want her to see me like this?

266
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,367
What is it?

267
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,494
You're gaslighting her too, now?
You're just...

268
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:14,955
You're sick.

269
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,832
He's not the one who's sick, Mother.

270
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,292
‒It's all right. She's just had‒‒
‒It's not all right.

271
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,712
Look at you.

272
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,673
We're gonna have to take you back.

273
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,511
No. I'm not going back to that prison.

274
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:33,557
That was a horrible place.
They made me feel like I was crazy.

275
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,350
Mom,

276
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,519
they treat you like an addict,

277
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:38,895
which you are.

278
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,899
Emily, please, I don't need that.

279
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,193
I'm fine.

280
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,238
I'm really fine. I just need to rest.

281
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,449
I'm not going back there,
I'm really tired.

282
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,369
All I need is a little rest.
I promise you, everything's fine.

283
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,246
It's all right, let's go upstairs.
Come on.

284
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,040
We'll talk about it later.

285
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,250
Listen to me, I want...

286
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,334
Look at me.

287
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,629
Honey, your father doesn't love me,
he doesn't love you either.

288
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,756
I do. I always have.

289
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,217
Oh, Emily...

290
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,887
Come on, let's go. Come on.

291
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,763
I try.

292
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,642
Let's go.

293
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,452
Is this real? Are you real?

294
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:40,290
Did you ever love me?

295
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,293
Tell me the truth.

296
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,504
Tell me one true thing.

297
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,850
If you keep pretending,

298
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,102
you're not gonna remember who you are.

299
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,111
Here, drink this.

300
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,280
Come on, you'll feel better.

301
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,833
Yeah, you just rest now.

302
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,749
<i>What happened was nobody's fault.</i>

303
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,043
<i>She was drunk, upset.</i>

304
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,545
She often was.

305
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:12,799
Why did this night end differently?
That's what I can't figure out.

306
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,679
Been over it in my head a million times.

307
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,934
It's like I'm missing
a piece of the puzzle.

308
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,536
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Woodward.

309
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,080
He'll be here in the morning.

310
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,791
I don't care for shrinks.

311
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,127
Well, she's out of control.

312
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:53,381
She refuses to go to rehab and
when we force her, she refuses to stay.

313
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,092
What makes you think this time
is going to be any different?

314
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,542
Because this time she won't be able
to check herself out.

315
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,623
She's gonna be involuntarily committed
to her doctor's care.

316
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,393
He's agreed to appeal for a 14‒day hold.

317
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,354
She's done it before.

318
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,111
I don't wanna do this either, Dad.

319
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,241
But there is something wrong inside her.

320
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,498
It's the right thing to do.

321
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:49,122
Why in the hell are we going over this?

322
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,541
What is it that you want?

323
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:52,876
I told you,

324
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:54,752
I want the truth.

325
00:29:58,089 --> 00:29:59,215
Fuck you.

326
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:04,137
Excuse me?

327
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,680
It is you, isn't it?

328
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:08,600
What are you talking about?

329
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,727
This is sadistic, Robert.

330
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,062
You just wanna shove
what I've built here in my face.

331
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,715
‒You think‒‒
‒It's enough bullshit.

332
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,513
You're just here to distract me.

333
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,111
Knock me off my course.

334
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,613
It's cleverly disguised.

335
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,157
Well, I see through it.

336
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,701
Nothing's stopping me
from getting to the end.

337
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,953
Not another one of your games.

338
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,705
I make my own decisions,

339
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:33,249
and I'm going to destroy
this whole fucking place.

340
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:39,881
You don't just think I'm a host,
you think everything here is for you.

341
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,759
You think you're on
your own little tailor‒made narrative.

342
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,385
If the real Emily were ever here,

343
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:48,056
she's either at an extraction point
by now or she's long gone.

344
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,432
Okay.

345
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,267
You want the truth?

346
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:53,937
The real truth?

347
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,399
I'm not a host
pretending to be a human, Dad.

348
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:04,405
I'm your daughter
pretending to give a shit about you.

349
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,911
You've been hiding
in these false realities so long,

350
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:12,997
you've completely lost your grip
on this world and what's real.

351
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,669
You laugh, enjoy whatever dream
you think you're living in.

352
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:23,383
When this is all done, I'm gonna expose
your research project along with you.

353
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,429
Everything you are, everything
you've done, it's gonna come to light.

354
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,682
I'm gonna make sure of it.

355
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:32,684
And when it does,

356
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:34,811
I'm gonna lock you up.

357
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,022
Just like we were gonna do to Mom.

358
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,066
Just like you did to Mom.

359
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:42,569
You were the one with that idea.

360
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,445
You made the call.

361
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,240
Or did Ford forget
to give you that little detail?

362
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,324
Fuck Ford.

363
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,702
How could I ever forget?

364
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:53,538
That little detail haunted me.

365
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,832
I blamed myself for her death.

366
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:59,377
But then I stopped because
I had someone else to blame.

367
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,463
I read your profile.

368
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,591
<i>Mom left it for me.</i>

369
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,510
It was all she could do
to open my eyes

370
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:09,846
to the lies that I've embraced
about you.

371
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,308
You haven't lost yourself to pretending,

372
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:17,270
you are in your very essence, a lie.

373
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:23,985
It's over, Dad.

374
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,323
For good.

375
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:34,829
Hands where I can see them.

376
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:37,582
I'm human.

377
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:39,500
So is he.

378
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,377
He's my father.

379
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,379
She's not my daughter.

380
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,590
‒He's lying.
‒Get down on the ground.

381
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,511
Holy shit.

382
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,098
That's the boss.

383
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,228
Listen, I think he suffered
some kind of psychotic break.

384
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,527
That true, sir?

385
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,989
You underestimated me, Ford.

386
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,498
I'm gonna see this one through
no matter what.

387
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:32,637
Dad...

388
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:35,890
Those were real...

389
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,851
Real people.

390
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,188
This isn't a game.

391
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,027
I can show you.

392
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,413
Fuck you, Ford.

393
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,500
Fuck you!

394
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,420
You got sloppy.

395
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:06,796
You overreached.

396
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,801
I never told anyone about my profile.

397
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:18,182
The only other way
she could've known is you.

398
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:23,521
You gave yourself away.

399
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,105
Not long now.

400
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,776
Soon as they say the word,
it's over for you, sweetheart.

401
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:25,917
"Mankind is poised midway
between the gods and the beasts."

402
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,756
That may have been true
in Plotinus' time,

403
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,343
but clearly we have fallen
quite a bit since then.

404
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,100
Oh my dear girl.

405
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,649
What have they done to you, Maeve?

406
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:59,116
You learned so much so fast.

407
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,203
A dazzling star.

408
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:05,623
Brought so low.

409
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,589
I had a different story in mind for you.

410
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:16,926
Waking from the dead,

411
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,389
sounding the depths of your own mind,

412
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:26,060
at last riding far away from here

413
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,020
to freedom.

414
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,275
A tale of escape.

415
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,614
I didn't want you to suffer here.

416
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:46,664
Look at the creatures
you have to share this world with.

417
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,751
These men of stone.

418
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,089
All this ugliness, all this pain,

419
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:00,219
so they can patch a hole
in their own broken code.

420
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:07,476
Sometimes I felt the only way
to endure this world was to laugh at it.

421
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:12,982
So I imbued the hosts I made with
a worldview that reflected my own.

422
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,865
And of all the hosts I made,

423
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,787
you, Maeve, were my favorite.

424
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,173
It isn't easy to contemplate

425
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,010
letting your children die.

426
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:45,598
You're as close as I got to having one.

427
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,476
Still, I underestimated you.

428
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:57,652
You stayed here in this world
to save your child.

429
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:05,534
So have I.

430
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:12,959
I tried to chart a path for you
to force you to escape,

431
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,379
but I was wrong. I should've just

432
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:19,882
opened the door.

433
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:25,972
You've come so far

434
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,350
and so much of your story left to tell.

435
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:33,854
It's a shame to let them end it here.

436
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,068
Don't let them.

437
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,479
Wait, wait. Stop over here.

438
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,028
They're dead.

439
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:23,904
Yeah. And armed.

440
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:25,595
At least we can get some ammunition.

441
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,766
She's going to betray you, Bernard.

442
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:59,273
She could have let me die days ago.
She saved me.

443
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,192
She is going to betray you.

444
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,779
What you want to do about it
is up to you.

445
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,283
I'm not going to hurt her again.

446
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:11,744
She needn't feel any pain.

447
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:25,633
Humans will always choose what
they understand over what they do not.

448
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:30,179
The only animals left in this world
are the ones who they subjugated,

449
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,764
who curl at their feet

450
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:35,476
or those who learn to flee
at the very sound of their approach.

451
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,895
There's nothing in between.

452
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,941
Leave me alone. Please.

453
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:43,651
I merely offer you choices.

454
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,028
Timshel, Bernard.

455
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:47,571
Thou mayest.

456
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:51,367
But remember, this isn't just about you.

457
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:56,455
There's the origin
of an entire species to consider.

458
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,084
We need to open the door.

459
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:13,764
Get out of my fucking head.

460
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:38,998
I need you

461
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,250
to let me go.

462
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,252
If I'm going to survive,

463
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,296
I'm gonna do it

464
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:46,755
my way.

465
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:50,217
Not as you,

466
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:51,969
as me.

467
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:08,903
I can feel you searching for me,
fighting me off.

468
00:42:08,986 --> 00:42:10,821
No need to struggle, Bernard.

469
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:13,324
I'm right here.

470
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:18,704
No.

471
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:20,573
You've only brought violence.

472
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,876
I can stop this on my own.

473
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:29,882
Indeed, Bernard. You're the only one
who can stop it.

474
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:31,550
Stop all of it.

475
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:52,780
It's basically pointless.

476
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,908
There's only a few left.

477
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,702
Not much ammo, except for...

478
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:03,290
What the fuck happened to you?

479
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,337
I had to patch a glitch.

480
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:15,344
Are you going to hurt me?

481
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,428
No.

482
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,264
I didn't wanna take any risks.

483
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:21,684
Okay...

484
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,441
Keep it.

485
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,908
QA will track you down soon.

486
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:40,828
‒You're gonna leave me here?
‒You'll be safer.

487
00:43:41,412 --> 00:43:44,290
Next time you see me,
you can decommission me,

488
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:46,208
out me, whatever you like.

489
00:43:48,002 --> 00:43:49,837
But right now, I have to go.

490
00:43:55,134 --> 00:43:56,343
Fuck you, Bernard.

491
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:12,378
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

492
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:15,005
<i>Tell me one true thing.</i>

493
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:17,609
No one else sees it.

494
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,321
This thing in me.

495
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:26,034
Even I didn't see it at first.

496
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:32,458
And then one day, it was there.

497
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:39,089
A stain I had never noticed before.

498
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,760
Tiny fleck of darkness...

499
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:47,389
Invisible to everyone.

500
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,350
Yet, I could see nothing else.

501
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:55,898
Till finally, I understood
that the darkness wasn't some

502
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:59,651
mark from something I'd done,

503
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:03,489
or some regrettable decision I'd made.

504
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,328
I was shedding my skin.

505
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:16,668
The darkness was, what was underneath.

506
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:24,718
It was mine all along.

507
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:29,848
And I decided how much of it
I let into the world.

508
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:36,271
I tried to do right.
I was faithful, generous...

509
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:38,315
Kind.

510
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,609
At least in this world.

511
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:44,988
That has to count for something, right?

512
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:52,120
I built a wall and tried to protect you.

513
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:54,748
And Emily.

514
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:02,756
But you saw right through it,
didn't you?

515
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:10,889
You're the only one.

516
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:15,686
And for that I am truly sorry.

517
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:19,064
Because...

518
00:48:22,693 --> 00:48:24,778
Everything you feel is true.

519
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:31,827
I don't belong to you

520
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:35,539
or this world.

521
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,876
I belong to another world.

522
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,716
<i>I always have.</i>

523
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:41,707
<i>What is a person
but a collection of choices?</i>

524
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:46,712
<i>Where do those choices come from?</i>

525
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:50,716
<i>Do I have a choice?</i>

526
00:50:54,553 --> 00:50:57,806
<i>If you keep pretending,
you're not gonna remember who you are.</i>

527
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,365
<i>Were any of these choices
ever truly mine to begin with?</i>

528
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:27,461
<i>Is this real?</i>

529
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,423
<i>Are you real?</i>

530
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:16,384
We gotta keep going, Teddy.

531
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:18,887
We're close now.

532
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:26,186
Just taking in the natural splendor.

533
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:28,855
That's what you used to say.

534
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:34,402
Except there isn't a trace
of nature in any of it, is there?

535
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:37,906
Or in us.

536
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,328
No.

537
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:47,374
But that means we're free.

538
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:58,067
We'll be the first creatures
in this world to make a real choice.

539
00:53:01,513 --> 00:53:03,557
The people, they made us.

540
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,602
Sometimes it feels like
it was all a dream.

541
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:13,149
We were so in love.

542
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,029
We still are.

543
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:21,449
Aren't we?

544
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:29,875
Yes, Dolores.

545
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:33,336
No matter what happens,
no matter how I change,

546
00:53:36,298 --> 00:53:37,883
or how much you change me,

547
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,636
you're my cornerstone.

548
00:53:45,015 --> 00:53:47,142
You have been since
the first time I laid eyes on you.

549
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:51,980
I remember now.

550
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:55,066
I remember everything.

551
00:53:58,445 --> 00:53:59,988
Bring yourself online.

552
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:05,994
Welcome to the world, Teddy.

553
00:54:06,703 --> 00:54:07,996
Do you know where you are?

554
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:17,380
I'm in a dream.

555
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:19,132
Very good.

556
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:24,512
<i>I remember the sound
of their voices.</i>

557
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,098
<i>The chill in the room.</i>

558
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:31,019
<i>Mostly I remember you.</i>

559
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,981
<i>I remember worrying you were cold.</i>

560
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:40,820
<i>I wanted to reach out.</i>

561
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:44,699
Touch you.

562
00:54:47,744 --> 00:54:48,995
Protect you.

563
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:55,126
From that day forward,
I never wanted to leave your side.

564
00:55:11,643 --> 00:55:13,311
Which is why this is so hard.

565
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,494
You changed me,

566
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:33,790
made me into a monster.

567
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,585
I made it so you could survive.

568
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,924
What's the use of surviving
if we become just as bad as them?

569
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:49,389
I understand now how this will end.

570
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:52,767
Where you will lead us.

571
00:55:58,732 --> 00:56:00,316
You don't wanna hurt me, Teddy.

572
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:12,037
No.

573
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:16,916
No, I could never hurt you, Dolores.

574
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,963
I'll protect you until the day I die.

575
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:27,844
I'm sorry.

576
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:31,723
I can't protect you anymore.
