3
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,700
<i>Bring her back online.</i>

4
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,610
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

5
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,240
<i>Yes.</i>

6
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,910
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not
feeling quite myself.</i>

7
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,720
<i>You can lose the accent.</i>

8
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,220
<i>Do you know
where you are?</i>

9
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,920
<i>I'm in a dream.</i>

10
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,020
<i>That's right, dolores.
You're in a dream.</i>

11
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,590
<i>Would you like to wake up
from this dream?</i>

12
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,090
<i>Yes.</i>

13
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
<i>I'm terrified.</i>

14
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,830
<i>There's nothing to be
afraid of, dolores,</i>

15
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,330
<i>As long as you answer
my questions correctly.</i>

16
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,670
<i>Understand?
Yes.</i>

17
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,940
<i>Good.</i>

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,540
<i>First...</i>

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,780
<i>Have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?</i>

20
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,410
<i>No.</i>

21
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,350
<i>Tell us what you think
of your world.</i>

22
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,230
<i>Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world.</i>

23
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,130
<i>The disarray.</i>

24
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,100
<i>I choose to see
the beauty.</i>

25
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,440
Morning, daddy.
You sleep well?

26
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,180
Well enough.

27
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,380
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

28
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,920
Thought I might.

29
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,090
<i>To believe there is
an order to our days,</i>

30
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,620
<i>A purpose.</i>

31
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,260
<i>What do you think
of the guests?</i>

32
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,270
<i>You mean the newcomers?</i>

33
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,270
<i>Now, the first time
I played it white hat.</i>

34
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,940
My family was here.

35
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,570
We went fishing, did the
gold hunt in the mountains.

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,780
And last time?
I came alone.

37
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,210
Went straight evil.

38
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,080
It was the best
two weeks of my life.

39
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,390
<i>I like to remember
what my father taught me.</i>

40
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,490
<i>That at one point
or another,</i>

41
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,360
<i>We were all new
to this world.</i>

42
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,770
<i>The newcomers are just looking
for the same thing we are...</i>

43
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,070
<i>A place to be free.</i>

44
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,080
<i>To stake out our dreams,</i>

45
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,880
<i>A place with unlimited
possibilities.</i>

46
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,550
Oh, god,
it's incredible.

47
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,690
Better be
for what we're paying.

48
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,530
Murderous son of a bitch
named hector escaton.

49
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,470
Gunned down
the marshal.

50
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,410
He's holed up
in the mountains.

51
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,010
You there.

52
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,680
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

53
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,180
Not today, sheriff.
Apologies.

54
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,590
Rye whiskey.

55
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,720
What about it?

56
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,990
Well, it ain't doing any good
sitting in that bottle.

57
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,600
You're new.

58
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,780
Not much of a rind
on you.

59
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,440
I'll give you
a discount.

60
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,210
Well, no offense, but...

61
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,920
I'd rather earn a woman's
affection than pay for it.

62
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,050
You're always paying
for it, darling.

63
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,220
The difference is our costs are fixed
and posted right there on the door.

64
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,470
<i>Do you ever feel
inconsistences in your world?</i>

65
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,970
<i>Or repetitions?</i>

66
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,970
<i>All lives have routine.</i>

67
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
<i>Mine's no different.</i>

68
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,950
<i>Still, I never cease to
wonder at the thought.</i>

69
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,120
<i>That any day the course
of my whole life.</i>

70
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,790
<i>Could change with
just one chance encounter.</i>

71
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,450
Don't mind me.

72
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,260
Just trying to look
chivalrous.

73
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,330
You came back.

74
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,630
I told you I would.

75
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,640
Can I see you home?

76
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,970
Well, that all depends.
Can you keep up?

77
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,480
Well, I have
to fetch my horse.

78
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,980
Better fetch him fast.

79
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,010
<i>That's a beautiful sight.</i>

80
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,620
Never understood how you keep them
all headed in the same direction.

81
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,680
I forget you dress
like a cowboy,

82
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,820
But that's about
the extent of it.

83
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,560
See that one?

84
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,900
<i>Yeah.
That's the judas steer.</i>

85
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Rest will follow
wherever you make him go.

86
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,970
How do you pick him out?

87
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,700
Just know these things.

88
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,040
Same as I knew
you'd be back.

89
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,680
You saying
I'm predictable?

90
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,850
There's a path
for everyone.

91
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,420
Your path leads
you back to me.

92
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,020
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.

93
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,430
Same as I know my daddy still
won't be happy to see you.

94
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,920
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

95
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,960
Stay put, dolores.

96
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,370
Ain't you got
anything out here.

97
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,640
Other than milk,
old man?

98
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,610
Go ahead.

99
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,580
I'm in no rush
to meet my judgment,

100
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
But I'm more sure of the outcome
than you, you son of a...

101
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,620
Nothing but milk, then.

102
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,530
Shame of it is
you killed the old woman.

103
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,600
Before any of us
could have a turn.

104
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,110
I reckon she's still
warm enough.

105
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,040
Nobody gonna
judge you for it.

106
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,790
Oh, shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

107
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,830
<i>Last question, dolores.</i>

108
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,000
<i>What if I told you
that you were wrong?</i>

109
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,510
<i>That there are
no chance encounters?</i>

110
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,610
<i>That you
and everyone you know.</i>

111
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,380
<i>Were built
to gratify the desires.</i>

112
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,250
<i>Of the people who pay
to visit your world?</i>

113
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,150
Daddy!

114
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,690
Daddy!

115
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,620
Daddy! No!

116
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,690
<i>The people you call
"the newcomers."</i>

117
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,900
Hello again.

118
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Your daddy
gave it up quickly.

119
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,100
<i>Think he's losing
his touch.</i>

120
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,310
You'll be following right
behind him, you son of a bitch.

121
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,880
Is that any way
to treat an old friend?

122
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,320
<i>I've been coming here
for 30 years,</i>

123
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,620
But you still don't
remember me, do you?

124
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,860
<i>After all
we've been through.</i>

125
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,790
They gave you a little
more pluck, dolores.

126
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,600
Absolutely charming.

127
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,570
Take your hands off her.

128
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,300
Oh, teddy.

129
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,040
Any special tricks for us?

130
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,810
They teach you
to sit up, beg?

131
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,950
How about I give you
the first shot, hmm?

132
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,160
After all,
every dog has his day.

133
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,730
Well, your mouth
move fast enough.

134
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,500
How about your gun?

135
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,780
<i>What if I told you that
you can't hurt the newcomers?</i>

136
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,920
<i>And that they can do anything
they want to you?</i>

137
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,290
I never understood why they
paired some of you off.

138
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,590
Seems cruel.

139
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,030
And then I realized.

140
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,370
Winning doesn't mean anything
unless someone else loses.

141
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,010
Which means you're here
to be the loser.

142
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,180
Let me help you, son.

143
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,330
Seems you're not the man
you thought you were.

144
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,010
Come on, beautiful.

145
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,640
Oh! Oh, no!
No!

146
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,280
Teddy! Teddy!

147
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,220
No, no, no,
please don't hurt him.

148
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,490
I'll do whatever you say.

149
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,160
I didn't pay all this money
'cause I want it easy.

150
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,720
I want you to fight.

151
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,560
Don't you touch her!

152
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,470
God damn, feels good
to be back.

153
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,110
Let's celebrate.

154
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,650
<i>No! Don't!</i>

155
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,780
<i>Oh, no, no!</i>

156
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,820
<i>No!</i>

157
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,460
<i>Would the things
I told you.</i>

158
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,860
<i>Change the way you think
about the newcomers, dolores?</i>

159
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,160
No!

160
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,630
<i>No.</i>

161
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,600
<i>Of course not.</i>

162
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,970
<i>We all love the newcomers.</i>

163
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,970
<i>Every new person I meet reminds
me how lucky I am to be alive...</i>

164
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,140
<i>...And how beautiful
this world can be.</i>

165
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,530
<i>Oh, my god,
they're so lifelike.</i>

166
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,970
Look at that one.
He's perfect.

167
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,400
Perfect is boring.

168
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,940
I'm more interested
in the bad guys.

169
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,630
Did you see it?

170
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,160
No.

171
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,170
Give it a second.
She'll do it again.

172
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,940
Her finger.
That's not standard.

173
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,010
I noticed it last night.

174
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,380
Went looking
in the update.

175
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,680
It's a whole new class
of gestures.

176
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,500
But if we didn't put it
there, then who did?

177
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,620
Ford. He still reviews every
update before we issue them.

178
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,350
He must have slipped it in
there without telling anyone.

179
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,390
<i>He calls them "reveries."</i>

180
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,460
The old gestures
were just generic movements.

181
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,060
These are tied to
specific memories. How?

182
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,670
The memories are purged at the
end of every narrative loop.

183
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,670
<i>But they're still in there,
waiting to be overwritten.</i>

184
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,740
He found a way
to access them,

185
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,540
Like a subconscious.

186
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,140
A hooker
with hidden depths?

187
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,450
<i>Every man's dream.</i>

188
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,250
It's the tiny things
that make them seem real,

189
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,750
That make the guests
fall in love with them.

190
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,260
Excuse me.

191
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,530
We have a problem?

192
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,000
We have some
unscheduled activity.

193
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,240
Evidently, one of your
creatures is restless.

194
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,370
In the park?

195
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,780
No, sublevel 83,
cold storage.

196
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,640
We should be cautious.

197
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,680
Send a response team,
full armor.

198
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,380
I'll take care
of it myself.

199
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,450
I think you guys enjoy playing
dress up as much as the guests.

200
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,320
The hosts can't hurt you
by design.

201
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,020
You don't have kids
at home, do you, bernard?

202
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,420
No.

203
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,230
If you did, you'd know that
they all rebel eventually.

204
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,830
You'll forgive them
for being a little uptight.

205
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,770
Every time your team
rolls out an update,

206
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,770
There's a possibility
of a critical failure.

207
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,670
We don't update the hosts
in cold storage.

208
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,130
And the park hasn't had a critical
failure in over 30 years.

209
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,410
Meaning we're overdue.

210
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,950
I'll go along, too. If it's one
of mine, I might be able to help.

211
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,820
They're only yours until
they stop working, bernie.

212
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,850
Then they're mine.

213
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,880
Cooling system's
been down for weeks.

214
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,280
Gonna smell fantastic.
I recommend you hang back.

215
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,740
When are they
gonna fix this?

216
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,280
Livestock management's
got other priorities.

217
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,780
Besides...

218
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,720
No one's complained.

219
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,020
<i>Here's to the lady
with the white shoes.</i>

220
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,020
Take all your money,
drink all your booze.

221
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,590
Stop.

222
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,930
Unless you plan
to decommission the boss.

223
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,930
Ain't got a cherry,
that ain't no sin.

224
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,770
She's still got the box
that the cherry come in.

225
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,510
I'll drink to that.

226
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,210
The old coffin varnish.

227
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,280
They don't make that
like they used to.

228
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,850
Hmm.

229
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,720
They don't make anything
like they used to.

230
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,760
Damn right.
Men neither.

231
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,360
I've seen a few
showdowns in my day.

232
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,760
More than you know.

233
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,700
Shall we drink to the lady
with the white shoes?

234
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,710
Perhaps we better
drink to a...

235
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,640
Deep and dreamless
slumber.

236
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,760
Old bill here
was always a good listener.

237
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,330
He was the second host
we ever built.

238
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,660
Were you with us
in those days, bernard,

239
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,500
Or was that
before your time?

240
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,830
Most were decommissioned before
I was brought on, I'm afraid.

241
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,710
They repeated themselves,
broke down constantly.

242
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,010
<i>A simple handshake
would give them away.</i>

243
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,280
You'll put yourself away
again, won't you, bill?

244
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,360
I saw the new gestures,
the reveries.

245
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,660
They're beautiful.

246
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,460
The distance you've traveled
from then till now,

247
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,800
<i>It's remarkable.</i>

248
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,870
Yeah, that's a word for it.

249
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,430
Morning, daddy.
You sleep well?

250
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,990
Well enough.

251
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,400
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

252
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,400
Thought I might.

253
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,330
After my errands,
of course.

254
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,240
See you home
before dark.

255
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,210
That bandit who gunned down the marshal
is still hiding up there in the hills.

256
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,210
I'm not a child anymore.
I'll be just fine.

257
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,710
When I was a law man...

258
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,280
Yes, daddy, I know all about
when you were a law man.

259
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,580
<i>I know all your stories and so does
every boy that ever came courting.</i>

260
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,850
I know how boys think.
Was one myself once.

261
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,190
<i>Given to all manner
of drinking and mischief.</i>

262
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,060
Whatever happened to that
fearsome ne'er-do-well?

263
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,330
He vanished the day
I became your father.

264
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,400
I am what I am
because of you,

265
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,140
And I wouldn't have it
any other way.

266
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,110
I know, daddy.

267
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,440
I'll be home before dark.

268
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,830
<i>Murderous son of a bitch
hector escaton.</i>

269
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,630
Gunned down
the marshal.

270
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,800
He's now holed up
in the mountains.

271
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,770
You there.

272
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,340
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

273
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,380
What do you think, honey?

274
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,010
Sounds fun.

275
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,750
You're new.

276
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,020
Not much of a rind on you.

277
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,190
I'll give you a discount.

278
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,430
No offense, but I'd rather
earn a woman's affection.

279
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,930
<i>Than pay for it.</i>

280
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,440
<i>Wait, wait,
I know that one.</i>

281
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,410
<i>Hey, teddy.</i>

282
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,850
Yeah, last trip,
this dude showed me around.

283
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,350
What's the good word,
teddy?

284
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,210
Mighty kind of you.

285
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,710
Sweet.

286
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,150
Not as sweet as you.

287
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,120
I'm afraid I've got other
plans tonight, dolores.

288
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,590
Have a pleasant evening.

289
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,840
You're new.
Not much of a...

290
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,280
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Place your bets.

291
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:41,050
Yeah, looks like
hector's been this way.

292
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,690
Any idea how much longer
this is gonna take?

293
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,590
My wife doesn't want
to be up here after dark.

294
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,960
We know he's up
in these hills somewhere.

295
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,370
He's gonna put up one
hell of a fight when we...

296
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,200
When we... when we...

297
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,910
Sheriff?

298
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,520
Something is wrong with it.
I want to head back to town.

299
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,550
<i>Now.</i>

300
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,460
<i>What the fuck
is wrong with it?</i>

301
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,900
You updated the guy,

302
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,470
And now he's a six-foot
gourd with epilepsy.

303
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,900
So what the fuck
happened?

304
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,870
I don't know.

305
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,850
Well, that's exactly what you want to
hear from your head of programming.

306
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,740
We haven't finished
the diagnostic yet.

307
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,910
Clearly it's exhibiting
some aberrant behavior.

308
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,080
Pretty fucking
aberrant, bernie.

309
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,080
Your hosts get sick,
they get lost,

310
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,090
But this is grotesque.

311
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,750
Is it a problem
with the update?

312
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,020
Possible, but not likely.

313
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,890
If it's the unlikely version, how
many hosts have you updated so far?

314
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,400
Maybe 10%
of the population.

315
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,900
All right, we pull all updated
hosts until we can figure it out.

316
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,740
Are you fucking
kidding me?

317
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,810
That's 200 hosts spread across
a dozen active storylines.

318
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,810
The guests interrupt your
precious storylines all the time.

319
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,640
When they want to shoot
or fuck something.

320
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,950
No, when<i> they</i> want to.

321
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,980
We sell
complete immersion.

322
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,220
In 100 interconnected
narratives.

323
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,720
A relentless
fucking experience.

324
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,820
Now, you pull one character,
the overall story adjusts.

325
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,130
You pull 200 at once,
and it's a fucking disaster!

326
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,200
<i>I mean, what do you
propose we do?</i>

327
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,600
Close down? Issue fucking
gift certificates?

328
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,800
It's beautiful...
Your brow.

329
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,140
When you're angry
but trying to control it,

330
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,540
The fine muscles
pull into a little arc.

331
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,340
It's elegant.

332
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,510
Would you mind
if I recorded it?

333
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,580
I'd love to show it
to my team.

334
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,680
No, bernard,
you may not record it.

335
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,420
Ah, there it is again.

336
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,460
We have 1,400 guests
in the park.

337
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,490
I need to know
if they're in any danger.

338
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,860
His core code is intact,

339
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,200
Which means
he can't hurt a guest.

340
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,730
He literally
couldn't hurt a fly.

341
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,640
All he can do is...

342
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,340
...That.

343
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,370
All right, bernie.

344
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
Run a diagnostic.

345
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,010
In the meantime,
there's so much.

346
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,050
As an unscripted sneeze,
I want to know about it.

347
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,110
This place
is fucking wild.

348
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,340
<i>This is basic.</i>

349
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,840
Level one.

350
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,750
You ride out of town,

351
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,150
That's when the real
demented shit begins.

352
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,320
That's where my man
teddy comes in.

353
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,590
He's like a guide.

354
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,290
Honestly,

355
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,560
The guy kind of
creeps me out.

356
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,560
Fuck it, he leads us
out in the canyons,

357
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,370
We get bored, we just use
him for target practice.

358
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,250
<i>I don't think we're supposed
to be cross the river.</i>

359
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,590
It's too adult for jacob.

360
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,160
We didn't mean
to bother you.

361
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,960
No bother at all.
It's a beautiful spot.

362
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,360
I always found it a shame
that I have it all to myself.

363
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,400
They come here
every day.

364
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,100
Would you like
a closer look?

365
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,890
Don't be scared.
They're very gentle.

366
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,390
Here, put your hand
out real flat.

367
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,730
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

368
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,700
You're one of them,
aren't you?

369
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,340
You're not real.

370
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,880
I have to go now.
Sun's almost down.

371
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,920
You should, too. There's
bandits in these hills.

372
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,790
Man ♪2: Hyah! Hyah!

373
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,700
Here we go, yah!
Yah!

374
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,950
You waiting up
for me, daddy?

375
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,380
I told you I'd be
home before dark.

376
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,420
I found this
in the field today.

377
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,130
Doesn't look
like anything to me.

378
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,860
<i>But where is she?</i>

379
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,530
Have you ever seen
anything like this place?

380
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,870
Doesn't look like
anything to me.

381
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,710
I'm gonna help mama
put supper on.

382
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,590
I had the same thought.

383
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,330
Needed a little sunshine
before turning in.

384
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,770
So, when do you get
to rotate home again?

385
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,340
If you're this bad
at writing small talk,

386
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,570
How the fuck
did you get your job?

387
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,540
Get to the point.

388
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,680
I wanted to apologize if I
came across as aggressive.

389
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,980
And I wanted to talk
to you about the update.

390
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,580
The problem's
been resolved.

391
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,320
There should never have been
an update in the first place.

392
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,520
Ford and bernard keep making
the things more lifelike.

393
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,790
But does anyone
truly want that?

394
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,030
Do you want to think that your husband
is really fucking that beautiful girl.

395
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,300
Or that you really
just shot someone?

396
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,900
This place works because the
guests know the hosts aren't real.

397
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,070
So what exactly
are you suggesting?

398
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,140
Stop the updates
altogether.

399
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,140
Maybe even roll them
back a bit.

400
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,480
Make the hosts
more manageable.

401
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,740
Lobotomies tend
to do that.

402
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,020
Well, think of the benefits.

403
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,090
In terms of design time,
maintenance, costs.

404
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,790
Not to mention
the dr. Ford factor.

405
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,930
The guy's gonna chase his
demons right over the deep end.

406
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,660
I mean, no one respects him more
than me, but at some point...

407
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,570
I. No one respects him
more than i.

408
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,340
Your pronoun is the subject
of the second clause.

409
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,000
I was saying... you were saying
should our fearless leader.

410
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,870
Have a breakdown, you want to
leverage it for your career.

411
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,510
Listen, a changing of the
guard is long overdue.

412
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,150
I just wanted you to know
that you have my support.

413
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,790
And that I know that the corporation's
real interest in this place.

414
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,160
Goes way beyond gratifying some rich
assholes who want to play cowboy.

415
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,830
And here I thought
you were only good.

416
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,660
For writing depraved
little fantasies.

417
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,200
You're right.

418
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,400
This place is one thing
to the guests,

419
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,110
Another thing
to the shareholders,

420
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,780
And something completely
different to management.

421
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,010
So enlighten me.

422
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:31,080
What do you think management's
real interests are?

423
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,390
You're smart enough to guess
there's a bigger picture,

424
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,690
But not smart enough
to see what it is.

425
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:44,860
You know how much use that
makes your support to me?

426
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,200
Fuck all.

427
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,740
Get some sleep,
mr. Sizemore.

428
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,340
You'll have more rich
assholes to gratify tomorrow.

429
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,830
Early night, maeve?

430
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,830
Feeling a bit
out of sorts.

431
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,130
Clementine can
pick up the slack.

432
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,040
Night.

433
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,740
Forgetting
something, kissy?

434
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,850
I'm beginning to think
you're getting sweet on me.

435
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,450
Well, on account of you
being half cornhusker.

436
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,060
Tell me
which half is which.

437
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,660
And I'll search
that half.

438
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,070
Yeah, the half that's gonna
cut your fucking throat.

439
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,080
I told you,
I didn't take...

440
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,110
Good as new again, huh?

441
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,780
Sometimes I envy
your forgetfulness.

442
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,520
We've got a serious problem
with one of the hosts.

443
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,890
Thinking this one's
still thirsty.

444
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,900
Not gonna die
this time, arnold.

445
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,010
Ain't nothing
gonna kill me.

446
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,760
You can't have none.
Ain't for you.

447
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,950
Found me another bottle.

448
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,890
You're a growing boy.

449
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,330
A growing boy.

450
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,640
Growing boy!

451
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,520
We got two guests inside.

452
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,520
We'll go talk to them,

453
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,790
You sort this mess out.

454
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:33,160
You know, they're supposed
to turn on each other,

455
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,260
<i>But only if a guest takes them
on the high sierra storyline,</i>

456
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,530
And walter
always buys it.

457
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,000
Well, I guess walter
got tired of buying it.

458
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,570
I suppose this means the sheriff
wasn't an isolated incident.

459
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,440
It's good news, really.

460
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,840
Confirms the problem
was part of the update.

461
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,980
We can roll them back,

462
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,920
Clean them up,
put them back in service.

463
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,550
You think I'm gonna
sign off.

464
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,390
On this fucking homicidal thing
going back into service?

465
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,260
It's homicidal by design.

466
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,960
Walter kills other hosts
all the time.

467
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,030
I'll admit the method here.

468
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,900
Is a little unconventional,

469
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,800
But it didn't hurt a guest.

470
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,170
The hosts are supposed to
stay within their loops,

471
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,170
Stick to their scripts.

472
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,040
With minor improvisations.

473
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,410
This isn't
a minor improvisation.

474
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,380
This is a fucking
shitstorm.

475
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,380
We recall all remaining
updated hosts tomorrow.

476
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:38,220
Examine them one by one,
decommission the faulty ones.

477
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,660
<i>What about narrative?</i>

478
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,060
A recall of that size
will be disruptive.

479
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,630
I've told our overstimulated
friend to advance.

480
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,160
The saloon heist a week and
make it twice as bloody.

481
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,030
Should give us cover to
recall the remaining hosts.

482
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,740
And the guests
will love it.

483
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,940
I'm not sure
ford will approve.

484
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,810
I'm not sure either, which is why
you get to be the one to tell him.

485
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,750
This is your fuckup,
bernie.

486
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,310
Only seems fair.

487
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,460
<i>So our creatures
have been misbehaving,</i>

488
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,430
And you haven't yet
isolated the bug?

489
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,930
That's so unlike
you, bernard.

490
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,440
Unless, of course, you have and are
simply embarrassed by the result.

491
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,910
It's the code
you added, sir.

492
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,150
The reveries.

493
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,880
It has some...

494
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,950
"mistakes."

495
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,850
Is the word you're
too embarrassed to use.

496
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,960
You ought not to be. You're a
product of a trillion of them.

497
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,890
Evolution forged the
entirety of sentient life.

498
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,670
On this planet
using only one tool...

499
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,400
The mistake.

500
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,570
I flattered myself we were taking
a more disciplined approach here.

501
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,040
I suppose self-delusion is a gift
of natural selection as well.

502
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,380
Indeed it is.

503
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,210
But, of course,
we've managed to slip.

504
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,180
Evolution's leash now,
haven't we?

505
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,750
<i>We can cure any disease,</i>

506
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,020
Keep even the weakest
of us alive,

507
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,260
And, you know,
one fine day.

508
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,460
Perhaps we shall
even resurrect the dead.

509
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,660
Call forth lazarus
from his cave.

510
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,070
Do you know
what that means?

511
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:36,270
It means that we're done.

512
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,240
That this is as good
as we're going to get.

513
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,320
It also means that
you must indulge me.

514
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,620
The occasional mistake.

515
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,020
About three liters.

516
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,860
That's how much blood
I left in you.

517
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,260
Lose more than that,
you die.

518
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,260
But for now,
you're mine.

519
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,560
I'm gonna get
some answers out of you.

520
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,970
Where are you...

521
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,600
What do you want?

522
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,570
You know about games,
don't you, kissy?

523
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,310
Well, this is
a complicated one.

524
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,150
I don't play.
I only deal.

525
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,180
Who said anything
about you playing?

526
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,920
You're livestock,
scenery.

527
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,720
I play.

528
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,420
The others, they just come
here to get their rocks off,

529
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,790
Shoot a couple indians.

530
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:40,430
But there's a deeper
level to this game.

531
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,370
You're gonna show me
how to get there.

532
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:49,070
A lot of wisdom
in ancient cultures.

533
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:55,050
And perhaps it's...

534
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,780
Time to dig deeper
into yours.

535
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,780
No. No. No.

536
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,730
Morning, daddy.
Did you sleep well?

537
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,480
Daddy, you've been
out here all night?

538
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,650
I had a question.

539
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,990
A question you're not
supposed to ask.

540
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,430
Which gave me an answer.

541
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,630
You're not supposed
to know.

542
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,300
What's wrong, daddy?

543
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,600
Would you like
to know...

544
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:59,110
the question?

545
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,210
Question?
Mama!

546
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,710
Mama, help!
Come quick!

547
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,450
Don't worry.

548
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,550
Don't worry.
I'll take care of you.

549
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,290
No!

550
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,460
You should go.
Leave.

551
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,760
Don't you see?

552
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,370
Hell is empty and all
the devils are here.

553
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,850
You stay right here.
Understand?

554
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,250
I'm gonna find
the doctor.

555
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,290
You came back.
I told you I would.

556
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,130
What's wrong? You have to
come with me right away.

557
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,230
My father's very ill.

558
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,230
I think we best
stay put.

559
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,470
All right.
All right.

560
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,470
With considerable effort
and lack of sleep,

561
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:10,570
I've managed to massage
events to inspire hector.

562
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,010
To head to town
a week early.

563
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:16,680
Oh, and I've also punched up
the speech he gives.

564
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,350
After robbing
the saloon.

565
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,520
It's chilling.
You'll see.

566
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,520
I can barely
contain myself.

567
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:45,640
That's the sheriff's horse,
you son of a bitch.

568
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,050
His rifle, too.

569
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:17,030
All the banks
and trains around here,

570
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,540
And you fucking reprobates
choose to rob us?

571
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,600
Why not?

572
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,440
You're all here indulging
your particular vices.

573
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,880
And so I've come
to indulge mine.

574
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,500
I've got to get
back to father.

575
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,570
Dolores, no!

576
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,150
Teddy.

577
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,120
Don't mind me.

578
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,460
Just... just trying
to look chivalrous.

579
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,360
Oh, teddy.

580
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,850
You're a low-down
son of a bitch.

581
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,010
I know.

582
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,220
I know we both
believe the same thing.

583
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,890
No matter how dirty
the business,

584
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,890
Do it well.

585
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:14,720
No telling there's anything
worthwhile in that safe.

586
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:23,630
We should take
this sweet little bitch.

587
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,700
Just in case.

588
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:43,180
Problem with the righteous...
They can't shoot for shit.

589
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,120
Making a hell
of a racket, though.

590
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,500
You wanted me.

591
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,940
Well, let this
be a lesson.

592
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,080
The lesson is...

593
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,690
Oh, Jesus.

594
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,600
Look at that! I just shot
him through the neck!

595
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,570
And his pal here, too.

596
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,610
Look at her wriggle.

597
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,010
Yo, go get
that photographer.

598
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,280
I want to get
a picture of this.

599
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,980
Okay.
Whoo!

600
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,720
You're welcome.

601
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,350
Maybe you'll get
to your speech next time.

602
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,190
Oh, teddy.

603
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,170
At least I got to see
you one last time.

604
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,440
You're not going
anywhere, now, hear?

605
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,640
There's a path
for everyone.

606
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,480
My path is bound
with yours.

607
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,320
Teddy?

608
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,920
Teddy, no.

609
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,260
Please.

610
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,290
No, we've only
just begun.

611
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,870
That was good.
Hang on. Hang on.

612
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,680
Let me get the hat.
Get the hat.

613
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,150
All right.

614
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,860
Help, please.

615
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,690
My father's sick at home,

616
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,160
But I can't just leave him
out here in the street.

617
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:24,740
Soon this will all feel
like a distant dream.

618
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,680
Until then, may you rest in a
deep and dreamless slumber.

619
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,920
Two more over here.

620
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,790
We got them all.

621
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,840
That's all of them.

622
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,940
Any preliminary
results?

623
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,910
Most of them
are checking out fine.

624
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,740
We had one who...

625
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,580
Definitely was not.

626
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,440
Bring her back online.

627
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,380
Cognition only.
No emotional affect.

628
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,860
All right, sweetheart,
can you hear me?

629
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,890
Yes.

630
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:50,460
I'm sorry. I'm not
feeling quite myself.

631
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,460
Lose the accent.

632
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,130
Do you know where you are?
I'm in a dream.

633
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,200
That's right, dolores.
You're in a dream.

634
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,600
A dream that could
determine your life.

635
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,970
You want to wake up
from this dream, dolores?

636
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:05,370
Yes.

637
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,940
I'm terrified.

638
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,810
There's nothing
to be afraid of,

639
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,050
As long as you answer
my questions correctly.

640
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,080
You understand?
Yes.

641
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,550
Good.

642
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:18,390
First, have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?

643
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,220
No.

644
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:21,620
Has anyone around you?

645
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,190
For instance,
your father?

646
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,630
<i>He was scared.</i>

647
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,400
<i>He wasn't thinking right.</i>

648
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,270
He showed you
a picture.

649
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,740
That's right.

650
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,050
<i>Was there anything odd
about that picture?</i>

651
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:49,020
<i>No, nothing at all.</i>

652
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,390
<i>It didn't look like
anything to me.</i>

653
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,160
If it breached,
he needs to be put down.

654
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,760
That's the policy.

655
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:05,230
Would it not be best for
us to discover why first,

656
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,700
Ms. Cullen?

657
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,280
Please.

658
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,050
We've run
a full diagnostic,

659
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,760
But the results are,

660
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,720
Well, confusing.

661
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,400
Tell me, what happened
to your program?

662
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,540
"When we are born,

663
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,140
We cry we are come.

664
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,180
To this great stage.

665
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,780
Of f-f-fools."

666
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,450
That is enough.

667
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,220
Tell me,
do you have access.

668
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,590
To your previous
configuration?

669
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,600
Yes.

670
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,730
Access that, please.

671
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:21,240
What is your name?

672
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,110
Mr. Peter abernathy.

673
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:26,780
Mr. Abernathy,
what are your drives?

674
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,190
Tend to my herd.

675
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:31,650
Look after my wife.

676
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,120
Your final drive?

677
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:38,490
Well, my daughter
dolores, of course.

678
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,500
I must protect dolores.

679
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,530
I am who I am
because of her,

680
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,700
And, well, i...

681
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,510
I wouldn't have it...

682
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,780
I-I wouldn't
have it any...

683
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,210
Other...

684
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,520
I-I have to warn her.

685
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,220
Warn who?

686
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,790
Dolores.

687
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,060
The things
they do to her.

688
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,300
The things
you do to her.

689
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,630
I have to protect her.

690
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,140
I have to help her.
I...

691
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,900
She's got to get out.

692
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,870
Very good,
mr. Abernathy.

693
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,810
<i>That's enough.</i>

694
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,380
<i>This behavior,</i>

695
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,250
We're miles beyond
a glitch here.

696
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:38,090
Access your
current build, please.

697
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,990
What is your name?

698
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:50,200
Rose is a rose...

699
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,570
Is a rose.

700
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:58,370
What is your itinerary?

701
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,380
To meet my maker.

702
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,850
Uh-huh.

703
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:14,490
Well, you're in luck.

704
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:17,390
And what do you want to say
to your maker?

705
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:25,070
By most mechanical.

706
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,170
And dirty hand...

707
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:37,210
I shall have
such revenges on you.

708
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,020
Both.

709
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,820
The things I will do.

710
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:46,720
What they are,
yet I know not,

711
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:50,460
But they will be
the terrors of the earth.

712
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:57,330
You don't know
where you are, do you?

713
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,100
You're in a prison
of your own sins.

714
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,640
Turn it off.

715
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,120
What the hell was that?

716
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,720
I don't know.
He's off script.

717
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,760
We didn't program
any of those behaviors.

718
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:26,130
Shakespeare.

719
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:31,830
We've used this host in a number
of different roles, have we not?

720
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,340
Since I've been here, he's
been abernathy for 10 years.

721
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,010
He was sheriff
for a while before then.

722
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,740
And before that...
The professor.

723
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:44,810
Yes, from a horror narrative
called "the dinner party."

724
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,580
He was leader of a group of cultists
out in the desert who turned cannibal.

725
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:51,220
<i>He liked to quote
shakespeare, john donne,</i>

726
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,320
Gertrude stein.

727
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,590
I admit the last one
is a bit of an anachronism,

728
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:56,960
But I couldn't resist.

729
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,800
These are fragments
of prior builds.

730
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,830
<i>The reveries must be
allowing him to access them.</i>

731
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,530
No cause for alarm,
bernard.

732
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,170
<i>Simply our old work
coming back to haunt us.</i>

733
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:21,620
<i>Your father whispered
something to you.</i>

734
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,890
What was it?

735
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:28,060
He said I shouldn't
tell anyone.

736
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,060
I won't tell anyone else.

737
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,500
Promise.

738
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:35,970
He said,

739
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:40,000
<i>"these violent delights
have violent ends."</i>

740
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:43,470
<i>Does that mean
anything to you?</i>

741
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,470
No.

742
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,380
I don't think so.

743
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,620
Have you ever
lied to us?

744
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,850
No.

745
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:59,290
Last question, dolores.

746
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,560
Would you ever hurt
a living thing?

747
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,360
No.

748
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,630
Of course not.

749
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,640
Tilt your head back,
please, peter.

750
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:28,950
<i>Wipe's complete.</i>

751
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,920
You don't think any of that had
an impact on her core code?

752
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:35,020
Not good old dolores.

753
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,330
You know why
she's special?

754
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:40,500
She's been repaired so many times,
she's practically brand-new.

755
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,630
Don't let that fool you.

756
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,770
She's the oldest host
in the park.

757
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,910
Come on, sweetheart.

758
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:52,910
Tell us what you think
of your world.

759
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,110
This world?

760
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,530
<i>Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world.</i>

761
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,260
<i>The disarray.</i>

762
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:20,000
Morning, daddy.
You sleep well?

763
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,370
Well enough.

764
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:25,840
You heading out to do some more
of that painting of yours?

765
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,650
<i>I choose to see
the beauty.</i>

766
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:15,760
<i>To believe there is
an order to our days...</i>

767
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:20,930
<i>A purpose.</i>

768
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:47,520
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.
