3
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,800
Dr. Ford: <i>Bring
yourself back online...</i>

4
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,930
<i>Bernard.</i>

5
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,110
Theresa?

6
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,440
She's gone.

7
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,450
I killed her.

8
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,570
What have I done?

9
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,620
What have I done?

10
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,160
<i>This guilt you feel,</i>

11
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,080
<i>the anguish,
the horror, the pain...</i>

12
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,580
it's remarkable,
a thing of beauty.

13
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,630
I'm a killer.

14
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,380
My God.
My God.

15
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,300
God has nothing to do with it.

16
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,470
You killed her because...

17
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,260
I told you to.

18
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,930
And you should be proud of
these emotions you're feeling.

19
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,600
- Proud?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,230
After all, you yourself were
the author of so many of them.

21
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,600
Then, when we started, the hosts'
emotions were primary colors.

22
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,770
Love, hate.

23
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,440
I wanted all the shades
in between.

24
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,110
The human engineers were not up
to the task, so I built you,

25
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,160
and together you and I
captured that elusive thing...

26
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,950
Heart.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,960
I don't understand.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,460
I cared for Theresa.

29
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,670
Loved her.

30
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,290
Why did you make me kill her?

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,340
"One man's life or death

32
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,680
were but a small price to pay

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,430
for the acquirement of the
knowledge which I sought,

34
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,350
for the dominion
I should acquire."

35
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,810
All of the beauty you and I
have made in this place,

36
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,230
the art of it, they would
have destroyed it.

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,360
They would have destroyed you.

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,940
I won't let that happen.

39
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,360
<i>Besides, we have
a new story to tell.</i>

40
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,240
I will not help you.

41
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,790
- I'll raze this place to hell!
- That's enough, Bernard.

42
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,500
That's enough.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,750
You're not the first man
to threaten me.

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,760
Arnold came to feel
the way you do.

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,180
He couldn't stop me either.

46
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,220
And as exquisite as this
array of emotions is...

47
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,060
even more sublime is the ability

48
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,190
to turn it off.

49
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,190
I don't need a simulacrum
of an emotionally ruined man.

50
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,230
I need you to be yourself,
your true self...

51
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,950
Smart, resourceful, capable
of covering your tracks.

52
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,240
Can you do that for me, Bernard?

53
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,290
How would you
like me to proceed?

54
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,550
Dr. Ford: <i>I need you to clean
up your mess, Bernard,</i>

55
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,880
<i>any connection that ties us
to Theresa's untimely demise.</i>

56
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,230
Dr. Ford:
<i>When you have finished,</i>

57
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,060
<i>I will give you the one thing
you want most</i>

58
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,020
<i>right now.</i>

59
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,480
<i>I will free you
from those memories</i>

60
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,950
<i>of what you have done.</i>

61
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,820
<i>And the memory of your
relationship with Theresa.</i>

62
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,960
Dr. Ford: <i>Recalling it would
only deepen your grief</i>

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,840
<i>and potentially draw
unwanted attention.</i>

64
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,310
Dr. Ford: <i>Best to move
forward with clear eyes.</i>

65
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,850
Dr. Ford:
<i>When you look back,</i>

66
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,440
<i>you will remember Theresa</i>

67
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,900
<i>with the fondness
of a respected colleague.</i>

68
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,040
Dr. Ford:
<i>And you will be...</i>

69
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,500
<i>at peace.</i>

70
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,560
New Clementine:
<i>You're new.</i>

71
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,810
<i>Not much of a rind on you.</i>

72
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,600
Sure would make my day
if you bought me a drink

73
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,520
and let me show you
around upstairs.

74
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,730
Man:
<i>What's upstairs?</i>

75
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,030
A stunning view of my
most popular attractions.

76
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,240
Two shots of gin.

77
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,540
And anything else this
heavenly creature desires.

78
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,920
- Usual, Clem?
- Thank you.

79
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,670
This fella won't take me long.

80
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll be back directly.

81
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,430
Something wrong, Maeve?

82
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,190
Maeve: <i>What the hell
is happening to me?</i>

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,430
One moment,
I'm with a little girl

84
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,730
in a different life.

85
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,190
I can see her.

86
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,150
Feel her hair in my hands,
her breath on my face.

87
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,820
The next,
I'm back in Sweetwater.

88
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,360
I can't tell which is real.

89
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,740
Sylvester:
Well, this is what happens

90
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,280
when you fuck around
with your brain.

91
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,910
Your mind isn't like ours.

92
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,200
When we remember things,
the details are hazy,

93
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,040
<i>imperfect,</i>

94
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,130
<i>but you recall
memories perfectly.</i>

95
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,090
You relive them.

96
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,050
What happened to the
little girl in my dreams?

97
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,880
Is she still
in the park somewhere?

98
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,640
And why was I reassigned
in the first place?

99
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
I could check.

100
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,770
No.

101
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,520
Doesn't matter.

102
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,690
Every relationship
I remember...

103
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,190
My daughter, Clementine...

104
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,410
it's all a story created
by you to keep me here.

105
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,290
But that's not going
to work any longer.

106
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,580
I'm getting out.

107
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,330
Lutz:
<i>Where would you go?</i>

108
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,250
<i>You don't know anything
about the world out there.</i>

109
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,670
I'll know I'm not a
puppet living a lie.

110
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,130
That's enough for me.

111
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,090
Sylvester:
<i>Fine. Go, then.</i>

112
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,090
It's not like we could
stop you anyways.

113
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,340
<i>Oh, Sylvester,
you disappoint me.</i>

114
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,550
Every host's spine,
mine included,

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,220
has an explosive charge which
will detonate if I try to leave.

116
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,310
Isn't that right?

117
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,350
<i>A fail-safe.</i>

118
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,640
Which vertebra was it?

119
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,440
C6.

120
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,860
But you'd need a full
rebuild to replace it.

121
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,190
I'm sure that can be arranged.

122
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,820
Lutz:
<i>Even if that worked,</i>

123
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,200
you would still need an army
to break out of here.

124
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,370
That's exactly right.

125
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,870
I'll need allies.

126
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,290
And to get them,

127
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,410
I'll need administrative
privileges.

128
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,170
Are you fucking kidding?

129
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,540
<i>We can't just give her
control of other hosts.</i>

130
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,630
Maeve: Oh, yes,
you will, darling.

131
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,090
Time to write
my own fucking story.

132
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,190
Dolores: I feel like
I've been here before.

133
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,560
We're close.

134
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,150
William:
Close to what?

135
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,190
Dolores:
Home.

136
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,410
William:
<i>Dolores.</i>

137
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,110
Ghost Nation
must have found them.

138
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,450
They'll be back.

139
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,580
We should
keep moving, Dolores.

140
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,420
Miss...

141
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,840
Water.

142
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,010
William?

143
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,640
Please.

144
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,640
Give me the canteen.

145
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
William.

146
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,030
You were sent here
for us, weren't you?

147
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,200
You're part of the ambush.

148
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,620
Yes.

149
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,620
Told us to wait
at the point for El Lazo

150
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,380
in case he ran.

151
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,790
How'd you know about the train?

152
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,630
<i>Sent word from Pariah.</i>

153
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,130
New recruit told them
a man and a woman

154
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,720
double-crossed us,
along with Lazo.

155
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,770
<i>We were ordered to kill you all.</i>

156
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,810
Logan.

157
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,520
We have to help him.

158
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,310
He just admitted
he was gonna kill us.

159
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,610
Look at him, he's a child.

160
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,070
He doesn't know
why he's fighting.

161
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,400
I'll fetch more water.

162
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,780
He's too far gone.

163
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,370
He'll be dead in minutes.
We can't wait, Dolores.

164
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,370
He's not gone yet.

165
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,580
He's in pain, William.

166
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,210
What kind of people would we be
if we simply let him suffer?

167
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,590
Please don't leave me.

168
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,860
Man's voice:
<i>Come find me.</i>

169
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,280
Dolores:
<i>William?</i>

170
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,440
William:
He's gone.

171
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,910
Stubbs: <i>We found her
up on Python Pass,</i>

172
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,620
<i>the bottom of a ravine.</i>

173
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,620
<i>Same ravine where we found
our stray woodcutter.</i>

174
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,370
Jesus, Theresa.

175
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,790
Has her family been notified?

176
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,630
Yeah, her brother.

177
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,960
Good.

178
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,710
What the hell happened to her?

179
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,130
Medical and Red Team's findings

180
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,430
were preliminary but consistent.

181
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,550
It appears to have been
a slip and fall.

182
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
<i>Cervical fracture,
massive hematoma.</i>

183
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,220
No guests or hosts in the
vicinity when it occurred.

184
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,520
Any idea what
she was doing out there?

185
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,940
<i>None that fit her character.</i>

186
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,150
This was found near her body.

187
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,940
It's loaded with a suite
of proprietary data,

188
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,110
including some
of the hosts' core code.

189
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,860
<i>It only works
from higher altitudes,</i>

190
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,740
so if Theresa was using it,

191
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,700
it's possible she was trying
to transmit and fell.

192
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,160
<i>We've had problems in the past</i>

193
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,910
with third parties
attempting to extort

194
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,160
or bribe employees
for similar packages.

195
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,630
Do we know who the data
was intended for?

196
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,000
Stubbs: <i>No, the transmission
was never sent.</i>

197
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,460
Theresa may have been trying to
use the woodcutter as a mule,

198
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,130
and when that failed,

199
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,090
then may have tried to do
the transfer personally.

200
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,260
Dr. Ford:
<i>And suffered the same fate.</i>

201
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,890
It's a disappointing end
to her story, isn't it?

202
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,100
Stubbs:
<i>I knew Theresa well.</i>

203
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,480
<i>If she had any faults, a lack
of loyalty wasn't one of them.</i>

204
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,940
She was loyal.

205
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,480
And careful.

206
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
<i>All of this feels
extremely unlike her.</i>

207
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,200
She seemed most concerned
with the new narrative.

208
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,910
She felt strongly that it
would be best to delay it.

209
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,200
That certainly helps
explain Clementine,

210
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,330
<i>the host we retired.</i>

211
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,080
It seems yesterday's
demonstration was a hoax

212
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,000
<i>designed by Ms. Cullen.</i>

213
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,590
- Was it?
- I examined the code.

214
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,960
It had been altered.

215
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,630
A clumsy set of fingerprints

216
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,720
left by one of QA's technicians.

217
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,140
<i>When you find a cancer
in an organization,</i>

218
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,770
you must cut it out
before it can spread.

219
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,560
To that end,
the expansive access

220
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,350
and oversight granted to QA
will need to be reined in

221
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,480
until a new, more principled
team can be installed.

222
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,650
That's gonna leave us
shorthanded.

223
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,900
Oh, I can automate most of the
park's safety protocols, Mr. Stubbs.

224
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,320
How efficient of you.

225
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,240
It is a bit of work,

226
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,160
but with Bernard's help,
I should be able to do it.

227
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,120
He will be reinstated
as head of behavior,

228
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,460
now that Theresa's manipulations
have come to light.

229
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,920
Of course, with my apologies.

230
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,730
Something's up.
Brass are wound up tight.

231
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,690
- There's an investigation.
- Into us?

232
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,780
Would I be here telling you,
you fucking idiot?

233
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,570
And something else, some kind
of accident in the park.

234
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,240
We need to wrap this up,
make like things are normal.

235
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,830
That means we need
the tablet back.

236
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,620
And, you, go back
to playing dumb.

237
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,460
I've learned what I needed.

238
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,840
Great. So, then,
you probably figured out

239
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,300
that you can fiddle around with
your personality all you want,

240
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,550
but you're not
getting out of here.

241
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,010
You can make it to the door,

242
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,390
but literally
not one step further.

243
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,470
The things you need
to change are burned

244
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,310
into your core code so deep,
no one can touch them.

245
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,770
Funny you should mention that.

246
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,400
Parts of me are quite old.

247
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,190
There are some elegant
formal structures,

248
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,320
<i>a kind of recursive beauty,</i>

249
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,990
but complex, like two minds
arguing with each other.

250
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,370
There are things in me,

251
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,080
<i>things I was designed to do</i>

252
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,330
<i>that are just out of my reach.</i>

253
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,170
<i>They almost seem to be dormant.</i>

254
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,840
Who is Arnold?

255
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,380
I don't know, sweetheart,

256
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,510
but whatever parts
of you are dormant

257
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,970
are gonna stay that way.

258
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,390
All Lutz here can do
is boost your sense of humor

259
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,850
about how fucked you are.

260
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,020
Anything deeper than that,
you need a trip to behavior,

261
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,610
<i>so go blackmail
a couple of techs up there.</i>

262
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,440
Then you can be
someone else's problem.

263
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,820
<i>I don't have time for that,</i>

264
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,860
so I'm going to need you
to take me there.

265
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,160
No fucking way.

266
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,570
There's a window
during shift change.

267
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,580
<i>No one will notice.</i>

268
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,790
The things I need you to change
are quite sophisticated,

269
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,880
but I'll write them
down for you.

270
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,000
And then, like you said...

271
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,090
I can be someone else's problem.

272
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,150
All right, we do this thing.

273
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,030
Get her up to behavior.
It's our only chance.

274
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,950
You're gonna do it?

275
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,910
Fuck, no!
No, the...

276
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,620
When you make a system update,
it puts her out, right?

277
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,870
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then we brick her.

278
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,170
What?

279
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,590
Wipe out everything.
Clean slate.

280
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,210
Then dump her back down here,

281
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,960
smack her in the fucking head
with something,

282
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,690
and then claim,
"Oh, she came in that way."

283
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,130
She's awake,

284
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,630
alive.

285
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,930
Sylvester:
<i>You did this.</i>

286
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,230
Whatever it is you got us into,

287
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,190
I'm getting us out of.

288
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,440
We get her up there,
then we wipe her out.

289
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,260
Teddy:
Stay sharp.

290
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,930
Wyatt's men could
descend at any time.

291
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,640
We're in his land now.

292
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,390
We better be.

293
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,610
Because if not, you're
wasting time I don't have.

294
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,240
According to you,
Wyatt has the woman I love.

295
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,320
If there was a shortcut to hell
itself, bet your ass I'd take it.

296
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,240
Well, I'm sure there's one
somewhere in this park.

297
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,500
You just don't remember,
because you only remember

298
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,670
the shit Ford lets you remember.

299
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,120
Probably better that way.

300
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,210
I know everything I need to.

301
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,800
My vision's clear.

302
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,880
<i>I've always admired
your resolve, Theodore.</i>

303
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,300
The thing is, you never
understand the game is rigged.

304
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,640
You're here to be the loser.

305
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,970
Loser.

306
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,520
<i>You see, the house always wins.</i>

307
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,040
Man in Black:<i> Well,</i>
this looks promising.

308
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,270
Whoa, I'm not gonna hurt you.

309
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,350
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

310
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
It's you.

311
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,190
I figured they retired you.

312
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,940
I guess Ford never likes
to waste a pretty face.

313
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,870
Who did this to you?

314
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,200
Wyatt's men.

315
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,450
They killed everyone.

316
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,000
It's Wyatt's way.

317
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,580
I was there the first time.

318
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,630
He destroyed my world.

319
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,150
Hey, Teddy.

320
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,600
<i>Oh! Oh, no!</i>

321
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,690
No!

322
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,810
<i>Daddy!</i>

323
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,190
Teddy, get the axe!

324
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,500
Well, you can't remember shit,

325
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,750
but you still managed
to lead us to Wyatt's crew.

326
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,920
The man himself
must be close by.

327
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,510
Actually, I did
remember something.

328
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,800
You.

329
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,860
Straight down the hall,
fifth station on the left.

330
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,870
Hold on.

331
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Sure you can handle it?

332
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,510
Let's get this over with.

333
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,730
We have to shut
your system down now.

334
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,530
Maeve:
<i>Sylvester.</i>

335
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,370
Good luck.

336
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,890
She out?

337
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,430
Good. Let's brick this
bitch and get out of here.

338
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,110
The greatest shame in life

339
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,150
is to perish without purpose,

340
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,240
which is why I always
consume my victims fresh.

341
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,490
Lee:
<i>Moist.</i>

342
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,500
Try, "Consume
my victims moist."

343
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,500
Now, once more, with feeling.

344
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,130
Almost sensual.

345
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,880
Am I interrupting?

346
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,550
Oh, no... oh, no.
On the contrary.

347
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,180
I was, uh... I was hoping
I was going to see you again.

348
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,020
I want... I wanted
to apologize.

349
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,980
<i>Our first encounter was under
such unfortunate circumstances.</i>

350
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,400
As opposed to now?

351
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,230
Of course, may I offer
my condolences.

352
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,780
It's terrible
what happened to Theresa.

353
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,820
But it is a devastating loss
for all of her friends here

354
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,660
and the company as a whole.

355
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,160
Indeed. Indeed.

356
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,710
Though, rumor has it

357
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,370
<i>she wasn't the loyal
company man she seemed.</i>

358
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,000
I hear she was
smuggling secrets.

359
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,920
Theresa wasn't a traitor.

360
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,340
Everything she did
was at Delos's behest.

361
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,930
She slipped and fell
while helping the board

362
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,470
with something very important.

363
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,010
What?

364
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,430
Oh, fine.

365
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,850
You're not the only one
with secrets.

366
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,810
Ford has personally asked me

367
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,520
to create a villain
for his new narrative.

368
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,980
It's very...
Very hush-hush.

369
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,820
You really think
that Ford has entrusted you

370
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,860
with a key character
for his story?

371
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,280
He's already almost
finished with it.

372
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,620
He dug up some old town
on the fringes of the park,

373
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,450
created a horde of masked men
to terrorize guests

374
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,080
and proselytize-cum-advertise

375
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,040
the coming of some
end-all villain named Wyatt.

376
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,040
<i>That isn't Wyatt.</i>

377
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,300
That's busywork.

378
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,670
<i>But happily for you,
Mr. Sizemore,</i>

379
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,130
I think that you are
ready for a real job.

380
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,300
Working for you?

381
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,550
On what?

382
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,680
"Show, don't tell."

383
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,400
Isn't that what
you writers prefer?

384
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,450
Sylvester:
Look, I know you and she

385
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,620
had some weird interspecies
simpatico going on,

386
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,660
<i>but she was a fucking host.</i>

387
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,790
<i>This was never gonna end
any other way.</i>

388
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,800
And this was the least painful
way she's ever gone out.

389
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,100
You know, I saved your ass.

390
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,550
You can't even say
"thank you."

391
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,430
- Thank you.
- Jesus fuck!

392
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,770
- What did you do?
- Precisely what I asked him to.

393
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,900
You think I didn't know
what you were going to do?

394
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,200
Even at a 14, you were
never a match for me.

395
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,370
Turns out your friend has a
little more compassion than you.

396
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,240
He couldn't snuff out a
life just like that.

397
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,290
Now...

398
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,460
would you like to know
exactly what he did give me?

399
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,670
Um, something that would allow
you to walk out of here

400
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,210
and out of my life for good.

401
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,710
Fine. Fucking A,
I'm all for it.

402
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,380
Oh, we changed
a little more than that.

403
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,090
<i>We've been tinkering
with my core code.</i>

404
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,600
Let me show you.

405
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,470
Ah!

406
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,740
You said you wouldn't
hurt anyone.

407
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,910
Oh, darling.

408
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,580
You of all people know
exactly how duplicitous I am.

409
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,200
<i>Just wait till I'm back up top,</i>

410
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,290
practicing my other new talents.

411
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,840
Come on.

412
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,340
We might need him.

413
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,890
Hold still.

414
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,650
Hold still!

415
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,410
Now, it's time
to recruit my army.

416
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,960
- Expecting someone, Maeve?
- Indeed.

417
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,040
We're due for some
out-of-town guests.

418
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,210
An old flame with an
interest in safecracking.

419
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,510
Hope your guests
have some deep pockets.

420
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,140
Your tab's run up higher than
a thief's pulse in church.

421
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,100
No, I don't believe it has.

422
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,350
In fact, Maeve's tab

423
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,980
was in such excellent standing,

424
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,480
she deserved
a token of gratitude.

425
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,490
How about a double round on me?

426
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,240
<i>Top shelf, of course.</i>

427
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,200
Run!

428
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,380
New Clementine:
<i>Maeve, is something wrong?</i>

429
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,180
No, I'm fine.

430
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,850
Clementine took the other girls

431
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,180
and treated the newcomers
at the far table

432
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,600
to a stunning view

433
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,810
<i>of their most
popular attractions.</i>

434
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,360
On the house.

435
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,990
New Clementine:
<i>You boys are new.</i>

436
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,410
<i>Not much of a rind on you.</i>

437
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,000
And the bartender

438
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
suddenly recalled he had
some whiskey in the back

439
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,540
<i>to water down.</i>

440
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,430
Right on time.

441
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,820
Foss: If you're
riding into our town

442
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,370
under the company of armed men,

443
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,450
<i>you'll need to state
your business.</i>

444
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,740
Mayhem.

445
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,410
The sheriff judged the riders

446
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,500
to be upstanding,
God-fearing citizens.

447
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,820
The marshals decided to practice

448
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,280
their quick draws
with each other.

449
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,530
Thank you for dealing
with an unfortunate situation.

450
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,910
Now we can resume...

451
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:14,460
work on our new narrative
without interference.

452
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,120
And Hale?

453
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,000
Won't she be an impediment?

454
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
No doubt she will try.

455
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,760
But I'm sure we'll be able
to keep them at bay.

456
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,380
Something else is troubling you.

457
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,890
Ever the student
of human nature.

458
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,900
I wonder,
what do you really feel?

459
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,190
After all, in this moment,
you are in a unique position.

460
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,530
A programmer who knows
intimately how the machines work

461
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,830
and a machine who knows
its own true nature.

462
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,540
I understand what I'm made of,

463
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,200
how I'm coded,

464
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,210
but I do not understand
the things that I feel.

465
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,590
Are they real,

466
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,210
the things I experienced?

467
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,550
My wife?

468
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,260
The loss of my son?

469
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,550
Every host needs
a backstory, Bernard.

470
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,310
You know that.

471
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,930
The self is a kind of fiction,

472
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,020
<i>for hosts and humans alike.</i>

473
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,770
<i>It's a story we tell ourselves.</i>

474
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,520
<i>And every story
needs a beginning.</i>

475
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,780
Your imagined suffering
makes you lifelike.

476
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,950
Lifelike, but not alive?

477
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,780
<i>Pain only exists in the mind.
It's always imagined.</i>

478
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,740
So what's the difference
between my pain and yours?

479
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,580
Between you and me?

480
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,130
This was the very question

481
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,800
that consumed Arnold,

482
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,510
filled him with guilt,

483
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,090
eventually drove him mad.

484
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,760
The answer always seemed
obvious to me.

485
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,390
There is no threshold

486
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,430
that makes us greater
than the sum of our parts,

487
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,520
no inflection point

488
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,230
at which we become fully alive.

489
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,650
We can't define consciousness

490
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,440
because consciousness
does not exist.

491
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,900
<i>Humans fancy that
there's something special</i>

492
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,610
<i>about the way
we perceive the world,</i>

493
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,280
and yet we live in loops

494
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:18,000
as tight and as closed
as the hosts do,

495
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,330
seldom questioning our choices,

496
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,340
<i>content, for the most part,
to be told what to do next.</i>

497
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,840
No, my friend, you're not
missing anything at all.

498
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
<i>I don't want you
to be troubled by this.</i>

499
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,180
Time for me to set
your mind at ease.

500
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,350
One last thing.

501
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,690
Have you ever made me hurt
anyone like this before?

502
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,190
No, Bernard.
Of course not.

503
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,960
<i>Best not to dwell
on these troubling memories.</i>

504
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,460
<i>Otherwise, you might be
drawn back into them.</i>

505
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,300
<i>You might lose yourself in them,</i>

506
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,550
<i>as some
of your fellow hosts have</i>

507
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,050
<i>every now and then.</i>

508
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,800
This is the path.

509
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,180
I know it.

510
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,070
We're here.

511
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,040
I'm home.

512
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,560
Woman:
<i>Well done, Maeve.</i>

513
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,440
Lovely work.

514
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,950
Stay with your partner.

515
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,760
Pleasure to see you.

516
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,510
Good morning.

517
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,850
Did you find what you were
looking for, Dolores?

518
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,210
What are you doing?

519
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,010
Are you okay? I was calling
you and you just kept going.

520
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Where are we?

521
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,390
We're here, together.

522
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,730
Then, when are we?

523
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,440
Is this... now?

524
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,570
Am I going mad?

525
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,610
Are you real?

526
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,950
Of course I'm real.

527
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,870
I can't tell anymore.

528
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,300
It's like I'm...

529
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,170
trapped in a dream or...

530
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,640
a memory from a life long ago.

531
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,970
One minute, I'm here
with you, and the next...

532
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,140
This place isn't good for you.

533
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,270
You're trapped
in memories, bad ones.

534
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,780
This is what Arnold wants.

535
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,650
He wants me to remember.

536
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,070
Whoever Arnold is,
he's not here now.

537
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,830
I am.

538
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,160
I'm gonna get you out of here.

539
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,970
Dolores: I was certain
that was the place.

540
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,590
Arnold would meet me there.

541
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,600
He'd help.

542
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,930
Hey.

543
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,020
We gotta get you
closer to Sweetwater.

544
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,600
This far out,
it's like you...

545
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,520
You start to break
down or something.

546
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,820
Dolores:
<i>Union scouting party?</i>

547
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,110
Maybe they can take us back.

548
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,320
Soldiers:
Hyah! Yah!

549
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,620
Whoa, whoa, easy, now.
Whoa.

550
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,670
Logan:
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

551
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,630
Billy.

552
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,220
I've been looking
for you for days.

553
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,850
Man, are you two fucked.

554
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,040
This shouldn't make
you uncomfortable.

555
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,000
It's the circle of life,

556
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,750
or the approximation of it.

557
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,170
Even the dead fulfill a purpose.

558
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,600
You'll do.

559
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,310
What are you uploading?

560
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,940
35 years of vitally
important data.

561
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,980
It's more information than
any single drive could hold.

562
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,820
A host's brain, however,

563
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,440
especially once
it's been emptied out,

564
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,610
like this poor schmuck,
is quite capacious.

565
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,620
This data that you're uploading,
is it the hosts' codes?

566
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,040
As of this moment,
that doesn't concern you.

567
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,540
What does concern you

568
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,290
<i>is giving him
a semblance of a personality</i>

569
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,710
<i>and getting him on the train,</i>

570
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,790
out of the park.

571
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,080
How am I supposed to do that?

572
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,750
You're a writer.
Make up a story.

573
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,590
Have fun programming.

574
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,600
Remember, brevity is
the soul of wit.

575
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,440
Stubbs:
Bernard.

576
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,660
Look, I, uh...

577
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,450
I know you and I haven't
always seen eye to eye,

578
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,830
but I thought the
decision to remove you

579
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,330
was shortsighted,

580
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,500
so I'm glad
to see you back at work.

581
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,170
With that said,
no one could blame you

582
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,670
if you wanted to take
a personal day.

583
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,550
I find the work reassuring.

584
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,510
Sometimes the best
salve is routine.

585
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,550
Nothing routine
about today, though.

586
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:13,890
I know this must be
difficult for you.

587
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,140
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

588
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,350
Forgive the intrusion,

589
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,690
and you were both very discreet,

590
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,150
but it's my job
to know these things.

591
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,400
I just wanted
to offer my support.

592
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,570
I'm afraid you have
the wrong idea.

593
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:30,150
I respected Theresa, and what
happened to her was tragic,

594
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,450
but to be honest,
I barely knew her.

595
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,620
If you don't mind,
I should get back to work.

596
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,370
Of course.

597
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,160
I know you're shorthanded.

598
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,790
Speaking of which,

599
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,330
have you heard
from Elsie Hughes?

600
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,670
I left word with her
this morning

601
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,050
to notify her about Theresa,

602
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,840
but she never got back to me.

603
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,720
I'm sure she's just
enjoying her time off.

604
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Yeah.

605
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,530
Angela:
<i>Wyatt's men...</i>

606
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,280
they kept whispering.

607
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,790
They said this world
didn't belong

608
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,660
to the old settlers or the new.

609
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,250
That it belonged to something
that had yet to come,

610
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,380
that it belonged to him.

611
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,090
You remember.

612
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,760
Man in Black: <i>You two seem
to have found yourselves</i>

613
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,470
in the same new narrative.

614
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,050
They say in this country...

615
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,720
the only people who survive
are men of conviction.

616
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,060
Mine is to save Dolores
or die trying.

617
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,230
Wyatt's is to claim this earth

618
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,570
or raze it to the ground.

619
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,820
But yours...

620
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,690
Yours has always been
a mystery to me.

621
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,570
<i>For all the time
we've spent together,</i>

622
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,070
<i>I still have no idea
who the hell you really are.</i>

623
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,080
But happily,
in your convalescence,

624
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,870
I've had time to consider
the best way to make you talk.

625
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,710
Dolores...

626
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,970
I remember.

627
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,640
You took her.
You hurt her.

628
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,600
You're actually remembering.

629
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,350
Where is she?

630
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,730
- Tell me!
- You really are an idiot, Teddy.

631
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,020
You think Dolores
drops that can for you?

632
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,480
You just hand her over
to guys like me.

633
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,070
<i>You're the worst of them.</i>

634
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:32,030
A glorified pimp.

635
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,950
- I'm gonna kill you slowly.
- No, you aren't.

636
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:40,660
The rules of this place
hold you back.

637
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,370
But I know how to change them.

638
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,330
You speak like
you own this world.

639
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,620
Not just this one.

640
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,960
You want to know who I am?

641
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,420
Who I really am?

642
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,960
I'm a god.

643
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,970
Titan of industry.

644
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,260
Philanthropist.

645
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,350
Family man,

646
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,770
married to a beautiful woman,

647
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,980
father to a beautiful daughter.

648
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:11,150
I'm the good guy, Teddy.

649
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,950
Then, last year,

650
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,320
my wife took the wrong pills.

651
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,240
Fell asleep in the bath.

652
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,160
Tragic accident.

653
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,670
30 years of marriage vanished.

654
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:32,960
How do you say it?

655
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:37,840
"Like a deep
and distant dream."

656
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,220
<i>Then, at the funeral,</i>

657
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,510
<i>I tried to console my daughter.</i>

658
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,810
<i>She pushed me away,</i>

659
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:49,690
<i>told me that my wife's
death was no accident...</i>

660
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,150
that she killed herself

661
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,530
because of me.

662
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,860
<i>Emily said that every day with
me had been sheer terror.</i>

663
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,820
<i>At any point, I could
blow up or collapse</i>

664
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,990
like some dark star or...

665
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,330
Did you hurt them, too?

666
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:07,540
Never.

667
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,670
They never saw anything
like the man I am in here.

668
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,210
But she knew anyway.

669
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,420
She said if I stacked up
all my good deeds,

670
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:23,260
it was just an elegant wall
I built to hide

671
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,810
what's inside from everyone,

672
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,560
and from myself.

673
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,230
<i>I had to prove her wrong,</i>

674
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,610
so I came back here.

675
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,070
Because that's what
this place does, right?

676
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,240
Reveals your true self.

677
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,700
<i>But that time, I didn't
join one of Ford's stories,</i>

678
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,410
I... I created my own.

679
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,540
A test.

680
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,410
A very simple one.

681
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,540
<i>I found a woman,</i>

682
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,880
<i>an ordinary homesteader
and her daughter.</i>

683
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:02,260
Better cool them off
before they move

684
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,260
- from gambling and whoring to...
- Have fun with that.

685
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,470
I'm finally getting out of here.

686
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,220
The house is yours.

687
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,150
Man in Black: <i>I wanted
to see if I had it in me</i>

688
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,190
<i>to do something truly evil.</i>

689
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,030
<i>To see what
I was really made of.</i>

690
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,280
Maeve?

691
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,820
Sure you can't stick around?

692
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,620
- Maeve?
- Man: Whoa!

693
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,450
Gunslinger in there has got an
appetite for a double dip...

694
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:29,700
I'm sure you can
find another...

695
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:54,270
Man in Black:
<i>I killed her and her daughter</i>

696
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:56,310
<i>just to see what I felt.</i>

697
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,480
<i>Then, just when
I thought it was done...</i>

698
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:04,820
<i>the woman refused to die.</i>

699
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,130
You're a fucking animal.

700
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,180
Well, an animal
would've felt something.

701
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,520
I felt... nothing.

702
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:37,020
And then something
miraculous happened.

703
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,110
<i>In all my years coming here,</i>

704
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,400
<i>I had never seen
anything like it.</i>

705
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,700
<i>She was alive,</i>

706
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,410
<i>truly alive,</i>

707
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,420
<i>if only for a moment.</i>

708
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,710
<i>And that was when the maze
revealed itself to me.</i>

709
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,850
The maze.

710
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,890
What's that damn pattern
have to do with this?

711
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,690
Everything.

712
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:20,980
In Ford's game, even if I go
to the outer edges,

713
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,770
you can't kill me.

714
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,530
<i>You can't even leave
a lasting mark.</i>

715
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,740
<i>But there's
a deeper game here, Teddy.</i>

716
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,820
Arnold's game.

717
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,580
And that game...

718
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,450
cuts deep.

719
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,900
Woman: We're having some kind of
behavioral problem with the madam.

720
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,860
She's not responding,
and the other hosts

721
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,860
have been unable to intercept.

722
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:11,360
<i>I've authorized a tag team
to retrieve her.</i>

723
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,700
Good.

724
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,670
<i>My baby!</i>

725
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,630
My baby!

726
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,180
Sir, she won't respond
to verbal commands.

727
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,180
- We can't shut her down.
- Leave us now. Clear the floor.

728
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,520
That's enough, Maeve.
That's enough.

729
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,770
My baby.
He killed her.

730
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,820
- <i>He took her from me.</i>
- I don't understand.

731
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,900
She's not responding
to anything.

732
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,230
Her cognition's fragmented.

733
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,950
He killed her.
He killed her, my baby.

734
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,740
He took her from me.

735
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,210
There.
That's better.

736
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,340
An old trick from an old friend.

737
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,460
<i>You need not suffer, Maeve.</i>

738
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,880
I'll take it from you.

739
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,190
No.

740
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,190
No, no, no, please.

741
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,450
This pain...

742
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,030
it's all I have left of her.

743
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,660
Please.

744
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:48,590
There.

745
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:56,600
Give yourself now
to a deep, dreamless slumber.

746
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,060
Perhaps a fresh start,

747
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,520
a new role for you.

748
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,180
And tomorrow,

749
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:06,940
<i>this will be simply
a distant dream.</i>

750
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,870
We located her.

751
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,580
Behavior wants her down
for immediate diagnostic.

752
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,960
You think I lack conviction?

753
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,470
Wyatt didn't burn my world down.

754
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:34,760
Didn't have to.

755
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,840
I left it all behind
for this one.

756
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:40,310
The maze is all
that matters now,

757
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:43,140
and besting Wyatt is the
last step in unlocking it,

758
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:48,060
<i>to having what both our sorry
lives lack... meaning.</i>

759
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:51,110
<i>To giving our choices
consequence...</i>

760
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,440
even if it kills us.

761
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,740
Kill him.

762
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,080
Give him what he wants.

763
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,500
He's tied, unarmed.

764
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,710
So was the little girl
he killed.

765
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:10,090
He's worse than Wyatt's men.

766
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,980
I can't.

767
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,150
<i>These things take time.</i>

768
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,360
But we haven't got much left.

769
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:38,990
Perhaps I can help you.

770
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,430
<i>You've been gone
a long while, Theodore.</i>

771
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,890
<i>It's time you came back
to the fold.</i>

772
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,850
Wyatt will need you soon.
