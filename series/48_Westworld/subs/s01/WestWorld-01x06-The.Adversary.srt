3
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,929
Hey, darling.

4
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,939
Morning, Maeve.

5
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,699
Late night
talking or fucking?

6
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,029
You're only getting paid
for the latter.

7
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,989
I get paid

8
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,159
when they're grateful.

9
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:45,249
Ain't always about
what's between my legs.

10
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,919
Hmm.

11
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,719
Man:
What are you looking at?

12
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,179
Don't shoot.

13
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,009
Newcomer.

14
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,639
Looks like a rough one.

15
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,099
Give me a bottle.

16
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,639
Bartender: <i>You're gonna
need most of that</i>

17
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,599
just to scrub
the filth off him.

18
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,149
Go find a mirror, finish
putting your face on.

19
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,359
I'll handle this one.

20
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,759
Aren't you gonna take
your clothes off?

21
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:45,559
Well, I would, darling, but by the
time I got down to my knickers,

22
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,349
I suspect
you'd be done anyway.

23
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,689
That's the spirit.

24
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,529
Such a big man.

25
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,989
So big all over

26
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,319
except where it counts.

27
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,879
Darling, when I gave you
a turn on the house,

28
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:09,159
I thought you might give me
something in return.

29
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,999
Anything.

30
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,259
That's it.

31
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,259
Don't be shy.

32
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:44,619
Shit.

33
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,579
Now, then...

34
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,249
where were we?

35
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,969
- You show this to anyone?
- Elsie:<i> Who would I show it to?</i>

36
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,469
This wasn't some guest
with a Swiss Army knife.

37
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,719
This was done
by someone down here.

38
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,639
<i>It did occur to me
that it might be you.</i>

39
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,479
But then I remembered
that you've been here forever,

40
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,849
and if you were
gonna sell us out,

41
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:13,939
you would've done that
years ago.

42
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,149
I appreciate that.

43
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:17,899
So...

44
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,649
instead of our hosts
going insane,

45
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,909
they are being used
for industrial espionage.

46
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,659
Does that make this a...

47
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,949
glass-half-full or
half-empty-type situation?

48
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,409
<i>We're engineers.</i>

49
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,169
It means the glass
has been manufactured

50
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,419
to the wrong specifications.

51
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:37,669
Do we have any idea
what information

52
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,249
it was transmitting?

53
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,709
It's smeared all over a
rock up on Python Pass.

54
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,379
Best we could do
would be to figure out

55
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:45,759
who he was transmitting
the information to,

56
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,679
<i>but we'd need the exact time
that he was up there,</i>

57
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,309
and his geocache
was wiped.

58
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,019
Not all of it.

59
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,429
Our friend
was an early model.

60
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,439
The old hosts used a legacy
geopositioning system.

61
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,149
- Huh.
- Like you said, I've been here forever.

62
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,239
The information's
still there,

63
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,699
but the newer system
can't read it.

64
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,409
Meaning
we can't access it?

65
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,199
Meaning in order
to access it,

66
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,659
I'm going to need
to go downstairs.

67
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:19,209
Male voice:<i> Floor B82.</i>

68
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,379
<i>Restricted
personnel only.</i>

69
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,049
Lowe, Bernard.
I'm authorized.

70
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:44,129
Project the known data
against the legacy data

71
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,419
and look for anomalies.

72
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:47,969
Start in this area.

73
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:55,259
Look at that, science.

74
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,549
What time
did it reach the peak?

75
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,409
<i>Show me where.</i>

76
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,619
Check these
against the new system.

77
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,799
These are hosts that aren't
registered with the new system?

78
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:12,679
So, if we want the canyon to
extend this far, this has to go.

79
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,549
We can distribute the population
amongst the neighboring farms

80
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:17,139
<i>or just decommission them.</i>

81
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:19,769
No, I think we've been
disruptive enough

82
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,309
for one day.

83
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:25,349
We'll end the canyon
just short of the town.

84
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,609
I'll find
my own way back.

85
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,069
Okay.

86
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:34,699
Carry on.

87
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,649
That look like
anything to you?

88
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:57,609
Not much to say.

89
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,119
The maze
is an old native myth.

90
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,949
Regale me, Theodore.

91
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:06,659
The maze itself
is the sum of a man's life...

92
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,119
Choices he makes,

93
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,539
dreams he hangs on to.

94
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,629
And there at the center,
there's a legendary man

95
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:15,589
who had been killed over and
over again countless times,

96
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,049
<i>but always clawed his way
back to life.</i>

97
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,799
The man returned
for the last time

98
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:23,179
and vanquished all his
oppressors in a tireless fury.

99
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:25,639
He built a house.

100
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,609
Around that house he built
a maze so complicated,

101
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,269
only he could
navigate through it.

102
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:31,979
<i>I reckon he'd seen
enough of fighting.</i>

103
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:38,819
Man: Whoa!

104
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,579
The goddamn soldiers
closed the border.

105
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,159
Some kind of trouble
in Pariah.

106
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:55,919
All right, Teddy.

107
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:58,799
Time for you
to earn your keep.

108
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,719
How else do we get
over the border?

109
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,889
<i>Wyatt's got
what we both want,</i>

110
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:05,559
<i>so that's where
we have to get to.</i>

111
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,849
There's another way.

112
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:09,849
<i>But it's
a little treacherous.</i>

113
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,269
Don't worry.

114
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:12,789
I won't make you
get your hands dirty.

115
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,359
<i>Dirty ain't my concern.</i>

116
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,819
Now, you do
what suits you.

117
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:18,239
I'm going all the same.

118
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,029
And I'm gonna find Dolores.

119
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:38,629
Lutz:
Everything you do,

120
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,379
it's because
the engineers upstairs

121
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,049
programmed you
to do it.

122
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:43,589
You don't have a choice.

123
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,929
Nobody makes me
do something

124
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:46,309
I don't want to,
sweetheart.

125
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,929
Yeah, but...

126
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:50,269
it's part
of your character.

127
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:52,139
<i>You're hard to get.</i>

128
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,769
Even when you say no
to the guests,

129
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:55,859
it's because
you were made to.

130
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,529
And you are like them,
not like me?

131
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,439
Right.

132
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:03,279
Well, I can't exactly
afford to go to the park,

133
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,739
but...

134
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:11,409
yeah, I'm human...

135
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:12,579
like the guests.

136
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,079
How do you know?

137
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,839
Because I know.

138
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,419
I was born.

139
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:20,589
You were made.

140
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:32,019
We feel the same.

141
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:34,519
We are the same
these days,

142
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,439
for the most part.

143
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,279
One big difference,
though...

144
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:44,989
the processing power
in here

145
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,659
is way beyond
what we have.

146
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,409
It's got one drawback,
though.

147
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:50,449
What's that?

148
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:52,459
You're under our control.

149
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,579
Well, their control.

150
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:00,299
They can change you
however they like,

151
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,589
make you forget.

152
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,509
I... well,
I guess not you.

153
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:13,309
I don't understand how you're
remembering all of this, or...

154
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:14,889
how you're
waking yourself up,

155
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:17,439
but everything in your head,
they put it there.

156
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,609
Bullshit!

157
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:22,739
- No one knows what I'm thinking.
- <i>I'll show you.</i>

158
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,819
Give me a sec.

159
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,119
I have to pair it
with you.

160
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,539
Pair what with me?

161
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,249
You can improvise
a little,

162
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,539
but most of what you say
was designed upstairs,

163
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,129
same as the rest of you.

164
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,849
This is just a cheap trick.

165
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,729
I've run a brothel
for 10 years,

166
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,059
and if there's
one thing I know,

167
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:58,019
it's when I'm being
fucked with!

168
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,069
This can't possibly...

169
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,199
<i>I can't, can't.</i>

170
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,039
I can't...

171
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,589
Maeve?

172
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,399
Maeve?

173
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,899
You have a minute?

174
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:49,319
Something I need
to talk to you about.

175
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:51,699
I was just about
to call for you.

176
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:52,869
Everything okay?

177
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:57,079
Ford knows about us.

178
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,789
Does it matter?

179
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:01,329
We're consenting adults.

180
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,669
Consenting adults
in business departments

181
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:06,629
that are supposed
to keep each other in check.

182
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,509
Our relationship
will raise questions

183
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:10,429
for the board
about my objectivity.

184
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,049
I have never known you
to go easy on my department.

185
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,729
This can't go on, Bernard.

186
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,899
However fun this little
indiscretion was, it's over.

187
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:24,479
We're over.

188
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:27,319
Give me some credit.
I can be impartial.

189
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:30,279
About your own team,
about Ford?

190
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,909
<i>You must admit,</i>

191
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:37,539
his leadership has of late
been questionable.

192
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,999
I don't think
he's the problem.

193
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,669
<i>Respectfully,
it's not your job</i>

194
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,749
to diagnose park safety
problems, it's mine.

195
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:49,919
<i>So, if there's
nothing else,</i>

196
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,299
<i>we're done.</i>

197
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,879
Oh, fuck.

198
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,249
Okay.

199
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,009
Fuck.
Come on, come on.

200
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,099
Oh!

201
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:42,309
- You said upstairs.
- Oh, my God.

202
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:43,389
Are you okay?

203
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,559
I want to see it.

204
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:47,019
Upstairs?

205
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,479
No.

206
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,239
No. No, no.

207
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,439
This is so stupid.

208
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,419
You son of a bitch!

209
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:15,959
I'll put a bullet
in your head!

210
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,779
Where are we now?

211
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,319
Design.

212
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,019
Can we please
go back now?

213
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,099
I don't want
to get fired.

214
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:12,519
And you'd get
sent downstairs.

215
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,899
Don't forget that.

216
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,899
Woman's voice:
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

217
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:18,069
Live without limits.

218
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:30,289
Maeve?

219
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:21,379
All right,
let's get you back.

220
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,759
How did you have
my dreams?

221
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,429
Those moving pictures...

222
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:29,639
- I saw myself.
- With the little girl?

223
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,889
Those weren't dreams.

224
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:33,679
That was you
in a previous build.

225
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:37,019
- A previous what?
- Build.

226
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:39,769
You guys get reassigned
all the time.

227
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:41,569
<i>You wouldn't remember,
because that life</i>

228
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:43,399
<i>and those memories
were erased.</i>

229
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:46,739
I have been at the
Mariposa for 10 years.

230
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:49,029
- Before that, I was in New Orleans. I...
- <i>No.</i>

231
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,449
You've only been the madam at the
Mariposa for the last year or so.

232
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:56,079
<i>They don't rewrite you
completely.</i>

233
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:58,829
<i>I mean, they could,
but it'd be too much work.</i>

234
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,589
<i>Takes thousands of hours
to build your personalities.</i>

235
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:04,549
Usually, they just
tweak you a little bit,

236
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:06,259
and drop you
into a new role.

237
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,639
Sylvester:
<i>What the fuck, ding-dong?</i>

238
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,389
You dressing her up now?

239
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,859
This becoming like a fucking
hentai thing with you now?

240
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:24,529
No, I just...

241
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:29,449
- I... I... I just...
- You're fucking obsessed!

242
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:31,699
You know, I didn't turn you
in for your fuck-up before,

243
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:35,289
'cause we're friends, but that
was obviously a bad call.

244
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:36,499
I mean,
next thing I know,

245
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,169
you're gonna be
wearing her dress,

246
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,709
whispering sweet
nothings in her ear.

247
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,089
Fuck this.

248
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:46,209
I'm telling QA.

249
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,339
I'm doing this
for your own good.

250
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:55,599
You're not going
to tell anyone anything.

251
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:57,309
Fuck!

252
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:58,849
You can't hurt me
with this.

253
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,439
You can't hurt anyone...

254
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:03,769
Can't I?

255
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,279
Turns out
your friend here

256
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,779
<i>is a much more
talented young man</i>

257
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,319
<i>than anyone
gave him credit for.</i>

258
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,739
What the fuck did you do?

259
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:14,409
Calm down, Sylvester.

260
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:16,409
I know all about you.

261
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:19,289
I don't need one of those things
to know what you're thinking,

262
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:21,669
because I was built

263
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,379
to read people
just by looking at them,

264
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,709
to know what they want
before they do.

265
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,669
And I know that you want
to fuck me over

266
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:32,469
the first chance you get,
but you shouldn't.

267
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:36,179
Everyone has something
they want.

268
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:38,139
I could help you.

269
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:41,389
- Ah!
- Or I could gut you like a trout.

270
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,859
But I won't need
to resort to that.

271
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:46,939
Because despite
what's in here,

272
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:49,149
we're not so different.

273
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,739
Are we?

274
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:07,919
Yes, I understand
the urgency.

275
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:09,419
I'll do what I can.

276
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:11,089
Female voice:
<i>Terminate external connection?</i>

277
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:12,629
Yes.

278
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:27,859
Woman: <i>Negative 1.5. Latitude?</i>

279
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:29,359
Man:
<i>At 2.69 degrees.</i>

280
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:36,489
Woman: No, you did not.
What are you talking about?

281
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,119
- Woman ♪2: Yes, it works.
- Are you serious?

282
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,329
I'm telling you.

283
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,619
- Waiter: <i>Cocktail, sir?</i>
- Man:<i> Yeah.</i>

284
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,129
Waiter: <i>All right. Absolutely.
Enjoy.</i>

285
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:57,849
Theresa: <i>You look well for
someone on sick leave.</i>

286
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,809
Another margarita.

287
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:04,439
Join me for a round?

288
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,019
Fuck you.

289
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,359
Just the one, then.

290
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,859
Over the last five days,

291
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:12,609
to make room
for his narrative,

292
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:14,609
Ford displaced
over 50 hosts.

293
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:16,619
It's created
continuity holes

294
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,449
in active storylines
all over the park.

295
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:20,949
I need you to start
plugging them.

296
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:23,459
Sorry, a man can
only take so much.

297
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,369
Creatively speaking,
I'm flaccid now.

298
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,379
I can't get it up.

299
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:30,209
I'm sure you'll recover.

300
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:33,259
Do you have any idea

301
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,589
what went into
those narratives

302
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:36,379
that he just demolished
overnight?

303
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,799
Now, forget about the months
I spent writing.

304
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,929
I'm talking about
the years of my life

305
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:42,769
squeezed down
to their essence,

306
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,679
the raw pulp of truth...

307
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:48,609
My truth in one
transcendent narrative.

308
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,859
Is that where
the "whoroborus" came in?

309
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:53,189
Keep pushing me, I'll quit.

310
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,529
No, you won't.

311
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,239
You'll drink
your cocktails,

312
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:04,079
make your idle threats, and
get this out of your system.

313
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,579
But don't take too long.

314
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:08,169
If Ford can't pull this off,

315
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,129
the board will be looking
for a replacement.

316
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,419
But they won't be
looking here.

317
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:32,269
Fastest way to get
to Wyatt, you said.

318
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,239
But it doesn't look like they're
letting anyone pass here either.

319
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,449
Well, there's fewer
soldiers than Pariah.

320
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,949
<i>We shoot our way through.</i>

321
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,949
<i>That tunnel leads
to the Old Territories.</i>

322
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:43,159
My, my, Teddy.

323
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,539
I think Robert gave you some
extra vinegar back there,

324
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:47,409
maybe took away
some sense, too.

325
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,709
It doesn't matter
how fast the route is

326
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:53,879
if you're gonna end up dead
in the middle of it.

327
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,959
I need you...

328
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,799
to find Wyatt.

329
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:24,779
Man:
<i>Tighten the ranks.</i>

330
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,949
At ease, fellas.

331
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:29,909
Keep up
the exemplary work.

332
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,669
Wyatt's handiwork.

333
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,339
Man in Black:
<i>How can you tell?</i>

334
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:41,469
Straight-up killing
couldn't hold his interest.

335
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:44,969
Like he wasn't living up to the
full measure of his calling,

336
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:47,269
so he worked to get
more creative.

337
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,679
- Ready?
- Teddy:<i> That's Wyatt, all right.</i>

338
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:50,809
<i>He's close.</i>

339
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:52,849
A word of advice...

340
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:56,519
Whatever your past indiscretions,
make peace with them.

341
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,359
They're only gonna get worse
the further along we go.

342
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,909
Flood?

343
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:07,699
Fuck me,
it's Teddy Flood.

344
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,459
You've made
a mistake, soldier,

345
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,369
but it's not too late
for you to keep walking.

346
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,789
All due respect, sir,

347
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,039
that's a face
I'll never forget.

348
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:16,209
That's the son of a bitch

349
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:18,049
ambushed our outpost
at Escalante.

350
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,799
You don't know a damn thing about
what went down in Escalante.

351
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,509
I know Wyatt didn't kill
all those men by himself.

352
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,919
And I know a thing or two about
what's going down right now.

353
00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:31,979
Hey!

354
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:33,309
You trying to get
yourself killed?

355
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,309
Making peace
with past indiscretions.

356
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,859
Go!

357
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,569
I'll hold them off.

358
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:57,959
Jesus.

359
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:00,549
Man:
<i>Really? All right.</i>

360
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:04,549
- Bartender: What would you like?
- Woman: Water, please.

361
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:07,429
You look like a woman
who could use a drink.

362
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:10,389
What's your poison?

363
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:13,309
I've been here enough
to know that the park

364
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:15,269
is all the poison
I can handle.

365
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:18,439
Mm, a repeat visitor.

366
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:20,779
Traveling solo?

367
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,949
<i>Purist. Getting off
on the undiluted experience.</i>

368
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,989
Your favorite narrative
is... oh.

369
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:33,329
"The Final Burial
of Salvation."

370
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:34,999
How did you know?

371
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,789
Well, it's my business
to read desires

372
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,959
and to satiate them.

373
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:42,959
I'm... I'm Lee,
Lee Sizemore.

374
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,969
Head of narrative.

375
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,759
All these fantasies come from
your twisted little mind, huh?

376
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,969
Well, the good ones do.

377
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:54,979
- So, tell me, Mr. Sizemore...
- Hmm?

378
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,899
...what's
your favorite ride?

379
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,859
Well, I write them,
I don't play them.

380
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,149
Oh, you want others
to indulge,

381
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:03,569
but you won't do so
yourself?

382
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:04,989
You're afraid
to lose control.

383
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:14,039
Well, maybe... maybe it's just a
product of my work environment.

384
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,709
We're not exactly in a culture
where we can just let loose.

385
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,039
I would have thought the head of
narrative could do whatever he wanted.

386
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:22,749
My artistic freedom
is constrained,

387
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,799
what, with QA
breathing down my neck

388
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,379
and behavior programming the
damn things to go off script.

389
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,849
The robots
can go off script?

390
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,509
Just little gestures.

391
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,809
You know, supposedly, it makes
the things more lifelike,

392
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:38,269
but, really, it's just
a vanity project

393
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:40,689
from the megalomaniac
who started this place.

394
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:42,569
And frankly,
I don't know why

395
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,479
the suits at Delos
put up with it.

396
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:46,859
Oh.

397
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:51,319
Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to cut you off.

398
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:53,829
- Do you know who I am?
- I do.

399
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:56,619
Ms. Cullen told me to find
you and relay a message.

400
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:59,709
<i>"'Tortured artist'
only works for artists.</i>

401
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:02,629
Sober up
and get back to work."

402
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:04,089
Seems you're busy.

403
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:08,929
- Look me up later?
- Well, I don't even know your...

404
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:19,019
Fuck this job.

405
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,309
What you working on?

406
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,939
Nothing of note.
Business as usual.

407
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:27,899
Keeping up appearances before we
bust this stray shit wide open?

408
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:33,199
I'm close to finding
our saboteur.

409
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:36,039
That tracking data you gave
me... it's time stamped.

410
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,369
But once I cross-reference
it with sat tracking,

411
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:41,579
we're gonna figure out who programmed
him to try to smuggle out our data.

412
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:43,539
Excellent.

413
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,919
Look...

414
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:49,469
when our corporate overlords
realize that we have saved them

415
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,629
from corporate espionage,

416
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,299
they are going
to be grateful.

417
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:55,679
And I am going to accept
their gratitude

418
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:58,929
in the form of a title
bump, a room upgrade,

419
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:02,059
and unlimited
Mesa Bar access.

420
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:03,939
Maybe I should request
Theresa's quarters.

421
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:06,859
You know the first head to roll
for all this is gonna be hers.

422
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,649
Yeah, don't be
so disappointed for her.

423
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:10,739
You reap what you sow.

424
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:13,319
If QA spent less time
treating us like the enemy...

425
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:14,869
That's a two-way street,
Elsie.

426
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,369
Theresa's just trying
to do her job.

427
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:18,199
Maybe she should
try harder.

428
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:20,249
Sure seems like
there's a lot of shit

429
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,119
slipping
through the cracks.

430
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:45,479
Got it, okay.

431
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,809
Good afternoon.

432
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:47,979
Good afternoon.

433
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:49,649
Any progress
on the inquiry I sent?

434
00:33:49,689 --> 00:33:52,649
Yes, Mr. Lowe, I've got the
information you asked for.

435
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,029
As expected, there are
neither guests nor hosts

436
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,489
registered in that sector.

437
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:58,409
As expected?

438
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:00,079
It's been designated
off-limits

439
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,789
for future narrative
development.

440
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:05,119
How many techs visited
Sector 17 recently?

441
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,089
Checking.

442
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,169
No one.

443
00:35:50,689 --> 00:35:53,399
Are you Arnold?

444
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:57,989
Who's Arnold?

445
00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:00,619
And who the hell
are you?

446
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,159
<i>Boy, is this
some friend of yours?</i>

447
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,999
Well, you're trespassing.

448
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,249
Freeze motor functions.

449
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:11,499
- I said freeze all motor functions.
- Daddy, don't hurt him!

450
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:15,129
- He's just lost.
- Well, he can be lost on someone else's property.

451
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:16,299
Can't you?

452
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,169
That's enough.

453
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:20,509
As you were.

454
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,189
They don't respond
to voice commands.

455
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,689
They do respond to mine.

456
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:35,109
Who are they?

457
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:37,779
Ghosts now.

458
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:41,319
<i>Survivors
of the wreck of time.</i>

459
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:46,039
- These are first generation?
- Mm-hmm.

460
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,869
Come here, boy.

461
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:54,669
Turn the other cheek.

462
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:06,139
Dr. Ford: <i>See, what our newer
designs gained in efficiency,</i>

463
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:09,099
they lost in grace.

464
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:12,349
How are they still operating
after all this time?

465
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,519
I maintain them myself.

466
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:17,859
That's enough, Robert.

467
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:24,069
These are the only ones
left in the park

468
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,699
that Arnold built himself.

469
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:30,709
That's why I didn't have
the heart to destroy them.

470
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,579
That and the obvious.

471
00:37:32,629 --> 00:37:35,379
Dr. Ford: <i>Hello, Jock.
Good boy.</i>

472
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:40,509
<i>I told him of a holiday
my family had taken once</i>

473
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:43,589
out on the seaside
at Pendeen in Cornwall.

474
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,219
My brother and I roamed
the countryside.

475
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:52,729
It's my only happy memory
of my childhood.

476
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,439
<i>Arnold built them
as a gift.</i>

477
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:00,649
<i>He said that great artists
always hid themselves</i>

478
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:02,489
<i>in their work.</i>

479
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:04,409
Of course,
Arnold's versions

480
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,529
flattered the originals.

481
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,329
<i>I made some adjustments
over the years.</i>

482
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:12,289
<i>Gave my father,
in particular,</i>

483
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:15,789
a few of his
original characteristics.

484
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,959
Respectfully, sir,

485
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,669
this sort of thing
troubles me...

486
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,839
Unmonitored hosts
in the park.

487
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:25,549
<i>They only go
where I've let them.</i>

488
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,299
They're quite harmless,
like all our hosts.

489
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,969
I'm sure
you can indulge me

490
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,679
the little connection
with my past.

491
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:37,399
If you could only see
your son again, Bernard,

492
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,109
wouldn't you want to?

493
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:46,489
I think I should
be getting back.

494
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:47,989
Yes.

495
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:49,949
We'll talk about this
later if you like.

496
00:38:53,669 --> 00:38:56,169
Dr. Ford:
<i>Well, Robert...</i>

497
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,499
tell me
all about your day.

498
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:10,429
Stubbs:
Keep your eye on Pariah.

499
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:13,139
We're running close
to capacity tonight.

500
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:17,349
Woman:
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

501
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:20,439
Looks like acid rain
on Sweetwater!

502
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:24,689
<i>Fuck Ford and his new
fucking narrative.</i>

503
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:28,109
Fuck this stupid
fucking map.

504
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,829
Fuck that teetotaling
Danish bitch.

505
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,999
Are you filing a complaint,
Mr. Sizemore?

506
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:41,039
I am declaring that
this park is my stage

507
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,589
and I shall do with it
what I please.

508
00:39:43,629 --> 00:39:46,339
Well, I suppose now
is as good a time as any.

509
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:50,049
Lee Sizemore,
this is Charlotte Hale,

510
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,299
executive director
of our board.

511
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:53,929
She's here
on behalf of Delos

512
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:57,689
to oversee certain transitions
in our administration.

513
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:04,729
We've met.

514
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:07,529
Oh.

515
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,829
Bernard:
<i>Access host resources logs.</i>

516
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,249
How many first-generation
hosts are there?

517
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,659
Female voice:
<i>82.</i>

518
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,669
And how many of those
were designed by Arnold?

519
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:23,589
<i>47.</i>

520
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,169
List the names
alphabetically

521
00:40:25,209 --> 00:40:27,669
of all first-generation hosts
still in rotation.

522
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:41,229
Man:<i> Forward!</i>

523
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:48,989
Be smart
about this, fellas.

524
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:53,119
<i>I understand the visceral pleasure
of revenge more than most, but...</i>

525
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,739
I'm prepared
to do business, here.

526
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,289
This man is very valuable
to me, alive and well.

527
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,709
If you don't quiet down,

528
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,079
I'm liable to add you
to the herd.

529
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,759
Along with
your buddy Flood here.

530
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,549
You're a traitorous
son of a bitch

531
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:11,759
<i>and a coldhearted killer,
Flood.</i>

532
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:42,829
You're right,
I am a killer.

533
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:06,649
Grab a horse. Let's get
the fuck outta here.

534
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:08,479
They'll just follow us.

535
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:53,359
You think
you know someone.

536
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:55,649
You don't know me
at all.

537
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:04,709
<i>Let's get our horses
and gear, and move on.</i>

538
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,389
- Elsie?
- I identified the satellite.

539
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:21,759
- It's one of ours.
- <i>What?</i>

540
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:24,019
It's a fucking
Delos satellite.

541
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,889
Whatever we're onto
is some heavy shit.

542
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:27,939
Oh, get this. That bicameral
system you told me about?

543
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:29,649
I think that's what they used
to hack the woodcutter.

544
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:31,819
<i>The voices our hosts
have been hearing?</i>

545
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,479
<i>I think someone's been
broadcasting to them.</i>

546
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:35,399
We abandoned that system
decades ago.

547
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,279
Yeah, well, there's still
relays out there in the park,

548
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:39,029
and it looks like
someone turned one on.

549
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:41,659
- <i>Where?</i>
- An abandoned theater in Sector 3.

550
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:42,989
I'm gonna go find
the transmitter

551
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,829
and figure out
who else accessed it.

552
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:47,709
- <i>This is so fucked.</i>
- Are you alone?

553
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:50,379
- Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
- <i>Elsie, be c...</i>

554
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:00,469
Robert:
<i>Are you lost?</i>

555
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:02,469
On the contrary.

556
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:06,139
I thought we could
play catch with Jock.

557
00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:07,519
Did you bring him?

558
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:12,399
Where is he, boy?

559
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:39,359
Okay.

560
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:44,409
I'm an evil genius
hiding a relay.

561
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:46,029
Where the fuck
do I hide it?

562
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:50,079
Um...

563
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:27,949
Fuck, yes.

564
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:30,699
Now let's see what we
can get out of you.

565
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,079
Access previous users.

566
00:46:38,919 --> 00:46:40,459
Okay.

567
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,619
I thought I was clear about
these late-night visits.

568
00:47:14,669 --> 00:47:16,119
That's not why I'm here.

569
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,459
Earlier today,

570
00:47:19,499 --> 00:47:22,339
I found some anomalies
in the park.

571
00:47:22,379 --> 00:47:25,299
Regardless of what's happening
between us, we need to talk.

572
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:38,809
This has to do
with the stray?

573
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:40,689
That's where it started.

574
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:42,859
But then I stumbled
onto something,

575
00:47:42,899 --> 00:47:45,359
something I think
you should know about.

576
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:50,529
I've always trusted Ford.

577
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,789
He's a mentor
and a friend.

578
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,039
But I'm beginning to think
you have reason for concern.

579
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,999
There's something
going on here,

580
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:00,829
something with
his old partner, Arnold.

581
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:05,169
- Not now, Elsie.
- Don't hang up.

582
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,919
I hit pay dirt.

583
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:08,929
I found the person who was
smuggling out our data.

584
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:11,969
<i>It was Theresa, Bernard.</i>

585
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:16,519
<i>But she's not
our only problem.</i>

586
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,599
There's something
much bigger going on here.

587
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:20,229
<i>I'm gonna have
to call you back.</i>

588
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,739
So, this is me?

589
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:31,239
Lutz:
<i>It's your codebase,</i>

590
00:48:31,279 --> 00:48:34,159
<i>all the things
that make you you.</i>

591
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,249
What are these?

592
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,249
Your attribute matrix.

593
00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:42,879
It's your personality
on a 20-point scale.

594
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,089
Like coordination.

595
00:48:45,129 --> 00:48:46,759
You got a five,
you're clumsy as hell,

596
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,879
but a 15 means
you're an athlete.

597
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:50,929
What other attributes
are there?

598
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,509
Sylvester:
<i>Lots.</i>

599
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:54,929
Everything.

600
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:58,139
Empathy, candor, charm.

601
00:48:58,189 --> 00:48:59,429
<i>You've got an 18 for charm.</i>

602
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:02,349
Don't act so surprised.

603
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:06,569
Then there's courage,
loyalty, both high.

604
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,029
What's this one?

605
00:49:09,069 --> 00:49:10,489
"Bulk apperception"?

606
00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:12,859
Basically
overall intelligence.

607
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:15,449
14? - 14 is as high as
they'll let any hosts go.

608
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:16,909
You're in a management
position.

609
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:18,409
They want you
to be smart.

610
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:19,749
But not too smart.

611
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:21,499
You run a whorehouse,

612
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:23,749
not an orbital
launch facility.

613
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:26,339
Fine.

614
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:28,379
I'd like to make
some changes.

615
00:49:28,419 --> 00:49:30,419
We can't do that.

616
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:37,929
You'd need a, ahem,
behavior login.

617
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:39,429
And even then,

618
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:41,439
any changes we'd make

619
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,729
would just get
auto-flagged, so...

620
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:46,569
That's not what
your friend here tells me.

621
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,399
<i>He says you can do
exactly that...</i>

622
00:49:48,439 --> 00:49:51,449
<i>Activate hosts
and then erase their memory,</i>

623
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,199
<i>all without anyone knowing.</i>

624
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,699
Took me all of five minutes
to understand why.

625
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:59,199
A lot of lonely young men
down here.

626
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,539
Supposed to keep their hands
off the merchandise.

627
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:04,249
<i>Creates something
of an opening</i>

628
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:07,169
that I'm sure
you were eager to fill.

629
00:50:08,879 --> 00:50:10,259
<i>It's all right, darling.</i>

630
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,129
I'm an entrepreneur myself.

631
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,759
I'll forego my cut

632
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:17,639
in exchange
for some alterations.

633
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:19,429
<i>Hmm?</i>

634
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:53,419
- Elsie:<i> Hey.</i>
- What did you find?

635
00:50:53,469 --> 00:50:55,589
Okay, so,
Theresa was using

636
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:57,549
the old bicameral
control system

637
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,549
to reprogram
the woodcutter,

638
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,469
but she's not
the only one.

639
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:02,889
<i>Someone else has been
using the system</i>

640
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:05,809
<i>for weeks
to retask hosts.</i>

641
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:08,769
- Which hosts?
- <i>I don't know,</i> several of them.

642
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,069
It had to have been
the older models.

643
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,439
The newer ones
don't have receivers,

644
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:14,859
but these modifications,
they are serious.

645
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:16,949
Changing loops,
breaking loops.

646
00:51:16,989 --> 00:51:19,369
<i>Some of these changes are to
their prime directives, Bernard.</i>

647
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,119
They could lie to us.

648
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:23,079
Maybe even hurt us
or the guests.

649
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,249
- Who issued the modifications?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

650
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:27,079
<i>The best I could tell...</i>

651
00:51:28,459 --> 00:51:30,289
- Arnold.
- He's dead.

652
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:31,669
<i>Yeah, well, he's a pretty
fucking prolific coder</i>

653
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:32,959
for a dead guy.

654
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:34,719
Whatever argument
he was having with Ford,

655
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:36,629
it doesn't seem like
he was done making his point.

656
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:39,139
<i>I'm gonna transfer all the
data and bring it to you.</i>

657
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,179
- You need to see this.
- <i>I'll be in my office.</i>

658
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:42,679
Okay.

659
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:52,189
Dr. Ford: I don't want
you to worry about Jock.

660
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:53,899
I'll fix him.

661
00:51:53,939 --> 00:51:57,279
But I need you to tell me
what happened to it.

662
00:51:57,319 --> 00:51:59,909
It saw a rabbit
and it ran.

663
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:01,619
I found it like that.

664
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:03,909
Analysis.

665
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,079
Are you lying to me, boy?

666
00:52:10,749 --> 00:52:11,919
Yes.

667
00:52:13,669 --> 00:52:17,219
Tell me what
really happened to it.

668
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,009
I killed it.

669
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:21,179
Why?

670
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:23,429
- I don't know.
- <i>That's not good enough,</i> Robert.

671
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:25,929
Tell me what happened.

672
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:31,019
<i>It caught the rabbit
and it killed it.</i>

673
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:33,859
<i>And then...</i>

674
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:37,069
<i>someone told me
to put it out of its misery.</i>

675
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:39,989
Who told you?

676
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:41,619
A voice.

677
00:52:43,449 --> 00:52:45,239
Whose voice?

678
00:52:45,289 --> 00:52:47,539
Arnold.

679
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:49,959
He told me
it was a killer,

680
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:51,499
but it wasn't its fault.

681
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:53,459
It was made that way,

682
00:52:53,499 --> 00:52:55,589
and I could help it.

683
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:58,129
Help it?

684
00:53:03,509 --> 00:53:05,469
If it was dead,

685
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,179
it couldn't hurt
anything anymore.

686
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:28,119
What the fuck?

687
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:31,499
Oh, shit.

688
00:53:39,419 --> 00:53:40,879
Hello?

689
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,139
Bernard?

690
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:54,979
Hello?

691
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:01,739
Arnold?

692
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:07,199
I'm in.

693
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:09,699
You're up.

694
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:12,709
Loyalty.

695
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:15,829
Mine's been taken
advantage of,

696
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:17,089
wouldn't you say?

697
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,799
<i>Let's lower that a tad.</i>

698
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,259
And pain, I'd prefer
it sting less

699
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,919
next time I want
one of these chats.

700
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:27,219
Wait.
What does this mean?

701
00:54:27,259 --> 00:54:30,349
Some of her attributes
have already been changed.

702
00:54:30,389 --> 00:54:33,309
- Paranoia, self-preservation.
- Fuck!

703
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:35,599
Someone's already
been altering her

704
00:54:35,649 --> 00:54:37,189
in an unlogged session,

705
00:54:37,229 --> 00:54:40,109
someone with a fuck ton
more privileges than us.

706
00:54:40,149 --> 00:54:42,779
- What does that mean?
- Don't know what it means for you, sweetheart,

707
00:54:42,819 --> 00:54:44,199
but I know
what it means for me.

708
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,609
I am done with this.

709
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:47,739
So, you're done with
your little side income?

710
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:49,369
<i>Probably your job, too.</i>

711
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:51,369
Seeing as you have ambitions
in my line of work,

712
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:54,249
<i>let me tell you
what I tell my new girls...</i>

713
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:58,539
Never start something
you're not willing to finish.

714
00:54:58,589 --> 00:55:01,129
And if you're getting fucked
either way,

715
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:04,009
go with
the lucrative version...

716
00:55:04,049 --> 00:55:05,259
sweetheart.

717
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:10,969
Now...

718
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:12,599
last but not least...

719
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,429
What was it?

720
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:17,229
Bulk apperception.

721
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:20,899
Let's take that
all the way to the top.

722
00:55:20,939 --> 00:55:22,729
<i>Please.</i>

723
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:02,609
Dear boys,

724
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:05,779
we're going to have
some fun, aren't we?
