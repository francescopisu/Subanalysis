1
00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:01,178
<i>Water</i>

2
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:03,651
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:05,895
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:07,937
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:12,073
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony</i>

6
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:16,401
<i>then everything changed
when the firenation attacked</i>

7
00:00:17,697 --> 00:00:21,347
<i>Only the avatar mastered
all four elements could stop them</i>

8
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:24,427
<i>but when the world needed
him most he vanished</i>

9
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:28,483
<i>100 years passed, my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

10
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:30,496
<i>airbinder named Aang</i>

11
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:33,037
<i>And although his airbinding
skill is great,</i>

12
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:35,869
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he is ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:39,499
<i>But I believe...
...Aang can save the world</i>

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,799
Even though I was born blind,
I've never had a problem seeing.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,630
I see with earthbending.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,570
Look here, sugar queen, I gave up everything I
had so that I could teach Aang earthbending,

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,360
Well, look at this. Enemies
and traitors all working together.

18
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:29,944
Today's the day!

19
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:31,214
Can you believe it?

20
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:33,454
After all that time
searching for a teacher,

21
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:35,634
I'm finally starting earthbending!

22
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:40,014
And this place...i-it's perfect!
Don't you think?

23
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:41,065
Sokka

24
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:44,585
Oh, you're still sleeping, huh?

25
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:47,825
Sorry!

26
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:53,894
Good morning earthbending student!

27
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:55,904
Good morning sifu Toph.

28
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:58,784
Hey! You never call me sifu Katara.

29
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,365
Well, if you think I should

30
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:07,065
Sorry, snoozles. We'll do our
earthbending as quietly as we can.

31
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:22,094
So what move are you
going to teach me first?

32
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:27,755
Rockalanche? The trembler? Oh!
Maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool out of land!

33
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:31,315
Let's start with move a rock.

34
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,595
Sounds good! Sounds good!

35
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,405
The key to earthbending is your stance.

36
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:39,965
You've got to be steady and strong.

37
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,965
Rock is a stubborn element.

38
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,755
If you're going to move it, you've
got to be like a rock yourself.

39
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:47,864
Like a rock. Got it.

40
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:51,545
Good. Now the actual motion
of this one is pretty simple.

41
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:58,355
Okay, you ready to give it a try?

42
00:02:58,405 --> 00:02:59,685
I'm ready.

43
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:06,055
Rock beats airbender!

44
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:12,905
I got you, dad!

45
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:26,215
My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.

46
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:30,885
Uncle! You were unconscious.

47
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:33,735
Azula did this to you.

48
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:35,595
It was a surprise attack.

49
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,885
Somehow, that's not so surprising.

50
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:44,075
I hope I made it the way you like it.

51
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,175
Good

52
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:54,495
That was very, uhh... bracing!

53
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:58,075
So uncle, I've been thinking.

54
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:01,425
It's only a matter of time
before I run into Azula again.

55
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:06,085
I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending
if I want to stand a chance against her.

56
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:09,664
I know what you're going to say: she's my sister
and I should be trying to get along with her.

57
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:13,935
No, she's crazy and she needs to go down.

58
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:23,545
It's time to resume your training.

59
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,535
I don't understand what went wrong.
He did it exactly the way you did.

60
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:31,424
Maybe there's another way. What if I
came at the boulder from a different angle?

61
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:33,565
No, that's the problem.

62
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,824
You've got to stop thinking
like an airbender.

63
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:41,225
There's no different angle, no clever solution,
no trickity trick that's going to move that rock.

64
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:43,435
You've got to face it head on.

65
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:46,725
And when I say head on, I mean like this!

66
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,435
I've been training Aang for a while now.

67
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:58,135
He really responds well to
a positive teaching experience.

68
00:04:58,155 --> 00:05:01,945
Lots of encouragement and praise.
Kind words.

69
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,805
If he's doing something wrong, maybe
a gentle nudge in the right direction.

70
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:10,025
Thanks Katara. A gentle nudge.
I'll try that.

71
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,515
Keep your knees high, twinkletoes!

72
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:34,255
Rocklike!

73
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:20,939
Rocklike!

74
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:37,895
You're awfully cute, but unfortunately
for you, you're made of meat.

75
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:40,535
Just a bit closer...

76
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:49,705
Gotcha!

77
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:56,565
You are one lucky little meat creature.

78
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:02,285
Lightning is a pure
expression of firebending,

79
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:03,365
without aggression.

80
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:08,065
It is not fueled by rage or
emotion the way other firebending is.

81
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,535
Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire.

82
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:14,825
It is precise and deadly, like Azula.

83
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:18,555
To perform the technique
requires peace of mind.

84
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:22,925
I see. That's why we're drinking tea:

85
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:23,924
To calm the mind.

86
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:25,675
Oh yeah, good point!

87
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,805
I mean, yes.

88
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:34,035
There is energy all around us.
The energy is both yin and yang

89
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:37,145
positive energy and negative energy.

90
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:41,515
Only a select few firebenders
can separate these energies.

91
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:46,265
This creates an imbalance. The
energy wants to restore balance ...

92
00:07:46,815 --> 00:07:51,585
and in a moment the positive and negative
energy come crashing back together.

93
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:57,255
You provide release and
guidance, creating lightning.

94
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,825
I'm ready to try it!

95
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,665
Remember, once you separate
the energy, you do not command it.

96
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,985
You are simply its humble guide.

97
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:20,725
Breathe first.

98
00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:40,805
This time we're going to try something a
little different. Instead of moving a rock,

99
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,195
you're going to stop a rock.

100
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:44,505
Get in your horse stance!

101
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:48,435
I'm going to roll that boulder down at you.

102
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:53,745
If you have the attitude of an earthbender,
you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock.

103
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:56,215
Like this

104
00:08:56,825 --> 00:09:01,365
Sorry Toph, but are you sure this is really
the best way to teach Aang earthbending?

105
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:05,375
I'm glad you said something.
Actually, there is a better way.

106
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:09,845
This way he'll really have to sense
the vibrations of the boulder to stop it.

107
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:11,805
Thank you Katara.

108
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,385
Yeah, thanks Katara!

109
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:42,224
I guess I just panicked.
I don't know what to say.

110
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:44,264
There's nothing to say.

111
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:47,864
You blew it. You had a perfect
stance and perfect form ...

112
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:51,424
but when it came right down
to it you didn't have the guts.

113
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:53,924
I know. I'm sorry.

114
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:57,954
Yeah, you are sorry. If you're
not tough enough to stop the rock,

115
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:03,733
then you could at least give it the pleasure of smushing you
instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp!

116
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:08,334
Now, do you have what it takes
to face that rock like an earthbender!?

117
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:12,424
No. I don't think I do.

118
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:17,264
Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break
and try earthbending again when you're ready.

119
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:20,653
Besides, you still have a lot
of waterbending to work on, okay?

120
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,884
Yeah, that sounds good.

121
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:27,684
Yeah, whatever, go splash
around until you feel better.

122
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:36,134
Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning,
it keeps exploding in my face!

123
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:38,114
Like everything always does!

124
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,744
I was afraid this might happen.

125
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:46,804
You will not be able to master lightning until
you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.

126
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,154
What turmoil?

127
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:54,044
Zuko, you must let go of your feelings
of shame if you want your anger to go away.

128
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:57,334
But I don't feel any shame
at all! I'm as proud as ever!

129
00:10:57,364 --> 00:11:00,584
Prince Zuko, pride is not
the object of shame,

130
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:01,814
but its source.

131
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:04,924
True humility is the
only antidote to shame.

132
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:08,844
Well, my life has been
nothing but humbling lately.

133
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,174
I have another idea.

134
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:16,494
I will teach you a firebending
move that even Azula doesn't know,

135
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:19,034
because I made it up myself!

136
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:26,544
You probably think I
deserve this, don't you?

137
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:32,203
Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but
that's just the natural order of things!

138
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,914
Big things eat smaller
things, nothing personal!

139
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:37,634
But this time it didn't work out that way.

140
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:42,224
I admit it. You're cute.

141
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,524
Okay, you've convinced me.

142
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:50,434
If I get out of this alive, it's a comically
correct vegetarian existence for me.

143
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:55,694
No meat. Even though meat is so tasty.

144
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:09,044
It looks like my karma
is already paying off!

145
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:11,754
That's okay! I got it!

146
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:18,084
Now come back boomerang.

147
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:29,873
You know this block you're
having is only temporary, right?

148
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,364
I don't want to talk about it.

149
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,334
You do know that's the problem, don't you?

150
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:37,074
If you face this issue
instead of avoiding it...

151
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,394
I know I know I know I
know, I get it, alright!

152
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:41,704
I need to face it head-on, like a rock.

153
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:45,764
But I just can't do it! I don't
know why I can't, but I can't.

154
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:49,984
Aang, if fire and water are opposites,
then what's the opposite of air?

155
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:51,514
I guess it's earth.

156
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:54,354
That's why it's so hard
for you to get this.

157
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:58,814
You're working with your natural opposite.
But you'll figure it out. I know you will.

158
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,504
Think fast!

159
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:06,553
Excellent.

160
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:09,674
You have the reflexes of
a waterbending master.

161
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:11,634
Thanks Katara.

162
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:13,264
Sifu Katara.

163
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,394
Fire is the element of power.

164
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:25,754
The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will,
and the energy and drive to achieve what they want.

165
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,704
Earth is the element of substance.

166
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:36,594
The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong.
They are persistent and enduring.

167
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:39,214
Air is the element of freedom.

168
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:46,794
The Air Nomads detached themselves from
worldly concerns and found peace and freedom.

169
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:50,704
Also, they apparently had
pretty good senses of humor!

170
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:57,184
Water is the element of change.

171
00:13:57,224 --> 00:14:01,954
The people of the Water Tribe
are capable of adapting to many things.

172
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:08,614
They have a deep sense of community and love
that holds them together through anything.

173
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:11,734
Why are you telling me these things?

174
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:15,724
It is important to draw wisdom
from many different places.

175
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:20,964
If we take it from only one
place, it becomes rigid and stale.

176
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:26,004
Understanding others, the other
elements, and the other nations ...

177
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:27,764
will help you become whole.

178
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:31,854
All this four elements talk
is sounding like Avatar stuff.

179
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:38,404
It is the combination of the four elements in
one person that makes the Avatar so powerful.

180
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:41,314
But, it can make you more powerful too.

181
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:46,824
You see, the technique I am about to teach you
is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.

182
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:58,474
Aang! I found these nuts in your bag.

183
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:01,524
I think you would't mind. And besides,

184
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:04,924
even if you did, you're too much
of a pushover to do anything about it.

185
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:09,474
As a matter of fact, I don't mind.
I'm happy to share anything I have.

186
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:11,884
You know, I'm really
glad you feel that way,

187
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:15,764
because I also have this
great new nutcracker.

188
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:22,344
Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't.
..That's an antique,

189
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:25,674
hand crafted by the monks.
..lt's a delicate instrument!

190
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:28,384
It's not the only delicate
instrument around here.

191
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,203
Hey Aang, have you seen...

192
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,254
Meditating here!

193
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:43,244
It's important. It's almost
sundown and Sokka isn't back yet.

194
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:44,854
I think we should search for him.

195
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:47,364
We'll find him faster if we split up.

196
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:54,504
Okay karma person or thing,
whoever's in charge of this stuff,

197
00:15:54,534 --> 00:16:00,876
if I can just get out of this situation
alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. OK?

198
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:03,094
OW! That's all I got!

199
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,393
It's pretty much my whole identity!

200
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,964
Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy!

201
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:11,863
But I'm willing to be Sokka
the veggies and straight talk fellow!

202
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:12,914
Deal?

203
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:17,134
Aang! Thank goodness!
Have you got any meat?

204
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:19,024
Sokka! Are you okay?

205
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:25,394
Stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off
and I don't think the rest of me is coming!

206
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:29,354
Hmm... I bet I can airbend you out of here.

207
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:40,394
Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could
use a little earthbending here. How about it?

208
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,523
I can't.

209
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:43,914
I can't do it.

210
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,758
Well if you can't earthbend
me out of here, go get Toph.

211
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,929
I can't do that either.

212
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:54,464
You can't? Why not?

213
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,293
It would just be really...uncomfortable.

214
00:16:58,294 --> 00:17:01,774
Uncomfortable? Well, I wouldn't
want to make you feel uncomfortable.

215
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:02,878
Thanks Sokka.

216
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,949
This whole earthbending
thing really has me confused.

217
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:10,259
There's so much pressure. Everyone
expects me to get it right away.

218
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,029
It puts me in a really awkward position.

219
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,558
Awkward position?
I think I know the feeling.

220
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,289
If I try, I fail. But if I don't
try, I'm never going to get it.

221
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,652
I feel like I'm caught between
a rock and a hard place.

222
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,219
How about that.

223
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:29,749
Aang, this is my friend Foo Foo Cuddlypoops.
Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.

224
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,809
Aww, what a cute name for a
little baby sabertooth mooselion cub.

225
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,949
Really? He looks nothing
like a sabertooth mooselion.

226
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,929
It's hard to tell before their
giant teeth and horns grow in.

227
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:43,569
Whatcha doin' out here, little
guy? Did you lose your mama?

228
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:54,629
Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy.

229
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,439
A waterbender lets their
defense become their offense,

230
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:01,489
turning their opponents'
energy against them.

231
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,159
I learned a way to do this with lightning.

232
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,419
You can teach me to redirect lightning?

233
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:12,109
If you let the energy in your own
body flow, the lightning will follow it.

234
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:19,849
You must create a pathway from your fingertips up
your arm to your shoulder and down into your stomach.

235
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:23,049
The stomach is the source
of energy in your body.

236
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,879
It is called the sea of chi.

237
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:30,579
Only in my case, it is
more like a vast ocean.

238
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:38,399
From the stomach, you direct
it up again and out the other arm.

239
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,789
The stomach detour is critical.
You must not let the lightning pass through your heart

240
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,729
or the damage could be deadly.

241
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:53,689
You may wish to try a physical motion
to get a feel for the pathway's flow.

242
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,786
Like this.

243
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:08,569
Now, are you focusing your energy?
Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?

244
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,789
I think so.

245
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:15,669
Come on. You've got to feel the flow.

246
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:23,559
Excellent! You've got it!

247
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,239
Great! I'm ready to try
it with real lightning!

248
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:28,229
What, are you crazy?

249
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,028
Lightning is very dangerous.

250
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:34,179
I thought that was the point: You
teaching me how to protect myself from it.

251
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,849
Yah, But I'm not going to
shoot lightning at you!

252
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:42,829
If you are lucky, you will never
have to use this technique at all.

253
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,159
Well, if you won't help
me, I'll find my own lightning.

254
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:57,249
Hey there? We found your cub!

255
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:07,089
See? We have no problem with you!
We're friendly.

256
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:10,449
Aang, this is bad!
You gotta get me outta here!

257
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:24,339
This is really bad!

258
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:28,019
Please, Aang! You have to earthbend
me out, there's no other way!

259
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,009
Oh no

260
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,559
Whoo-hoo! Look at me!

261
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,198
Please don't leave me again.

262
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,249
I won't.

263
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:13,055
What are you doing here?

264
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:14,635
Just enjoying the show.

265
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:15,634
What?

266
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:17,135
You were there the whole time?

267
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:18,324
Pretty much.

268
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:20,055
Why didn't you do something?

269
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,675
Sokka was in trouble!

270
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:22,815
I was in trouble!

271
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,375
You could've gotten him
out and helped us get away!

272
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,205
I guess it just didn't occur to me.

273
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:35,205
Enough! I want my staff back!

274
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:37,434
Do it now.

275
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:38,404
What?

276
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:40,115
Earthbend, twinkletoes.

277
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:43,345
You just stood your ground
against a crazy beast,

278
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:46,384
and even more impressive,
you stood your ground against me.

279
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:48,327
You've got the stuff.

280
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:48,914
But...

281
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:49,965
Do it!

282
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:54,585
You did it!

283
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,575
You're an earthbender.

284
00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:57,955
I can't believe it!

285
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:01,665
Aww, this is really a
wonderful, touching moment.

286
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:06,135
So, could you get me out of here so
I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?

287
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:07,705
No problem, Sokka!

288
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:12,515
Actually, you should probably let me do that.
You're still a little new to this.

289
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:14,225
You might accidentally crush him.

290
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,935
Yeah, no crushing please.

291
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:24,665
You found him!

292
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:29,835
The whole time that I was in that
hole, not knowing if I would live or die,

293
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,025
it makes a man think about
what's really important.

294
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,254
I realize...

295
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:35,825
Hey Katara, look what I can do!

296
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:40,415
You did it!

297
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:41,505
I knew you would!

298
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:44,405
You tried the positive
reinforcement, didn't you?

299
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,645
Yep. It worked wonders.

300
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:53,895
Appa! Appa! I can earthbend now!
The key is being completely rooted!

301
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:56,395
Physically and mentally unmovable!

302
00:23:03,746 --> 00:23:08,484
You've always thrown
everything you could at me!

303
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:12,625
Well I can take it!
And now I can give it back!

304
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:18,805
Come on! Strike me!

305
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:20,695
You've never held back before!

306
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:35,517
