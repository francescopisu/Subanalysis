1
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:10,430
We need to find King Bumi so Aang
can learn earthbending somewhere safe.

2
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,775
Sounds like you're headed to Omashu.

3
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:18,227
I present to you the Earth
Kingdom city of O... Oh, no...

4
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:20,930
I guess I need to find someone
else to teach me earthbending.

5
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:25,959
You need to find someone who
waits and listens before striking.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:31,126
In the swamp we see visions of
people we've lost, people we loved...

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,872
But what about my vision?
It was someone I had never met.

8
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:48,681
It's pricey, but I really do like it.

9
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,354
Then you should get it.
You deserve something nice.

10
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:56,130
I do, don't I? But no. It's
too expensive, I shouldn't.

11
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:58,667
Alright, then don't.

12
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,383
You know what? I'm gonna get it.

13
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:09,965
Psst, psst. Hey, you kids like
earthbending? You like throwing rocks?

14
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:14,399
Then check out Master Yu's
Earthbending Academy.

15
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,712
Look, there's a coupon on the back.
The first lesson is free.

16
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,631
Who knows? This Master Yu could be...

17
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:25,472
the earthbending teacher
you've been looking for.

18
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:37,019
Take your stances.

19
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:42,409
Now, strike as if you're punching
through your opponents head!

20
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:48,906
So, are you ready to
commit to more lessons?

21
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:55,790
If you pay for the whole year in advance,
I'll bump you up to the next belt.

22
00:01:57,202 --> 00:02:00,102
Ah, he's not the one.

23
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:03,691
I think The Boulder is gonna
win back the belt at Earth Rumble 6.

24
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:06,302
He's gonna have to fight his
way through the best earthbenders...

25
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:08,394
in the world to even
get a shot at the champ.

26
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,266
Excuse me, but where is this
earthbending tournament exactly?

27
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:16,998
It's on the Island of Noneoya.
.. none o' ya business!

28
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,057
Oh, I got to remember that one.

29
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,277
I'll take care of this.

30
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,276
Hey strong guys, wait up!

31
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:34,992
What was I thinking? I don't need a new bag.
Why'd you let me buy this?

32
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:39,041
You ready to find an earthbending teacher?

33
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,785
Because we're going to Earth Rumble 6!

34
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,640
How did you get them to tell you?

35
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:47,174
Oh, a girl has her ways.

36
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,889
Hey, front row seats! I wonder
why no one else is sitting here.

37
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,258
I guess that's why.

38
00:03:08,194 --> 00:03:15,347
Welcome to Earth Rumble 6!
I am your host, Shin Fu!

39
00:03:15,348 --> 00:03:19,007
This is just gonna be a bunch of guys
chuckin' rocks at each other, isn't it?

40
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,820
That's what I paid for.

41
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:27,849
The rules are simple. Just knock the
other guy out of the ring and you win.

42
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:37,647
Round one! The Boulder
versus The Big Bad Hippo!

43
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:42,674
Listen up, Hippo. You
may be big, but you ain't bad!

44
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:47,076
The Boulder's gonna win
this in a landslide.

45
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:50,920
Hippo mad!

46
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:07,711
Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen!
The Hippo is rocking The Boulder!

47
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:23,426
The Boulder wins!

48
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,724
How about The Boulder?
He's got some good moves.

49
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:30,664
I don't know. Bumi said I need
a teacher who listens to the earth.

50
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:34,947
He's just listening to his big muscles.
What do you think Sokka?

51
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:43,759
Next match, The Boulder
versus Fire Nation Man!

52
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:48,332
Boo! Boo!

53
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:53,258
Please to rise for Fire
Nation national anthem.

54
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:59,868
? Fire Lord, my flame burns for thee!?

55
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:03,400
Go back to the Fire Nation!

56
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:10,673
No. No please!

57
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:24,647
Yeah! Whoo! The Boulder knows how
to put the hurt in the dirt! Yeah! Whoo!

58
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:50,005
Now, the moment you've all been waiting for.
The Boulder versus your champion...

59
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,039
The Blind Bandit!

60
00:05:57,343 --> 00:06:01,609
She can't really be blind. It's
just part of her character, right?

61
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:03,139
I think she is.

62
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:05,850
I think she is... Going down!

63
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:12,716
The Boulder feels conflicted
about fighting a young, blind girl.

64
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:16,703
Sounds to me like you're scared, Boulder.

65
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:19,963
The Boulder's over his
conflicted feelings, ...

66
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:23,961
and now he's ready
to bury you in a rock-a-lanche!

67
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:27,867
Whenever you're ready... The Pebble.

68
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:37,660
It's on!

69
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:19,652
Your winner, and still
the champion, The Blind Bandit!

70
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,454
No!

71
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,215
How did she do that?

72
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:27,679
She waited, and listened.

73
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,828
To make things a little
more interesting, ...

74
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:39,504
I'm offering up this sack of gold pieces
to anyone who can defeat The Blind Bandit!

75
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:43,317
What? No one dares to face her?

76
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:45,366
I will!

77
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:51,989
Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder!

78
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:57,482
Do people really want to see
two little girls fighting out here?

79
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:01,308
I don't really want to fight you.
I want to talk to you.

80
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:03,545
Boo! No talking!

81
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:05,702
Don't boo at him.

82
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,879
Somebody's a little light on his feet.

83
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,726
What's your fighting
name, The Fancy Dancer?

84
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:23,803
Where'd you go?

85
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,290
Please, wait!

86
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:27,485
There you are!

87
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:41,401
Please listen!
I need an earthbending teacher, ...

88
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:43,611
and I think it's supposed to be you.

89
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:47,273
Whoever you are, just leave me alone.

90
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,071
Wait!

91
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,750
Way to go, champ!

92
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:08,586
I gotta admit, now I'm
really glad I bought this bag.

93
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:11,225
It matches the belt perfectly.

94
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:13,241
That is a big relief.

95
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,011
If we want to find The Blind Bandit, ...

96
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,477
the Earthbending Academy
is a good place to start.

97
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:24,283
Oh great, you again.

98
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:27,493
Yeah, I didn't think so.

99
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:28,812
Nicely done.

100
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:31,546
Hey, you're the kid who
beat The Blind Bandit.

101
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:34,880
We need to talk to her.
Do you guys know where she lives?

102
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:40,426
The Blind Bandit's a mystery.
She shows up to fight, then disappears.

103
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:44,310
Let me handle this. You're
not telling us everything!

104
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:49,035
No no, I swear it's true! No one knows
where she goes, or who she really is.

105
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:51,927
That's because we're asking
about the wrong person.

106
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:56,381
In my vision, I saw a girl in
a white dress with a pet flying boar.

107
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:57,688
Know anybody like that?

108
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,950
Well, a flying boar is the
symbol of the Bei Fong family.

109
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:04,621
They're the richest people
in town, probably the whole world.

110
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:06,624
Yeah, but they don't have a daughter.

111
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:09,597
Flying boar is good enough for me.
Let's check it out.

112
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:11,889
Yeah, you better leave.

113
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,067
Hey, I've got my eye on you.

114
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,144
Water Tribe.

115
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:21,261
I'm telling you, The Boulder
was standing right there.

116
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:24,670
I saw the kid strike,
but there was no earthbending.

117
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:28,994
Nothing made contact. The Blind
Bandit just fell out of the ring.

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,860
She must have took a dive
and split the money with the kid.

119
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,567
Nobody cheats Xin Fu.

120
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:49,687
That's the flying boar from my vision.
Come on.

121
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:06,510
What are you doing here, Twinkle Toes?

122
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:07,827
How did you know it was me?

123
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,913
Don't answer to Twinkle Toes.
It's not manly!

124
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:13,567
You're the one whose bag matches his belt.

125
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,031
How did you find me?

126
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:18,919
Well, a crazy king told me I had to find
an earthbender who listens to the earth.

127
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:21,038
And then I had a vision
in a magic swamp and...

128
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:24,444
What Aang is trying to
say is, he's the Avatar, ...

129
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,292
and if he doesn't master
earthbending soon...

130
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:28,716
he won't be able to
defeat the Fire Lord.

131
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:33,699
Not my problem. Now get out
of here or I'll call the guards.

132
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,123
Look, we all have to do
our part to win this war.

133
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:39,165
And yours is to teach Aang earthbending.

134
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:43,333
Guards! Guards, help!

135
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,380
Toph, what happened?

136
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,410
I thought I heard someone. I got scared.

137
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:52,136
You know your father doesn't want you...

138
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:56,375
wandering the grounds
without supervision, Toph.

139
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,124
I'm pleased to hear that Toph's
private lessons are going well, ...

140
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,828
but I want to be sure that she's
not trying anything too dangerous.

141
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,936
Absolutely not. I'm keeping
her at the beginner's level.

142
00:12:14,937 --> 00:12:18,400
Basic forms and breathing exercises only.

143
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:20,229
Very good.

144
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:24,077
Excuse me sir, but you have a visitor.

145
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,736
Who thinks they are so important they
can just come to my home unannounced?

146
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:32,198
Uh, the Avatar, Sir.

147
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,831
Blow on it. It's too hot for her.

148
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,315
Allow me.

149
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,098
Oh my!

150
00:12:50,107 --> 00:12:54,329
Avatar Aang, it's an honor
to have you visit us.

151
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,503
In your opinion, how much longer
do you think the war will last?

152
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:02,055
I'd like to defeat the Fire
Lord by the end of summer, ...

153
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:06,444
but I can't do that without
finding an earthbending teacher first.

154
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:09,933
Well, Master Yu is the
finest teacher in the land.

155
00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:12,326
He's been teaching Toph
since she was little.

156
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:15,050
Then she must be a great earthbender, ...

157
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:18,711
probably good enough
to teach someone else.

158
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,982
Toph is still learning the basics.

159
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:26,827
Yes, and sadly because
of her blindness, ...

160
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:30,566
I don't think she will
ever become a true master.

161
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:34,388
Oh, I'm sure she's better
than you think she is.

162
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:51,887
What's your problem?

163
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:54,514
What's your problem?

164
00:13:56,176 --> 00:14:01,992
Well, shall we move to the
living room for dessert then?

165
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,357
Good night buddy.

166
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:16,616
Relax. Look, I'm sorry about dinner.
Let's call a truce, okay?

167
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:21,988
Even though I was born blind,
I've never had a problem seeing.

168
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:26,584
I see with earthbending. It's
kind of like seeing with my feet.

169
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:31,970
I feel the vibrations in the earth,
and I can see where everything is.

170
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:37,407
You, that tree, even those ants.

171
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,670
That's amazing.

172
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,571
My parents don't understand. They've
always treated me like I was helpless.

173
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:49,292
Is that why you became The Blind Bandit?

174
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,486
Yeah.

175
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:52,904
Then why stay here where you're not happy?

176
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:57,699
They're my parents. Where
else am I supposed to go?

177
00:14:57,702 --> 00:14:58,862
You could come with us.

178
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:02,168
Yeah. You guys get to go wherever you want.

179
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:10,429
No one telling you what to do, that's the life.
It's just not my life.

180
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:13,829
We're being ambushed.

181
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:34,917
I think you kids owe me some money.

182
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:42,289
Whoever took Aang and Toph left this.

183
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,668
"If you want to see your daughter
again, bring 500 gold pieces to the arena."

184
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:48,942
It's signed "Xin Fu and The Boulder."

185
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:51,032
I can't believe it.

186
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:54,605
I have the Boulder's autograph!

187
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:58,532
Master Yu, I need you to
help you get my daughter back.

188
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:00,948
We're going with you.

189
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:04,083
Poor Toph. She must be so scared.

190
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,503
You think you're so tough...

191
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,771
why don't you come up here
so I can smack that grin off your face?

192
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:10,751
I'm not smiling.

193
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,816
Toph!

194
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,470
Here's your money. Now let them go.

195
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:27,463
What about Aang?

196
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:31,667
I think the Fire Nation will
pay a hefty price for the Avatar.

197
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:36,241
Now, get out of my ring.

198
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:53,397
Go. I'll be ok.

199
00:16:55,725 --> 00:17:00,821
Toph, there's too many of them.
We need an earthbender. We need you!

200
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:06,220
My daughter is blind. She is blind
and tiny and helpless and fragile.

201
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:08,330
She cannot help you.

202
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,938
Yes, I can.

203
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:21,835
Let him go. I beat you all
before, and I'll do it again.

204
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:25,913
The Boulder takes issue with that comment.

205
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,751
Wait.

206
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:37,013
They're mine.

207
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,575
Hit it harder!

208
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:27,842
I'm trying!

209
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:32,227
I never knew. Your daughter's amazing.

210
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:28,990
She's the greatest
earthbender I've ever seen!

211
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:32,971
Dad, I know it's probably
hard for you to see me this way, ...

212
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:38,013
but the obedient little helpless blind
girl that you think I am just isn't me.

213
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:45,190
I love fighting. I love being an earthbender.
And I'm really, really good at it.

214
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:47,463
I know I've kept my life
secret from you, ...

215
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:50,591
but you were keeping
me secret from the whole world.

216
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:52,330
You were doing it to protect me.

217
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:57,384
But I'm twelve years old
and I've never had a real friend.

218
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:59,579
So now that you see who I really am, ...

219
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,982
I hope it doesn't change
the way you feel about me.

220
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:05,552
Of course it doesn't change
the way I feel about you, Toph.

221
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,855
It's made me realize something.

222
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:09,113
It has?

223
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:12,799
Yes. I've let you have
far too much freedom.

224
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:17,109
From now on, you will be cared
for and guarded 24 hours a day.

225
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,064
But dad!

226
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:20,861
We are doing this for your own good, Toph.

227
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:27,042
Please escort the Avatar and his friends out.
They are no longer welcome here.

228
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:28,519
I'm sorry, Toph.

229
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,936
I'm sorry, too. Good bye, Aang.

230
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:39,826
Don't worry. We'll find you a teacher.

231
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:42,634
There are plenty of amazing
earthbenders out there.

232
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,927
Not like her.

233
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:56,124
Toph! What are you doing here?

234
00:21:56,126 --> 00:22:01,646
My dad changed his mind. He
said I was free to travel the world.

235
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:06,205
Well, we'd better get out of here.
.. before your dad changes his mind again.

236
00:22:06,215 --> 00:22:07,767
Good idea.

237
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:10,152
You're gonna be a great teacher, Toph.

238
00:22:10,156 --> 00:22:13,525
Speaking of which, I want
to show you something.

239
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,612
Okay.

240
00:22:16,523 --> 00:22:18,128
Now we're even.

241
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:21,627
Um, I'll take the belt back.

242
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:26,664
Sorry.

243
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:30,133
I know you two are very different...

244
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:33,917
but I believe you
have a common interest.

245
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:40,003
The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter.

246
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:47,106
I want you to do whatever
it takes to bring her home.

247
