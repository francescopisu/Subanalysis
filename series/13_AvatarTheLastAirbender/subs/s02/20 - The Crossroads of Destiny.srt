218
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,567
Oh?

219
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:18,926
The Earth King's trust.

220
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:21,208
Why should i help you?

221
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:25,053
Because i can get you the Avatar.

222
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,677
I'm listening.

223
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:34,232
A message from the royal palace.

224
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:40,150
I... i can't believe it.

225
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,151
What is it Uncle?

226
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:48,495
Great news! We've been invited
to serve tea to the Earth King!

227
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:14,071
So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?

228
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:17,482
I don't know. In my vision,
i just knew she needed help.

229
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:22,170
It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be
just a little more specific from time to time.

230
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,141
What is that?!

231
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:30,765
Need a ride?
Ahhh!

232
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:32,126
Oooo!

233
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:40,420
The Earth King and The Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li.
They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng.

234
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:46,943
Soon they will turn on all of you, and eliminate you.
Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.

235
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:54,968
The coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King, and
each of the five generals, must be taken out simultaneously.

236
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:59,231
Long Feng has placed you in my command
while we overthrow the government.

237
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:10,723
If i sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any
weakness at all, i will snuff it out. That is all.

238
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:18,412
Nice speech Azula. It was pretty
and poetic, but also scary in a good way.

239
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:22,221
Yeah, i thought you were gonna
make that one guy pee his pants.

240
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:27,250
There are still a few loose ends.
The Avatar, and my brother and Uncle.

241
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:28,251
Many times, i imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace.
But i always thought i would be here as a conqueror... instead,

242
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:44,804
we are the Earth Kings personal guests, here
to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.

243
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:46,370
It sure is Uncle.

244
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:51,054
So how did it go with the Guru?
Did you master the Avatar State?

245
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:56,679
If you leave now, you won't be able
to go into the avatar state at all!

246
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,028
Aang, are you ok?

247
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:06,212
I'm great. It went great with the Guru.
I completely mastered the avatar state.

248
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,722
What's taking so long?

249
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:17,979
Maybe the Earth King overslept.

250
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,965
Something's not right.

251
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:27,490
It's tea time.

252
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:29,032
Azula!

253
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:37,117
Have you met the Dai Li? They're Earthbenders, but they have
a killer instinct that is so Firebender, i just love it!

254
00:26:37,118 --> 00:26:42,694
Did i ever tell you how i got
the nickname the "Dragon of the West"?

255
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:45,942
I'm not interested in a
lengthy anecdote, Uncle.

256
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:48,439
It's more of a demonstration really.

257
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:13,328
Come on. You'll be fine.

258
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:18,001
No. I'm tired of running.
It's time i faced Azula!

259
00:27:22,158 --> 00:27:27,358
You're so dramatic. What, are you
going to do, challenge me to an Agni Kai?

260
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,717
Yes! i challenge you!

261
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:30,831
No thanks.

262
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:49,650
Katara's fine.
You have nothing to worry about.

263
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:50,651
But, in my vision. i felt
so sure that she was in trouble.

264
00:27:50,652 --> 00:28:00,619
Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion.
And since then she's been off with your friends, the Kyoshi Warriors.

265
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,913
See Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our
apartment right now, talking about make up or something.

266
00:28:05,914 --> 00:28:08,247
Ok, maybe you're right.

267
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:13,515
Believe me, if there was any danger at all,
Bosco's animal instinct would sense it.

268
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:24,409
You've got company.

269
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,442
Zuko!

270
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:43,265
Momo!

271
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:48,283
There's no one else here.

272
00:28:48,284 --> 00:28:50,660
Katara is in trouble! i knew it!

273
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,030
Oh no.

274
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:55,774
Wait, someone's at the door.

275
00:28:55,775 --> 00:29:01,575
Actually, i know who it is. It's an old friend of mine.
Glad to see you're okay.

276
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:03,244
I need your help.

277
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:05,827
Huh uh?!

278
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:12,148
You guys know each other!

279
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:16,751
I met him in the woods once and knocked him down.
Then he gave me tea and very good advice.

280
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:19,594
May i come in?

281
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:24,655
Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.

282
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:26,119
She must have Katara.

283
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,684
She has captured my nephew as well.

284
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:32,484
Then we'll work together to fight
Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.

285
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:35,554
Woah there. You lost me at, "Zuko".

286
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:42,573
I know how you must feel about my nephew.
But believe me when i tell you there is good inside him

287
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:47,219
Good inside of him isn't enough.
Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay?

288
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:53,199
Katara is in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble.
Working together is our best chance.

289
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,685
I brought someone along
who might be able to help us.

290
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:12,030
Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup.
They're going to overthrow the Earth King.

291
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:15,183
My sister! Where are they keeping Katara

292
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:18,758
In the crystal catacombs of old
Ba Sing Se, deep beneath the palace.

293
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:25,362
The movements of all the generals and the Earth
King have been plotted out step by step.

294
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:29,476
Good. And the Fire Nation
Princess is cooperating?

295
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:39,497
Oh yes! More than cooperating, she's really taken charge.
She's terrifying and inspirational all at the same time. It's hard to explain.

296
00:30:44,272 --> 00:30:49,470
Why did they throw you in here?
Oh wait. Let me guess. It's a trap.

297
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:54,221
So when Aang shows up to rescue me, you can finally
have him in your little Fire Nation clutches.

298
00:30:57,143 --> 00:31:04,302
You're a terrible person, you know that? Always following us, hunting
the Avatar, trying to capture the world's last hope for peace!

299
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:11,320
But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son.
Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood.

300
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:12,939
You don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:23,429
I don't?! How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through.
Me personally. The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.

302
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:30,569
I'm sorry.
That's something we have in common.

303
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:39,414
Well whaddya know. There is an
ancient city down there, but it's deep.

304
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:47,747
We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to
look for Katara and the angry jerk... no offense.

305
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:49,005
None taken.

306
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:52,066
And I'll go with Toph to warn
the Earth King about Azula's coup.

307
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:05,513
So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice.
And great tea.

308
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:09,651
The key to both is proper aging.
What's on your mind?

309
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:19,539
Well, i met with this Guru who was supposed to help me
master the avatar state, and control this great power.

310
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
But to do it, i had to let go
of someone i love, and i just couldn't.

311
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:32,359
Perfection and power are overrated.
I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.

312
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:40,348
What happens if we can't save everyone and beat Azula?
Without the Avatar State, what if i am not powerful enough?

313
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:53,307
I don't know the answer. Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel.
You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving...

314
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:59,951
You will come to a better place.

315
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,663
Arghh! What's going on here?!

316
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:24,700
You're under house arrest.

317
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:28,299
The coup is happening right now!
We've got to warn the Earth King!

318
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:50,683
Thank goodness we're in time!

319
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:52,070
In time for what?

320
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:57,786
Yeah, what are you in time for...
cutie?

321
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:00,872
Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.

322
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,923
Who?

323
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:06,474
They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!

324
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:09,536
Sorry to disappoint you.

325
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:22,622
Ooo, it's like we're dancing together.

326
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:25,836
This fight... is over.

327
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:38,073
Get them all out of my sight.

328
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:57,968
Now comes the part where i double-cross you.
Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation Princess.

329
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:03,540
I said, arrest her. What is wrong with you?

330
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:08,221
It's because they haven't made up their minds.
They're waiting to see how this is going to end.

331
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:10,130
What are you talking about?

332
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:14,331
I can see your whole history in your eyes.
You were born with nothing.

333
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:24,347
So you had to struggle and connive and claw your way to power. But true power.
.. the divine right to rule... is something you're born with.

334
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:31,359
The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be
sitting on that thrown and which one is going to be bowing down.

335
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:37,110
But i know. And you know.
Well?

336
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:46,257
You've beaten me at my own game.

337
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:50,338
Don't flatter yourself.
You were never even a player.

338
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:54,257
I'm sorry i yelled at you before.

339
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:55,616
It doesn't matter.

340
00:35:55,617 --> 00:36:01,849
It's just that for so long now, whenever i would
imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.

341
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:04,281
My face. i see

342
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:06,621
No, no, that's not what i meant.

343
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,921
It's ok. i used to think
this scar marked me.

344
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:13,932
The mark of the banished prince,
cursed to chase the Avatar forever.

345
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:21,181
But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my
own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.

346
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:23,955
Maybe you could be free of it.

347
00:36:23,956 --> 00:36:24,801
What?

348
00:36:24,802 --> 00:36:26,176
I have healing abilities.

349
00:36:26,177 --> 00:36:28,827
It's a scar. It can't be healed.

350
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:40,542
This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so
i have be saving it for something important. i don't know if it would work, but...

351
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:53,703
Aang!

352
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:07,000
Aang, i knew you would come.

353
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:08,001
Uncle, i don't understand.
What are you doing with the Avatar

354
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:12,614
Saving you, that's what.

355
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:19,307
Zuko, it's time we talked. Go help your other friends.
We'll catch up with you.

356
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:28,407
Why Uncle?

357
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:36,390
You are not the man you used to be, Zuko.
You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been.

358
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:45,351
And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny.
It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good!

359
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:59,142
I expected this kind of treachery from Uncle, but Zuko, Prince Zuko.
.. you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?

360
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,136
Release him immediately!

361
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:05,395
It's not too late for you Zuko.
You can still redeem yourself.

362
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,849
The kind of redemption she
offers is not for you.

363
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:15,884
Why don't you let him decide, Uncle? i need you Zuko.
I've plotted every move of this day.

364
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:21,182
This glorious day in Fire Nation history.
And the only way we win is together.

365
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:24,685
At the end of this day,
you will have your honor back.

366
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:29,168
You will have your father's love.
You will have everything you want.

367
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:37,021
Zuko, i am begging you, look into your heart
and see what it is that you truly want.

368
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:39,682
You are free to choose.

369
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,220
We've got to find Sokka and Toph.

370
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:52,178
See any Dai Li agents near by?

371
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:54,226
Nope. All clear.

372
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:00,885
Let's go!

373
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:02,446
I'm not leaving without Bosco!

374
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:26,750
I thought you had changed!

375
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,626
I have changed.

376
00:41:58,384 --> 00:42:03,894
Come on, it's easy. You just walk on your front
paws instead of your rear ones. Like this.

377
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,683
That is a nice trick.

378
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:13,074
Just take the bear.

379
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:15,147
Bosco!

380
00:43:09,107 --> 00:43:11,785
There's too many.

381
00:43:11,786 --> 00:43:16,309
The only way, is to let her go.

382
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,804
I'm sorry Katara.

383
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:37,466
You've got to get out of here!
I'll hold them off as long as i can!

384
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:42,659
We've done it Zuko. It's taken a hundred years,
but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se.

385
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:44,222
I betrayed Uncle.

386
00:45:44,223 --> 00:45:52,823
No, he betrayed you. Zuko, when you return
home, father will welcome you as a war hero.

387
00:45:52,824 --> 00:45:56,865
But i don't have the Avatar.
What if Father doesn't restore my honor?

388
00:45:56,866 --> 00:46:03,667
He doesn't need to Zuko. Today,
you restored your own honor.

389
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:15,927
The Earth Kingdom... has fallen.
