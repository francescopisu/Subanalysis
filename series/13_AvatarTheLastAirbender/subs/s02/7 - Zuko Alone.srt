1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:03,021
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:04,895
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:07,004
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:08,296
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of
all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang
can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:51,750
Please, father, I only had the
fire nation's best interest at heart!

15
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:58,345
You will learn respect, and
suffering will be your teacher.

16
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:01,177
We no longer have anything
to gain by traveling together.

17
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,718
I need to find my own way.

18
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:07,409
You're like my sister. My
father says she was born lucky.

19
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:10,984
He says I was lucky to be born.
I don't need luck though.

20
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:14,321
I've always had to struggle
and fight and that's made me strong.

21
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,371
It's made me who I am.

22
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,400
Come on spider snake eyes?

23
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,173
Haha! Yeah!

24
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,950
Could I get some water, a bag
of feed, and something hot to eat?

25
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:18,359
Not enough here for a hot meal.
I can get you two bags of feed.

26
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:35,025
Hey! You throwing eggs at us stranger?

27
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:35,847
No.

28
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,057
You see who did throw it?

29
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:40,270
No.

30
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:42,701
That's your favorite word, no?

31
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:45,025
Egg had to come from somewhere.

32
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,835
Maybe a chicken flew over.

33
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:55,043
Thanks for your contribution.
The army appreciates your support.

34
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:56,736
You better leave town.

35
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,628
Penalty for staying is a lot
steeper than you can afford stranger.

36
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:03,320
Trust me.

37
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:07,397
Those soldiers are supposed to
protect us from the fire nation, ...

38
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:10,884
but they're just a bunch of thugs.

39
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:15,422
Thanks for not ratting me out.

40
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:24,636
I'll take you to my house and feed your
ostrich horse for you. Come on, I owe you.

41
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:39,464
No one can ever sneak up on us.

42
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,552
No kidding.

43
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,188
You a friend of Lee's?

44
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,070
This guy just stood up to the soldiers!

45
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:54,994
By the end, he practically
had them running away.

46
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,754
Does this guy have a name?

47
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,677
I'm, uh?

48
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:02,186
He doesn't have to say who
he is if he doesn't want to, Sela.

49
00:05:02,187 --> 00:05:06,995
Anyone who can hold his own against
those bully 'soldiers' is welcome here.

50
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:10,658
Those men should be ashamed
to wear Earth Kingdom uniforms.

51
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:15,607
The real soldiers are off fighting
the war, like Lee's big brother Sen Su.

52
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:19,192
Supper's going to be ready soon.
Would you like to stay?

53
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:23,248
I can't. I should be moving on.

54
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:25,540
Gansu could use some help on the barn.

55
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,967
Why don't you two work for
a while, and then we'll eat.

56
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,560
You don't seem like
you're from around here.

57
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:40,724
Uh-uh.

58
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,266
Where are you from then?

59
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,360
Far away.

60
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:46,060
Oh. Where're you going?

61
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:50,837
Lee, give it a rest. Stop asking
the man personal questions, got it?

62
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:57,668
Ah~ yes? So, how did you get that scar?

63
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,462
It's not nice to bother people about
things they might not want to talk about.

64
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,150
A man's past is his business.

65
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:27,852
Hey mom, want to see
how Azula feeds turtle ducks?

66
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:31,610
Zuko! Why would you do that?

67
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:48,319
Stupid turtle duck, why'd she do that?

68
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:51,630
Zuko, that's what mom's are like.

69
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,872
If you mess with their
babies they'll bite you back.

70
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,657
Azula!

71
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:18,432
Watch this.

72
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:23,546
Mom, can you make Zuko play with
us? We need equal teams to play a game.

73
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,575
I am not cart wheeling.

74
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:29,582
You won't have to. Cart
wheeling's not a game, dumb dumb.

75
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,544
I don't care.
I don't want to play with you.

76
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,579
We are brother and sister.

77
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,472
It's important for us to spend time together.
Don't you think so, mom?

78
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:43,134
Yes darling, I think it's a
good idea to play with your sister.

79
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:47,012
Go on now, just for a little while.

80
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:48,598
Here's the way it goes.

81
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:54,968
Now what you do is try to knock the apple
off the other person's head. Like this.

82
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,199
See, I told you it would work.

83
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:08,467
Aw, they're so cute together.

84
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,373
You two are such... ugh!

85
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,869
I was just coming to get you.

86
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:17,184
Uncle Iroh sent us a letter from the war front.
You're soaking wet.

87
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,753
Girls are crazy!

88
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:28,301
If the city is as magnificent as its wall,
Ba Sing Se must be something to behold.

89
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:36,570
I hope you all may see it someday,
if we don't burn it to the ground first.

90
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:41,073
Until then, enjoy these gifts.

91
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:45,294
For Zuko, a pearl dagger from
the general who surrendered...

92
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:47,825
when we broke through the outer wall.

93
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:51,759
Note the inscription and
the superior craftsmanship.

94
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,996
"Never give up without a fight."

95
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:57,647
"And for Azula, a new friend."

96
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:01,952
"She wears the latest fashion
for Earth Kingdom girls."

97
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,040
If Uncle doesn't make it back from war, ...

98
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,996
then dad would be next in
line to be Fire Lord, wouldn't he?

99
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:12,127
Azula, we don't speak that way. It
would be awful if Uncle Iroh didn't return.

100
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:15,700
And besides, Fire Lord
Azulon is a picture of health.

101
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:19,040
How would you like it if
cousin Lu Ten wanted dad to die?

102
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,582
I still think our dad would
make a much better Fire Lord...

103
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,296
than his royal tea loving kookiness.

104
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:01,203
You're holding them all wrong.

105
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:12,531
Keep in mind, these are dual swords.
Two halves of a single weapon.

106
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,366
Don't think of them as
separate, because they're not.

107
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:18,963
They're just two different
parts of the same whole.

108
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:34,284
I think you'd really
like my brother Sen Su.

109
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,150
He used to show me stuff
like this all the time.

110
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:46,218
Here. This ought to get
you through a few meals.

111
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:53,833
What do you think they want?

112
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,860
Trouble.

113
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,963
What do you want, Gow?

114
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:12,633
Just thought someone ought to tell
you, your son's battalion got captured.

115
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,609
You boys here what the Fire Nation did...

116
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:17,454
with their last group
of Earth Kingdom prisoners?

117
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:21,196
Dressed them up in Fire Nation uniforms
and put them on the frontline...

118
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,732
unarmed, way I heard it.

119
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:25,961
Then they just watched.

120
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:28,787
You watch your mouth!

121
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:40,467
Why bother rooting around
in the mud with these pigs?

122
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:59,320
Iroh has lost his son. Your cousin
Lu Ten did not survive the battle.

123
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:02,950
What's going to happen to my brother?

124
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:08,735
I'm going to the front. I'm going
to find Sen Su and bring him back.

125
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:16,501
When my dad goes... will you stay?

126
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:19,780
No. I need to move on.

127
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:23,505
Here. I want you to have this.
Read the inscription.

128
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,879
"Made in Earth Kingdom."

129
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,669
The other one.

130
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:31,532
"Never give up without a fight."

131
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:47,242
You waste all your time playing with knives.
You're not even good.

132
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,734
Put an apple on your head
and we'll find out how good I am!

133
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,953
By the way, Uncle's coming home.

134
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,713
Does that mean we won the war?

135
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:59,346
No. It mean's Uncle's a
quitter and a loser.

136
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:02,289
What are you talking
about? Uncle's not a quitter.

137
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:06,169
Oh yes he is. He found out his
son died and he just fell apart.

138
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,605
A real general would stay and
burn Ba Sing Se to the ground, ...

139
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:12,421
not lose the battle
and come home crying.

140
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:14,712
How do you know what he should do?

141
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:19,591
He's probably just sad his
only kid is gone... forever.

142
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:22,328
Your father has requested
an audience with Fire Lord Azulon.

143
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,772
Best clothes, hurry up.

144
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:27,521
Fire Lord Azulon. Can't
you just call him "Grandfather"?

145
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:30,397
He's not exactly the powerful
Fire Lord he used to be.

146
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:32,971
Some one will probably
end up talking his place soon.

147
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:37,623
Young lady! Not, another, word.

148
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,253
What is wrong with that child?

149
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:46,374
And how was it Great Grandfather Sozen
managed to win the battle of Han Tui?

150
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,864
Great Grandfather won, because?

151
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:51,923
Because even though his
army was outnumbered, ...

152
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:53,959
he cleverly calculated his advantages.

153
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,190
The enemy was downwind
and there was a drought.

154
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:58,971
Their defenses burned
to a crisp in minutes.

155
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:04,033
Correct my dear. Now, won't
you show Grandfather the new moves...

156
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,243
you demonstrated to me?

157
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:37,755
She's a true prodigy. Just like
her Grandfather for whom she's named.

158
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:39,720
You'll never catch up.

159
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:43,982
I'd like to demonstrate
what I've been learning.

160
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,455
I failed.

161
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:10,744
No, I loved watching you.
That's who you are Zuko.

162
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:13,372
Someone who keeps fighting
even though it's hard.

163
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:17,700
Prince Ozai, why are you
wasting my time with this pomp?

164
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,475
Just tell me what you want.
Everyone else go.

165
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,566
What are you?!

166
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,668
Shh!

167
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:33,833
Father, you must have realized
as I have, that with Lu Ten gone, ...

168
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:38,203
Iroh's bloodline has ended.
After his son's death, ...

169
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,051
my brother abandoned
the siege at Ba Sing Se, ...

170
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:45,002
and who knows when he will return home?

171
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:49,583
But I am here, father, and
my children are alive.

172
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:51,512
Say what it is you want.

173
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:55,330
Father, revoke Iroh's birthright.

174
00:15:55,346 --> 00:16:01,030
I am your humble servant, here
to serve you and our nation. Use me.

175
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:07,638
You dare suggest I betray Iroh?
My first born?

176
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:11,598
Directly after the demise
of his only beloved son?

177
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:14,402
I think Iroh has suffered enough.

178
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:20,707
But you, your punishment
has scarcely begun!

179
00:16:27,762 --> 00:16:31,584
Dad's going to kill you. Really, he is.

180
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:34,466
Ha ha Azula. Nice try.

181
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,372
Fine, don't believe me,
but I heard everything.

182
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:40,584
Grandfather said dad's punishment
should fit his crime.

183
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:46,566
"You must know the pain of losing
a first born son, by sacrificing your own!"

184
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:47,605
Liar!

185
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,195
I'm only telling you for your own good.

186
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:54,563
I know, maybe you could find a
nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you.

187
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:58,667
Stop it, you're lying.
Dad would never do that to me.

188
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:02,799
Your father would never do
what to you? What is going on here?

189
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,855
I don't know.

190
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,095
It's time for a talk.

191
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:12,077
Azula always lies? Azula always lies?

192
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,943
Azula always lies?

193
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:19,465
You have to help. It's Lee.

194
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:22,014
The thugs from town came
back as soon as Gansu left.

195
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:24,889
When they ordered us to give them
food, Lee pulled a knife on them.

196
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,687
I don't even know where he got
a knife! Then they took him away.

197
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:33,173
They told me if he's old enough to
fight, he's old enough to join the army.

198
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,870
I know we barely know you, but?

199
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:39,711
I'll get your son back.

200
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:50,012
Hey! There he is! I told you he'd come.

201
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,688
Let the kid go.

202
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:11,337
Who do you think you are?
Telling us what to do?

203
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:14,959
It doesn't matter who
I am, but I know who you are.

204
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:20,755
You're not soldiers. You're bullies.
Freeloaders, abusing your power.

205
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:25,048
Mostly over women and kids.
You don't want Lee in your army.

206
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:30,390
You're sick cowards messing with a family
who's already lost one son to the war.

207
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:36,433
Are you going to let this stranger
stand there and insult you like this?

208
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:29,154
Give him a left! A left!

209
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,122
It's not a fist fight.

210
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:34,539
He's got a left sword, don't he?

211
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,885
Look out!

212
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:43,880
Behind you!

213
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,750
Mom?

214
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,794
Zuko, please, my love, listen to me.

215
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:14,344
Everything I've done,
I've done to protect you.

216
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:16,085
Remember this Zuko.

217
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:23,349
No matter how things may seem
to change, never forget who you are.

218
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,631
Get up.

219
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:59,788
Who, who are you?

220
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:05,815
My name is Zuko.
Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai.

221
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:10,863
Prince of the Fire Nation
and heir to the throne.

222
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:16,999
Liar! I heard of you. You're
not a prince, you're an outcast!

223
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:21,627
His own father burned and disowned him.

224
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:30,470
Not a step closer.

225
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:33,372
It's yours. You should have it.

226
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,656
No, I hate you.

227
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:44,754
Mom? Mom, mom!

228
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:51,819
Where's mom?

229
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,154
No one knows. Oh, and last
night, Grandpa passed away.

230
00:21:56,155 --> 00:22:02,077
Not funny, Azula. You're sick.
And I want my knife back, now.

231
00:22:02,082 --> 00:22:06,159
Who's going to make me? Mom?

232
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:12,704
Where is she?

233
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:24,622
Azulon, Fire Lord to our
nation for 23 years.

234
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:28,876
You were our fearless leader
in the battle of Gar Sai.

235
00:22:28,877 --> 00:22:33,021
Our matchless conqueror
of the Hu Sin provinces.

236
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:42,026
You were father of Iroh. Father of Ozai.
Husband of Ila, now passed.

237
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:51,208
Grandfather of Lu Ten, now passed.
Grandfather of Zuko and Azula.

238
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:55,204
We lay you to rest.

239
00:22:55,215 --> 00:23:03,532
As was your dying wish, you
are now succeeded by your second son.

240
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:11,056
Hail Fire Lord Ozai!

241
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:34,811
