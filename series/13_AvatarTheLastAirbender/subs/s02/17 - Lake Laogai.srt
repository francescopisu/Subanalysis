lived together in harmony.</i>

when the fire nation attacked.</i>

four elements, could stop them.</i>

00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,428
The Fire Nation
killed my parents.

16
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:52,008
I was only 8 years old.

17
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:55,063
Hello! My name is Joo Dee.

18
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:58,770
We found out about the solar eclipse
that lead the Fire Nation defenseless.

19
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:04,085
It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se that
the war not to be mention within the walls.

20
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:10,044
You don't understand, they are Fire
Nation, you have to believe me!

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,076
There is no war within the walls.

22
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:14,801
Here we are safe.

23
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,608
Here, we are free.

24
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,678
I understand have been
looking for your bison.

25
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:24,353
It would be quite a shame if you're
not able to complete your quest.

26
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:47,944
We found a printer to make our posters.

27
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,205
Hey, I thought designing "the
lost Appa poster" was my job.

28
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:55,092
I've been working all day on my Appa.

29
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:58,300
Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head.

30
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:00,489
This IS his head.

31
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,421
Why are feet coming out of it?

32
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:07,215
Those are his horns!
I haven't seen him awhile ok?

33
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,552
It looks just like him to me.

34
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:13,945
Thank you, I worked really...
why do feel the need to do that?

35
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:16,448
Let's just stick with
the professional version.

36
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:20,700
Grrrr!
Come on, let's get busy!

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,110
So you're the genius
behind this incredible brew.

38
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:43,423
The whole city is buzzing about you.

39
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:45,580
I hope Pao pays you well.

40
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,171
Good tea is its own reward.

41
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:51,287
But it doesn't have to be the only reward.

42
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:53,935
How would you like to
have your own tea shop?

43
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:57,730
My own tea shop? This is a dream come true.

44
00:02:57,731 --> 00:03:02,124
What's going on here?
Are you trying to poach my tea maker?

45
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,437
Sorry Pao, that's business for you,
am I right?

46
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:10,413
Mushie, if you stay,
I will make you Assistant Manager.

47
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:12,818
Wait, Senior Assistant manager.

48
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,759
I'll provide you with a new
apartment in the upper ring.

49
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:18,488
The Tea shop is yours
to do whatever you want.

50
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:20,171
Complete creative freedom.

51
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:23,429
I even get to name the shop?
Of course!

52
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,343
Uh, Senior Executive Assistant Manager?

53
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:33,055
Did you hear nephew?

54
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:34,464
This man wants to give us

55
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:38,150
our own tea shop
in the upper ring of the city.

56
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,867
That's right young man.

57
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:43,256
You're life is about
to change for the better.

58
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,235
I'll try to contain my joy.

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,849
I just finished dropping all the leaflets.

60
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,948
Has anyone come in with news about Appa?

61
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:23,220
It's only been a day, just be patient.

62
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:29,227
Wow, you're right!
Patience really pays off.

63
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:32,700
Joo Dee?

64
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:36,967
Hello, Aang and Katara and Sokka and Toph.

65
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:39,856
What happened to you?
Did the Dai Li throw you in jail?

66
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:43,284
What, jail? Of course not.

67
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:47,237
The Dai Li are the protectors
of our cultural heritage.

68
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:49,861
But you disappeared
at the Earth King's party.

69
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:53,477
Oh, I simply took a short
vacation to Lake Laogai,

70
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:56,353
out in the country.
It was quite relaxing.

71
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:58,641
But then they replaced you
with some other woman

72
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,324
who also said her name was Joo Dee.

73
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:03,844
I'm Joo Dee.
Why are you here?

74
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,399
Dropping flyers and putting up posters

75
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:08,233
isn't permitted within the city.

76
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,032
Not without proper clearance.

77
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,590
We can't wait around to
get permission for everything.

78
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:15,756
You are absolutely forbidden
by the rules of the city

79
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:18,071
to continue putting up posters.

80
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:22,175
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RULES,
AND WE'RE NOT ASKING PERMISSON!

81
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:25,890
We're finding Appa on our own and
you should just stay out of our way!

82
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:29,355
That might come back
to bite us in the blubber.

83
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:30,105
I don't care.

84
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:32,710
From now on we do whatever it
takes to find Appa.

85
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,294
YEAH!
Let's break some rules!

86
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:51,611
I am very disappointed in your work
with the Avatar and his friends, Joo Dee.

87
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:54,902
I had hoped that you would
be able to control this situation.

88
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:58,071
I'm so sorry,
but they don't trust me anymore.

89
00:05:58,072 --> 00:06:01,329
I don't think I can keep working like this.

90
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,756
Joo Dee, the Earth King
has invited you to Lake Laogai.

91
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:11,896
I am honored to accept his invitation.

92
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:16,772
Good. Now go await further orders.

93
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,104
If the Avatar keeps
searching for his bison,

94
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:26,870
it could upset the delicate balance
we worked so hard to achieve in this city.

95
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,607
It could even cost us
control of the Earth King.

96
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,358
Should we take care of him?

97
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:35,000
No. It's much too dangerous
to confront him directly.

98
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:39,103
Let's see if we can still handle this...
quietly.

99
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:48,583
So, I was thinking about
names for my new tea shop.

100
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:51,842
How about the Jasmine Dragon?

101
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:55,891
It's dramatic, poetic,
has a nice ring to it.

102
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:59,973
The Avatar's here in Ba Sing Se.
And he's lost his bison.

103
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:04,327
We have a chance for a new life here.

104
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:06,463
If you start stirring up trouble,

105
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:10,287
we could lose all the good
things that are happening for us.

106
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:12,461
Good things that are happening for you.

107
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:14,697
Have you ever thought that
I want more from life

108
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:16,984
than a nice apartment
and a job serving tea?

109
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:20,844
There is nothing wrong with
a life of peace and prosperity.

110
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:26,905
I suggest you think about what it
is that you want for your life, and why.

111
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,895
I want my destiny.

112
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:31,548
What that means is up to you.

113
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:37,018
The Tea Weevil!
No, that's stupid.

114
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,361
Well split up to cover more area.

115
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,853
Toph, I guess you should just come with me.

116
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:48,232
Why because you think I
can't put up posters on my own?

117
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:56,378
It's upside-down isn't it?
I'll just go with Sokka.

118
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,366
Katara?

119
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:10,591
I think I can help you.

120
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,513
Katara! I've changed!

121
00:08:21,823 --> 00:08:24,302
Tell it to some other girl, Jet!

122
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,092
I don't want to fight you!
I'm here to help.

123
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:46,338
Katara, what is it?

124
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,875
Jet's back.

125
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,654
We can't trust anything Jet says.

126
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:57,690
But we don't' even know why he's here.

127
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:00,994
I don't care why he's here.
Whatever the reason is, it can't be good.

128
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:03,177
I'm here to help you find Appa.

129
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:08,968
Katara, we have to give him a chance.

130
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:10,349
I swear, I've changed.

131
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,765
I was a troubled person,
and I let my anger get out of control.

132
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:17,185
But I don't even have the gang now.
I've put all that behind me.

133
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:18,413
You're lying!

134
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:23,002
He's not lying.

135
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:23,933
How can you tell?

136
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:26,190
I can feel his breathing and heart beat.

137
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,002
When people lie,
there is a physical reaction.

138
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,873
He's telling the truth.

139
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:33,579
Katara, we don't have any leads.

140
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,442
If Jet says he can take us to Appa,
we have to check it out.

141
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:41,720
Alright...
but we're not letting you out of out sight!

142
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,848
This is the place I heard about.

143
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,287
There's nothing here.

144
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,250
If this is a trap!?

145
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:52,355
I told you, I work nearby!

146
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:55,231
Two guys were talking about
some giant furry creature they had.

147
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:56,746
I figured it must be Appa.

148
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:57,797
He was here!

149
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,491
We missed him.

150
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:07,277
They took that big thing yesterday.

151
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:09,534
Shipped him out to some island.

152
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:16,016
About time, I've been cleaning up fur
and various, uh leavings all day.

153
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:18,269
What island!?
Where's Appa?!

154
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:24,339
Foreman said some rich royal type
on Whaletail Island bought him up,

155
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,875
guess for a zoo or such, though
could be the meat would be good.

156
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:31,093
We've gotta get to Whaletail Island.

157
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:33,747
Where's whale tail island?

158
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:36,882
Far. Very far.

159
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:41,181
Here it is. It's near the South
Pole almost all the way back home.

160
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,448
Aang, It'll take us weeks just
to get to the tip of the earth kingdom.

161
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,702
And then we'll need to find
a boat to get to the island.

162
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:47,524
I don't care.

163
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:50,595
We have a chance to find Appa.
We have to try.

164
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:56,929
Must be nice to visit an island.
I haven't had a vacation for years.

165
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,019
Don't you have some more hair to clean up?

166
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,882
Shuffle on, I get ya.
No more need for "old sweepy".

167
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:05,087
You're right Aang.

168
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:07,839
Right now, our first concern
has to be finding Appa.

169
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,507
We can come back when we have him.

170
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:10,917
All right, let's get moving.

171
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:12,260
I'll come with you.

172
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:13,831
We don't need your help.

173
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:15,324
Why won't you trust me?

174
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:18,813
Gee, I wonder?

175
00:11:18,814 --> 00:11:21,955
Was this guy your boyfriend or something?

176
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,474
What? No!

177
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,004
I can tell you're lyyyyying.

178
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:31,755
We can take the train out to the wall,
but then we'll have to walk.

179
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:34,250
Don't worry, on the way
back, we'll be flying!

180
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:39,585
We're finally leaving Ba Sing Se.
Worst city ever!

181
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:42,147
Jet!

182
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:45,690
I thought you said you
didn't have your gang anymore?

183
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:46,469
I don't.

184
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,568
We were so worried.
How did you get away from the Dai Li?

185
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:50,848
The Dai Li?!

186
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:52,675
I don't know what she's talking about?

187
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:55,456
He got arrested by the Dai
Li a couple weeks ago.

188
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:56,939
We saw them drag him away.

189
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,744
Why would I be arrested?
I've been living peacefully in the city.

190
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:04,690
This doesn't make any sense.
They're both telling the truth.

191
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,372
That's impossible.

192
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:07,498
No, it's not.

193
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:11,421
Toph can't tell who's lying because
they both think they're telling the truth.

194
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:13,196
Jet's been brainwashed.

195
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:18,249
That's crazy! It can't be.
Stay away from me.

196
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:36,397
Out of my way, skinny.

197
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,066
Huh?

198
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:02,039
If you don't want to end up like him.
You'll do what I say.

199
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:06,943
The Dai Li must have
sent Jet to mislead us,

200
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:08,960
and that janitor was
part of their plot too.

201
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:11,062
I bet they have Appa here in the city.

202
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:13,314
Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet.

203
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:14,780
Where did they take you?

204
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:17,689
Nowhere.
I, I don't know what you're talking about.

205
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,514
We need to find a way to
jog his real memories.

206
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:24,269
Maybe Katara could kiss him.
That should bring something back.

207
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,281
Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka.

208
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:28,126
Hey, just an idea.

209
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:29,177
A bad one.

210
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,583
Oo, wait. I got it.

211
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:39,395
I don't think its working. Puh!

212
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:43,100
Try to think of something from
your past that triggers your emotions.

213
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:46,849
The Fire Nation,
remember what they did to your family.

214
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,286
Close your eyes.
Picture it.

215
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:04,744
No! It's too painful.

216
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:06,993
Maybe this will help.

217
00:14:30,282 --> 00:14:33,850
They took me to a headquarters
under the water, like a lake.

218
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:36,474
Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said?

219
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,076
She said she went on
vacation to Lake Laogai.

220
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:41,678
That's it! Lake Laogai.

221
00:14:49,214 --> 00:14:51,576
So where's this secret headquarters?

222
00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:52,877
Under the water I think.

223
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:55,318
There's a tunnel right
there near the shore.

224
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,746
It's all starting to come back to me.

225
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:29,853
I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se.

226
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:37,153
We are so lucky to have
our walls to create order.

227
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:43,792
I think there might be a cell
big enough to hold Appa up ahead.

228
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,800
I think it's through here.

229
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:54,623
Expecting someone else?

230
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:13,253
Now that's something different.

231
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:15,795
You have made yourselves
enemies of the state.

232
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:17,980
Take them into custody.

233
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,769
Long Feng is escaping!

234
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:27,642
Alright Avatar, you've
caused me enough problems.

235
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:31,842
This is your last chance,
if you want your bison back.

236
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:34,772
You do have Appa.
Tell me where he is!

237
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:36,561
Agree to exit the city now,

238
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:38,251
and I'll waive all charges against you

239
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:39,838
and allow you to leave with your lost pet.

240
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,603
You're in no position to bargain.

241
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,797
Am I not?

242
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,963
You're definitely not!

243
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:51,131
Jet, The Earth King has
invited you to Lake Laogai.

244
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,408
I am honored to except his invitation.

245
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:06,627
You're mine now.

246
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:12,424
Uncle?

247
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,425
So, the Blue Spirit.

248
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:18,225
I wonder who could be behind that mask?

249
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:20,487
What are you doing here?

250
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:23,632
I was just about to ask you the same thing.

251
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:28,074
What do you plan to do now that
you have found the Avatar's bison?

252
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,759
Keep it locked in our new apartment?

253
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,160
Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?

254
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:35,182
First I have to get it out of here.

255
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:36,506
AND THEN WHAT?!

256
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:39,061
You never think these things through!

257
00:18:39,062 --> 00:18:41,446
This is exactly what happened

258
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:43,968
when you captured the
Avatar at the North Pole!

259
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:47,565
You had him, and then
you had no where to go!

260
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:49,369
I would have figured something out!

261
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,314
No! If his friends hadn't found you,

262
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:54,097
you would have frozen to death!

263
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,656
I know my own destiny uncle.

264
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,736
Is it your own destiny?

265
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:02,967
Or is it a destiny someone
else has tried to force on you?

266
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:05,838
Stop it Uncle.
I have to do this.

267
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,258
I'm begging you Prince Zuko!

268
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:11,311
It's time for you to look inward,

269
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:14,859
and begin asking yourself
the big questions.

270
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,613
Who are you?
And what do you want?

271
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:31,819
Jet, it's me Aang!
You don't have to do this.

272
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,108
I'm afraid he no longer has a choice.

273
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:47,950
Jet, I'm your friend!
Look inside your heart!

274
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:51,067
Do your duty Jet.

275
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,821
He can't make you do this!
You're a Freedom Fighter.

276
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:09,369
Do it! Do it now!

277
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,494
Foolish boy. You've chosen your own demise.

278
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:36,843
I'm sorry, Aang.

279
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:38,021
Don't be.

280
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:54,130
This isn't good.

281
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:57,237
You guys go find Appa.
We'll take care of Jet.

282
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:58,799
We're not going to leave you.

283
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,782
There's no time.
Just go.

284
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:03,775
We'll take care of him.
He's our leader.

285
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:08,037
Don't worry Katara, I'll be fine.

286
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:16,227
He's lying.

287
00:21:29,374 --> 00:21:32,320
Appa's gone. Long Feng beat us here.

288
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:34,653
If we keep moving, maybe
we can catch up to him.

289
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:51,077
Do you think we can out run them?

290
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:52,749
I don't think it's gonna matter.

291
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,178
What is it Momo?

292
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,472
Appa!

293
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:39,960
I can handle you by myself.

294
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:56,021
Yeah! Appa!

295
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:57,601
I missed you, buddy.

296
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,721
You did the right thing, nephew.

297
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:27,009
Leave it behind.
