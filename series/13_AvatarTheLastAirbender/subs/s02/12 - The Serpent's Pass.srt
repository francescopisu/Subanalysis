14
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:50,439
We're heading to Ba-Sing-Se

15
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:52,768
Why would we go to the
Earth Kingdom capital?

16
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,729
The city is filled with refugees

17
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:57,280
uh... what's Suki up to?

18
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:00,526
Actually, she and the other
warriors left to fight in the war.

19
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:02,041
My name is Jet.

20
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,419
The Fire nation killed my parents.

21
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,633
I was only 8 years old.

22
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:08,705
That day changed me forever.

23
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:15,674
All those people...

24
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,616
Jet, you monster!

25
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:19,545
This was a victory Katara!

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,530
The Fire nation is gone and this
valley will be safe.

27
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:28,422
- Tell me where Appa is!
- I traded him!

28
00:01:28,457 --> 00:01:30,257
He's probably in Ba-Sing-Se by now!

29
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,103
Waterbending bomb!

30
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:14,075
Sure, 5000 year old maps from the spirit
library, just splash some water on 'em.

31
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,035
Sorry.

32
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:24,042
So, did you figure out
what route we're gonna take?

33
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,088
Okay. We just got out of the
desert, so we must be around here,

34
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,972
and we need to go to Ba
Sing Se, which is here.

35
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:32,523
It looks like the only passage
connecting the South to the North...

36
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:34,971
is this sliver of land
called the Serpent's Pass.

37
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,014
You're sure that's the best way to go?

38
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,439
It's the only way,

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,594
I mean it's not like
we have Appa to fly us there.

40
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:44,230
Shush up about Appa. Can't
you at least try to be sensitive?

41
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:47,824
Katara, it's ok.

42
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:50,486
I know I was upset about
losing Appa before,

43
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:53,114
but I just want to focus
on getting to Ba Sing Se,

44
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:55,741
and telling the Earth
King about the solar eclipse.

45
00:02:56,742 --> 00:03:00,621
Oh, well, ok. I'm glad you're doing better.

46
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:03,439
Then to Ba Sing Se we go,
no more distractions.

47
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,877
Hello there fellow refugees!

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,849
So, are you guys headed to Ba Sing Se too?

49
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:16,971
Sure are, we're trying to get
there before my wife Ying has her baby.

50
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:20,226
Great, we can travel through
the Serpent's Pass together.

51
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:25,104
The Serpent's Pass?! Only the
truly desperate take that deadly route.

52
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,149
Deadly route. Great pick, Sokka.

53
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:29,324
Well, we are desperate.

54
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,076
You should come with us to Full Moon Bay.

55
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:36,824
Ferries take refugees across the lake.
It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se.

56
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:39,994
And it's hidden, so the
Fire Nation can't find it.

57
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:44,165
Hmmm, peaceful ferry ride...
or deadly pass?

58
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:57,477
I can't believe how many people's lives
have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.

59
00:03:57,512 --> 00:04:02,767
We're all looking for a better life.
Safe, behind the walls of Ba Sing Se.

60
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:20,868
Who would have thought, after all these years, I'd
return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace...

61
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:22,460
as a tourist...

62
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:26,207
Look around, we're not
tourists, we're refugees.

63
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:33,297
I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt.
.. I'm tired of living like this.

64
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,591
Aren't we all?

65
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,389
My name's Jet, and these
are my freedom fighters,

66
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:42,904
Smellerbee, and Longshot.

67
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:44,178
Hey

68
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:46,101
Hello

69
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,568
Here's the deal.

70
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:51,983
I hear the Captain's eating like a king, while
us refugees have to feed off his scraps.

71
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:53,908
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

72
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:56,737
What sort of "king" is he eating like?

73
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,955
The fat, happy kind.

74
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,828
You want to help us "liberate" some food?

75
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,543
I'm in.

76
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:21,269
I've told you already,
no vegetables on the ferry!

77
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:25,558
One cabbage slug could destroy
the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se.

78
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:26,934
Security!

79
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:32,815
Ah! My Cabbages!

80
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,447
Next!

81
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,993
Um, four tickets for the
ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.

82
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,251
Passport.

83
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:48,289
Uh, no one told us we
had to have passports.

84
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:51,340
Don't you know who this is?
He's the Avatar!

85
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:57,215
Ah, I see fifty Avatars a day, and
by the way, not a very impressive costume.

86
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:05,640
Besides, no animals allowed.
Do I need to call security?

87
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,062
That won't be necessary.

88
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:12,236
Next!

89
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,940
I'll take care of this.

90
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:17,527
My name is Toph Bei Fong,
and I'll need 4 tickets.

91
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,246
Oh! The Golden Seal of the Flying Boar,

92
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,410
it is my pleasure to help
anyone of the Bei Fong family.

93
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:32,708
It is your pleasure. As you can see I am blind,
and these three imbeciles are my valets.

94
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,335
But the animal...

95
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,254
Is my Seeing-Eye Lemur.

96
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:40,925
Well, normally it's only
1 ticket per passport, but,

97
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,261
this document is so official,

98
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:45,847
I guess it's worth 4 tickets.

99
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,059
Thank you very much.

100
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,020
Alright, we scammed that lady good!

101
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,023
Tickets and passports please.

102
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,692
Is there a problem?

103
00:06:57,693 --> 00:06:58,692
Yeah,

104
00:06:58,693 --> 00:06:59,901
I've got a problem with you.

105
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:01,411
I've seen your type before,

106
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:06,951
probably sarcastic, think your hilarious, and
let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.

107
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,252
Do I know you?

108
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:10,955
You mean you don't remember?

109
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,457
Maybe you remember this.

110
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:15,265
Suki!

111
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,671
Sokka, it's good to see you!

112
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:23,447
You look so different without
your makeup, and the new outfit.

113
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:27,013
That crabby lady makes all
the security guards wear them.

114
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:29,897
And look at you sleeveless guy.
Been working out?

115
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:35,646
I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin
touches every now and then, nothing major.

116
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,656
Are the other Kyoshi warriors around?

117
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,695
Yeah, after you left Kyoshi, we
wanted to find a way to help people.

118
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,090
We ended up escorting some refugees,
and we've been here ever since.

119
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,876
Hi Momo, good to see you too.

120
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:54,624
So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry?
Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?

121
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,754
Appa is missing. We hope
to find him in Ba Sing Se.

122
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:01,881
I'm so sorry to hear that.

123
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,800
Are you doing okay?

124
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:10,598
I'm doing fine. Would everybody
stop worrying about me!

125
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,608
Avatar Aang, you have to help us!

126
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,568
Someone took all of our belongings.

127
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:19,816
Our passports, our tickets.
Everything's gone!

128
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,985
I'll talk to the lady for you.

129
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,114
No passports, no tickets!

130
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:31,661
But she's pregnant, and all of their stuff was stolen.
You have to make an exception.

131
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:32,869
No exceptions!

132
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,166
If I just gave away tickets willy nilly
to anyone, there would be no more order,

133
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:40,503
and you know what that means.
No more civilization!

134
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:41,872
What if we gave them our tickets?

135
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:42,348
NO!

136
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:43,107
But...

137
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,158
NEXT!

138
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:50,221
Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely.
I'll lead you through the serpents pass.

139
00:08:52,635 --> 00:09:00,891
I can't believe we gave up our tickets, and
now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.

140
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:03,484
I can't believe you're
still complaining about it.

141
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,861
I'm coming too.

142
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,697
Are you sure that's a good idea?

143
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,907
Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come...

144
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,200
I do, it's just...

145
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:12,583
Just what?

146
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,996
Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.

147
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,169
This is the Serpent's Pass?

148
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:24,312
I thought it would be more windy,
you know, like a serpent. Hmm,

149
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,305
I guess they misnamed it.

150
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,302
Look at this writing, how awful.

151
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:33,020
- What does it say?
- It says, "Abandon hope".

152
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:37,275
How could we abandon hope?
It's all we have.

153
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,355
I don't know. The monks used to
say that hope is just a distraction.

154
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,025
So maybe we do need to abandon it.

155
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,440
What are you talking about?

156
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,989
Hope isn't going to get us into
Ba Sing Se, and it's not gonna find Appa.

157
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:55,495
We need to focus on what we're doing right
now, and that's getting across this pass.

158
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,956
Ok, if you say so.

159
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:06,679
The fire nation controls the western lake.

160
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:12,234
Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other
side, and they don't want anyone to find out what it is.

161
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:22,563
I'm okay.

162
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,862
They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go!

163
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,967
Suki, are you ok? You have
to be more careful! Come on.

164
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,555
Thanks for saving my life Toph.
Hey no problem Sokka.

165
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,704
Suki, you shouldn't sleep there.

166
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:16,860
Who knows how stable this ledge
is? It could give way at any moment.

167
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:19,085
Sokka, I'm fine. Stop worrying!

168
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,374
You're right, you're right. You're perfectly
capable of taking care of yourself...

169
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,332
Wait!

170
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,712
Oh, never mind. I thought
I saw a spider, but you're fine.

171
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,497
Guards coming!

172
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,770
You know, it's o. k. to miss Appa.

173
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:28,613
What's going on with you?

174
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,143
In the desert, all you
cared about was finding Appa,

175
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:33,019
and now it's like you
don't care about him at all.

176
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,827
You saw what I did out there.

177
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:38,699
I was so angry about losing
Appa, I couldn't control myself.

178
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:40,500
I hated feeling like that.

179
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:43,586
But now you're not letting
yourself feel anything.

180
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:47,666
I know sometimes it hurts more
to hope, and it hurts more to care.

181
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:51,712
But you have to promise
me that you won't stop caring.

182
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:55,383
C'mon, you need a hug.

183
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,469
Thank you for your concern Katara.

184
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,067
It's a beautiful moon.

185
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:14,735
Yeah, it really is.

186
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:20,783
Look, I know you're just trying
to help, but I can take care of myself.

187
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:22,208
I know you can.

188
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:24,579
Then why are you acting so over protective?

189
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,123
It's so hard to lose
someone you care about.

190
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:30,660
Something happened at the North
Pole, and I couldn't protect someone.

191
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:33,337
I don't want anything
like that to ever happen again.

192
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:35,131
I lost someone I cared about.

193
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:37,807
He didn't die, he just went away.

194
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:41,137
I only had a few days to
get to know him, but he was...

195
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,324
smart, and brave, and funny.

196
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:47,065
Who is this guy? Is he taller than me?

197
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,771
No, he's about your height.

198
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:51,063
Is he better looking?

199
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,065
It is you stupid!

200
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,150
Oh!

201
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,409
I can't.

202
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:05,495
I'm... sorry.

203
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:09,874
No, you shouldn't be.

204
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:22,553
So, Smellerbee, that's an
unusual name for a young man.

205
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:27,058
Maybe it's because I'm not a man.
I'm a girl!

206
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,231
Oh, now I see! It's a beautiful
name for a lovely girl!

207
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:42,448
I know. You're right. As long as I'm confident with
who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think.

208
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:44,200
Thanks Longshot.

209
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:51,916
From what I heard, people eat
like this every night in Ba Sing Se.

210
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,460
I can't wait to set my
eyes on that giant wall.

211
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,178
It is a magnificent sight.

212
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:59,215
So you've been there before?

213
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:03,309
Once, when I was a different man.

214
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:06,139
I've done some things in
my past that I'm not proud of.

215
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:10,726
But that's why I'm going to
Ba Sing Se, for a new beginning.

216
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:12,527
A second chance.

217
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:14,529
That's very noble of you.

218
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:18,609
I believe people can change
their lives if they want to.

219
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:21,904
I believe in second chances.

220
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,802
Everyone single file.

221
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,730
Aang, I need help.

222
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:25,913
What is that thing?

223
00:16:56,986 --> 00:17:00,531
I think I just figured out why
they call it the Serpent's Pass.

224
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,239
Suki, you know about giant sea monsters.
Make it go away!

225
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:11,695
Just because I live near the
Unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert!

226
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:17,451
Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept
this humble and tasty offering. Thank you.

227
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:18,542
Sokka!

228
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll distract him.
Katara, get everyone across.

229
00:17:56,698 --> 00:17:58,783
Toph, come on. It's just ice.

230
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:05,248
Actually, I'm gonna stay on
my little island where I can see.

231
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,001
Ok, I'm coming!

232
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:14,549
You're doing great! Just
follow the sound of my voice!

233
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,843
It's hard to ignore.

234
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,346
You're almost there.

235
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,975
Help! I can't swim!

236
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:26,394
I'm coming Toph!

237
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:33,651
Help!

238
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:45,997
Oh Sokka, you saved me.

239
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:49,209
Actually, it's me.

240
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:54,163
Oh, well... heheh... You can
go ahead and let me drown now.

241
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:28,790
There's the wall!

242
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:33,503
Now it's nothing but
smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.

243
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:34,503
Oh, no.

244
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:35,964
What's wrong?

245
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:37,841
The baby's coming!

246
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,265
What!? Now!?

247
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,226
Can't you hold it in or something?

248
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:45,473
Sokka, Calm down. I helped Gran-
Gran deliver lots of babies back home.

249
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:51,479
This isn't the same as delivering an
arctic seal! This is a real "human" thing!

250
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:56,234
It's called a baby, and I helped
to deliver plenty of those too.

251
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:59,911
Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water.

252
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:03,575
Toph, I need you to make an earth tent.
A big one.

253
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:07,746
Suki, come with me.

254
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,838
You know, as soon as I saw your
scar, I knew exactly who you were.

255
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,307
You're an outcast, like me.

256
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:24,095
And us outcasts have to stick together.
We have to watch each other's backs,

257
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,688
because no one else will.

258
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:31,144
I've realized lately, that being
on your own isn't always the best path.

259
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:41,237
You're doing great Ying.

260
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:42,902
Sokka! Where's that water?

261
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,532
Get ready to push.

262
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:49,371
One, two, three... PUSH!

263
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,501
It's a girl!

264
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:59,673
So, you want to go see the baby? Or are
you going to faint like an old lady again?

265
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,092
No no, I'm good this time.

266
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:10,642
Aang, you have to come see this.

267
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:16,481
She sounds healthy.

268
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:17,941
She's beautiful.

269
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,735
It's so... squishy looking.

270
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:26,289
What should we name her?

271
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,660
I want our daughter's name to be unique.

272
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:31,538
I want it to mean something.

273
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,690
I've been going through
a really hard time lately.

274
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,631
But you've made me... hopeful again.

275
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:45,051
I know what I want to name our baby now.

276
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,681
Hope

277
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:50,223
That's a perfect name. Hope.

278
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:58,773
I thought I was trying to be strong, but really
I was just running away from my feelings.

279
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:03,653
Seeing this family together,
so full of happiness and love,

280
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:06,364
it reminded me of how I feel about Appa...

281
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:09,993
and how I feel about you.

282
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:20,795
I promise I'll find Appa as fast as I can.

283
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:22,881
I just really need to do this.

284
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,665
See ya in the big city.

285
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,435
Say hi to that big fuzzball for me.

286
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:29,679
You'll find him Aang.

287
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,679
I know.

288
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,730
Thank you Katara.

289
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:36,478
You ready Momo?

290
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:45,222
Sokka, It's been really
great to see you again.

291
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:48,955
Whoa, hold on. Why does it
sound like you're saying goodbye?

292
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,536
I came along because I wanted to make sure
you got through the Serpent's Pass safely.

293
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,498
But now I need to get back
to the other Kyoshi warriors.

294
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:59,977
So you came along to protect me?

295
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,386
Listen, I'm really sorry about last night.

296
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:09,803
We were talking, and saying things, I just
got carried away and before I knew it I...

297
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:13,598
You talk too much.

298
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:56,224
Sorry Momo, Appa's gonna have to wait.
