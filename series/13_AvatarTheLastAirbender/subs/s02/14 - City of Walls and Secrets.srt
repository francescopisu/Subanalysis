1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:01,686
<i>Water</i>

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:04,159
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,403
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:08,445
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:12,581
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony</i>

6
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:16,909
<i>then everything changed
when the firenation attacked</i>

7
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:21,855
<i>Only the avatar mastered
all four elements could stop them</i>

8
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,935
<i>but when the world needed
him most he vanished</i>

9
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,991
<i>100 years passed, my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

10
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,004
<i>an airbinder named Aang</i>

11
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:33,545
<i>And although his airbinding
skill is great,</i>

12
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:36,377
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he is ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:40,007
<i>But I believe...
... Aang can save the world</i>

14
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,117
<i>Appa is missing.</i>

15
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:52,192
<i>We hope to find him in Ba-Sing-Se</i>

16
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:56,262
<i>Professor Zei, head of anthropology
at Ba Sing Se University.</i>

17
00:00:56,297 --> 00:01:00,362
<i>This library said to contain
a vast collection of knowledge</i>

18
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:05,276
<i>Firebenders loose their
bending during a solar eclipse!</i>

19
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:08,817
<i>We've got to get this information
to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se.</i>

20
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:15,362
<i>What are you doing
firebending your tea?</i>

21
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:17,982
<i>So the old guy had some hot tea.
Big deal.</i>

22
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:19,492
<i>He heated it himself!</i>

23
00:01:19,522 --> 00:01:22,212
<i>Those guys are firebenders.</i>

24
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:27,612
Book two: Earth
Chapter fourteen: City of Walls and Secrets

25
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,102
Look, the inner wall.

26
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,432
I can't believe we finally
made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.

27
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:50,637
Hey don't jinx it!

28
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:54,202
We could still be attacked by some
giant, exploding Fire Nation spoon.

29
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:57,762
Or find out the city's been submerged
in an ocean full of killer shrimp.

30
00:01:57,797 --> 00:01:59,962
You been hitting the cactus juice again?

31
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:02,632
I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.

32
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:11,662
Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa.

33
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:13,197
It's such a big city.

34
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:16,782
He's a giant bison. Where could
someone possibly hide him? Oh.

35
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,957
Back in the city. Great.

36
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:43,142
What's the problem? It's amazing!

37
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:45,987
Just a bunch of walls and rules.

38
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:48,842
You wait; you'll get sick
of it in a couple of days.

39
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:55,752
I'm comin' for you buddy.

40
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,832
He's here. I can feel it.

41
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:10,657
Hello, my name is Joo Dee.

42
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:15,292
I have been given the great honor
of showing the Avatar around Ba Sing Se.

43
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:18,487
And you must be Sokka, Katara, and Toph.

44
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:22,422
Welcome to our wonderful city.
Shall we get started?

45
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:23,091
Yes!

46
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:27,436
We have information about the Fire Nation army that
we need to deliver to the Earth King immediately.

47
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:28,527
Great

48
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:29,987
let's begin our tour.

49
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:34,232
And then I'll show you to your new home here.
I think you'll like it.

50
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:38,867
Maybe you missed what I said.

51
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:41,626
We need to talk to the King
about the war, it's important.

52
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:45,022
You're in Ba Sing Se now.
Everyone is safe here.

53
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:51,262
This is the lower ring.

54
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:53,322
What's that wall for?

55
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:55,787
Oh, Ba Sing Se has many walls.

56
00:03:55,822 --> 00:04:01,382
There are the ones outside protecting us, and
the one's inside that help maintain order.

57
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:04,092
This is where our newest arrivals live,

58
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:08,802
as well as our craftsman and artisans,
people that work with their hands.

59
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:11,122
It's so quaint and lively.

60
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:15,167
You do want to watch your step though.

61
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:18,922
Why do they have all these poor people
blocked off in one part of the city?

62
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:20,952
This is why I never came here before.

63
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:25,092
I always heard it was so different
from the way the monks taught us to live.

64
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:36,652
I just want our new place to look nice ...

65
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:40,442
in case someone brings home a lady friend.

66
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:43,902
This city is a prison. I
don't want to make a life here.

67
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:46,322
Life happens wherever you are,

68
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:48,047
whether you make it or not.

69
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:50,522
Now come on, I found us some new jobs,

70
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:53,752
and we start this afternoon.

71
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:59,302
Look at them, firebenders
living right under everyone's nose.

72
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:03,747
Jet, you saw a man with a hot cup of tea.

73
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:07,007
It doesn't prove he's a firebender.
And what if he is,

74
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:11,032
are we supposed to attack them?
I thought we were starting over here,

75
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,302
changing our ways.

76
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,711
We are,

77
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:17,792
when I get the evidence I need, I'll report
them to the police and let them handle it.

78
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:18,938
Ok?

79
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:23,687
This is the middle ring of Ba Sing Se,

80
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:28,162
home to the financial district,
shops and restaurants and the university.

81
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,967
Yeah, we met a Professor
from Ba Sing Se University.

82
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:34,326
He took us to an ancient underground library where
we discovered information about the war that is ...

83
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:36,982
absolutely crucial for the King to hear!

84
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:38,957
Isn't history fascinating?

85
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:43,067
Look, here's one of the oldest buildings
in the middle ring, Town Hall.

86
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:46,197
Is that woman deaf?

87
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:48,316
She only seems to hear
every other word I say.

88
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:51,359
It's called "being handled".
Get used to it.

89
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:03,182
Well, you certainly look
like official tea servers.

90
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:04,472
How do you feel?

91
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:05,572
Ridiculous.

92
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,732
Uh, Does this possibly
come in a larger size?

93
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:14,262
I have extra string in the back.
Have some tea while you wait.

94
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,812
Eeow! This tea is nothing
more than hot leaf juice!

95
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:26,122
Uncle, that's what all tea is.

96
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:31,442
How can a member of my own
family say something so horrible?

97
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:35,412
We'll have to make some
major changes around here.

98
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:45,182
The Upper Ring is home
to our most important citizens.

99
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:47,442
Your house is not too far from here.

100
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:53,082
What's inside that wall?

101
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:58,362
And who are the mean looking guys in robes?

102
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:00,702
Inside is the Royal Palace.

103
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:05,062
Those men are agents of the Dai
Li, the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se.

104
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:08,442
They are the guardians
of all our traditions.

105
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,937
Can we see the King now?

106
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:14,362
Oh, no! One doesn't just
pop in on the Earth King.

107
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,962
Here we are. Your new home.

108
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:28,772
More good news, your request for an audience
with the Earth King is being processed,

109
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:31,122
and should be put through in about a month.

110
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:33,212
Much more quickly than usual.

111
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:34,552
A month!

112
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:37,252
Six to eight weeks, actually.

113
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:46,357
Isn't it nice? I think
you will really enjoy it here.

114
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:49,177
I think we'd enjoy it more
if we weren't staying so long.

115
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,796
Can't we see the King any sooner?

116
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:54,847
The Earth King is very busy
running the finest city in the world,

117
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:57,312
but he will see you as
soon as time permits.

118
00:07:57,313 --> 00:08:01,161
If we are going to be here for a month,
we should spend our time looking for Appa.

119
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:04,687
I'll be happy to escort you
anywhere you would like to go.

120
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:06,557
We don't need a babysitter.

121
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:12,217
Oh, I won't get in the way. And to
leave you alone would make me a bad host.

122
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:14,067
Where shall we start?

123
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:24,457
I'm sorry, but I haven't heard
anything about a flying bison.

124
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:26,177
I didn't even know there were any.

125
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:30,617
If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal
without anyone knowing, where would they go?

126
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,957
Where's the black market?
Who runs it? Come on, you know!

127
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,897
That would be illegal.

128
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:45,337
You'll have to leave now. Your
lemur is harassing my sparrowkeets.

129
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:53,747
I've never seen any sandbenders
or nomads around here.

130
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:57,967
You should ask Professor Zei, he
teaches the class on desert cultures.

131
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:02,257
Right. And which of your professors could
we ask about the war with the fire nation?

132
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:09,937
I don't know. I'm not a political science student.
I have to get to class. Ugh!

133
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:18,277
Well, I'm sorry no one has seen your bison.

134
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:22,547
Why don't you go get some rest?
Someone will be over with dinner later.

135
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:31,207
Hey, come with me.

136
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:41,277
You're the Avatar. I heard
you were in town. I'm Pao.

137
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:42,942
Nice to meet you, Pao.

138
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:47,767
So Pao, what's goin' on with this city?
Why is everyone here so scared to talk about the war?

139
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,997
War? Scared? What do you mean?

140
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:52,967
I can feel you shaking.

141
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:58,837
Look, I'm just a minor government official.
I've waited 3 years to get this house.

142
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:00,777
I don't want to get into trouble.

143
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:02,407
Get in trouble with who?

144
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:09,707
Listen, you can't mention the war here, and
whatever you do, stay away from the Dai Li.

145
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,272
Would you like a pot of tea?

146
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:21,047
We've been working in a tea shop all day.

147
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,757
I'm sick of tea!

148
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:27,367
Sick of tea?
That's like being sick of breathing!

149
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:32,407
Have you seen our spark
rocks to heat up the water?

150
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:33,747
They're not there.

151
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:37,177
You'll have to firebend, old man.

152
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,967
Where are you going?

153
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:46,867
I borrowed our neighbors, such kind people.

154
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:04,412
I've got it! I know how
we're gonna see the Earth King!

155
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:08,817
How are we supposed to do that?
"One doesn't just pop in on the Earth King"

156
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:12,567
The King is having a party at
the palace tonight for his pet bear.

157
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:14,547
You mean Platypus-Bear?

158
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,782
No, it just says "Bear".

159
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:19,337
Certainly you mean his pet Skunk-Bear.

160
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:20,647
Or his Armadillo-Bear.

161
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:21,817
Gopher-Bear?

162
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:24,277
Just..."Bear"

163
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:27,012
This place is weird.

164
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:30,517
The palace will be packed.
We can sneak in with the crowd.

165
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:31,602
Won't work.

166
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:32,476
Why not?

167
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,566
Well, no offense to you
simple country folk,

168
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:37,997
but a real society crowd
would spot you from a mile away.

169
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,757
You've got no manners.

170
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:45,827
Excuse me? I've got no manners?
You're not exactly lady fancy fingers.

171
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:51,157
I learned proper society
behavior and chose to leave it.

172
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:55,497
You never learned anything.
And frankly, it's a little too late.

173
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:58,467
Ah-Ha, but you learned it.
You could teach us.

174
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:02,037
Yeah, I'm mastering every element.
How hard could manners be?

175
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:05,157
Good evening, Mr. Sokka Watertribe.

176
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,847
Ms. Katara Watertribe.

177
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:11,447
Lord Momo of the Momo
Dynasty, your Momo-ness.

178
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:15,007
Avatar Aang, how you do go on?

179
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:25,177
Katara might be able to pull it off, but
you two would be lucky to pass as busboys.

180
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,217
But I feel so fancy.

181
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:32,217
- Earth!
- Fire!

182
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:43,987
Wow, you look beautiful.

183
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:49,362
Don't talk to the commoners, Katara.
First rule of society.

184
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:53,407
We'll get in the party, and then find
a way to let you in through the side gate.

185
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:10,267
Jet, we need to talk.

186
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:15,207
What? Oh great, it's you guys. Where have you been?
I could use some help with surveillance here.

187
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:18,997
We've been talking, and we think
you're becoming obsessed with this.

188
00:13:19,147 --> 00:13:20,662
It's not healthy.

189
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:23,332
Oh, really? You both think this?

190
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:26,652
We came here to make a fresh start,

191
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:29,917
but you won't let this go.
Even though there's no real proof!

192
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:31,999
Well, maybe if you'd help me.

193
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:34,012
Jet, you've gotta stop this.

194
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,762
Maybe you've forgotten why
we need to start over.

195
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:39,511
Maybe you've forgotten about how
the Fire Nation left us all homeless?

196
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:41,962
How they wiped out all the people we loved.

197
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:45,207
If you don't want to help me,
I'll get the evidence on my own.

198
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:55,407
This is the best tea in the city!

199
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:58,187
The secret ingredient is love.

200
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:05,647
I think you're due for a raise.

201
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,977
I'm tired of waiting.
These two men are firebenders!

202
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:23,864
I know they're firebenders!
I saw the old man heating his tea!

203
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:25,924
He works in a tea shop.

204
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:28,189
He's a firebender, I'm telling you!

205
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:30,909
Drop your swords boy, nice and easy.

206
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:37,344
You'll have to defend yourself. Then everyone will know.
Go ahead, show them what you can do.

207
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:42,024
You want a show? I'll give you a show.

208
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,594
Invitation please.

209
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,164
I think this will do.

210
00:15:05,424 --> 00:15:07,374
No entry without an invitation.

211
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:09,119
Step out of line please.

212
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:13,414
Look, the Pangs and the Yum Soon
Hans are waiting in there for us.

213
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:16,024
I'm going to have to tell
them who didn't let me in.

214
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:17,984
Step out of line please.

215
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:32,714
Sir? I'm sorry to bother you,
but my cousin lost our invitations.

216
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,349
She's blind.

217
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:36,169
Do you think you could help us?

218
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:39,164
Our family's inside and
I'm sure they're very worried.

219
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,269
I am honored,

220
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:43,154
please come with me.

221
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,399
He's taking all the good stuff!

222
00:15:56,434 --> 00:16:00,684
Quiet, you don't know what I had
to do to get seats this near the bear!

223
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:08,439
It's beautiful, isn't it?

224
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:13,182
By the way, I'm Long Feng. I'm
a cultural minister to the king.

225
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:16,924
I'm Kwa mai, and this is Dung.

226
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:21,414
Now where is your family?
I'd love to meet them.

227
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:26,794
Um, I don't see 'em right now. But I'm sure
we'll find them soon. Thanks for all your help.

228
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:36,244
Don't worry, as your escort it would be dishonorable to
abandon you ladies without finding your families first.

229
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:37,934
We'll keep looking.

230
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:41,959
Where are they?

231
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:44,549
Look, I came up with a backup plan.

232
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:47,069
We dress Momo like a ghost, OK?

233
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:52,954
He flies by the guards creating a distraction,
then we blast a hole in the wall...

234
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:54,533
Or, we could go in with these guys.

235
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:57,359
Toph said we might pass as busboys.

236
00:16:57,394 --> 00:17:01,794
OK, but remember that Momo ghost plan.
I think it's a winner.

237
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:08,664
You must be getting tired
of using those swords.

238
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,144
Why don't you go ahead and firebend at me.

239
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:15,808
Please son, you're confused.
You don't know what you're doing!

240
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,411
Bet you wish he'd help you out
with a little fire blast right now.

241
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:23,628
You're the one who needs help.

242
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:35,374
You see that? The Fire
nation is trying to silence me.

243
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,399
It'll never happen.

244
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,574
Where are Toph and Katara?

245
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:47,859
Forget about them, just
keep an eye out for the King.

246
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:50,439
I don't know what he looks like.

247
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:54,611
You know, "royal", flowing
robe, fancy jewelry.

248
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,471
That could be anyone.

249
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:00,247
Another crab puff please.

250
00:18:00,282 --> 00:18:01,332
You found us.

251
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,943
I'd know your little footsteps
anywhere Twinkletoes.

252
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:06,847
Thanks for letting us in.

253
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:10,401
Sorry, but the guy who escorted
us in, won't let us out of his sight.

254
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:11,657
What guy?

255
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:14,575
What are you doing here?

256
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:18,349
You have to leave immediately,
or we'll all be in terrible trouble.

257
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,566
Not until we see the King.

258
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,554
You don't understand. You must go.

259
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:30,024
Sorry! No, don't shout.

260
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:39,814
The Avatar. Ooh, I didn't
known the Avatar would be here.

261
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,014
You keep their attention
while I look for the King.

262
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:52,558
Watch this everybody!

263
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:17,924
Drop your weapons!

264
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,739
Arrest them. They're Firebenders.

265
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:25,874
This poor boy is confused.
We're just simple refugees.

266
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:30,974
This young man wrecked my tea
shop, and assaulted my employees.

267
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:33,434
It's true sir. We saw the whole thing.

268
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:36,204
This crazy kid attacked
the finest tea maker in the city.

269
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:39,164
Oh ho ho. That's very sweet.

270
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:41,954
Come with us son.

271
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:50,534
You don't understand! They're
Fire Nation! You have to believe me!

272
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:23,574
Aang, the Earth King.

273
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:28,204
Greetings your majesty.

274
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:38,724
Hey, let me go.

275
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:58,021
Avatar, it is a great honor to meet you. I am Long Feng,
Grand Secretary of Ba Sing Se and head of the Dai Li.

276
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:02,121
I'd like to talk to you. You're friends
will be waiting for us in the library.

277
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:08,769
Why won't you let us talk to the King?

278
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,557
We have information that
could defeat the Fire Nation!

279
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:15,224
The Earth King has no time to get
involved with political squabbles ...

280
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:18,003
and the day to day minutia
of military activities.

281
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:20,829
This could be the most important
thing he has ever heard.

282
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:27,134
What's most important to his royal majesty is
maintaining the cultural heritage of Ba Sing Se.

283
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,239
All his duties relate to
issuing decrees on such matters.

284
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:35,784
It's my job to oversee the rest of the
city's resources, including the military.

285
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,074
So the King is just a figurehead.

286
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:39,699
He's your puppet!

287
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:45,019
Oh, no, no! His majesty
is an icon, a god to his people.

288
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,803
He can't sully his hands with
the hourly change of an endless war.

289
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:52,384
But we found out about a solar eclipse that
will leave the Fire Nation defenseless.

290
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:53,788
You could lead an invasion...

291
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:56,374
Enough, I don't want
to hear your ridiculous plan!

292
00:21:56,409 --> 00:21:59,178
It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se...

293
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,174
that the war not be
mentioned within the walls.

294
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:07,374
Constant news of an escalating war will throw the
citizens of Ba Sing Se into a state of panic.

295
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:10,419
You have to believe me,
they're firebenders!

296
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,734
They won't stop until they win the war.

297
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:16,834
Calm down, you're safe now.

298
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:24,964
Our economy would be ruined. Our peaceful way
of life, our traditions would disappear.

299
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:28,469
There's no war in Ba Sing Se.

300
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:33,224
What are you talking about? Where do you think
all the refugees come from? You can't hide it.

301
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:39,414
In silencing talk of conflict, Ba
Sing Se remains a peaceful, orderly utopia.

302
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:41,774
The last one on Earth.

303
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:49,364
There is no war within the walls.
Here we are safe.

304
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,564
Here we are free.

305
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:57,574
You can't keep the truth from all these people.
They have to know.

306
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,879
I'll tell them.
I'll make sure everyone knows!

307
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:03,819
Until now, you've been
treated as our honored guest.

308
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:07,699
But from now on, you will be watched
every moment by Dai Li agents.

309
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:11,774
If you mention the war to anyone,
you will be expelled from the city.

310
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:14,279
I understand you've been
looking for your bison.

311
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:18,744
It would be quite a shame if you
were not able to complete your quest.

312
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:21,684
Now Joo Dee will show you home.

313
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:26,074
Come with me, please.

314
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,494
What happened to Joo Dee?

315
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:33,004
I'm Joo Dee. I'll be your host as
long as you're in our wonderful city.
