00:00:00,891 --> 00:00:02,108
<i>Water</i>

2
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:04,387
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:05,487 --> 00:00:06,495
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:08,686
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,303
<i>Long Ago, The four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:17,505
<i>Then, everything changed when
the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:22,318
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elments, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:25,342
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:29,754
<i>100 years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

10
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,588
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:33,896
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great</i>

12
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,878
<i>He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:40,685
<i>But I believe Aang
can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:49,005
<i>Previously on Avatar...</i>

15
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:53,728
<i>What happened generations ago,
can be resolved now.</i>

16
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:58,665
<i>Born in you is the power to
restore balance to the world.</i>

17
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,851
<i>You see you are too late,</i>

18
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:07,122
<i>the comet is already here
and I'm unstoppable!</i>

19
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:10,266
<i>You were right about what Katara needed,</i>

20
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:12,379
<i>violence wasn't the answer.</i>

21
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,928
<i>It never is.</i>

22
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:16,249
<i>Then I have a question for you:</i>

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,946
<i>What are you going to do
when you face my father?</i>

24
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,580
More ferocious!

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,939
Imagine striking through
your opponent's heart!

26
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,780
I'm trying!

27
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,489
Now, let me hear you
roar like a tiger-dillo!

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,360
That sounded pathetic!

29
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,470
I said "roar!"

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,439
Who wants a nice cool
glass of watermelon juice?

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,079
Oh, me, me, me!

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,089
Hey! Your lesson
is not over yet!

33
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,390
Get back here!

34
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,469
Come on, Zuko. Just take a break.
What's the big deal?

35
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,950
Fine!

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,619
If you want to lounge around like
a bunch of snails all day,

37
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,190
then go ahead!

38
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,869
Maybe Zuko's right.

39
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,479
Sitting around the house
made us pretty lazy.

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,879
But I know just the thing to change that:

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,480
Beach Party!

42
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,440
It's you!

43
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,680
We kissed at the invasion.

44
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,269
But I've been working on
my sandbending.

45
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,360
You're gonna love this.

46
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,680
You even made a little
Earth King and Bosco.

47
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,320
Try to top that, Sokka!

48
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,829
Is that a blubbering blob-monster?

49
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,050
No! It's Suki!

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,019
Suki, we'll all understand if you

51
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,749
break up with him over this.

52
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,780
I think it's sweet.

53
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,830
But it doesn't even look like...

54
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,120
What are you doing?

55
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,320
Teaching you a lesson!

56
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,600
What happened?

57
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,279
Zuko's gone crazy!

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,610
I made a sand sculpture
of Suki and he destroyed it!

59
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,540
Oh, and he's attacking Aang.

60
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,059
Get a grip before I blast
you off this roof!

61
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,890
Go ahead and do it!

62
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,530
Enough!

63
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,769
What's wrong with you?
You could've hurt Aang!

64
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,089
What's wrong with me? What's
wrong with all of you!?

65
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,939
How can you sit around
having beach parties

66
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,590
when Sozin's Comet is
only three days away?

67
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,689
Why are you all looking
at me like I'm crazy?

68
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,690
About Sozin's Comet...

69
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:36,739
I was actually gonna wait to
fight the Fire Lord

70
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,559
until after it came.

71
00:05:38,742 --> 00:05:41,030
- After?
- I'm not ready.

72
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:43,189
I need more time to master firebending.

73
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,729
And, frankly, your earthbending
still could use some work too.

74
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,619
So, you all knew Aang
was gonna wait?

75
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,299
Honestly, if Aang tries to fight
the Firelord right now,

76
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,239
he's gonna lose. No offense.

77
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,859
The whole point of fighting
the Firelord before the comet

78
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,329
was to stop the Fire Nation
from winning the war.

79
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,499
But they pretty much won the war
when they took Ba Sing Se.

80
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,520
Things can't get any worse.

81
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,110
You're wrong.

82
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,910
It's about to get worse than
you can even imagine.

83
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:12,907
The day before the eclipse,

84
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:16,248
my father asked me to attend
an important war meeting.

85
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:19,248
It was what I dreamed about and
wanted for so many years.

86
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:22,268
My father had finally accepted me back.

87
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:29,338
Welcome, Prince Zuko.
We waited for you.

88
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:38,998
General Shinu, your report.

89
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,698
Thank you, sir.

90
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,137
Ba Sing Se is still under
our control, however,

91
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:47,467
Earthbender rebellions have prevented
us from achieving

92
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:50,247
achieving a total victory in the Earth Kingdom.

93
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:51,927
What is your recommendation?

94
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,947
Our army is spead too thin,

95
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:57,147
but once the eclipse is over
and the invasion defeated,

96
00:06:57,148 --> 00:07:01,478
we should transfer more domestic
forces into the Earth Kingdom.

97
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:06,208
Prince Zuko, you've been among the
Earth Kingdom commoners,

98
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:10,008
do you think that adding more troops
will stop these rebellions?

99
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:15,177
The people of the Earth Kingdom
are proud and strong.

100
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:18,588
They can endure anything,
as long as they have hope.

101
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:21,488
Yes, you're right.

102
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:25,567
We need to destroy their hope.

103
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:27,437
Well, that's not exactly what I...

104
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:29,927
I think you should take
their precious hope,

105
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:33,488
and the rest of their land, and
burn it all to the ground.

106
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:37,828
Yes, yes, you're right, Azula.

107
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:41,007
Sozin's Comet is almost upon us.

108
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:46,207
And on that day, it will lend us the
strength and power of a hundred suns.

109
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,067
No bender will stand a chance against us.

110
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,157
What are you
suggesting, sir?

111
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:55,617
When the comet last came, my
grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin,

112
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:58,337
used it to wipe out the air nomads.

113
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,697
Now, I will use its power to end
the Earth Kingdom,

114
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,818
permanently.

115
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:08,897
From our airships, we will
rain fire over their lands.

116
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:12,407
The fire that will
destroy everything!

117
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:16,177
And out of the ashes,
a new world will be born.

118
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:19,267
A world in which all the
lands will be Fire Nation

119
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:24,108
and I am the supreme ruler
of everything!

120
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,248
I wanted to speak out
against this horrifying plan,

121
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:30,628
but ashamed to say
that I didn't.

122
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:34,808
My whole life I struggled to gain
my father's love and acceptance.

123
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:35,987
But once I had it,

124
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:39,318
I realized I lost myself
getting there.

125
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:41,518
I forgotten who I was.

126
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:43,858
I can't believe this.

127
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:46,997
I always knew the Firelord
was a bad guy,

128
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:49,648
but his plan is just pure evil!

129
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,277
What am I gonna do?

130
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:53,727
I know you're scared.

131
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:56,908
And I know you're not
ready to save the world.

132
00:08:56,938 --> 00:09:00,117
But if you don't defeat the Firelord
before the comet comes,

133
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:03,688
there won't be a world
to save anymore.

134
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:10,848
Why didn't you tell me about
your dad's crazy plan sooner?

135
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,367
I didn't think I had to.

136
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:14,757
I assumed you were still gonna
fight him before the comet.

137
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:17,098
No one told me you
decided to wait.

138
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:21,208
This is bad, this is
really, really bad!

139
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,298
Aang, you don't have
to do this alone.

140
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:27,127
Yeah! If we all have to fight
the Firelord together,

141
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:29,067
we got a shot at
taking him down!

142
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,828
Alright! Team
Avatar is Back!

143
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,868
Air, Water,

144
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,858
Earth, Fire,

145
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,788
Fan, and Sword!

146
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:43,078
Fighting the Firelord is gonna be the
hardest thing we've ever done together.

147
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:46,118
But I wouldn't wanna do it
any other way.

148
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:49,808
- Yeah!
- Alright!

149
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:51,427
Get over here, Zuko.

150
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:55,058
Being part of the group also means
being part of the group hugs.

151
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:06,908
There's one technique you need
to know before facing my father.

152
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:09,168
How to redirect lightning.

153
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:14,607
If you let the energy in your body
flow, lightning will follow it,

154
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:17,178
and you turn your opponent's
energy against them.

155
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:19,538
- That's like waterbending.
- Exactly.

156
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:21,637
My uncle invented
this technique himself

157
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,287
by studying waterbenders.

158
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:26,607
So...have you ever redirected
lightning before?

159
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:29,217
Once.
Against my father.

160
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:30,838
What did it feel like?

161
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:32,678
Exilirating.

162
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:37,268
But terrifying.

163
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:43,208
You feel so powerful holding that
much energy in your body,

164
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:46,928
but you know if you make
the wrong move, it's over.

165
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:49,937
Well, not over-over, I mean...

166
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:53,137
There is always Katara and
a little spirit water action,

167
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:54,307
am I right?

168
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:57,658
Actually, I used it all
up after Azula shot you.

169
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:02,758
You'll have to take the Firelord's
life, before he takes yours.

170
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:06,948
Yeah, I'll just do that.

171
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:14,668
Gather around, Team Avatar.

172
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:20,847
In order to take out the Firelord,
or in this case, the Melonlord,

173
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,948
our timing has to be perfect.

174
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:25,657
First, Suki and I will
draw his fire.

175
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:28,958
Then, Katara and Zuko charge in
with some liquidy hot offence,

176
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:31,647
and while the Melonlord
is distracted,

177
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:35,437
Aang swoopes in and BAM!
He delivers the final blow.

178
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,598
Ehm, what about me?

179
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:39,897
For now, you're the
Melonlord's forces.

180
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,177
So I get to chuck flaming
rock at all of you?

181
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:44,978
Whatever makes the training
field more realistic.

182
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:46,618
Sweetness!

183
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,158
Watch it, Toph!

184
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:22,128
I'm no Toph,
I AM MELONLORD!

185
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:39,038
Now, Aang!

186
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:52,338
What are you waiting for?
Take him out!

187
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:54,188
I can't.

188
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:57,787
What's wrong with you?

189
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:01,338
If this was the real deal, you'd
be shot full of lighting right now.

190
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:04,318
I'm sorry. But it just
doesn't feel right.

191
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:06,278
I didn't feel like myself.

192
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,558
There. That's that how it's done.

193
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:26,917
I have a surprise
for everyone!

194
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:30,488
I knew it! You did have a
secret thing with Haru!

195
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:34,188
Ah, no.

196
00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:38,028
I was looking for cooking pots in
the attic and I found this.

197
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:42,768
Look at baby Zuko!
Isn't he cute?

198
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,988
Oh lighten up, I'm
just teasing.

199
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:51,098
That's not me.
It's my father.

200
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:55,058
But he looks so sweet
and innocent.

201
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:57,858
That sweet little kid grew
up to be a monster.

202
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:00,398
And the worst father in
the history of fathers.

203
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,568
But he's still a
human being.

204
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:04,488
You're going to defend him?

205
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:06,577
No, I agree with you.

206
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,767
Firelord Ozai is
a horrible person,

207
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:11,117
and the world will probably
be better off without him,

208
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,848
but there's got to
be another way.

209
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:14,067
Like what?

210
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:15,448
I don't know.

211
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:18,957
Maybe we can make some big pots
of glue and then I can use

212
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,337
gluebending to stick his arms and legs
together so he can't bend anymore!

213
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:24,537
Yeah, then you can show
him his baby pictures

214
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:26,687
and all these happy memories
will make him good again!

215
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:28,447
Do you really think
that will work?

216
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:29,728
No!

217
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:34,828
This goes against everything
I learned from the monks.

218
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:38,048
I can't just go around wiping
out people I don't like.

219
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:40,387
Sure you can.
You're the Avatar!

220
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:42,357
If it's in the name of
keeping balance,

221
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:44,657
I'm sure the universe
will forgive you.

222
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:46,718
This isn't a joke, Sokka!

223
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:49,228
None of you understands
the position I'm in!

224
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:52,517
- Aang, we do understand. It's just..
- Just what, Katara?

225
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,617
- What?
- We're trying to help!

226
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:57,787
Then why don't you figure out a way
for me to defeat the Firelord

227
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,038
without taking his life,
I'd love to hear it!

228
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:04,108
Aang, don't walk
away from this.

229
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,878
Let him go.

230
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,518
He needs time to sort
it out by himself.

231
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:31,128
Hey, Momo. I don't suppose
you know what I should do.

232
00:15:32,638 --> 00:15:34,428
I didn't think so.

233
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:33,477
Okay, that's everything.

234
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:35,898
No it's not, where's Aang?

235
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:42,027
Aang?

236
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:45,518
- Aang?
- Come on, lazy bones, let's go!

237
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:01,917
He left his staff.
It's so strange.

238
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:04,958
Aang's not in the house,
let's check the beach.

239
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:09,837
Look! There's
his footprints.

240
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:11,667
The trail ends here.

241
00:17:11,668 --> 00:17:15,187
So, he went for a midnight
swim and never came back?

242
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:17,777
- Maybe he was captured.
- I don't think so.

243
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:19,177
I don't think so.

244
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:21,068
I bet he ran away again.

245
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,727
He left his glider and Appa.

246
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:27,218
Then what do you think
happened, oh, sloozy one?

247
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:28,988
It's pretty obvious.

248
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:32,067
Aang mysteriously disappears
before an important battle.

249
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:34,917
He's definitely in a
spirit world journey.

250
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:37,727
But if he was, wouldn't
his body still be here?

251
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:39,757
Oh, yeah, forgot about that.

252
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,717
Then he's gotta be somewhere
on Ember Island,

253
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:43,378
let's split up and look for him.

254
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,478
I'm going with Zuko.

255
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:49,507
What? Everyone else went on a
life-changing field-trip with Zuko.

256
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:51,398
Now it's my turn!

257
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:03,891
Aang! Aang! Aang!
Aang! Aang!

258
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,328
Avatar State, Yip Yip!

259
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:15,457
And when I was 9,
I ran away again.

260
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:17,887
I know I should complain.

261
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,287
My parents gave me
everything I ever asked for.

262
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:23,007
But they never gave me the one
thing that I really wanted.

263
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:24,787
Their love.

264
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:26,258
You know what I mean?

265
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:29,267
Look, I know you had a rough childhood,

266
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:31,568
but we should really focus
on finding Aang.

267
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,448
This is the worst
field trip ever.

268
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,327
Judging by the looks
on your faces,

269
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:46,498
I'm guessing you guys
didn't find Aang either.

270
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:52,327
No, it's like he
just... disappeared.

271
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:53,567
Hey, wait a minute,

272
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:56,871
has anyone noticed that
Momo is missing too?

273
00:18:56,872 --> 00:19:00,127
Oh, no! I knew it was
only a matter of time!

274
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,577
Appa ate Momo!

275
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:05,917
Momo! I'm coming for you, buddy!

276
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:08,577
Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo.

277
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:10,347
He's probably with Aang.

278
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,517
That's just what Appa
wants you to think.

279
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,857
Get out of the bison's
mouth, Sokka.

280
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:17,617
We have a real problem here.

281
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:20,717
Aang is nowhere to be found and
the comet is only two days away.

282
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:23,018
What should we do, Zuko?

283
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:25,018
I don't know.

284
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,757
Why are you all
looking at me?

285
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:32,808
Well, you are kind of the
expert on tracking Aang.

286
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:36,067
Yeah, if anyone's got experience
hunting the Avatar,

287
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,278
it's you.

288
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:43,837
Zuko, I don't want to tell
you how to do your job,

289
00:19:43,838 --> 00:19:46,397
but why are we heading
to the Earth Kingdom?

290
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:47,977
There's no way Aang's there.

291
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,448
Just trust me.

292
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:11,848
Come on, slowpokes,
faster!

293
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:34,687
Sorry I'm late, father.

294
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:38,257
Good palanquin bearers are
so hard to come by these days.

295
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:41,177
So, is everything ready
for our departure?

296
00:20:41,178 --> 00:20:43,347
There's been a change
in plans, Azula.

297
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:44,487
What?

298
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:46,707
I've decided to lead the
fleet of airships

299
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,707
to Ba Sing Se alone.

300
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,748
You will remain here,
in the Fire Nation.

301
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:55,197
But, I thought we were
going to do this together?

302
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:58,148
My decision is final.

303
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:01,097
You, you can't treat
me like this!

304
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:03,097
You can't treat me like Zuko!

305
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:05,727
Azula, silence yourself.

306
00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:08,357
But it was my idea to burn
everything to the ground!

307
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:10,357
I deserve to be by your side!

308
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:12,478
Azula!

309
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,537
Listen to me. I need you here to
watch over the homeland.

310
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:21,608
It's a very important job that
I can only entrust to you.

311
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:23,681
Really?

312
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,671
And for your loyalty,

313
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:30,388
I've decided to declare you
the new Firelord.

314
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:32,577
Firelord Azula?

315
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:35,237
It does seem appropriate...

316
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:37,427
But, what about you?

317
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:40,037
Firelord Ozai is no more.

318
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:43,547
Just as the world will
be reborn in fire,

319
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:48,167
I shall be reborn as the supreme
ruler of the world.

320
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:51,937
From this moment on,
I wll be known as

321
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:54,898
The Phoenix King!

322
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:30,277
And the reason you brought us to the
Seedy Earth Kindom Tavern is what now?

323
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:31,488
June.

324
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:38,978
Oh yeah, this weird bounty
hunter with a big mole.

325
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:40,567
Mole? Her skin is flawless.

326
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,797
No, she has this giant mole-creature
she rides around on.

327
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:45,237
Shirshu.

328
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,587
It's the only animal who can track
Aang's scent anywhere in the world.

329
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:51,348
It's the one shot we
have at finding him.

330
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,627
I don't know who this
June lady is,

331
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:07,758
but I like her!

332
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:19,308
Hey, Momo...I just had
the strangest dream.

333
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:22,588
Wait.

334
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:33,908
Where are we?
