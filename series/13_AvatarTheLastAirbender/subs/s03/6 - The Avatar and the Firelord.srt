1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,299
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,099
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,099
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,399
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,600
<i>Long ago...</i>

6
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,599
<i>The four nations lived
together in harmony.</i>

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,399
<i>Then everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,399
<i>Only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,150
<i>But when the world
needed him most</i>

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,099
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,699
<i>100 years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,399
<i>an airbender named aang.</i>

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,699
<i>And although his airbending
skills were great</i>

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,799
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,000
<i>But I believe aang
can save the world.</i>

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,599
I'm losing this war.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,099
I'm letting
the whole world down.

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,499
I should have seen
this war coming, and prevented it.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,999
For so long, I thought
that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,899
I'm back home now.

21
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,199
My dad talks to me.

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,599
Everything should
be perfect, right?

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,999
I should be happy now,
but I'm not.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,800
Please, uncle, I'm so confused.

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,599
I need your help.

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
Forget it.

27
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,499
I'll solve this myself.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,130
Waste away in here
for all I care.

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,299
Aang, it's time you learned
my history with fire lord sozin.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,800
You need to understand how the war
began if you want to know how to end it.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,000
Meet my on my home island on
the day of the summer solstice.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,099
Ok, roku.

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,199
You need to know the story of
your great-grandfather's demise.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
It will reveal your own destiny.

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,399
There it is.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,999
That's roku's home.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,099
But there's nothing here.

38
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,199
Yes, there is.

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,499
An entire village.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,300
Hundreds of houses.

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,200
All completely buried in ash.

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,299
It's never too early
for a sitting with the court painter, zuko.

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,999
Make sure he gets
your good side.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,899
Wait.

45
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,599
I need to ask you something.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,499
What do you remember about
our great-grandfather's history?

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,399
Ah, zuko.

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,499
It's so strange
how your mind works.

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,999
Fire lord sozin began
the war, of course.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,799
He spent his early years
secretly preparing for it

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,099
but he was as patient
as he was clever.

52
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,799
He famously waited
for the comet, later renamed sozin's comet

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,299
and used its power to launch
his full-scale invasion of the world.

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,899
In the end, he died
a very old and successful man.

55
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,499
But how did he die?

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,999
Didn't you pay any attention
in school, zuko?

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,299
He died peacefully,
in his sleep.

58
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,350
He was ancient.

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,500
What does it mean?

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,900
The fire sages keep the secret history
in the dragon bone catacombs.

61
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,099
The final testament
of fire lord sozin.

62
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,399
Come, aang.

63
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,999
Where are we going?

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,299
To visit my past.

65
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,799
Our shared past.

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,099
As I feel
my own life dimming, I can't help but think

67
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,899
of a time when everything
was so much brighter.

68
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,100
I remember my friend.

69
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,500
Looks like I win again, roku.

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,699
Are you kidding?

71
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,299
The tree root did all the work.

72
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,099
Nice one, sozin.

73
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,899
You were friends
with fire lord sozin?

74
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,600
Back then, he was just prince
sozin, and he was my best friend.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Say something to her.

76
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,600
Uh....

77
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,699
Love is hard when you're young.

78
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,200
You don't have to tell me.

79
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:00,999
Don't worry.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,799
It gets better.

81
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,500
Now come with me.

82
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,599
We have a party to attend.

83
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,199
Wait, whose party is it?

84
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,199
Sozin and I
shared many things, including a birthday.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,099
Did something happen
to my father?

86
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,499
No, prince sozin.

87
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,999
We are not here for you.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,299
We are here to announce
the identity of the next avatar.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,700
It is our honor
to serve you, avatar roku.

90
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,499
The

91
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,199
had to leave the fire nation
and face his destiny as the avatar.

92
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,599
He needed to travel the world
so he could master the other elements.

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,799
Hey, why aren't you packed yet,
all-powerful avatar?

94
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,600
Come on, show me how it's done
using all four kinds of bending.

95
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,299
I started packing,
but then the fire sages told me

96
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,899
I won't need any
worldly possessions anymore.

97
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,799
Oh.

98
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,799
It happened so fast.

99
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,599
Everything's gonna
be different now.

100
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,999
Here.

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,899
I hope you're at least
allowed to have this.

102
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,099
But this is a royal artifact.

103
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,999
It's supposed to be worn
by the crown prince.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
I want you to have it.

105
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,199
Do they have bathrooms
in the spirit world?

106
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
As a matter of fact,
they do not.

107
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,499
Hey, we're almost at
the Southern air temple.

108
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,899
This was the first stop
on my avatar journey.

109
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,899
It was the place where I was
trained to master airbending

110
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,200
and also where I met
an old friend of yours, monk gyatso.

111
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,250
No way.

112
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,900
Hey, gyatso, you want to see
a new glider trick?

113
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
, check this out.

114
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,000
He's air-surfing.

115
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,999
I can't believe
I never thought of that.

116
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,899
That's amazing.

117
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,150
I can't believe you were friends
with monk gyatso just like I was.

118
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,700
Some friendships are so strong,
they can even transcend lifetimes.

119
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,300
After my years mastering airbending,
I traveled to the northern water tribe.

120
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,300
Waterbending was
especially challenging for me.

121
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,300
But in time,
I mastered it as well.

122
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,600
I moved on to the earth kingdom.

123
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,500
My earthbending master, sud, was
uncompromising, stubborn, and blunt

124
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,699
and a lifelong friend.

125
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,800
It was bitter work,
but the results were worth it.

126
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,399
Twelve long years passed
before I saw my friend again.

127
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,400
When roku returned, he was a fully
realized avatar, and I had changed as well.

128
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,499
Sozin, or should I say,
fire lord.

129
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Customarily, my subjects bow before
greeting me, but you're the exception.

130
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,100
After all these years,
he was still my best friend

131
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,500
and a few months later,
he was my best man.

132
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,799
Roku, it's that girl
who didn't even know you were alive.

133
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,799
Ta min.

134
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,099
I was persistent.

135
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,699
When love is real,
it finds a way

136
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,499
and being the avatar doesn't hurt
your chances with the ladies, either.

137
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,200
On wedding days, we look to the
future with optimism and joy.

138
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,300
I had my own vision
for a brighter future.

139
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,900
Excuse me.

140
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,099
May I borrow him for a moment?

141
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,900
It's not very traditional,
but ok.

142
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,399
What's on your mind?

143
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,799
I've been thinking hard about
the state of the world lately.

144
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,999
Sozin, it's my wedding.

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,999
Have a cookie.

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,199
Dance with someone.

147
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,099
Lighten up.

148
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,499
I know, I know,
but just hear me out.

149
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,199
Right from the start,
I was destined to be fire lord

150
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,099
and although we didn't always know
it, you were destined to be the avatar.

151
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,470
It's an amazing stroke of fate
we know each other so well, isn't it?

152
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,699
Together, we could do anything.

153
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,599
Yeah, we could.

154
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,999
Our nation is enjoying
an unprecedented time of peace and wealth.

155
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Our people are happy, and we're
so fortunate in so many ways.

156
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Where are you going with this?

157
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,499
I've been thinking.

158
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,699
We should share this prosperity
with the rest of the world.

159
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,999
In our hands is the most
successful empire in history.

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,799
It's time we expanded it.

161
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,200
No

162
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,199
the four nations are meant
four.

163
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,399
Roku, you haven't even stopped
to consider the possibilities.

164
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,299
There are no possibilities.

165
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,600
This is the last I want
to hear about this.

166
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,099
That was my first
real test as the avatar.

167
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,699
Unfortunately, it was many years
before I learned that sozin

168
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,100
had gone ahead with his plan,
despite my warning.

169
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,500
I've seen the colony, sozin.

170
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,499
How dare you occupy
earth kingdom territory.

171
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,000
How dare you, a citizen of the fire
nation, address your fire lord this way?

172
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,099
Your loyalty is
to our nation first.

173
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,199
Anything less
makes you a traitor.

174
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,300
Don't do this, sozin.

175
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,099
Don't challenge me.

176
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,099
It will only end badly.

177
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,300
It's over.

178
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,099
I'm sparing you, sozin.

179
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,799
I'm letting you go in the name
of our past friendship

180
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,800
but I warn you, even a single step out
of line will result in your permanent end.

181
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,499
And k or see each other

182
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,199
for 25 years after our battle.

183
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,300
I spent most of my spare time
here at my home.

184
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,700
Let's go.

185
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,450
Roku's island
was 100 miles away.

186
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,299
But I could still
feel it rumbling

187
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,299
and see the black plume
of smoke.

188
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,600
I had never seen anything
like this catastrophe.

189
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,300
This is amazing, roku.

190
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,599
You're battling a volcano,
and you're winning.

191
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,499
Unfortunately, my success
didn't last, aang.

192
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,000
There was no way
I could do it all.

193
00:16:56,611 --> 00:17:00,699
Battling the elements
was hard enough

194
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,399
I had to do it while
I could barely breathe.

195
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,799
The poisonous, volcanic gasses
were overwhelming.

196
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,799
It's all right, fang.

197
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,200
Get out of here, I'm fine.

198
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,799
Need a hand, old friend?

199
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,000
Sozin?

200
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,700
There's not a moment to waste.

201
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,400
Don't breathe the toxic gas.

202
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,599
It's... too much.

203
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,500
Please...

204
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,599
Without you, all my plans
are suddenly possible.

205
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,000
I have a vision
for the future, roku.

206
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,399
Who's, wait,
that's me, isn't it?

207
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,599
Make sense of our past, aang.

208
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,599
And you will bring peace
and restore balance in the world.

209
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,000
Roku?

210
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,899
Roku...

211
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,399
With roku gone,
and the great comet returning

212
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,099
the timing was perfect
to change the world.

213
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,799
I knew the next avatar
would be born an air nomad

214
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,199
so I wiped out the air temples.

215
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,899
But somehow,
the new avatar eluded me.

216
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,699
I wasted the remainder of
my life searching in vain.

217
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,999
I know he's hiding
out there somewhere

218
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,299
the fire nation's
greatest threat.

219
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
The last airbender.

220
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,600
That can't be it,
where's the rest of it?

221
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,199
You sent this, didn't you?

222
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,899
I found the secret history.

223
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,599
Which, by the way, should be renamed
"the history most people already know."

224
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,399
The note said that I needed to
know about my great-grandfather's death

225
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,199
but he was still alive
in the end.

226
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,299
No, he wasn't.

227
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,799
What are you talking about?

228
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,199
You have more than one
great-grandfather, prince zuko.

229
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,499
Sozin was your
father's grandfather.

230
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,299
Your mother's grandfather
was avatar roku.

231
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,599
Why are you telling me this?

232
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,499
Because understanding the struggle
between your two great-grandfathers

233
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,300
can help you better understand
the battle within yourself.

234
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,899
Evil and good are always
at war inside you, zuko

235
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,899
it is your nature, your legacy.

236
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,399
But there is a bright side.

237
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,999
What happened generations ago
can be resolved now.

238
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,699
By you.

239
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,799
Because of your legacy, you alone
can cleanse the sins of our family

240
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,099
and the fire nation.

241
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,699
Born in you,
along with all this strife

242
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,800
is the power to restore balance
to the world.

243
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,699
This is a royal artifact.

244
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,900
It's supposed to be worn
by the crown prince.

245
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,199
You mean, after all roku and
sozin went through together

246
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,799
even after roku showed him mercy,
sozin betrayed him like that?

247
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,699
It's like these people
are born bad.

248
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,000
No, that's wrong.

249
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,199
I don't think that was the point
of what roku showed me at all.

250
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,499
Then what was the point?

251
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,899
Roku was just as much
fire nation as sozin was, right?

252
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,999
If anything, their story proves anyone's
capable of great good and great evil.

253
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,699
Everyone, even the fire lord
and the fire nation

254
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,199
have to be treated like
they're worth giving a chance.

255
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,299
And I also think it was
about friendships.

256
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:30,099
Do you really think friendships
can last more than one lifetime?

257
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,399
I don't see why not.

258
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,299
Well, scientifically
speaking, there's no way to prove that...

259
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,700
oh, sokka, just hold hands.
