1
00:00:01,118 --> 00:00:02,835
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,636
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,739
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,174
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,409
<i>Long ago...</i>

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,544
<i>The four nations lived
together in harmony.</i>

7
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:17,449
<i>Then everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,653
<i>Only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,505
<i>But when the world
needed him most</i>

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,457
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:29,228
<i>100 years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

12
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,063
<i>an airbender named aang.</i>

13
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,499
<i>And although his airbending
skills were great</i>

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,635
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,939
<i>But I believe aang
can save the world.</i>

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,183
I am proud of you, prince zuko.

17
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,253
You slayed the avatar.

18
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,790
You're so beautiful
when you hate the world.

19
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,625
I don't hate you.

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,293
I don't hate you, too.

21
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,497
I have everything
I always wanted.

22
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,768
But it's not at all
how I thought it would be.

23
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,336
The avatar is alive.

24
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,804
I want you to find him...

25
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,206
And end him.

26
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,353
I'm so excited to spend
the weekend on ember island.

27
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,656
It's gonna be great to hang out
on the beach and do nothing.

28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,458
Doing nothing
is a waste of time.

29
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,729
We're being sent away
on a forced vacation.

30
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:35,961
I feel like a child.

31
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,363
Lighten up.

32
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,131
So dad wants to meet
with his advisors alone

33
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,833
without anyone else around.

34
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,334
Don't take it personally.

35
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,404
Doesn't your family have
a house on ember island?

36
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,539
We used to come every
summer when we were kids.

37
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,141
That must've been fun.

38
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,977
That was a long time ago.

39
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,725
Welcome to ember island, kids.

40
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,372
It smells like
old lady in here.

41
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,274
Gee, I wonder why.

42
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,612
Who are these
two beautiful women?

43
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,815
Can't you tell?

44
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,950
It's li
and me. S lo and me.

45
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,421
Ooh, I love
this seashell bedspread.

46
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,855
Are you serious?

47
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,224
It looks like the beach
threw up all over it.

48
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,360
We know you're upset

49
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,329
that you were forced
to come here this weekend.

50
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,433
But ember island
is a magical place

51
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,401
keep an open mind.

52
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,603
Give it a chance.

53
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:55,307
And it can help you understand
yourselves and each other.

54
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,812
The beach has a special way

55
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,281
of smoothing even
the most ragged edges.

56
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,653
Time to hit the beach.

57
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:13,392
Aang, I know
swimming is fun and all

58
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,195
but do you really think you should
be exposing yourself like that?

59
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,096
Cover up.

60
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,147
What?

61
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,032
I'm wearing trunks.

62
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,834
I know, it's youtattoos
I'm worried about.

63
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,469
What if someone sees you?

64
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,204
There are walls all around us.

65
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,538
It's completely safe.

66
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:32,845
Whoo, hey!

67
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:43,856
This has got to be the most
boring job in the fire nation.

68
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:44,990
Nothing ever happens.

69
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,028
Whoa!

70
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,965
Let's go again.

71
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,572
The avatar's alive.

72
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,208
We better send a messenger
hawk to the fire lord.

73
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,817
A black ribbon message.

74
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,952
This is so exciting.

75
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,373
Ahh!

76
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,643
Hey, you need
some help unpacking?

77
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,312
Sure, thanks.

78
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,760
Could you scooch just
a little bit more to the...

79
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,562
Perfect.

80
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,899
Here...

81
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,434
This is for you.

82
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,370
Why would I want that?

83
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,221
I saw it and I thought
it was pretty.

84
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,022
Don't girls like
stuff like this?

85
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,342
Maybe stupid girls.

86
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,493
Forget it!

87
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,088
Wow, thanks.

88
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,857
This is so pretty.

89
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,492
Not as pretty as you are.

90
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,560
That shell's not so great.

91
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,230
Ahem, shade... shade.

92
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,635
I thought since
it's so hot... here.

93
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,605
Thks.

94
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,241
This is really refreshing.

95
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,615
Hey, beach bums,
we're playing next.

96
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,184
Ty Lee, get over here now.

97
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,134
See that girl with
the silly pigtails?

98
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,270
When she runs
towards the ball...

99
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,072
There's just the slightest
hesitation of her left foot.

100
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,843
I'm willing to bet a childhood
injury has weakened her.

101
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:18,544
Keep serving the ball to her
left and we'll destroy her

102
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,912
and the rest of her team.

103
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,081
Dismissed.

104
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,049
Yes, we defeated you
for all time.

105
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,552
You will never rise from the ashes
of your shame and humiliation.

106
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,922
Well, that was fun.

107
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,758
I'm having a party tonight.

108
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,126
You should come by.

109
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:07,993
Sure...

110
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,261
I love parties.

111
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,729
Your friend can come, too.

112
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,999
Uh, what about
me and my brother?

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,534
Aren't you going to invite us?

114
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,570
You don't know
who we are, do you?

115
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,673
Don't you know who we are?

116
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,675
We're chan and ruon-jian.

117
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,009
Yeah.

118
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,880
But fine, you're invited.

119
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,548
Just so you know, though

120
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,684
some of the most important
teenagers in the fire nation

121
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,452
are gonna be at this party so...

122
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,653
Try and act normal.

123
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,588
We'll do our best.

124
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:42,294
Why didn't you tell
those guys who were were?

125
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,096
I guess I was intrigued.

126
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,265
I'm so used to
people worshipping us.

127
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,416
They should.

128
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,735
Yes, I know, and I love it.

129
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,503
But for once,
I just wanted to see

130
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,173
how people would treat us if
they didn't know who we were.

131
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,275
Like waves washing away

132
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,610
the footprints othe sand

133
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,581
ember island gives
everyone a clean slate.

134
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,918
Ember island
reveals the true you.

135
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,122
To the party.
To the party.

136
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,169
Um... you're a little early.

137
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,604
No one's here yet.

138
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,085
I heard you telling someone

139
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,840
you'd be partying
from dusk till dawn.

140
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,143
It's dusk so we're here.

141
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,012
But that's just an expression.

142
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,981
We are the perfect party guests.

143
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,732
We arrive right on time
because we are very punctual.

144
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:18,223
All right, listen,
my dad's an admiral.

145
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,692
He has no idea
I'm having this party

146
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,927
so don't mess anything up.

147
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,832
That's a sharp
outfit, chan... careful.

148
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,703
You could puncture the hull
of an empire-class fire nation battleship

149
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,138
leaving thousands
to drown at sea...

150
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,875
Because it so sharp.

151
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,546
Um... thanks.

152
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,321
Hey, first ones here, huh?

153
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,825
He thinks he's so great.

154
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,294
Well, what do you think of him?

155
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,145
I don't have any
opinion about him.

156
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,597
I hardly know him.

157
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,500
You like him, don't you?

158
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,708
So how do you know ty Lee?

159
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,076
I met her at the beach today.

160
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,087
She was pretty impressed
by a sand pagoda that I made for her.

161
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,249
Well, I met her first.

162
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,886
Look, it doesn't matter
who I met first 'cause I like you all.

163
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,022
But which one of us
do you like?

164
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,923
Yeah.
Tell us.

165
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,226
I don't know, I don't know.

166
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,462
Ooh.

167
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,331
Ahh...

168
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,166
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

169
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,235
Those boys won't
leave me alone.

170
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,270
I guess they all
just like me too much.

171
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,540
Come on, ty Lee,
you can't be this ignorant.

172
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,242
What are you talking about?

173
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,512
Those boys only like you because
you make it so easy for them.

174
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,681
You're not a challenge-
you're a tease.

175
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,250
It's not like they
actually care who you are.

176
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,155
Ok, ok, calm down.

177
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,124
I didn't mean what I said.

178
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,460
Look, maybe I just said it
because I was a little...

179
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,428
Jealous.

180
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,196
What?

181
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,731
You were jealous of me?

182
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:10,235
Um, but, you're the most beautiful,
smartest, perfect girl in the world.

183
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,804
Well, you're right
about all those things.

184
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,672
But for some reason
when I meet boys

185
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,108
they act as if I'm going to do
something horrible to them.

186
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,511
But you probably
would do something horrible to them.

187
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:23,082
I'm sure they're
just intimidated by you.

188
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,651
Ok, look, if you want
a boy to like you

189
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,453
just look at him and smile a lot

190
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,356
and laugh at everything he says
even if it's not funny.

191
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:35,027
Well, that sounds
really shallow and stupid.

192
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,178
Let's try it.

193
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,563
Ok.

194
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,898
"Hey, there, sweet sugar cakes.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,201
How ya likin' this party?"

196
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,308
- I'm bored.
- I know.

197
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,910
I'm hungry.
So what?

198
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,879
So find me some food.

199
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,314
Sure.

200
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,086
Chan, I'm ready for
a tour of the house.

201
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,493
Is this your first time
on ember island?

202
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,928
No, I used to
come here years ago.

203
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,731
It's a great place
if you like sand.

204
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:19,304
Yeah, it's like,
"welcome to Sandy land."

205
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,813
Your arms look so strong.

206
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,582
Yeah, I know.

207
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,054
You're pretty.

208
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,823
Together, you and I will be...

209
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,574
The strongest couple
in the entire world.

210
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,561
We will dominate the earth!

211
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:50,369
Uh... I gotta go.

212
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,648
Hey, watch it.

213
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,883
That food was for
my cranky girlfriend.

214
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,240
Whoa...

215
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:13,942
What are you doing?

216
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,894
Stop talking to my girlfriend.

217
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,263
Relax, it's just a party.

218
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,431
Uh!

219
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,535
Zuko, what is wrong with you?

220
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,170
What's wrong with me?

221
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,905
Your temper's out of control.

222
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,874
You blow up over
every little thing.

223
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,810
You're so impatient and
hot-headed and angry.

224
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,747
Well, at least
I feel something... as opposed to you.

225
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,448
You have no passion
for anything.

226
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,151
You're just a big blah.

227
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,453
It's over, zuko.

228
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,222
We're done.

229
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,858
Who broke my Nana's vase?

230
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,827
That's it, you're out of here.

231
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,462
I was just leaving.

232
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,332
Have fun by yourself,
loser boy.

233
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,200
Nice.

234
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,854
Guys, you're all gonna
think I'm crazy

235
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,589
but it feels like
a metal man is coming.

236
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:11,737
I thought I'd find you here.

237
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:15,974
Those summers we spent
here seem so long ago.

238
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,477
So much has changed.

239
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,012
Come down to the beach with me.

240
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:23,215
Come on,
this place is depressing.

241
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,994
Hey...

242
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,230
Where's your new boyfriend?

243
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,635
Are you cold?

244
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,372
I'm freezing.

245
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,007
I'll make a fire.

246
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,710
There's plenty of
stuff to burn in there.

247
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,082
This is crazy.

248
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,893
How can we beat a guy who blows
things up with his mind?

249
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:00,853
We can.

250
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,154
Jump on appa.

251
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,589
I'll try to distract him.

252
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,434
I'm ok.

253
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,615
Well, that was random.

254
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,170
I don't think so.

255
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,040
I get the feeling
he knows who we are.

256
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,047
What are you doing?

257
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,682
What does it look
like I'm doing.

258
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,518
But it's a painting
of your family.

259
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,669
You think I care?

260
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,021
I think you do.

261
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,891
You don't know me, so why don't
you just mind your own business?

262
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,760
Ah, I know you.

263
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,795
No, you don't.

264
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,363
You're stuck in your
little ty Lee world

265
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,499
where everything's
great all the time.

266
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,467
Zuko, leave her alone.

267
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,136
I'm so pretty, look at me.

268
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,971
I can walk on my hands, whoo!

269
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,676
Circus freak.

270
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,546
Yes, I'm a circus freak.

271
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,848
Go ahead and laugh
all you want.

272
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,939
You wanna know why
I joined the circus?

273
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,318
Here we go.

274
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,288
Do you have any idea
what my home life was like

275
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,723
growing up with six sisters

276
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,192
who look exactly like me?

277
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,661
It was like,
I didn't even have my own name.

278
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,296
I joined the circus because

279
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,765
I was scared of spending
the rest of my life

280
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,801
as part of a matched set.

281
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,436
At least, I'm different now.

282
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,305
Circus freak is a compliment.

283
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:36,775
Guess that explains why you
need 10 boyfriends, too.

284
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,577
I'm sorry, what?

285
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,346
Attention issues?

286
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,381
You couldn't get enough
attention when you were a kid

287
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,950
so you're trying
to make up for it now.

288
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,986
Well, what's your excuse, mai?

289
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,389
You were an only child
for 15 years.

290
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,091
But even with all that attention

291
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:55,260
your aura is this
dingy, pasty, gray...

292
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,763
I don't believe in auras.

293
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,965
Yeah, you don't
believe in anything.

294
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:04,336
Oh, well, I'm sorry I can't be as
high-strung and crazy as the rest of you.

295
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,804
I'm sorry, too.

296
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:09,208
I wish you would be
high-strung and crazy for once

297
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,410
instead of keeping all your
feelings bottled up inside.

298
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,178
She just called your aura dingy.

299
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,346
Are you gonna take that?

300
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,781
What do you want from me?

301
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,685
You want a teary confession
about how hard my childhood was?

302
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,120
Well, it wasn't.

303
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,223
I was a rich only child
who got anything I wanted

304
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,592
as long as I behaved...

305
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,861
And sat still

306
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:31,563
and didn't speak
unless spoken to.

307
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,466
My mother said I had
to keep out of trouble.

308
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,969
We had my dad's political
career to think about.

309
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,837
Well, that's it, then.

310
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,674
You had a controlling mother
who had certain expectations

311
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,776
and if you strayed from them
you were shut down.

312
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,078
That's why you're afraid
to care about anything

313
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,246
and why you can't
express yourself.

314
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,615
You want me to express myself?

315
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,983
Leave me alone!

316
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,621
I like it when you
express yourself.

317
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,855
Don't touch me.

318
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,024
I'm still mad at you.

319
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,461
My life hasn't been
that easy, either, mai.

320
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,330
Whatever- that doesn't excuse
the way you've been acting.

321
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:06,899
Calm down, you guys.

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,501
This much negative energy
is bad for your skin.

323
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,070
You'll totally break out.

324
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,221
Bad skin?

325
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,807
Normal teenagers worry
about bad skin.

326
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,308
I don't have that luxury.

327
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:20,179
My father decided to teach me
a permanent lesson on my face.

328
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,047
Sorry, zuko, I...

329
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,484
For so long, I thought
that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy.

330
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:26,685
I'm back home, now.

331
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,770
My dad talks to me.

332
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,155
Huh, he even thinks I'm a hero.

333
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,724
Everything should
be perfect, right?

334
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,159
I should be happy now,
but I'm not.

335
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,929
I'm angrier than ever
and I don't know why.

336
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,298
There's a simple question
you need to answer then.

337
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,733
Who are you angry at?

338
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,435
No one, I'm just angry.

339
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,238
Yeah, who are you
angry at, zuko?

340
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,041
Everyone... I don't know.

341
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:49,942
Is it dad?

342
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,477
No, no.

343
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:52,845
Your uncle?
Me?

344
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:54,880
No, no... no, no.

345
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,048
Then who?

346
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,182
Who are you angry at?

347
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,650
Answer the question, zuko.

348
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,785
Talk to us.

349
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,186
Come on, answer the question.

350
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,688
Come on, answer it.

351
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,591
I'm angry at myself.

352
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,397
Why?

353
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,932
Because I'm confused.

354
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,968
Because I'm not sure
I know the difference

355
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,736
between right
and wrong anymore.

356
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:18,704
You're pathetic.

357
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:22,074
I know one thing
I care about...

358
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,109
I care about you.

359
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,883
Well, those were wonderful
performances, everyone.

360
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,952
I guess you wouldn't
understand, would you, azula

361
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:35,921
because you're just so perfect.

362
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,023
Well, yes, I guess you're right.

363
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,325
I don't have sob stories
like all of you.

364
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,562
I could sit here and complain how
our mom liked zuko more than me

365
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:46,231
but I don't really care.

366
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,866
My own mother...

367
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,035
Thought I was a monster.

368
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:56,775
She was right, of course,
but it still hurt.

369
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,144
What lo and li said came true.

370
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,347
The beach did help us
learn about ourselves.

371
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,582
I feel all smoothed.

372
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,217
I'll always remember this.

373
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:08,887
You know what would make
this trip really memorable?

374
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,027
We've got some bad news, chan.

375
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,628
