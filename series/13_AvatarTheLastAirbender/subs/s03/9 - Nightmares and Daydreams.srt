<i>Water</i>

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,636
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,739
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,207
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,244
<i>Long ago the four nations
lived together in harmony</i>

6
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:16,732
<i>Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:20,949
<i>Only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,256
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:28,024
<i>100 years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar,</i>

10
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,763
<i>an airbender named Aang</i>

11
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:32,199
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great</i>

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,335
<i>He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:39,327
<i>But I believe Aang
can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:50,168
You have redeemed yourself, my son.

15
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:52,277
Welcome home

16
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:56,770
I know one thing I care
about. I care about you.

17
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:59,968
A solar eclipse is coming.

18
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,802
The sun will be entirely blacked up by
the moon. The firebenders will be helpless.

19
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:07,467
That's the day we need
to invade the firenation

20
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:09,121
The day of black sun.

21
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:11,975
I've always known that I'd
have to face the firelord.

22
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:13,899
But now I know I
need to do it alone.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Book three: Fire

24
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:20,001
Chapter Nine:
Nightmares and Daydreams

25
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:24,002
Made by elpiedro from
http:/santahelp. wordpress. com

26
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:32,900
This is it. The official rendezvous
point for the invasion force.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,856
How did you pick this place?

28
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:37,664
Before we split up my dad and
I found this island on the map.

29
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:41,474
It's uninhabited and the
harbor is surrounded by cliffs.

30
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,857
Nice choice, Sokka. And we are
here four days ahead at schedule.

31
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,004
Four days?

32
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:49,251
The invasion is in four days?

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,569
Whatever, that's like four days
from now. Let just calm down and...

34
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,801
Sokka has got the right idea, Aang

35
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:01,871
We are here, we are ready.

36
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,616
The best thing we can do
now is get plenty of rest.

37
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:08,153
I guess.

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,421
Your days eternity
are over, Firelord.

39
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:30,206
I'm bringing you down.

40
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:37,652
Really? How do you plan on doing that
when you are not even wearing pants.

41
00:02:38,887 --> 00:02:40,477
Oh no.

42
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:06,269
It was just a dream, Momo.
I still have my pants.

43
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:09,472
Well, I better keep training.

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,865
Fresh foot, prince Zuko?

45
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:29,181
May I wash your feet, sir?

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,615
Head massage?

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,635
Hot towel?

48
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:57,869
Prince Zuko, is something wrong?
You didn't take the palan key.

49
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,408
I'm just going to Mai's
house. It's not far.

50
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:03,403
It is not a prince's place
to walk anywhere, sir.

51
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:39,032
Hey

52
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,615
How long have you been up?

53
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:42,318
A couple hours.

54
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,938
I've got a lot more skills to
refine if I'm going to fight Ozai.

55
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,343
You know there is such
a thing as overtraining.

56
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,122
You don't get it, do you?

57
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:02,760
My form is bad, I'm sloppy and I
still don't know any firebending.

58
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,794
Not even the basics.

59
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:09,003
That's okay, Aang. The eclipse
will block off firebending anyway.

60
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:12,219
You don't need to know any.
Plus it's a stupid element.

61
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,136
Okay, well, I still have
to work on everything else.

62
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:17,067
I better spend the
whole day training.

63
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:37,920
Good night, Katara.

64
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:39,743
Good night, Sokka.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,259
Good night, Toph.

66
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,626
Good night, Appa.

67
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,986
Good night, Momo.

68
00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:46,750
Good night, Appa and Momo...
- I'm asleep already.

69
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:07,193
Your days eternity
are over, Firelord.

70
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:09,140
I'm bringing you down.

71
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:11,825
And this time I brought pants.

72
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:14,662
So it seems.

73
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:18,652
But are you prepared for
your mathematics test?

74
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:23,599
Math test? Oh no, I forgot
all about the math test.

75
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,528
I've got to be ready.

76
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:42,922
Aang, it's the middle of the night.

77
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:44,686
You need to go back to sleep.

78
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,275
But I forgot my pants
and my math test.

79
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,786
Aang, sleep, please. For me.

80
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,762
Tell me, if you can had anything
you want right now, what would it be?

81
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,956
A big fancy fruit tart
with rose peddles on top.

82
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:20,259
You know, being a prince and all I
might just be able to make that happen.

83
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:23,344
That would be impressive.

84
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:26,198
Do you think you can find a
fresh fruit tart for the lady?

85
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,747
With rose peddles on top?
- Excellent choice, sir.

86
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:33,019
I guess there is some nice
perks to come with being royalty.

87
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,590
Though there is annoying stuff too.
Like that all day war meeting coming up.

88
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,136
War meeting? What
you talking about?

89
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:43,946
Azula mentioned something.
I assumed you were going too.

90
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,986
I guess I wasn't invited.

91
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,615
Wake up, Aang.

92
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,067
Wake up sleepyhead.

93
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:57,125
Rise and shine

94
00:07:57,126 --> 00:08:00,460
You overslept. You
missed the invasion.

95
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,779
Sokka, get up. I need
to know what day it is.

96
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,226
What? Who's talking?

97
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:18,677
Relax, it's still two
days before the invasion.

98
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:22,382
Sokka, you've got to get up and
drill your wall climbing exercises.

99
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:23,592
What?

100
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:26,545
In one of my dreams you were
running from firenation soldiers...

101
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:29,619
trying to climb this cliff. But
you were to slow and they got you.

102
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,856
But that was just a
dream. I'm a great climber.

103
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,369
Then climb that
cliff. Climb it fast.

104
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,137
Stupid Avatar. Stupid cliff.

105
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:48,082
Stupid dream. I can climb fast.

106
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:51,018
Don't drink that.

107
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,277
Why? Is it poison?

108
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:56,855
In my dream we were right
in the middle of the invasion

109
00:08:56,856 --> 00:09:01,143
and you had to stop to use the bathroom.
We die because your tiny bladder.

110
00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:04,910
And you need to stop wearing your hear up.
In my dream your hear got caught in a train

111
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,534
Aang... I know you
are just trying to help

112
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:11,197
But you really need to get
a grip. You are unraveling.

113
00:09:12,976 --> 00:09:15,991
You are right. I'm losing my mind.

114
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:26,462
It is like every time about how stressed
I am, I just end up more stressed.

115
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:29,093
I'm like a big growing
snowball of nerves.

116
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:31,957
Of cource you are. That's because
you got to fight the firelord.

117
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,913
The baddest man on the planet and
you better win or we are all done for.

118
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:37,648
Sokka, you're not helping.

119
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,571
What? It's true. That's
the deal, he knows it.

120
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:46,505
You know what, I've
got just the thing.

121
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:48,799
Get ready to be destressafied.

122
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:56,223
These yoga stretches can really work
wonders if you do them in extreme heat.

123
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:58,317
Reach up

124
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:00,604
Reach for the sun.

125
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:03,709
Feel your t-pads clearing.

126
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:08,412
Now close your eyes.
How are you feeling?

127
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:14,028
I feel... really warm.
- Good, good.

128
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:18,605
Like there's this warm
feeling all around me.

129
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:22,809
This heat. Like I'm in
the firelord's palace...

130
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,287
and he's shooting a
bunch of fireballs at me.

131
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:27,715
And the whole world is
being engold in flames.

132
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:32,846
Maybe your stress is the
kind you need to talk out.

133
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:40,016
Why don't you get right down to business
and tell me what has been bothering you.

134
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:44,065
You know what's bothering me. I have
to fight the firelord in a few days.

135
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:50,721
Tell me more about this firelord.
Why are you so afraid of him?

136
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:53,644
You said it yourself he's
the baddest man on the planet.

137
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:56,317
I'm supposed to defeat
him and save the world.

138
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,915
Life does feel that way
sometimes, doesn't it?

139
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,283
Like we are all trying to
save the world from evil.

140
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:05,773
Okay, but what can
I do to feel better?

141
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:07,926
Want to try screaming
into this pillow?

142
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:27,343
Hello Zuzu.

143
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:30,438
If you come for a royal hair
coming I'm afraid you have to wait.

144
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,047
So I guess there's a big
war meeting coming up, huh?

145
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:35,036
And apparently I'm
not welcome there.

146
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:37,912
What do you mean? Of
course you're welcome.

147
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:40,889
Oh yeah? I guess that's why no
one bothered to tell me about it.

148
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,776
Oh, Zuko, don't be so dramatic.
I'm certain dad wants you there.

149
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:47,586
You probably weren't
invited because...

150
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:50,131
it is so obviously that
you supposed to be there.

151
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,975
Well, were you invited?
- Of cource, I'm the princes.

152
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:56,769
And I'm the prince.
- Exactly.

153
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,106
So stop acting like
a paranoid child.

154
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:02,849
Just go to the meeting.
- Forget it, I'm not going.

155
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:11,357
All right, what you need is a good old fashion
back pounding to relieve your stress.

156
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:12,807
Pound a way.

157
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:22,739
Toph, I think this is fruzing me.

158
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:28,463
Sorry, I forgot you have baby skin.

159
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:31,670
Well, there's one
other thing we can try

160
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,657
Ace pulsar

161
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:44,370
Zuko, it's just a dumb meeting.

162
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:46,946
Who cares?
- I don't.

163
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:49,055
Well good, you shouldn't.

164
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:51,266
I mean why do you even want to go?

165
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:54,517
Just think about how things went
the last war meeting you went to.

166
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,038
I know.

167
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,120
You know what'd
make you feel better?

168
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,998
Ordering some servants around.

169
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:05,319
I might be hungry for a
whole tray of fruit tarts

170
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,393
And maybe a little palan
key ride around town.

171
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:09,597
Double time.

172
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:21,389
Thanks for everything guys.
- So, do you feel less stressed?

173
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,153
Ready for a good night sleep?

174
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:28,473
I kinda think I sort of might
slightly feel a little better.

175
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,385
Maybe.
- Then our work here is done.

176
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:47,987
What happened, Aang?

177
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,597
It's the nightmares.

178
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,521
They just get worse and worse.

179
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:54,719
Look like it's time for
another therapy session.

180
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:57,823
No, that won't help. Nothing helps.

181
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,205
There's only one thing I can do.

182
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:03,354
I'm going to stay wake
straight trough the invasion.

183
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:13,513
Invasion.

184
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,382
All aboard for the invasion.

185
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,459
You don't look so good.

186
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,196
You sure you can't just
lay down for a little nap?

187
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:24,119
I told you I can't go back to sleep

188
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,530
Aang, staying up all night
can't be good for you.

189
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:29,944
Actually staying up all night
has given me some time to think.

190
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,320
And I realize some
big things, Katara.

191
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:33,996
What big things?

192
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:37,250
I see everything so clearly
now. What really matters.

193
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,286
Why I'm really doing this.

194
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:42,033
I'm doing it to save the
world. But more than that...

195
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:46,431
I'm doing it for the people I
love. I'm doing it for you, Katara.

196
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:49,632
Aang, what are you saying?
- I'm saying...

197
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:51,851
I love you

198
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:01,392
What are we doing?

199
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:05,342
What our hearts have been telling
us to do for a long, long time.

200
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:08,280
Baby, you're my forever girl.

201
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,319
Aang...

202
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,579
I was just saying
you should take a nap.

203
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:18,418
Oh, I guess I kinda
drifted off into a daydream.

204
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:19,992
What was your dream about?

205
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,764
Uh, living under water.

206
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:25,510
Sounds unique.

207
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:36,038
Price Zuko, everyone
is waiting for you.

208
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,907
What?

209
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,731
The high admirals, the high
generals, the war ministers...

210
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:42,083
and the princes have all arrived.
You're the only person missing.

211
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:45,576
So, my dad wants me at the meeting?

212
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:48,587
The firelord said he would not
start until your arrive, sir.

213
00:16:56,778 --> 00:16:58,440
Put them up, firelord.

214
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,982
Hey, I'm trying to build
Appa some armor here...

215
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:09,183
so that he doesn't have to
go to the invasion naked.

216
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:10,503
He's your bison.

217
00:17:10,635 --> 00:17:14,450
Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll
have to try a different approach.

218
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,030
You think you're untouchable,
don't you mister firelord?

219
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:29,942
Oi, you're really
starting to lose it kid.

220
00:17:30,956 --> 00:17:33,758
Momo? Did you hear something?

221
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,299
No, but I said something.

222
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:42,202
You my friend are just a few
plunch short of a fruit pie.

223
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,216
That's more like it.

224
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:55,879
I'm so tired that for a second there
I imagined you were talking to me.

225
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,752
Oh, Momo let me explain.

226
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:10,487
Aang?

227
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:13,890
We are all starting to get
a little worried about you.

228
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,783
You've been awake too long.

229
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:18,024
And you're acting weird.

230
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:23,969
You've got to take care of
yourself. You can't go on like this.

231
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:27,768
Look, I appreciate
what you guys are saying

232
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:31,473
but the stress and the nightmares
they were just too much.

233
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:34,281
Staying awake is the best
way for me to deal with it.

234
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:36,124
Yeah, leave the kid alone.

235
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,110
Hey, who asked you?

236
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,559
Guys, come on.

237
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,542
No, I'm sick of this guy always
mounting off and telling me what to do.

238
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:47,854
Oh, you don't like it.
Then let's go right now.

239
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,434
Sokka, what should we do?
- About what?

240
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:52,485
About that

241
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:29,319
Come on guys, we're
all on the same side.

242
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:08,191
I just need a jump
in a cold waterfall.

243
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:19,009
So? How did it go?

244
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,394
When I got at the meeting,
everyone welcomed me.

245
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:26,534
My father had saved me a
seat. He wanted me next to him.

246
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:28,912
I was literally at his right hand.

247
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:32,748
Zuko, that's wonderful.
You must be happy.

248
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,422
During the meeting I
was the perfect prince.

249
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:46,262
The son my father
wanted. But I wasn't me.

250
00:21:02,505 --> 00:21:07,186
Oh, look another hallucination. An
imaginary bed made out of clouds.

251
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:10,482
Hey, it's real. We spend
hours working on it.

252
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:14,189
We made it for you, a good night sleep
will probably take the crazy away.

253
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,354
We hope.

254
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:17,690
Look, you guys keep
telling me I need to sleep.

255
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:20,484
But I can't, the
invasion is tomorrow.

256
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:22,181
Aang..
- No, Katara.

257
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:26,955
There is still so much I haven't learnt. I
don't need sleep, what I need is practice.

258
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:28,374
Quick, hit me.

259
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,235
I'm not going to hit you.

260
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:32,841
You want me to do it?

261
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:36,292
Listen to me, you've been training
for this since the day we met.

262
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,153
I've seen your progress.

263
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:40,473
You're smart, brave
and strong enough.

264
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,453
You really think so?

265
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:46,285
We all do, you can
do this. You're ready.

266
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:48,408
You're the man, twinkletoes.

267
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,706
Thanks guys.

268
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:02,792
You know what? I think I'm ready.

269
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:14,432
Your days eternity
are over, Firelord.

270
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:18,995
Really? You're going to take me
out? You're not even wearing pants.

271
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,434
No, firelord Ozai.
You're not wearing pants.

272
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,834
My royal parts are showing.
