1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,370
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,540
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,710
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,860
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,450
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,780
<i>Then, everything changed when
the fire nation attacked</i>

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,890
<i>only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,490
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,190
<i>A hundred years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar.</i>

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,860
<i>An airbender named aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,070
<i>And although his airbending skills are great, he has
a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,130
<i>But I believe, aang
can save the world.</i>

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,530
Sokka's your name, right? My favourite
prisoner used to mention you all the time.

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,500
She was convinced you are
going to come rescue her.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,810
Of course he never came,
and she gave up on you.

16
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,690
Where.. Is.. Suki?

17
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,780
How are we all gonna escape?

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,600
We're not.

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,620
You kids have to leave.
You have to escape on appa together.

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,010
Bye, dad. We won't be apart
for too long this time.

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,120
I promise.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,880
No one can make tea like uncle, but
hopefully I learned a thing or two...

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,760
Would you like to hear
uncle's favourite tea-joke?

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,590
Sure, I like jokes

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,460
bring it

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,340
ok, I can't remember how it starts but the
punch line is 'leave me alone, I'm bushed'

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,750
well, it's funny when uncle tells it.

28
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,530
Right, maybe that's because
he remembers the whole thing.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,150
Everyone laughs

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,510
it's nice to get a chance to relax a
little... it hardly ever happens.

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,750
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,550
So what's up?

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,320
If someone was captured by the fire nation,

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,700
where would they be taken?

35
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,100
What do you mean? Who was captured?

36
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,050
When the invasion plan failed,
some of our troops were taken.

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,370
I just wanna know where they might be.

38
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,850
I can't tell you.

39
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,270
What? Why not?

40
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,180
Trust me. Knowing will
just make you feel worse.

41
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,180
It's mine dad. He was captured too.

42
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,440
I need to know what I put him through.

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,320
It's not good, sokka

44
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,130
please

45
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,160
my guess is...

46
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,410
They were taken to the boiling rock.

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,350
What's that?

48
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,000
The highest security
prison in the fire nation.

49
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,470
It's on the island in the
middle of the boiling lake.

50
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,350
It's unescapable.

51
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,810
So where is this place?

52
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,490
Why do you need to know?

53
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,840
What do you planing?

54
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,870
Nothing.

55
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,630
Boy, you're so paranoid.

56
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,040
It's in the middle of the volcano
between her and the fire nation.

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,180
You guys actually flew right
past it on the way here.

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,410
Thanks, zuko.

59
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,770
A-a-a-ah..
Just knowing makes me feel better.

60
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,720
Yeah... I'm sure it does.

61
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,490
Not up to anything, huh?

62
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,100
Fine. You caught me.

63
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,500
I'm gonna rescue mine dad.
You're happy now?

64
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,380
I am never happy.

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,450
Look, I have to do this.

66
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,320
The invasion plan was mine idea. It was mine decision
to stay when things when things were going wrong.

67
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,430
It's my mistake.
And it's mine job to fix it.

68
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,630
I have to regain mine honor.

69
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,330
You can't stop me, zuko.

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
You need to regain your honor?
Believe me... I get it.

71
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,430
I'm going with you.

72
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,210
No. I have to do this alone.

73
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,840
How you're going to get here? On appa?

74
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,100
Last time I checked prisons
don't have a bisons take cares.

75
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,120
We'll take mine war baloon.

76
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,480
What does it say?

77
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,120
Need meat. Gone fishing.
Back in a few days. Sokka and zuko.

78
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,440
One more thing. Aang, practice
your firebending while I'm gone.

79
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,890
Do the twenty of sets of fire fists and ten hot
squats everytime you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko.

80
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,770
Nobody else has homework.

81
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,920
One hotsquat, two hotsquats, three
hotsquat, four hotsquat....

82
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,310
Pretty clouds.

83
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,970
Yeah, fluffy.

84
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,410
What?

85
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,070
What?

86
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,950
Oh.. I didn't said anything.

87
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,670
You know, a friend of mine actually
designed this war baloons.

88
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,510
No kidding.

89
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,180
Yep.

90
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,400
Baloon. But for a war.

91
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,350
There is one thing my dad is good at.
It's war.

92
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,700
Yeah.. It seems to ru in a family.

93
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,570
Hey, hold on, not everyone
in mine family is like that.

94
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,930
I know, I know... you've changed.

95
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,930
I met my uncle.
He was more than father to me.

96
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,240
And I really let him down.

97
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,130
I think your uncle would be proud with you.

98
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,940
Leaving your home to come help us.
That's hard.

99
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,390
It wasn't that hard.

100
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,990
Really?

101
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,560
You didn't left behind
anyone you cared about?

102
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,360
Well, I did have a girlfriend.

103
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,060
Mai.

104
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,380
That gloomy girl, who sighs a lot?

105
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,620
Yeah.

106
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,600
Everyone in the fire nation
thinks I am a traitor.

107
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,630
I couldn't drag her into it.

108
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Mine first girlfriend turned to the moon.

109
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,080
That's rough, buddy.

110
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,110
There it is.

111
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,240
There is plenty of steam
to keep us covered.

112
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,550
As long as we quite, we
should be able to navigate

113
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,220
through it without being caught.

114
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,330
We're going down!
Baloon is not working anymore.

115
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,910
The air outside is just as hot as
the air inside, so we can't fly.

116
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,730
So what are we supposed to do?

117
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,310
I don't know! Crash-landing?

118
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,520
How we're gonna get off the island

119
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,720
if the baloon won't work?

120
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,260
We'll figure something out.

121
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,300
I suspected it that it
may be a one way-ticket.

122
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,340
You knew this would happen and
you wanted to come anyway?

123
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,720
My dad might here. I had to come and see.

124
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,080
Uncle always said I never
thought things through.

125
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,960
But this?

126
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,530
Ah, this is just crazy!

127
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,970
Hey, I never wanted you to
come along in the first place.

128
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,810
And for the record... I
always think things through.

129
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,640
But my plans didn't haven't exactly worked,

130
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,670
so this time I am playing it by ear.

131
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,770
So there.

132
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,480
What are you doing?

133
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,660
It doesn't work anyway.

134
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,480
And we don't want anyone to find it.

135
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,570
I hope you know what you're doing.

136
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,930
There is no turning back now.

137
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,910
I hope this disguises work.

138
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,450
We just need to lay low,

139
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,220
and find my dad as fast as possible.

140
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,710
Guards, there is scuffle in the yard.

141
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,360
Come on!

142
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,630
I am going back to my cell.

143
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,060
Stop right there, chit sang!

144
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,980
We can't blow our cover.

145
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,370
I had it with your unruly behavior.

146
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,250
What did I do?

147
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,830
He wants to know what he did.

148
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,520
Isn't that cute?

149
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,200
Ah, very cute, sir.

150
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,820
Super cute.

151
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,790
You didn't bow down, when
walked by, chit sang.

152
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,240
What? That's not a prison rule.

153
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,570
Do it.

154
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,670
Make me.

155
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,740
Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited.
You're going in a cooler.

156
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,720
You! Help me take him in!

157
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,020
Meet back here, in an hour.

158
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,900
A warden will deal with you soon.

159
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,130
Can you believe this guy?

160
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,250
Prisoners, am I right?

161
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,280
Eh.. Tell me about it.

162
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,430
Ha-ha.

163
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,710
Hey, new guy!

164
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,510
I know it's a rule to have
your helmet on all times but

165
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,060
this is lounge... relax.

166
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,640
But if there's an incident?

167
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,630
If I am not prepared someone
can strike me in a head.

168
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,000
Give it a wake. He'll loosen up.

169
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,130
Can a new guy ask you, veterans,
a few questions about a prison?

170
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,360
No you can't date a female guards.

171
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,000
Trust me, you don't want to.

172
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,890
No that's not it.

173
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
The boiling rock.

174
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,830
It holds a fire nations most
dangerous criminals, right?

175
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,180
So what about war prisoners?

176
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,930
It's sure looks cold in there.

177
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,430
That's why we call it a cooler

178
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,550
he wont be firebending in there.

179
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,220
It's a warden!

180
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,430
Look alive!

181
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,690
So, chit sang...

182
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,460
I hear you used a firebending
to try to escape.

183
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,290
You shouldn't know better.

184
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,660
I wasn't trying to escape...

185
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,350
He's lying, I saw it with my own eyes!

186
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,090
Noone has ever, ever escaped from here.

187
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,040
I'd sooner jump in a boiling lake
myself, than let that record fall.

188
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,190
Don't forget it.

189
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,610
Now, get back to your shivering.

190
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,990
Hey, there... fellow guard...

191
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,160
How goes it?

192
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,130
Zuko?

193
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,420
Shh!

194
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,530
Listen, I asked around the lounge...

195
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,710
There are no water tribe prisoners.

196
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,030
I am afraid your father is not here.

197
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,850
What?

198
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,050
Are you sure? Did you double-check?

199
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah. I am sure.

200
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,250
No!

201
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,610
No-o-o!

202
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm really sorry, sokka

203
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,970
so we came all this way for nothing.

204
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,420
I failed, again.

205
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,040
Augh, what would uncle say...

206
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,690
Sometimes clouds have two
sides... a dark and light.

207
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,200
And a silver lining in between.
It's like a silver sandwich.

208
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,660
Sooo... when life seems hard,

209
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,050
take a bite out of the silver sandwich.

210
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,570
Maybe we haven't failed after all!

211
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,260
That's a spirit.
I can't believe that worked,

212
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,290
I didn't even know what I was saying.

213
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,270
No, what you said made no sense at all,

214
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,350
but look...

215
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,000
It's suki!

216
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,980
Prisoners, back in your cells!

217
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,740
What is it? Did I do something wrong?

218
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,810
You mean you don't recognise me?

219
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,750
You people all look the same to me.

220
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,140
Oh, then maybe you will recognise this...

221
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,170
Sokka! It's you!

222
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,390
The other kyoshi warriors? Are they here?

223
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,350
No.

224
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,570
I don't know where they are.

225
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,830
They locked me in, because
I am their leader.

226
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,310
You won't be here for long.

227
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,760
I am busting you out.

228
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,180
I am so glad to see you, sokka!

229
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,630
I knew you'll come!

230
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,770
Excuse me, I need to get in that cell.

231
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,390
No, you can't go in there.

232
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,080
Eh.. The lights are out.

233
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,510
The prisoner can sneak up on you.

234
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
Step aside, fool!..

235
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,700
Hey, hey!.. What are you doing?!

236
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,530
Guard, help!

237
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,850
I think he's imposter!

238
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,470
Arrest him!

239
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,100
Get him off me, and arrest him!

240
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,290
You're under arrest!

241
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,310
Don't worry! I'll figure you out.

242
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,060
Well, well, well.

243
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,660
I never thought I will find you in here

244
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,190
prince zuko.

245
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,670
How did you know who I am?

246
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,340
How could I not?

247
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,630
You broke my niece's heart.

248
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,170
You're mai's uncle?..

249
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,220
I never meant to hurt her.

250
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,130
Quiet!

251
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,580
You're my special prisoner now.

252
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,580
And you best behave

253
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,240
if this criminals will
find out who you are...

254
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,890
The traitor prince who let his nation down.

255
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,750
They will dew you to shreds.

256
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,230
So what's in it for you?

257
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,210
Why don't you just tell my
father and collect the reward?

258
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,430
Oh, in a due time, believe me,

259
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,330
I intend to collect.

260
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,450
Oh, good. You guys have met.

261
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,650
Actually, we met a long time ago.

262
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,660
We did?

263
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,850
Yeah. You...

264
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,050
Kinda burnt down my village.

265
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,810
Oh. Sorry about that.

266
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,180
Nice to see you again.

267
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,280
So listen.

268
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,960
I think I have an escape plan.

269
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,330
I've checked that coolers again.

270
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,410
The whole point of them is to keep
all firebenders contained, right?

271
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,630
Yeah...

272
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,700
So they're completely insolated.

273
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,150
And sealed to keep the cold in.

274
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,270
Well, to keep the cold in,

275
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,710
you have to keep the heat out, right?

276
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,600
Just get to the point, sokka.

277
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,710
It's a perfect boat to get
through a boiling water.

278
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,900
The cooler as a boat?

279
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,940
Are you sure?

280
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,550
I'm telling you... it will work.

281
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,550
I worked around perimter.

282
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,230
There is a blind spot
between two guard towers.

283
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,650
It's a perfect launching point.

284
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,240
I already testid it out.

285
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,450
We will roll the cooler into the water
and just flow with the current.

286
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,320
It will take us straight across.

287
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,830
As long as we don't make a sound.

288
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,000
Noone will notice.

289
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,150
And bing-bang-boom... we're all home, free.

290
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,490
How are you goning to get the cooler out?

291
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,360
Yeah, how are you going
to get the cooler out?

292
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,490
What?

293
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,630
We didn't... we didn't say that.

294
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,230
Yeah, you heard wrong.

295
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,510
I heard you're hatching an escape plan.

296
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,640
And I want in.

297
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,330
There is nothing to get in on.

298
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,440
Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is...

299
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,490
An egg?..

300
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,960
Ok, well I come with you, or a
warden hears about this egg, too.

301
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,900
I guess we have no choice.

302
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,580
Ok you're in.

303
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,900
Now first we need someone
to unbolt the cooler.

304
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,210
From the inside.

305
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,500
Oh, I can get you inside.

306
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,820
Hey what are you, stupid...

307
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,780
Watch where you're going!

308
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,550
Hey, you who you're shoving!

309
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,610
I think you mean whome... I am shoving.

310
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,740
I need backup over here.

311
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,140
No firebending.

312
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,330
Into the cooler.

313
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,260
I can take you back into your
cell if you learned your lesson.

314
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,540
Yes, I have,

315
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,490
completely.

316
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,150
I got suki and chit sang out of
their cells a few minutes ago.

317
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,120
They will be waiting for us at the shore.

318
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,620
Someone's coming.

319
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,660
Yeah, new arrivals coming in a dawn.

320
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,020
Anybody interesting?

321
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,980
Nah, just the usual.

322
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,160
Some robbers, couple of
traitors, some war prisoners.

323
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,780
But I did hear there might be a pirate.

324
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,890
No fooling?

325
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,060
War prisoners.

326
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,040
It could be your father.

327
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,960
I know.

328
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,970
Well, what should we do?

329
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,620
Are we going according to plan,

330
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,050
or waiting another night?

331
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,140
I don't know.

332
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,149
Is it right for me...
To risk suki's freedom,

333
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,490
all of our freedom on a slim chance
that mine dad's gonna show up?

334
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,080
It's your call, sokka.

335
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,460
Took you guys, long enough.

336
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,630
This is mine girl and mine best buddy.
They are coming too.

337
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,520
Fine.

338
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,800
Everybody in a cooler.

339
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,850
Let's go.

340
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,780
Are you sure you wanna go?

341
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,060
You are the one who said that
you want to redeem yourself,

342
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,690
redeem your honor.

343
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,890
Rescuing your dad is your chance.

344
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,180
Your dad?

345
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,180
If would just count my
losses in the invasion.

346
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,350
Maybe we wouldn't be in this mess.

347
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,570
Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it

348
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,800
quit before you fail.

349
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,910
No. It's not.

350
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,340
Look, sokka.

351
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,660
You're gonna fail a lot,
before things will work out.

352
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,890
That's supposed to make me feel better?

353
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,340
Even though you'll probably
fail over and over again,

354
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,820
seriously, not helping.

355
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,900
You have to try every time.

356
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,120
You can't quit because you're
afraid you might fail.

357
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,410
Hey! If you two are done cuddling.

358
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,730
Can we get a move on?!

359
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,010
No, I am staying.

360
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,540
You guys go.

361
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,040
You've been here long enough.

362
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
I am not leaving without you, sokka

363
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,650
I am staying too.

364
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,620
Not me, I am out.

365
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,100
Let's row, baby.

366
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,810
We gave up our only chance for escaping.

367
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,570
I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.

368
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,080
Ahhh, this current is so slow.

369
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,610
I can use this to paddle.

370
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,050
Guards! Secure the perimeter
and lock down the prisoners.

371
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:57,900
Now!

372
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,139
The plan failed.

373
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,140
They're caught.

374
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,980
Get the fugitives and
throw them in a cooler.

375
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,170
Ah, they are in a cooler, sir.

376
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,460
One makes bolted down
and a flooded in water.

377
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,000
This is lockdown.

378
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,890
We have new prisoners arriving.

379
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,330
Everything must be completely secure.

380
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,080
The gondola is moving.

381
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,750
This is it.

382
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,680
If mine dad is not there, we
risked everything for nothing.

383
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,220
We had to.

384
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,980
Come on, come on.

385
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,620
Is that him?

386
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,970
Mine dad doesn't have nose-ring.

387
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,330
Where is he?

388
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,460
That's it?

389
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
That can't be it.

390
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,550
I am sorry sokka.

391
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,680
Oh, no.

392
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,700
Hey, you.

393
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,720
Get off the gondola.

394
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,700
Dad.
