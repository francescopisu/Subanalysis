1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,693
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:02,961
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:05,063
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:07,498
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:10,490
<i>Long ago...</i>

6
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,579
<i>The four nations lived
together in harmony.</i>

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,850
<i>Then everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:22,055
<i>Only the avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,906
<i>But when the world
needed him most</i>

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,858
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,629
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar...</i>

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,464
<i>An airbender named aang.</i>

13
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,900
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great</i>

14
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,036
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,807
<i>But I believe
aang can save the world.</i>

16
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,483
What about the invasion?

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:55,021
We'll join up with my dad and the
invasion force on the day of the eclipse.

18
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,056
Keep quiet.

19
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,859
We're in enemy territory.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,862
What we need is some
new clothes.

21
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,193
Yeah, blending in
is better than hiding out.

22
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,033
If we get fire nation disguises

23
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,969
we'll be just as safe
as we would be hiding in a cave.

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,271
Ta-da,
normal kid.

25
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:14,107
How do I look?

26
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,157
Momo?

27
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:36,095
Oh, momo?

28
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,231
Ah.

29
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:41,801
You found me, buddy.

30
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,303
Hey, guys, I think
this river's polluted.

31
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,716
Well, that explains why I can't
catch a fish around here.

32
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:01,054
Because normally my fishing
skills are... off the hook.

33
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,256
Get it, like a fishing hook?

34
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,758
Too bad your skills aren't
on the hook.

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,666
It looks like we'll need to go
somewhere else to get food.

36
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,736
Assuming that'll fit into
sokka's master schedule.

37
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,938
Hm... it's doable.

38
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,407
But that means only two
potty breaks today.

39
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,010
Hey, maybe we can
get food there.

40
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,517
Now you look just like
a little hill with horns.

41
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,985
Bye, buddy.

42
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,791
I don't feel anything.

43
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,360
Where's this village?

44
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,195
It's in the middle
of the river.

45
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,563
Sure is.

46
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,931
My name's dock.

47
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,532
Mind if I ask who you are?

48
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,737
We're, um, from the earth
kingdom colonies.

49
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,638
Wow, colonials.

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,141
Hop on, I'll give you a ride
into town.

51
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,213
Why do you guys
live on the river?

52
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,981
Because we're a fishing town.

53
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,951
At least that's how it was
before the factory moved in.

54
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,553
Army makes their metal there.

55
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,923
Moved in a few years ago and
started gunking up our river.

56
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,993
Now our little village is
struggling to survive.

57
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,569
Thanks for the ride.

58
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,938
Look at this place.

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,640
It's so sad.

60
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,610
We have to do something to help.

61
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,212
No, we can't waste
our time here.

62
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,049
We have a bigger mission
that we need to stay focused on.

63
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,317
These people are on their own.

64
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:42,155
These people are starving,
but you turn your back on them?

65
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,691
How can you be so cold
and heartless?

66
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:47,760
I'm not turning my back,
I'm just being realistic.

67
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,111
We can't go around helping every
rinky-dink town we wander into.

68
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,866
We'll be helping them all
by taking out the fire lord.

69
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,535
Hey, loudmouth...

70
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,670
Maybe we should be
a little quieter

71
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,606
when we talk about taking out
the fire lord.

72
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,042
Come on, katara,
be reasonable about this.

73
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,073
You know our mission
has to come first.

74
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,380
I guess so.

75
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,049
Let's just get
what we need and go.

76
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,124
Hey, dock, you work here too?

77
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm not dock, I'm shoe.

78
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,628
Dock's my brother.

79
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,230
But we just saw you.

80
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,399
You're even wearing
the same clothes.

81
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,368
The only difference is your hat.

82
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,571
Dock works on the docks,
that's why they call him "dock."

83
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,774
And I work in the shop,
that's why they call me "shoe."

84
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,242
I don't get it.

85
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,778
Me neither.

86
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,813
What can I get you?

87
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,183
Hey, I'll give you
a special deal.

88
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:49,222
If you buy three fish,
I'll throw in a clam for free.

89
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:58,398
Mind telling your brother
we need a ride back to shore?

90
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,999
Hey, colonials.

91
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,102
My brother says you need a lift.

92
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,641
Can you spare some food?

93
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,778
I wish I could help more.

94
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:31,464
Our detour into town today
has completely thrown off our schedule.

95
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:35,568
It's gonna take some serious
finagling to get us back on track.

96
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,705
Finagle away,
o schedule master.

97
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:42,442
Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need
to wake up 43 minutes earlier every day.

98
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,243
43 minutes?

99
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:48,915
Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the fire
lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse

100
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,384
which, by the way,
only lasts for eight minutes.

101
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,919
And we just lost a whole day.

102
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,855
So if we want to make up
the time and stay on schedule

103
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,390
we have to wake up early.

104
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,692
Well, I'm not waking up early.

105
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,829
Or we could just cut out
all of our eating breaks.

106
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,031
What?
No way. Forget it.

107
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,066
I got it, how's this?

108
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,969
From now on, we'll take
food breaks and potty breaks

109
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,571
at the same time.

110
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:12,722
Ew.

111
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,108
Hey, it might be gross,
but it's efficient.

112
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,045
Either way, we have to
leave here first thing tomorrow morning.

113
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,887
What's the matter, katara?

114
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,756
I think appa's sick.

115
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,392
What, appa's sick?
That's awful.

116
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:36,129
Wow, sokka, I didn't
realize you cared so much.

117
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,663
Of course I care.

118
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:42,702
I might as well just
throw our schedule away now.

119
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:47,507
And I'm concerned because my
big, furry friend doesn't feel well.

120
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,042
He must've gotten sick

121
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:50,733
from being in the
polluted water.

122
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,178
He doesn't look sick.

123
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,047
Are you ok, buddy?

124
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,650
His tongue is purple.

125
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,218
That can't be good.

126
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,687
Katara, can you heal him?

127
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,689
It looks like he needs
some medicine.

128
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,426
Maybe we can find
the right herbs in town.

129
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:13,566
Is it just me, or
does this place seem different?

130
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,502
Yeah, are the people happier?

131
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:24,477
Hey, shoe, what's
going on with everyone today?

132
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,247
Ah, something amazing happened
last night.

133
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:32,618
Food was delivered to our village
by a mysterious and wonderful person.

134
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,821
The painted lady.

135
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:35,988
The painted who now?

136
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,957
The painted lady.

137
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,293
She's part of our town's lore.

138
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:41,994
They say she's a river spirit

139
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:44,864
who watches over our town
in times of need.

140
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,033
I always thought she was
just a legend.

141
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,268
Until now.

142
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,239
See, we don't need to help these people,
they already have someone to help them.

143
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,675
All we need is medicine
for our sick friend.

144
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:56,909
Medicine?

145
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:00,346
Sorry, all the medicine we have
goes to the factory.

146
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,449
That's why there's so many
sick people in our village.

147
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,452
Looks like we need to stay
another night so appa can rest.

148
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,621
I guess you're right.

149
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,124
You got any more food to sell?

150
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:15,028
Would you like the one-headed
fish or the two-headed fish?

151
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,897
Two-headed.

152
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,533
What, you get more
for your money that way.

153
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,011
Thank you, painted lady.

154
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,887
Hi, dock, is shoe around?

155
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:19,425
Let me check...

156
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,295
Hey there, back again, are you?

157
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,730
We need more food.

158
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:27,934
Our friend is still sick and we
can't leave until he's better.

159
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,103
Oh, well, that's too bad.

160
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:31,604
Maybe if you guys are lucky

161
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,840
the painted lady will
visit you in the night

162
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:34,907
and heal your friend.

163
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,410
And maybe she'll cook us
a midnight snack

164
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,145
and we'll all have a sing-along.

165
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,414
Yeah, maybe.

166
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,750
You know, last night
she visited us again.

167
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,852
Healed most of our sick folks.

168
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,003
Is that why this place
seems so festive?

169
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,457
Yep, it's all because of
the painted lady.

170
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:55,928
Can you believe how much an entire
village can be affected by one lady?

171
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,497
I mean, spirit?

172
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,332
Well, I hope she returns
every night.

173
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,068
Otherwise this place would go
right back to the way it was.

174
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,703
Why would you say that?

175
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,672
Look how much better off
these people are.

176
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:09,208
Yeah, now, but without her, they
wouldn't be able to fend for themselves.

177
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,977
If she really wanted to help

178
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,147
she would use her spirit magic
to blow up that factory.

179
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:18,117
Ooh...

180
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,486
Spirit magic doesn't work
that way, sokka.

181
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:26,192
It's more like...
Whoo...

182
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,262
Whoo...

183
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,794
What's the matter, buddy?

184
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,964
It's her.

185
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,033
Hello, painted lady spirit.

186
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,945
Excuse me,
I don't mean to bother you

187
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:23,683
but my friend's sick and we're
on kind of a tight schedule.

188
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:28,221
Wait, but I'm the great bridge
between your world and mine.

189
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,562
I know hei bai,
we're close personal friends.

190
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,076
Hey.

191
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:04,524
My name's aang.

192
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:07,927
I'm the avatar.

193
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,296
Well, hello, avatar.

194
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,766
I wish I could talk,
but I am very busy.

195
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,268
Yeah, me too.

196
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,004
I hate that.

197
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,340
You know, you're really pretty
for a spirit.

198
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:25,211
I don't get to meet too many spirits, but
the ones I do meet... not very attractive.

199
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,680
Thank you, but...

200
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,650
You seem familiar, too.

201
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,452
A lot of people say that.

202
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:35,421
No, you really seem familiar.

203
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:39,659
Look, I really should
get going.

204
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,465
Katara?

205
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:46,666
Hi, aang.

206
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,469
You're the painted lady?
But how?

207
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,805
I wasn't at first, I was just
trying to help the village.

208
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,441
But since everyone thought
that's who I was anyway...

209
00:12:55,442 --> 00:13:00,279
I guess I just kind of
became her.

210
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,582
So you've been sneaking out
at night?

211
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,817
Wait, is appa even sick?

212
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,688
He might be sick of the purple
berries I've been feeding him

213
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,790
but other than that, he's fine.

214
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,093
I can't believe you lied to
everyone so you could help these people.

215
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,529
I'm sorry,
I know I shouldn't have.

216
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,131
No, I think it's great.

217
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,933
You're like a secret hero.

218
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,935
Well, if you want to help...

219
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:26,606
There's one more thing
I have to do.

220
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,850
You want to destroy
this factory?

221
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,887
Yes, sokka was just kidding,
but he was right.

222
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,857
Getting rid of this factory is the only
way to help these people permanently.

223
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,446
Ha-ha...

224
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,883
Shh, we don't want to
wake sokka.

225
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,785
Hi... sokka.

226
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,788
We were just out
on a morning walk.

227
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,189
Oh, really?

228
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,526
A morning walk?

229
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:58,698
I know you're the painted lady.

230
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,533
I know you've been sneaking out
at night.

231
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:05,238
And I know you've been lying about appa and
feeding him purple-izing-tongue berries.

232
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,840
Ah.

233
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:10,610
Katara, what you did put our
whole mission in jeopardy.

234
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:14,981
We're leaving right now.

235
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,316
And how long did you
know about this?

236
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:20,453
Hey, I just found out
this morning.

237
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,209
What's going on?

238
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,478
Fire nation soldiers are
heading to the village.

239
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:46,879
What did you do?

240
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,048
I kind of destroyed
their factory.

241
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,283
You what?

242
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,052
It was your idea.
I was joking.

243
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,489
I also said to use spirit magic
and made funny noises.

244
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,958
Did you even
think this through?

245
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,960
The army's gonna blame
the villagers.

246
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,029
They're headed there right now
to get revenge.

247
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,764
Well, what was I supposed to do?

248
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:07,533
Leave, do nothing.

249
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,801
No.

250
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:12,171
I will never, ever turn my back
on people who need me.

251
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,574
I'm going down to the village

252
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,810
and I am gonna do
whatever I can.

253
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:22,899
Wait.

254
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,984
I'm coming too.

255
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,353
I thought you didn't
want to help.

256
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:30,890
You need me, and I will never
turn my back on you.

257
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:35,528
Sokka, you really do have
a heart.

258
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:39,365
He really does have a heart,
doesn't he?

259
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,310
I thought we could live
as neighbors in peace

260
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:53,012
but I guess I was wrong.

261
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,782
You steal our food,
our medicine...

262
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:57,984
And then you destroy
our factory.

263
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,620
We didn't do any of that.

264
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:03,456
Yeah, the painted lady
brought us food.

265
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:06,459
She's the one that healed
our sick, not your medicine.

266
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,164
Oh, right, the mysterious
painted lady did it.

267
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:16,636
And I suppose she drew the army
emblem on your containers, too.

268
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:21,708
This is a town of thieves
and liars.

269
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:29,182
Where's your painted lady now?

270
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:32,418
We're going to cure the world
of this wretched village.

271
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,479
Look at that,
where's it coming from?

272
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,980
I don't know.

273
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,516
Something strange is going on.

274
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:07,420
It's the painted lady.

275
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,288
She's coming.

276
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,524
There is no painted lady.

277
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:34,647
What is that sound?
Maybe it is her.

278
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:53,800
Do something.

279
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:07,947
Stand your ground.

280
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,004
I'll take care of you myself.

281
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,538
Leave this village
and never come back.

282
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,336
I knew you'd come.

283
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:37,837
Thank you.

284
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:39,672
Painted lady, you're the best.

285
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:43,543
Me and my brothers
really owe you a lot.

286
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:47,580
Hey, wait a minute, I know you.

287
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,749
You're not the painted lady.

288
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,685
You're that colonial girl.

289
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:56,322
Yeah, you're the lady
that gave me a fish.

290
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,558
You've been tricking us.

291
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,860
You're a waterbender.

292
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,328
She's a waterbender.

293
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,897
How dare you act like
our painted lady?

294
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:11,137
Maybe she is a waterbender, but
she was just trying to help you.

295
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:14,140
Because of her, that factory
won't be polluting your river

296
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:15,775
and the army is gone.

297
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:18,544
You should be down on your knees
thanking her.

298
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:21,280
Sokka, it's ok.

299
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:23,750
I shouldn't have acted like
someone I wasn't

300
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:25,618
and I shouldn't have
tricked you.

301
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,154
But I felt like I had to
do something.

302
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:31,457
It doesn't matter if
the painted lady is real or not.

303
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:35,294
Because your problems are real,
and this river is real.

304
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:38,064
You can't wait around
for someone to help you.

305
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:40,299
You have to help yourself.

306
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:44,070
She's right,
but what should we do?

307
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:47,507
Maybe we can clean the river.

308
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:50,677
Yeah, we can clean the river.

309
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:55,982
Thank you.

310
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,052
You know, you're not so bad
for a waterbender.

311
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:01,988
You wouldn't mind keeping that
a secret, by the way, would you?

312
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,423
No problem.

313
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:05,874
Keeping my mouth shut is
a personal specialty.

314
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:09,495
My brother shoe, on the other
hand, ho, he's a blabbermouth.

315
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:12,865
So, dock, are you gonna
help us clean?

316
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:16,302
No, ma'am, I'm going to get
my other brother, bushi.

317
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:20,707
He loves cleaning rivers.

318
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:22,508
All right, I'm bushi.

319
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,577
Let's get some
river cleaning done.

320
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,679
Aha, I knew it.

321
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,414
I knew you were the same guy.

322
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,050
You're the shop owner
and the boat guy.

323
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:34,354
Oh, you must be talking about
my brothers, dock and shoe.

324
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:36,055
No, I just saw you.

325
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:38,324
You switched hats and called
yourself a different name.

326
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:40,760
Oh, you know who does that?

327
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,962
My brother dock.

328
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:44,831
He's crazy.

329
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,373
Thank you.
