1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,797
<i>Water, earth,</i>

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>fire, air...</i>

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

4
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:18,726
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,689
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

6
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

7
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,984
<i>he vanished.</i>

8
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:31,197
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,865
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

10
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,243
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

11
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,995
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,250
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

13
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,243
The only reason
you should be interrupting me

14
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:20,037
is if you have news about the Avatar.

15
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,248
Well, there is news, Prince Zuko,

16
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:23,874
but you might not like it.

17
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,001
Don't get too upset.

18
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,878
Uncle, you taught me that
keeping a level head

19
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,505
is a sign of a great leader.

20
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,091
Now, whatever you have to say,
I'm sure I can take it.

21
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,093
Ok, then.

22
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,262
We have no idea where he is.

23
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:37,555
What?

24
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,017
You really should open a window
in here.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,268
Give me the map!

26
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:45,771
There have been multiple sightings
of the Avatar,

27
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,649
but he is impossible to track down.

28
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,192
How am I going to find him, Uncle?

29
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,321
He is clearly a master
of evasive maneuvering.

30
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:57,533
You have no idea
where you're going, do you?

31
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,410
Well, I know it's near water.

32
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:02,496
I guess
we're getting close, then.

33
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:06,626
Momo, marbles, please.

34
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,214
Hey, Katara, check out
this airbending trick.

35
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,927
That's great, Aang.

36
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,555
You didn't even look.

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,848
That's great.

38
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,224
But I'm not doing it now.

39
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,768
Stop bugging her, airhead.

40
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:26,020
You need to give girls space
when they do their sewing.

41
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:29,565
What does me being a girl
have to do with sewing?

42
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,816
Simple.

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,419
Girls are better
at fixing pants than guys,

44
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,755
and guys are better at hunting
and fighting and stuff like that.

45
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,405
It's just the natural order of things.

46
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,698
All done with your pants,

47
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,909
and look what a great job I did.

48
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,746
Wait! I was just kidding!

49
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,082
I can't wear these! Katara, please!

50
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,416
Relax, Sokka.

51
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,585
Where we're going,
you won't need any pants.

52
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,259
We just made
a pit stop yesterday.

53
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,783
Shouldn't we get a little more flying
done before we camp out?

54
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,597
He's right. At this rate,

55
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,516
we won't get to the North Pole
until spring.

56
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,017
But Appa's tired already,

57
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,560
aren't you, boy?

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,606
I said, "Aren't you, boy?"

59
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,985
Yeah, that was real convincing.

60
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,905
Still, hard to argue
with a 10-ton magical monster.

61
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:19,323
Look!

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,746
That's why we're here... Elephant koi,

63
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,123
and I'm going to ride it.

64
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,958
Katara, you've got to watch me.

65
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,505
Cold!

66
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,478
Woo!

67
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,480
Yeah!

68
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,944
Woo-hoo!

69
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:00,489
He looks pretty good out there.

70
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,075
Are you kidding?
The fish is doing all the work.

71
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,077
No, Appa!

72
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,370
Don't eat that!

73
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:13,502
Aw, man.

74
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,258
There's something in the water!

75
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:25,347
What's wrong?

76
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,474
Aang's in trouble.

77
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,267
- Aang!
- Get out of there!

78
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,812
- Get back here, Aang!
- Come in!

79
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,738
Aah!

80
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,420
What was that thing?

81
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,630
I don't know.

82
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,381
Well, let's not stick around
to find out.

83
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,925
Time to hit the road.

84
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,605
Or we could stay a while.

85
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:22,196
You three have some
explaining to do.

86
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,406
And if you don't answer
all our questions,

87
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,784
we're throwing you back
in the water with the unagi.

88
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,828
Show yourselves, cowards!

89
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:34,250
Who are you?
Where are the men who ambushed us?

90
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,544
There were no men. We ambushed you.

91
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,255
Now tell us, who are you
and what are you doing here?

92
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,422
Wait a second.

93
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,591
There's no way a bunch of girls
took us down.

94
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,552
A bunch of girls, huh?

95
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,054
The unagi's going to eat well tonight.

96
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,098
No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it!

97
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:51,308
My brother's just an idiot sometimes.

98
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,769
It's my fault.

99
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,020
I'm sorry we came here.

100
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,564
I wanted to ride the elephant koi.

101
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,067
How do we know
you're not Fire Nation spies?

102
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,486
Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far

103
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,613
and we intend to keep it that way.

104
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,032
This island is named for Kyoshi?

105
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,242
I know Kyoshi.

106
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,493
Ha!

107
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,245
How could you possibly know her?

108
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:15,708
Avatar Kyoshi was born here
400 years ago.

109
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,793
She's been dead for centuries.

110
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,672
I know her because I'm the Avatar.

111
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:23,048
That's impossible.

112
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,552
The last Avatar was an airbender
who disappeared 100 years ago.

113
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:27,636
That's me.

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,972
Throw the impostor to the unagi.

115
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,853
Aang, do some airbending.

116
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,816
- Wow.
- That's amazing.

117
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,111
It's true.

118
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:46,155
You are the Avatar.

119
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,490
Now, check this out.

120
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,959
Did you hear the news?

121
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,669
The Avatar's on Kyoshi.

122
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,046
Huh?

123
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:12,264
The Avatar's on Kyoshi island?

124
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,850
Uncle, ready the rhinos.

125
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,894
He's not getting away from me
this time.

126
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:18,979
Are you going to finish that?

127
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,981
I was going to save it for later!

128
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,126
All right!

129
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,503
Dessert for breakfast!

130
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:46,298
These people sure know
how to treat an Avatar.

131
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,425
Mm! Katara, you've got to try these.

132
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,135
Well, maybe just a bite.

133
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,264
Sokka, what's your problem?

134
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,391
Eat!

135
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,475
I'm not hungry.

136
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,310
But you're always hungry.

137
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,771
He's just upset
because a bunch of girls

138
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:02,314
kicked his butt yesterday.

139
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,565
They snuck up on me!

140
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,859
Right, and then they kicked your butt.

141
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:08,195
Sneak attacks don't count.

142
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:09,863
Tie me up with ropes...

143
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,991
I'll show them a thing or two.

144
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,784
I'm not scared of any girls.

145
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,911
Who do they think they are, anyway?

146
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,871
Mm! This is tasty.

147
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,457
What's he so angry about?

148
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,583
It's great here.

149
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,187
They're giving us the royal treatment.

150
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,087
Hey, don't get too comfortable.

151
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,756
It's risky for us to stay
in one place for very long.

152
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,299
I'm sure we'll be fine.

153
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,011
Besides, did you see how happy
I'm making this town?

154
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,138
They're even cleaning up
that statue in my honor.

155
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:37,641
Well, it's nice to see you excited
about being the Avatar.

156
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,435
I just hope it doesn't
all go to your head.

157
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:41,520
Come on, you know me better than that.

158
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:43,397
I'm just a simple monk.

159
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,734
There he is!

160
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,944
There he is! Oh!

161
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,925
Hmm, painting the Avatar.

162
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,594
That's easy enough.

163
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:15,554
Oh, there's another one.

164
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,681
Well, I'll make an adjustment
here and...

165
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,767
There's more.

166
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,143
I...

167
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,290
Ooh! Heh heh!

168
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,544
I can't believe I got beat up
by a bunch of girls.

169
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,633
Sorry, ladies.

170
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,676
Didn't mean to interrupt
your dance lesson.

171
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,054
I was just looking for somewhere
to get a little workout.

172
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:59,556
Well, you're in the right place.

173
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:01,517
Sorry about yesterday.

174
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,894
I didn't know
you were friends with the Avatar.

175
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:05,020
It's all right.

176
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,504
I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge,

177
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:09,274
but seeing as you guys are a bunch
of girls, I'll make an exception.

178
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,984
I should hope so.

179
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,654
A big, strong man like you,

180
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:15,197
we wouldn't stand a chance.

181
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,865
True, but don't feel bad.

182
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,076
After all, I'm the best warrior
in my village.

183
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,537
Wow. Best warrior, huh?

184
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,038
In your whole village?

185
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,999
Maybe you'd be kind enough
to give us a little demonstration.

186
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,961
Oh, well, I mean, I...

187
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,337
Come on, girls,

188
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,140
wouldn't you like him
to show us some moves?

189
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,008
Well, if that's what you want,

190
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,426
I'd be happy to.

191
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,054
All right, you stand over there.

192
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,682
Now, this may be a little tough,

193
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,475
but try to block me.

194
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:45,018
Ow!

195
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,021
Good.

196
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,606
Of course, I was going easy on you.

197
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,732
Of course.

198
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,568
Let's see if you can handle this!

199
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,652
Ouch!

200
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:54,778
Oh!

201
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,738
That does it!

202
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:11,253
Anything else you want to teach us?

203
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,511
There she is, girls,
me in a past life.

204
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,641
You were pretty.

205
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,685
Excuse me for a second, ladies.

206
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,190
Oh, good.

207
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,834
Can you help me carry this
back to the room?

208
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,067
It's a little heavy.

209
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,444
Actually, I can't right now.

210
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:36,588
What do you mean, you can't?

211
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,031
I promised the girls
I'd give them a ride on Appa.

212
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,175
Why don't you come with us?

213
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,200
It'll be fun.

214
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,368
Watching you show off
for a bunch of girls

215
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,578
does not sound like fun.

216
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:47,372
Well, neither does
carrying your basket.

217
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,957
It's not my basket.

218
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,834
These supplies are for our trip.

219
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,794
I told you,
we have to leave Kyoshi soon.

220
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,838
I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet.

221
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,465
I can't put my finger on it,

222
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,884
but there's something
I really like about this place.

223
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,597
What's taking you so long, Aangie?

224
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,681
Aangie?

225
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,225
Just a second, Koko.

226
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,893
Simple monk, huh?

227
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,937
I thought you promised
me this Avatar stuff

228
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,021
wouldn't go to your head.

229
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,190
It didn't. You know what I think?

230
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:15,734
You just don't want to come
because you're jealous.

231
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,527
Jealous? Of what?

232
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,863
Jealous that we're having
so much fun without you.

233
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,156
That's ridiculous.

234
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,574
It is a little ridiculous,

235
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,659
but I understand.

236
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,620
Ugh!

237
00:12:36,004 --> 00:12:37,756
Uh, hey, Suki.

238
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,384
Hoping for another dance lesson?

239
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,635
No, I...

240
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:42,844
Well, let me explain.

241
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,347
Spit it out. What do you want?

242
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,894
I would be honored
if you would teach me.

243
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,521
Even if I'm a girl?

244
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,648
I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier.

245
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:55,774
I was wrong.

246
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:58,026
We normally don't teach outsiders,

247
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,903
let alone boys.

248
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,363
Please make an exception.

249
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:02,489
I won't let you down.

250
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:06,243
All right, but you have to follow
all of our traditions.

251
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,369
Of course.

252
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,621
And I mean all of them.

253
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,624
Do I really have to wear this?

254
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,793
It feels a little... Girly.

255
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:16,503
It's a warrior's uniform.

256
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:17,713
You should be proud.

257
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,506
The silk thread symbolizes

258
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,883
the brave blood
that flows through our veins.

259
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,635
The gold insignia represents

260
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,304
the honor of the warrior's heart.

261
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,640
Bravery and honor.

262
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,933
Hey, Sokka.

263
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,143
Nice dress.

264
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:45,157
Katara, remember how
the unagi almost got me yesterday?

265
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,283
Yeah.

266
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,201
Well, I'm going to go ride it now.

267
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,911
It's going to be real dangerous.

268
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,163
Good for you.

269
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:52,348
You're not going to stop me?

270
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:53,665
Nope. Have fun.

271
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,000
I will. Great.

272
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,126
I know it's great.

273
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:57,252
Well, I'm glad you know.

274
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,479
- I'm glad you're glad.
- Good!

275
00:13:58,503 --> 00:13:59,504
Fine!

276
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,764
You're not going to master it
in one day.

277
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,223
Even I'm not that good.

278
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,975
I think I'm starting to get it.

279
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,236
It's not about strength.

280
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,491
Our technique is about using
your opponent's force against them.

281
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:28,825
Loosen up.

282
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,953
Think of the fan as an extension
of your arm.

283
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,747
Wait for an opening and then...

284
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,418
Hmm.

285
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:41,296
I fell on purpose
to make you feel better.

286
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,381
I got you!

287
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,465
Admit I got you!

288
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,594
Ok, it was a lucky shot.

289
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,763
Let's see if you can do it again.

290
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,230
What's taking so long?

291
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,690
I'm sure it will be here any second.

292
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:04,986
Um, what about this?

293
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,530
Not that again.

294
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:07,697
Boring.

295
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,199
Where's unagi?

296
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,450
It's getting late.

297
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,035
Where are you going?

298
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,120
Don't leave!

299
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,663
Sorry, Aang!

300
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:15,914
Maybe next time!

301
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:22,546
Katara, you showed up!

302
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,923
I wanted to make sure you were safe.

303
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:26,258
You really had me worried.

304
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,427
Back there you acted like
you didn't care.

305
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,011
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,346
Me, too.

307
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,598
I did let all that attention
go to my head.

308
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,183
I was being a jerk.

309
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,518
Well, get out of the water

310
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,437
before you catch a cold, you big jerk!

311
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:40,772
On my way!

312
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,154
Hang on, Aang!

313
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,405
Aah!

314
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:40,832
Aang!

315
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,111
Zuko!

316
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,086
I want the Avatar alive.

317
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,937
Wake up, Aang.

318
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,029
Katara.

319
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,908
Don't ride the unagi.

320
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,410
Not fun.

321
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,334
Not bad.

322
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:10,046
Fire bandits have landed
on our shores.

323
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,840
Girls, come quickly!

324
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,717
Hey, I'm not a...

325
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,468
Oh, whatever.

326
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,101
Come out, Avatar.

327
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:24,603
You can't hide from me forever.

328
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,359
Find him.

329
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,357
I guess training's over.

330
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:23,995
Nice try, Avatar,

331
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,414
but these little girls can't save you.

332
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,541
Hey, over here!

333
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:31,544
Finally.

334
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,669
Get inside.

335
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,466
Look what I brought to this place.

336
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,676
It's not your fault.

337
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,052
Yes, it is.

338
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,888
These people got their town destroyed
trying to protect me.

339
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,265
Then let's get out of here.

340
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,308
Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us.

341
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,810
I know it feels wrong to run,

342
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:30,228
but I think it's the only way.

343
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,897
I'll call Appa.

344
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,406
There's no time to say good-bye.

345
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:42,782
What about "I'm sorry"?

346
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,867
For what?

347
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,160
I treated you like a girl

348
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,043
when I should have
treated you like a warrior.

349
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,663
I am a warrior...

350
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:52,292
But I'm a girl, too.

351
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:55,503
Now get out of here.

352
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,921
We'll hold them off.

353
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,385
Appa, yip yip!

354
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,473
Back to the ship!

355
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,183
Don't lose sight of them!

356
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,397
I know it's hard,
but you did the right thing.

357
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,192
Zuko would've destroyed
the whole place if we stayed.

358
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,735
They're going to be ok, Aang.

359
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,656
What are you doing?

360
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,111
Thank you, Avatar.

361
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,323
I know, I know,

362
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:07,033
that was stupid and dangerous.

363
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,160
Yes, it was.
