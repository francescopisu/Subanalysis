1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,628
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,297
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,382
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,301
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:19,227
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:22,563
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,731
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.</i>

10
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:28,444
<i>100 years passed,</i>

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,239
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar,</i>

12
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,823
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

13
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:35,201
<i>And although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

14
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:38,454
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone,</i>

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,083
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

16
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,348
Look!

17
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,648
He is taunting us.

18
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,192
You are so going to be dinner.

19
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,697
Hey, where's the fishing line?

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,283
Oh, I didn't think
you would need it, Sokka.

21
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,827
Ah, it's all tangled.

22
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,413
Not tangled, woven.

23
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:22,164
I made you a necklace, Katara.

24
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,875
I thought since you lost
your other one...

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,171
Thanks, Aang.

26
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,256
I love it.

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,674
Great, Aang.

28
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,259
Maybe instead of saving the world,

29
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:35,062
you can go
into the jewelry-making business.

30
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:37,096
I don't see why I can't do both.

31
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:40,683
Huh!

32
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,059
Stop taunting me!

33
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,855
Uhh!

34
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,356
So, how do I look?

35
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,281
You mean, all of you
or just your neck...

36
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:57,199
I mean, because they both look great.

37
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,909
Smoochie smoochie.

38
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:01,454
Someone's in love.

39
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,748
I, well...

40
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,625
Stop teasing him, Sokka.

41
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,460
Aang's just a good friend,

42
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:10,338
a sweet little guy, just like Momo.

43
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,631
Thanks.

44
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,388
Someone's being attacked
by a platypus bear!

45
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,069
Well, hello there.

46
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,363
Nice day, isn't it?

47
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:36,989
Make noise! He'll run off!

48
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,949
No, play dead! He'll lose interest!

49
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:42,328
Whoa, close one. Ha ha ha.

50
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,747
Run downhill, then climb a tree!

51
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,332
No, punch him in the bill!

52
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:47,875
And then run in zig-zags.

53
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,710
No need.

54
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,087
It's going to be fine.

55
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,512
Whoa, there.

56
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,190
Mmm, lunch.

57
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,276
Lucky for you we came along.

58
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,947
Thanks, but everything
was already under control.

59
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,782
Not to worry.

60
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:22,785
Aunt Wu predicted
I'd have a safe journey.

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,161
Aunt who?

62
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,830
No, Aunt Wu.

63
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,541
She's the fortune-teller
from my village.

64
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,293
Awful nice knowing your future.

65
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,295
Wow, it must be.

66
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:35,339
That explains why you were so calm.

67
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:37,717
But the fortune-teller was wrong.

68
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,082
You didn't have a safe journey.

69
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,177
You were almost killed.

70
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,012
But I wasn't.

71
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,889
All right, have a good one.

72
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:50,396
Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met
any travelers, to give them this.

73
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,027
Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu
and learn our fortunes.

74
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,404
It could be fun.

75
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:01,365
Oh, come on.
Fortune-telling is nonsense.

76
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,451
What do you know?

77
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,535
An umbrella.

78
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:07,955
That proves it.

79
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,206
No, it doesn't.

80
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:11,709
You can't really tell the future.

81
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:14,211
I guess you're not
really getting wet, then.

82
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,506
Whoa... Aah!

83
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:18,924
Of course she predicted

84
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,009
it was gonna rain.

85
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:21,427
The sky has been grey all day.

86
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,262
Just admit you might be wrong,

87
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:24,785
and you can come under the umbrella.

88
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,558
Look, I'm gonna
predict the future now.

89
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:30,478
It's going to keep drizzling.

90
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,230
See?

91
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,734
Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.

92
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:41,363
Aah!

93
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,256
Aunt Wu is expecting you.

94
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,925
Really?

95
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,092
Pfft.

96
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,059
My name is Meng,
and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.

97
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,774
Well, hello there.

98
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,235
Hello.

99
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,653
Can I get you some tea

100
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:23,155
or some of Aunt Wu's
special bean curd puffs?

101
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,615
I'll try a curd puff.

102
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:25,699
Just a second.

103
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,117
So, what's your name?

104
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,202
Aang.

105
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,579
That rhymes with Meng,

106
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,457
and you've got some pretty big ears,
don't you?

107
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,918
I guess.

108
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,545
Don't be modest.

109
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,629
They're huge.

110
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,423
Well, Aang, it's very nice
to meet you...

111
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,050
Very nice.

112
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,426
Likewise.

113
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,637
I can't believe we're here

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,930
in the house of nonsense.

115
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,558
Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.

116
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,841
There are things in this world

117
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,310
that just can't be explained.

118
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,980
Wouldn't it be nice to have
some insight into your future?

119
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:58,482
It would be nice
to have some bean curd puffs.

120
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,027
Oh, Meng!

121
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,905
Aunt Wu says
I'm going to meet my true love!

122
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:08,158
He's going to give me
a rare panda lily.

123
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,870
That's so romantic.

124
00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:14,957
I wonder if my true love
will give me a rare flower.

125
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,333
Good luck with that.

126
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,880
Is that the big-eared guy
who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?

127
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,843
Aah!

128
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,806
Enjoy your snack.

129
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,436
Welcome, young travelers.

130
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,645
Now, who's next?

131
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,898
Don't be shy.

132
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,652
I guess that's me.

133
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,864
Not bad, not bad.

134
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,866
Mmm! Mmm!

135
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,367
Hmm?

136
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,119
I'm good on puffs.

137
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:53,454
Hmm.

138
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:57,708
So, what do you think
they're talking about back there?

139
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,251
Boring stuff, I'm sure.

140
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,920
Love, who she's gonna marry,

141
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,713
how many babies she's gonna have.

142
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:05,215
Yeah, dumb stuff like that.

143
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,384
Well, I gotta find a bathroom.

144
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:14,475
Your palms are so smooth.

145
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:16,894
Do you use moisturizer?

146
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:19,772
Actually,
I have this special seaweed lotion.

147
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,191
I could get you some if you want.

148
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:25,527
So, do you see anything
interesting in my love line?

149
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,197
I see a great romance for you...

150
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,282
The man you're going to marry.

151
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,700
Tell me more!

152
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,829
I can see
that he's a very powerful bender.

153
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:46,006
Looks like someone
had a pretty good bathroom break.

154
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,467
Yeah, when I was in there...

155
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,718
I don't even want to know.

156
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,970
Who's next?

157
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,097
Ok, let's get this over with.

158
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,684
Your future is full
of struggle and anguish,

159
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,645
most of it self-inflicted.

160
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,022
But you didn't read
my palms or anything.

161
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,732
I don't need to.

162
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,526
It's written all over your face.

163
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,031
You there, come with me.

164
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,453
This is the most reliable method
of telling your fortune.

165
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,497
The bones never lie.

166
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,749
Go on. Pick one.

167
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,628
Now throw it on the fire.

168
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:28,007
The heat makes cracks in the bones,

169
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,677
and I read the bone cracks
to tell your destiny.

170
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,055
Wow, that's a big crack.

171
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:38,267
I've never seen this before.

172
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,147
Oh, my!

173
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,698
Your destiny... This is incredible.

174
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:56,493
You will be involved
in a great battle...

175
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:00,372
An awesome conflict
between the forces of good and evil.

176
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:05,044
A battle whose outcome will determine
the fate of the whole world.

177
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,129
Yeah, yeah. I knew that already,

178
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,797
But did it say anything about a girl?

179
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,215
A girl?

180
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,967
You want to know about love?

181
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,177
Yes!

182
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,596
I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything.

183
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:19,558
Oh, look!

184
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,351
I must have missed something.

185
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,103
Right here.

186
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:28,317
It says, "trust your heart, and you
will be with the one you love."

187
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,818
Really?

188
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,070
Thank you, Aunt Wu!

189
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,759
Well, now you got to see
for yourselves

190
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,202
that fortune-telling
is just a big, stupid hoax.

191
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,661
You're just saying that

192
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,890
because you're gonna make yourself
unhappy your whole life.

193
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,540
That woman is crazy!

194
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:47,586
My life will be calm and happy
and joyful!

195
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:49,630
Ow!

196
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,299
That doesn't prove anything.

197
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:54,259
Well, I liked my predictions.

198
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:57,137
Certain things
are gonna turn out very well.

199
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:58,931
They sure are.

200
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:00,099
Why?

201
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,183
What did she tell you?

202
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,643
Some stuff.

203
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:03,727
You'll find out.

204
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:10,442
What's with the sky?

205
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,487
We're waiting for Aunt Wu
to come and read the clouds

206
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,489
to predict the fate
of the whole village.

207
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:17,741
That cloud kind of looks
like a fluffy bunny.

208
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,327
You better hope that's not a bunny.

209
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,455
The fluffy bunny cloud
forecasts doom and destruction.

210
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,457
Do you even hear yourself?

211
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,960
The cloud reading
will tell us if Mount Makapu

212
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,129
will remain dormant for another year

213
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,213
or if it will erupt.

214
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:33,841
We used to have
a tradition once a year

215
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,092
of going up the mountain

216
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:36,844
to check the volcano ourselves,

217
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,887
But ever since Aunt Wu

218
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,973
moved to the village 20 years ago,

219
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:44,184
we have a tradition of not doing that.

220
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,520
I can't believe
you would trust your lives

221
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:48,689
to that crazy
old woman's superstition!

222
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,816
Shh! She's coming.

223
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:56,321
Hey, Aang,

224
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,575
don't you think that cloud
looks like a flower, huh?

225
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,161
Sure, I guess.

226
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,414
Hey, Katara, don't you think
that cloud looks like a flower?

227
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:06,540
Shh!

228
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,424
Bending arrow cloud...

229
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:19,052
Good crops this year.
Nice, big harvest.

230
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,430
Darn good news!

231
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,434
Wavy moon-shaped cloud... Let's see.

232
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,896
Gonna be a great year for twins.

233
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:30,314
- Yes!
- Yes!

234
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:35,152
And a cumulus cloud with a twisty
nub coming off the end of it...

235
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:40,240
The village will not be destroyed
by the volcano this year!

236
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,952
Since I got you here,

237
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,121
there's something I want to tell you.

238
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,457
I like you, but more than normal.

239
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:51,835
Never mind.

240
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,843
Hi, Aunt Wu.

241
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,053
Sorry to bother you.

242
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,262
Anytime.

243
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,306
About this man I'm supposed to marry...

244
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:05,599
Is he gonna be handsome?

245
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:06,892
Oh, I hope he's tall.

246
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:10,395
Ah. You want another reading.

247
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,605
Yes, please.

248
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:16,526
I can't believe all these saps.

249
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,196
Someone really needs
to scream some sense at them.

250
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,240
They seem happy, Sokka.

251
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,658
Not for long.

252
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,160
I'm gonna prove
Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.

253
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,120
Hey, you,

254
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,915
I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear
those red shoes, didn't she?

255
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:32,292
Yeah, she said
I'd be wearing red shoes

256
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,627
when I met my true love.

257
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,003
Uh-huh.

258
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,648
And how many times
have you worn those shoes

259
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,923
since you got that fortune?

260
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,258
Every day.

261
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,511
Then of course it's gonna come true!

262
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,721
Really? You think so?

263
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,556
I'm so excited!

264
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,100
Uhh!

265
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:52,187
Aah! Uhh!

266
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,565
And then you'll have
your third great grandchild

267
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,694
before quietly
passing away in your sleep.

268
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,404
Is that enough information for you?

269
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:03,490
Wow. Thanks, Aunt Wu.

270
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,409
Oh, wait. One more thing.

271
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:08,078
How warmly should I dress tomorrow?

272
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,414
You want me to do a reading for that?

273
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,376
I don't care what Aunt Wu told you!

274
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,795
You have to take a bath sometime!

275
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:23,844
So, Sokka, you know some stuff
about ladies, right?

276
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:25,095
Some stuff?

277
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:26,888
You've come to the right place.

278
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,390
What can I do you for?

279
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,267
Well, there's this girl...

280
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,313
I think I know who you mean.

281
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:36,481
You do? And you're ok with it?

282
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,899
Of course I am.

283
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,276
And to tell you the truth,

284
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,462
I've been picking up
a subtle vibe that she likes you, too.

285
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:42,487
She does?

286
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,781
Oh, yeah. She's crazy about you.

287
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,034
All you have to do now
is not mess it up.

288
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,952
Well, how do I do that?

289
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,204
The number one mistake
nice guys like you make...

290
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,748
Being too nice.

291
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,791
You can be too nice?

292
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,169
Yep. If you want to
keep her interested,

293
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,712
you have to act aloof,

294
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,967
Like you don't really care
one way or the other.

295
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:03,342
Well, ok.

296
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,844
Hey, Aang. I was wondering...

297
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:07,220
See you later.

298
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,889
Hmm.

299
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,558
Wow. That kid is good.

300
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,728
And you'll be fine
as long as you've got a scarf.

301
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,188
Bye-bye, now.

302
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,899
Ok, ok. But one more thing.

303
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,234
All right. What is it?

304
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:24,821
Should I eat a mango or a papaya

305
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,073
for breakfast tomorrow?

306
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,574
Papaya.

307
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:30,243
Oh, I hate papaya.

308
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,329
Oh. Hey, Katara.

309
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:33,497
I didn't see you there.

310
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,207
Hey, Aang.

311
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,708
That's ok.

312
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,210
I'm busy with my own stuff.

313
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,637
Ugh. Papaya, please.

314
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:51,807
So, papaya.

315
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,017
Uh-huh. Would you like some?

316
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,352
You know me.

317
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:57,104
I don't really care what I eat.

318
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:58,730
Ok, then.

319
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,856
See you later.

320
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:01,608
Ugh!

321
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,819
Maybe aloof isn't my style.

322
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:06,655
Oh, a panda lily.

323
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,241
Did you see that?

324
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,787
Excuse me. Where can a guy
find one of those things?

325
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,517
I can't believe you're
dragging me all the way up here.

326
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,042
For a stupid flower.

327
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,045
Not just any flower... A panda lily.

328
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,631
I've seen it in action,
and, boy, does it work.

329
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,592
Flowers are fine once you're married,

330
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,219
but at this early stage,

331
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:32,347
it's critical that you maintain
maximum aloofness.

332
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,273
But my heart
is telling me to get this flower,

333
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,352
And Aunt Wu said
if I trusted my heart,

334
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,979
I would be with the one I love.

335
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:42,732
What? Don't tell me
you believe in that stuff, too.

336
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:46,027
Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.

337
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,654
Why should she be wrong about love?

338
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,533
There, on the rim!

339
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,665
Oh, no.

340
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,417
Aunt Wu was wrong.

341
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:13,781
Those people all think they're safe.

342
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,265
We've got to warn them.

343
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,808
There's no time to walk.

344
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:18,059
Grab on.

345
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,269
Aah!

346
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:29,821
Hi, Katara.

347
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,907
Can you believe she won't let me in?

348
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,797
And after all the business
I've given her?

349
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,076
But she doesn't even charge.

350
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,703
I know, but still.

351
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,206
Well, we have other things
to worry about.

352
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,249
Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.

353
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,169
Sokka, you tried to convince me
she was wrong before.

354
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:45,771
It's gonna take an awful lot
to change my...

355
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,049
Oh, no.

356
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,136
Everyone, that volcano
is gonna blow any second!

357
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,430
Aunt Wu was wrong!

358
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,475
Yeah, yeah. We know
you don't believe in Aunt Wu,

359
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:00,185
Mr. Science and Reason lover.

360
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,480
If you won't listen to him,
maybe you'll listen to me.

361
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:06,441
I want to believe Aunt Wu and her
predictions as much as you do,

362
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,735
but my brother and Aang saw the lava

363
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:10,070
with their own eyes.

364
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:14,824
Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction
with my own ears.

365
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,285
Please listen to us!

366
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,995
You are all in danger,

367
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,039
and we have to get out of here!

368
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:23,166
You can't rely
on Aunt Wu's predictions!

369
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,086
You have to take fate
into your own hands!

370
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,921
Look!

371
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,923
Can your fortune-telling explain that?

372
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,554
Heh. Can your science
explain why it rains?

373
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,223
Yes! Yes, it can!

374
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,729
They just won't listen to reason.

375
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,232
But they will listen to Aunt Wu.

376
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,109
I know. That's the problem.

377
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:51,695
Well, it's about to become
the solution.

378
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:53,822
We're taking fate in our own hands.

379
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,616
First, I need to borrow
Aunt Wu's cloud-reading book.

380
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,752
Shh.

381
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,171
We don't want anyone to hear us.

382
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,758
Oh! Oh, I didn't see you there.

383
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,760
You don't like me, do you?

384
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:17,512
Of course I like you.

385
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:19,639
But not the way I like you.

386
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,851
Oh. I guess not.

387
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,811
It's ok.

388
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:27,564
It's just really hard
when you like someone,

389
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:30,191
but they don't think of you that way.

390
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,027
I know what you mean.

391
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:33,695
She's beautiful, by the way.

392
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:34,821
Huh?

393
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:36,615
That water tribe girl.

394
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,617
I can see why you like her so much.

395
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:41,286
She's sweet, she's a bender,

396
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:45,290
and her hair seems so manageable.

397
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,667
Don't worry.

398
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,085
You're gonna meet a great guy

399
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,563
who's gonna completely fall for you.

400
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,588
I know it.

401
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:52,839
Thanks.

402
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,591
Wait.

403
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,925
Don't you want this?

404
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:58,178
How did you know?

405
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,764
I've kind of been stalking you. Heh.

406
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,891
Oh, thanks...

407
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:04,726
I guess.

408
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,147
Clouds are made
of water and air,

409
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:10,940
So between the two of us,

410
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,526
we ought to be able to bend them
into any shape we want.

411
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,988
I found it...
The symbol for volcanic doom.

412
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,934
Aunt Wu, look!

413
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,311
Something's happening in the clouds!

414
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:49,896
That's very strange.

415
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:52,732
It shouldn't... Oh, my!

416
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,410
We could still save the village
if we act fast.

417
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,161
Sokka has a plan.

418
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,622
Lava is gonna flow
downhill to this spot.

419
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,165
If we can dig a deep enough trench,

420
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,169
we can channel all the lava
away from the village

421
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,252
to the river.

422
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,671
If any of you are earth benders,
come with me.

423
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,089
I'm an earth bender!

424
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:17,173
I'm not!

425
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,008
Everybody else, grab a shovel.

426
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:21,636
Come on! We've got to hurry.

427
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:42,949
Dig faster! Dig faster!

428
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:49,622
Everyone needs to evacuate!

429
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,066
We'll come for you when it's safe!

430
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,362
It's too much.

431
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,530
It's gonna overflow!

432
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,615
Aah!

433
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,629
Uhh!

434
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:38,922
Aah!

435
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,649
Man...

436
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:00,902
Sometimes I forget
what a powerful bender that kid is.

437
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:02,946
Wait, what did you just say?

438
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,281
Nothing. Just that Aang
is one powerful bender.

439
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,080
I suppose he is.

440
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,296
By the way,
we kind of borrowed your book.

441
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,091
So you messed with the clouds,
did you?

442
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,178
Ha ha ha! Very clever.

443
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:29,889
No offense, but I hope this
has taught everyone a lesson

444
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,517
about not relying too much
on fortune-telling.

445
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:35,395
But Aunt Wu predicted
the village wouldn't be destroyed,

446
00:22:35,478 --> 00:22:36,563
and it wasn't.

447
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,523
She was right, after all.

448
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:40,316
I hate you.

449
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,901
It's ok, Sokka.

450
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,862
Everything's gonna be all right.

451
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,321
Can I ask you something?

452
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,198
Of course, honey.

453
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,659
You didn't really see love
in my fortune, did you?

454
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:51,703
You just told me
what I wanted to hear.

455
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,372
I'll tell you a little secret,
young airbender.

456
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:57,375
Just as you reshaped those clouds,

457
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,962
you have the power
to shape your own destiny.

458
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,298
Good-bye, everyone!

459
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,133
It was so nice to meet you!

460
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:06,968
Take care, Meng.

461
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:08,219
Take care!

462
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:13,892
Floozy.
