1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:03,628
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:05,963
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:07,882
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:10,051
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,430
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,643
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,770
<i>Only the Avatar,</i>

8
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:22,313
<i>master of all four elements,</i>

9
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:23,564
<i>could stop them.</i>

10
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,399
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

11
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,734
<i>he vanished.</i>

12
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,361
<i>A hundred years passed,</i>

13
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:30,863
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar,</i>

14
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,949
<i>an airbender named Aang,</i>

15
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>and although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,329
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

17
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

18
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:05,439
Wait till you see it, Katara.

19
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,251
The air temple
is one of the most beautiful places

20
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,401
in the world.

21
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,278
Aang, I know you're excited,

22
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,571
but it's been a hundred years

23
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,989
since you've been home.

24
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,532
That's why I'm so excited!

25
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:17,451
It's just that a lot can change
in all that time.

26
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,536
I know,

27
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,037
but I need to see it for myself.

28
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,876
Wake up, Sokka.

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,670
Air temple, here we come!

30
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:31,132
Sleep now. Temple later.

31
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,640
Sokka, wake up!

32
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,642
There's a prickle snake
in your sleeping bag!

33
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,477
Aah!

34
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,895
Get it off! Get it off!

35
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,980
Aah!

36
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,273
Heh heh heh!

37
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,608
Great. You're awake.

38
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,692
Let's go.

39
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:56,157
Uncle, I want the repairs made

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,283
as quickly as possible.

41
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,701
I don't want to stay too long

42
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,994
and risk losing his trail.

43
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:01,287
You mean the Avatar?

44
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,890
Don't mention his name on these docks.

45
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,582
Once word gets out that he's alive,

46
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,709
every firebender
will be out looking for him,

47
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,628
and I don't want anyone
getting in the way.

48
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,671
Getting in the way of what,

49
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,922
Prince Zuko.

50
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,466
Captain Zhao.

51
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:14,884
It's commander now.

52
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,344
And General Iroh,

53
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,471
great hero of our nation.

54
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,222
Retired general.

55
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,932
The Fire Lord's brother and son

56
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,893
are welcome guests anytime.

57
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:25,686
What brings you to my harbor?

58
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,563
Our ship is being repaired.

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,150
That's quite a bit of damage.

60
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:34,028
Yes. You wouldn't believe
what happened.

61
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,822
Uncle, tell Commander Zhao
what happened.

62
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,574
Yes, I will do that.

63
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,910
It was incredible.

64
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,912
What, did we crash or something?

65
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:46,499
Yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship.

66
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,000
Really?

67
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,212
You must regale me
with all the thrilling details.

68
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,589
Join me for a drink?

69
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,299
Sorry, but we have to go.

70
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,759
Prince Zuko,

71
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,178
show Commander Zhao your respect.

72
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,931
We would be honored to join you.

73
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,518
Do you have any ginseng tea?
It's my favorite.

74
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:16,028
Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right?

75
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,863
I'm trying to find us some food.

76
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,331
Hey! Who ate all
my blubbered seal jerky?

77
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,500
Oh. That was food?

78
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,669
I used it to start
the campfire last night.

79
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:32,878
Sorry.

80
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,505
You what?

81
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:35,798
Aww.

82
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,925
No wonder the flames smelled so good.

83
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:41,822
The Potola mountain range!

84
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,347
We're almost there!

85
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,349
Aang, before we get to the temple,

86
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,560
I want to talk to you
about the airbenders.

87
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:48,769
What about them?

88
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,937
Well...

89
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,397
I just want you to be prepared

90
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,940
for what you might see.

91
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,276
The Fire Nation is ruthless.

92
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,361
They killed my mother,

93
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,630
and they could have done the same

94
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:00,072
to your people.

95
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,324
Just because no one
has seen an airbender

96
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,168
doesn't mean the Fire Nation
killed them all.

97
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,536
They probably escaped.

98
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:07,413
I know it's hard to accept.

99
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,123
You don't understand, Katara.

100
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:10,642
The only way to get to
an airbender temple

101
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,168
is on a flying bison,

102
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,336
and I doubt the Fire Nation
has any flying bison.

103
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,546
Right, Appa?

104
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,048
Yip yip!

105
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,859
There it is,
the Southern Air Temple.

106
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,320
Aang, it's amazing!

107
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,364
We're home, buddy. We're home.

108
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,621
And by year's end,

109
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:50,831
the Earth Kingdom capital
will be under our rule.

110
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:53,959
The Fire Lord will finally claim

111
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,252
victory in this war.

112
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,004
If my father thinks
the rest of the world

113
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,255
will follow him willingly,

114
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,548
then he is a fool.

115
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,008
Two years at sea

116
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,760
have done little
to temper your tongue.

117
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:07,223
So, how's your search
for the Avatar going?

118
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:12,186
Uh... My fault entirely.

119
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,605
We haven't found him yet.

120
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,524
Did you really expect to?

121
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,859
The Avatar died a hundred years ago

122
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,487
along with the rest of the airbenders.

123
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,824
Unless you found some evidence

124
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,534
that the Avatar is alive.

125
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,619
No. Nothing.

126
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:31,622
Prince Zuko,
the Avatar is the only one

127
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:32,873
who can stop the Fire Nation

128
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,458
from winning this war.

129
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,585
If you have an ounce of loyalty left,

130
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,629
you'll tell me what you found.

131
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:41,090
I haven't found anything.

132
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,008
It's like you said...

133
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,262
The Avatar probably died
a long time ago.

134
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,722
Come on, uncle. We're going.

135
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:50,933
Commander Zhao,

136
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,018
we interrogated the crew
as you instructed.

137
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,478
They confirmed Prince Zuko

138
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,355
had the Avatar in custody

139
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:57,982
but let him escape.

140
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:00,693
Now remind me,

141
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:04,989
how exactly was your ship damaged?

142
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:14,498
So where do I get something to eat?

143
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,793
You're lucky enough
to be one of the first outsiders

144
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,962
to ever visit an airbender temple,

145
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:22,006
and all you can think about is food?

146
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,842
I'm just a simple guy
with simple needs.

147
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,279
So that's where my friends and I

148
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,429
would play airball,

149
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,598
and over there is where
the bison would sleep.

150
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,682
And...

151
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,226
What's wrong?

152
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,146
This place used to be full of monks
and lemurs and bison.

153
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,023
Now there's just a bunch of weeds.

154
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,403
I can't believe how much
things have changed.

155
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:46,363
So, uh,

156
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,115
this airball game... How do you play?

157
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,171
Ugh!

158
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,339
Ooh!

159
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,758
Ha ha ha!

160
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,761
Aang seven, Sokka zero.

161
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,596
Making him feel better

162
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,139
is putting me in a world of hurt.

163
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,271
Katara, check this out.

164
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:21,607
Fire Nation.

165
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,942
We should tell him.

166
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,694
Aang, there's something
you need to see.

167
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,404
Ok.

168
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,577
Oh!

169
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,787
What is it?

170
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,082
Uh... Just a new
waterbending move I learned.

171
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:40,042
Nice one. But enough practicing.

172
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,378
We have a whole temple to see.

173
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:46,006
You know,
you can't protect him forever.

174
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,807
Katara, firebenders were here.

175
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,266
You can't pretend they weren't.

176
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,352
I can for Aang's sake.

177
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:01,313
If he finds out that the Fire Nation
invaded his home,

178
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,606
he'll be devastated.

179
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,941
Hey, guys!

180
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,651
I want you to meet somebody.

181
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:06,777
Who's that?

182
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,278
Monk Gyatso,

183
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,905
the greatest airbender in the world.

184
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,741
He taught me everything I know.

185
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,999
But the true secret
is in the gooey center.

186
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:21,583
Hmm.

187
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,794
My ancient cake making technique

188
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:25,921
isn't the only thing on your mind,

189
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,673
is it, Aang?

190
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:29,591
This whole Avatar thing...

191
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,885
Maybe the monks made a mistake.

192
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,846
The only mistake they made

193
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,640
was telling you before you turned 16.

194
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,518
But we can't concern ourselves
with what was.

195
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:42,021
We must act on what is.

196
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:47,901
But, Gyatso,

197
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,820
how do I know if I'm ready for this?

198
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,239
Your questions will be answered

199
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:56,368
when you're old enough
to enter the air temple sanctuary.

200
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,954
Inside, you will meet someone

201
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,290
who will guide you on your journey.

202
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:02,541
Who is it?

203
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:04,168
When you are ready,

204
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:06,336
he will reveal himself to you.

205
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,421
Hmm.

206
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,672
Now...

207
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,134
Are you going to help me
with these cakes

208
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,343
or not?

209
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,720
All right.

210
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,515
One... Two...

211
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,600
Three.

212
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,487
Your aim has improved greatly,

213
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,530
my young pupil.

214
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,411
You must miss him.

215
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,704
Yeah.

216
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,122
Where are you going?

217
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,749
The air temple sanctuary.

218
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,334
There's someone I'm ready to meet.

219
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,468
But, Aang,

220
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,945
no one could have survived in there

221
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,596
for a hundred years.

222
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,223
It's not impossible.

223
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:01,266
I survived in the iceberg
for that long.

224
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,351
Good point.

225
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,394
Katara, whoever's in there

226
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,271
might help me figure out
this Avatar thing.

227
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,440
And whoever's in there
might have a medley

228
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,401
of delicious cured meats.

229
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,570
Ooh!

230
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,655
Unh!

231
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:15,948
Ohh.

232
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,866
I don't suppose you have a key.

233
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,744
The key, Sokka, is airbending.

234
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:50,983
Hello?

235
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,818
Anyone home?

236
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,582
So a 12-year-old boy

237
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,834
bested you and your firebenders.

238
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,378
You're more pathetic than I thought.

239
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,880
I underestimated him once,

240
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,298
but it will not happen again.

241
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,757
No, it will not,

242
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,593
because you won't
have a second chance.

243
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,677
Commander Zhao,

244
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,780
I've been hunting the Avatar
for two years, and I...

245
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:21,930
And you failed.

246
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,557
Capturing the Avatar is too important

247
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,517
to leave in a teenager's hands.

248
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,977
He's mine now.

249
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,771
Keep them here.

250
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,485
More tea, please.

251
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,544
Statues?

252
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,962
That's it?

253
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,547
Where's the meat?

254
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,216
Who are all these people?

255
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,259
I'm not sure.

256
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,220
But it feels like I know them somehow.

257
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,304
Look!

258
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,513
That one's an airbender!

259
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,015
And this one's a waterbender.

260
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,600
They're lined up in a pattern.

261
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,354
Air, water, earth, and fire.

262
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:12,064
That's the Avatar cycle.

263
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:14,733
Of course. They're Avatars.

264
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,569
All these people
are your past lives, Aang.

265
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,364
Wow! There's so many.

266
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,409
Past lives?

267
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,662
Katara, you really
believe in that stuff?

268
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,955
It's true.

269
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,998
When the Avatar dies,

270
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,122
he's reincarnated
into the next nation in the cycle.

271
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,300
Aang, snap out of it.

272
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:42,678
Huh?

273
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,054
Who is that?

274
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,640
That's Avatar Roku,
the Avatar before me.

275
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,934
You were a firebender?

276
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:51,061
No wonder I didn't trust you
when we first met.

277
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,562
There's no writing.

278
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,647
How do you know his name?

279
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,982
I'm not sure.

280
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,359
I just know it somehow.

281
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,279
You just couldn't get any weirder.

282
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,322
♪♪♪♪

283
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,249
Firebender.
Nobody make a sound.

284
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,458
You're making a sound.

285
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,584
Shh! Shh!

286
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,885
That firebender
won't know what hit him.

287
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,564
Lemur!

288
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:36,773
Dinner.

289
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,191
Don't listen to him.

290
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,568
You're gonna be my new pet.

291
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:40,861
Not if I get him first!

292
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,283
Wait! Come back!

293
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,201
I want to eat you!

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,293
Ha ha ha!

295
00:13:58,628 --> 00:13:59,963
Aah! Unh!

296
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:12,642
Hey! No fair!

297
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,191
My search party is ready.

298
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:20,984
Once I'm out to sea,

299
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,788
my guards will escort you
back to your ship,

300
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,404
And you will be free to go.

301
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,031
Why? Are you worried

302
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:27,991
I'm going to try and stop you?

303
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,327
Ha ha ha!

304
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,454
You... Stop me?

305
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:33,747
Impossible.

306
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,791
Don't underestimate me, Zhao.

307
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:37,709
I will capture the Avatar before you.

308
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,878
Prince Zuko, that's enough.

309
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:42,214
You can't compete with me.

310
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,758
I have hundreds of warships
under my command,

311
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:45,967
And you,

312
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,803
you're just a banished prince.

313
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,597
No home, no allies.

314
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,891
Your own father doesn't even want you.

315
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,476
You're wrong.

316
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,353
Once I deliver
the Avatar to my father,

317
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,438
he will welcome me home with honor

318
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,732
and restore my rightful place
on the throne.

319
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,777
If your father really wanted you home,

320
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,445
he would have let you return by now,

321
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,739
Avatar or no Avatar.

322
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,825
But in his eyes, you are a failure

323
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,827
and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.

324
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,161
That's not true.

325
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,372
You have the scar to prove it.

326
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,582
Aah! Maybe you'd like one to match!

327
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,292
Is that a challenge?

328
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,212
An Agni Kai at sunset.

329
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,047
Very well.

330
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,591
It's a shame your father won't be here

331
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,718
to watch me humiliate you.

332
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,512
I guess your uncle will do.

333
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:32,556
Prince Zuko,

334
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,057
have you forgotten what happened

335
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,976
the last time you dueled a master?

336
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,061
I will never forget.

337
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,403
Hey! Come back!

338
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,447
Come on out, little lemur.

339
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,574
That hungry guy
won't bother you anymore.

340
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,288
Firebenders?

341
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:58,248
They were here?

342
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,798
Gyatso.

343
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:09,926
Hey, Aang, you find my dinner yet?

344
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,181
Aang, I wasn't really gonna
eat the lemur, ok?

345
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,057
Oh, man.

346
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,101
Come on, Aang.

347
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,436
Everything will be all right.

348
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,645
Let's get out of here.

349
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,246
Aang!

350
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,552
Send word
to the Fire Lord immediately.

351
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,846
The Avatar has returned.

352
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:03,438
Aang, come on!

353
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,398
Snap out of it! Aah!

354
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,236
Aah! Unh!

355
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:16,660
What happened?

356
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:19,120
He found out firebenders
killed Gyatso.

357
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,623
Oh, no. It's his Avatar spirit.

358
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,166
He must have triggered it.

359
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,252
I'm gonna try and calm him down.

360
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,711
Well, do it,

361
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,630
before he blows us off the mountain!

362
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:47,941
Remember your firebending basics,
Prince Zuko.

363
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:49,776
They are your greatest weapons.

364
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,236
I refuse to let him win.

365
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:55,532
This will be over quickly.

366
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:36,114
Basics, Zuko.

367
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,616
Break his root.

368
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,409
Unh!

369
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,166
Unh!

370
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,344
Aah!

371
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:16,863
Unh!

372
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,622
Do it!

373
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,211
That's it?

374
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:33,505
Your father raised a coward.

375
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:36,007
Next time you get in my way,
I promise,

376
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,801
I won't hold back.

377
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,688
Unh!

378
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,273
No, Prince Zuko.

379
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,026
Do not taint your victory.

380
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,779
So this is how
the great Commander Zhao

381
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,114
acts in defeat?

382
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,241
Disgraceful.

383
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,410
Even in exile,

384
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:07,080
my nephew is more honorable than you.

385
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,666
Thanks again for the tea.

386
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:11,418
It was delicious.

387
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,174
Did you really mean that, uncle?

388
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,759
Of course.

389
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,512
I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.

390
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,270
Aang, I know you're upset,

391
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:31,896
and I know how hard it is

392
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,815
to lose the people you love.

393
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,485
I went through the same thing
when I lost my mom.

394
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:40,405
Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders

395
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,198
may be gone,

396
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,076
but you still have a family.

397
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,787
Sokka and I, we're your family now.

398
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,757
Katara and I

399
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,359
aren't gonna let anything
happen to you.

400
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:01,509
Promise.

401
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,682
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,892
It's ok.

403
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,268
It wasn't your fault.

404
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:11,644
But you were right.

405
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,438
And if firebenders found this temple,

406
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,565
That means
they found the other ones, too.

407
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:18,067
I really am the last airbender.

408
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,911
Everything's packed.

409
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:29,329
You ready to go?

410
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:30,914
How is Roku supposed to help me

411
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:32,290
if I can't talk to him?

412
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:34,000
Maybe you'll find a way.

413
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,377
♪♪♪♪

414
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,761
Mm! Mm!

415
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:46,513
Looks like you made
a new friend, Sokka.

416
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:49,766
Can't talk. Must eat.

417
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,851
Hey, little guy.

418
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:57,357
You, me, and Appa...

419
00:21:57,565 --> 00:21:59,484
We're all that's left of this place.

420
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,361
We have to stick together.

421
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:03,238
Katara, Sokka,

422
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,533
say hello to the newest
member of our family.

423
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,742
What are you gonna name him?

424
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,080
Momo.
