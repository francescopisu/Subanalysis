1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,003
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,088
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:07,965
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,301
<i>Air...</i>

5
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:14,514
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:18,768
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,438
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,648
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,525
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

10
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>A hundred years passed,
and my brother and I</i>

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,615
<i>discovered the new Avatar,
an airbender named Aang.</i>

13
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>And although his airbending
skills were great,</i>

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,579
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,083
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

16
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,980
Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy.

17
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,192
Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka

18
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,069
aren't coming
to the Fire Nation with us.

19
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,239
If they got hurt,
I'd never forgive myself.

20
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,284
So get your big butt
off the ground and let's go!

21
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,451
Uhh...

22
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,869
Aah!

23
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:20,264
I think his big butt

24
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,568
is trying to tell you something.

25
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:23,249
Please don't go, Aang.

26
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,876
The world can't afford to lose you
to the Fire Nation.

27
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,461
Neither can I.

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,552
But I have to talk to Avatar Roku

29
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:36,012
to find out what my vision means.

30
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:38,139
I need to get to the fire temple

31
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:39,849
before the sun sets on the solstice.

32
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:41,309
That's today!

33
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:47,523
We're not letting you
go into the Fire Nation, Aang.

34
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,276
At least not without your friends.

35
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,527
We got your back.

36
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,740
Ew!

37
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:58,200
It's a long journey
to the crescent island.

38
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,369
You'll have to fly fast
to have any chance

39
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,246
of making it before sundown.

40
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,873
Good luck.

41
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:04,957
Thank you for your...

42
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,042
Go!

43
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:11,922
Ah.

44
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:13,883
Having trouble sleeping?

45
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:14,967
Uh!

46
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,220
Seen the Avatar lately?

47
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,440
Come on, boy.
We've got a long way to go.

48
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:30,524
Faster!

49
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,908
Sailing into Fire Nation waters.

50
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,786
Of all the foolish things you've done

51
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:44,580
in your 16 years, Prince Zuko,

52
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,291
this is the most foolish.

53
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,834
I have no choice, uncle.

54
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,003
Have you completely forgotten

55
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,547
that the Fire Lord banished you?

56
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,257
What if you're caught?

57
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,259
I'm chasing the Avatar.

58
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,263
My father will understand
why I'm returning home.

59
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,806
You give him too much credit.

60
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,517
My brother is not
the understanding type.

61
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,605
There they are.

62
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,524
Helmsman, full steam ahead.

63
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,194
Aang, we got trouble.

64
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:17,154
Yeah, and it's gaining fast!

65
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:27,957
Really, Prince Zuko,
couldn't you shoot them down

66
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,542
with something more fragrant?

67
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,544
Huh!

68
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,296
On my mark.

69
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:35,589
Fire!

70
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,844
Fire ball!

71
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:40,928
I'm on it!

72
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:46,767
We have to get out of Zuko's range

73
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,103
before he shoots
another hotsticker at us!

74
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,105
Can't you make Appa go any faster?

75
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,899
Yeah, but there's
just one little problem.

76
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,651
A blockade.

77
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:03,951
Technically, you are still

78
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,494
in Earth Kingdom waters.

79
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,747
Turn back now,
and they cannot arrest you.

80
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,206
If we fly north,

81
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,810
we can go around the Fire Nation ships

82
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,209
and avoid the blockade.

83
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,669
It's the only way.

84
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,379
There's no time!

85
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,339
This is exactly why
I didn't want you to come.

86
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,924
It's too dangerous.

87
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,760
And that's exactly why we're here.

88
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,595
Let's run this blockade.

89
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:24,555
Appa, yip yip!

90
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:28,684
He's not turning around.

91
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,354
Please, Prince Zuko.
If the Fire Nation captures you,

92
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,356
There is nothing I can do.

93
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,525
Do not follow the Avatar.

94
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,402
I'm sorry, uncle.

95
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:40,821
Run the blockade!

96
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:43,407
The Avatar...

97
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,327
And the banished prince.

98
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,455
This must be my lucky day.

99
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:51,832
Commander Zhao, what are your orders?

100
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,043
Shoot the bison down, captain.

101
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:57,087
But there's a fire navy ship
out there, sir... One of our own.

102
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,214
What if it's hit?

103
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:00,841
So be it. It belongs to a traitor.

104
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:02,384
Ignite!

105
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:06,889
Launch!

106
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,269
Aah! Aah! Aah!

107
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,538
Appa, are you ok?

108
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,221
Prince Zuko, the engines are damaged!

109
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,515
We need to stop and make repairs!

110
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,642
Do not stop this ship.

111
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,185
Launch!

112
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,985
Aah!

113
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,036
Aah! Aah! Aah!

114
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:13,330
Aah!

115
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,458
Sokka!

116
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,588
Aah!

117
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,340
Aah!

118
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:27,469
Oh!

119
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,315
Ready.

120
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:45,112
Fire!

121
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,783
Aah!

122
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,413
Huh!

123
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,544
Aah! Ooh!

124
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,010
We made it!

125
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:10,888
We got into the Fire Nation. Great.

126
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,515
Where do you think
the Avatar is headed, sir?

127
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,517
I'm not sure,

128
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,228
but I bet a certain
banished prince will know.

129
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,608
We're on a collision course!

130
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:23,859
We can make it.

131
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,237
The boarding party is ready
to apprehend Prince Zuko, sir.

132
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,531
Wait. Cut the engines

133
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,824
and let them pass.

134
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,909
Sir?

135
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,932
There it is...

136
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,685
The island
where Roku's dragon took me.

137
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,317
You did it, buddy. Nice flying.

138
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,904
Oh, you must be tired.

139
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:14,785
No, I'm good. Refreshed and ready
to fight some firebenders.

140
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,745
I was talking to Appa.

141
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,540
Well, I was talking to Momo.

142
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,966
I don't see any guards.

143
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:30,050
The Fire Nation

144
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,236
must have abandoned the temple

145
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,594
when Avatar Roku died.

146
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,930
It's almost sundown.
We'd better hurry.

147
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,651
Wait. I think I heard something.

148
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:54,700
We are the fire sages,
guardians of the temple of the Avatar.

149
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,869
Great. I am the Avatar.

150
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,454
We know.

151
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,045
I'll hold them off. Run!

152
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:10,340
Uh! Uh! Uh!

153
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,385
If the Avatar contacts Roku,

154
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,846
there's no telling how powerful
the boy will become.

155
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,681
Split up and find him.

156
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,603
Follow me!

157
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:23,926
Do you know where you're going?

158
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,022
Nope.

159
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,192
Wrong way!

160
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:29,902
Come back!

161
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,744
I don't want to fight you.
I am a friend.

162
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,038
Firebenders aren't our friends.

163
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,043
I know why you're here, Avatar.

164
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,252
You do?

165
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,631
Yes. You wish to speak to Avatar Roku.

166
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:52,841
I can take you to him.

167
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,926
How?

168
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,262
Uh!

169
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,641
This way.

170
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,434
Find him!

171
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:05,437
Time is running out! Quickly!

172
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,073
What's he up to, uncle?

173
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:18,200
Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?

174
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,661
Because he wants to follow you.

175
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,079
He knows you'll lead him

176
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:24,373
to the prize you're both after...

177
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,582
The Avatar.

178
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,293
If Zhao wants to follow
our trail of smoke,

179
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,587
then that's exactly
what I'll let him do.

180
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,007
Avatar Roku once called
this temple his home.

181
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,594
He formed these secret passages
out of the magma.

182
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,471
Did you know Avatar Roku?

183
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,182
No, but my grandfather knew him.

184
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,643
Many generations of fire sages

185
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:47,312
guarded this temple long before me.

186
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,523
We all have a strong
spiritual connection

187
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,024
to this place.

188
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,568
Is that how you knew I was coming?

189
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,029
A few weeks ago,
an amazing thing occurred.

190
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,240
The statue of Avatar Roku...

191
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,659
Its eyes began to glow.

192
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:02,661
That's when we were
at the air temple.

193
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:05,372
Avatar Roku's eyes
were glowing there, too.

194
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:09,126
At that moment,
we knew you had returned to the world.

195
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,628
If this is the Avatar's temple,

196
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,380
why did the sages attack me?

197
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,215
Things have changed.

198
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,925
In the past, the sages were loyal

199
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,635
only to the Avatar.

200
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,932
When Roku died, the sages eagerly
awaited for the next Avatar to return,

201
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,809
but he never came.

202
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:27,769
They were waiting for me.

203
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,564
Hey, don't feel bad.
You're only 100 years late.

204
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,525
They lost hope that the Avatar
would ever return.

205
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:36,612
When Fire Lord Sozin began the war,

206
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,614
my grandfather and the other sages

207
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,866
were forced to follow him.

208
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,660
I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord.

209
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,038
When I learned you were coming,

210
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,540
I knew I would have to
betray the other sages.

211
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,167
Thank you for helping me.

212
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,463
We'll follow these stairs
to the sanctuary.

213
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,882
Once you're inside,

214
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:59,885
wait for the light to hit
Avatar Roku's statue.

215
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,679
Only then will you be
able to speak with him.

216
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,773
No!

217
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,150
Shyu, what's wrong?

218
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:18,362
The sanctuary doors... They're closed.

219
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,656
Can't you just open them
with firebending,

220
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,199
like you opened that other door?

221
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,036
No. Only a fully realized Avatar

222
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,497
is powerful enough
to open this door alone.

223
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:31,917
Otherwise, the sages must
open the doors together

224
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,295
with five simultaneous fire blasts.

225
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,381
Five fire blasts, huh?

226
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,217
I think I can help you out.

227
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,429
Uncle, keep heading north.

228
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,306
Zhao will follow the smoke trail

229
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,975
while I use it as a cover.

230
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,601
Hmmm.

231
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,878
This is a little trick

232
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:00,237
I picked up from my father.

233
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,615
I seal the lamp oil inside
an animal skin casing.

234
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,909
Shyu lights the oil-soaked twine,

235
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,077
and ta da!

236
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,537
Fake firebending.

237
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:11,164
You're really outdone yourself
this time, Sokka.

238
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,250
This might actually work.

239
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,671
The sages will hear the explosion,

240
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:19,756
so as soon as they go off,
you rush in.

241
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:24,511
It's almost sunset. Are you ready?

242
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:25,679
Definitely.

243
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,230
Ooh!

244
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:41,570
Uh! Uh!

245
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:42,696
They're still locked!

246
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,160
It didn't work.

247
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:02,174
Why won't it open?! Uh!

248
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:04,634
Aang, stop.

249
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:06,470
There's nothing else we can do.

250
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:09,514
I'm sorry I put you
through all this for nothing.

251
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,682
I don't get it.

252
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:12,642
That blast looked as strong

253
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,269
as any firebending I've seen.

254
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,606
Sokka, you're a genius!

255
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,608
Wait. How is Sokka a genius?

256
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,026
His plan didn't even work.

257
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:23,570
Come on, Aang. Let her dream.

258
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:27,199
You're right.
Sokka's plan didn't work,

259
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,368
but it looks like it did.

260
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,203
Did the definition of genius change

261
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,913
in the last 100 years?

262
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,625
Come quickly!
The Avatar has entered the sanctuary!

263
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,001
How did he get in?

264
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,587
I know, but look at the scorch marks,

265
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,671
and down there.

266
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,010
He's inside.
Open the doors immediately

267
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,430
before he contacts Avatar Roku.

268
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:54,184
- Huh!
- Huh!

269
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:06,405
It's the Avatar's lemur.

270
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:08,824
He must have crawled
through the pipes.

271
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,117
We've been tricked!

272
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,284
Aah!

273
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,539
Now, Aang.

274
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:18,834
Aang, now's your chance!

275
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,213
The Avatar's coming with me.

276
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,465
Uh! Uh!

277
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,259
Uh!

278
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:29,636
Close the doors, quickly!

279
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:36,768
- Uh!
- Aah!

280
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,478
Go!

281
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,862
He made it!

282
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:02,252
The light hits the statue,
and I talk to Roku.

283
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,837
So why isn't anything happening?

284
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,089
- Huh!
- Huh!

285
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,761
Why isn't it working?
It's sealed shut.

286
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,597
It must have been the light.

287
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,266
Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.

288
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,854
Why isn't anything happening?

289
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,981
I don't know what I'm doing.

290
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,524
All I know is airbending.

291
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,610
Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me.

292
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,536
It's good to see you, Aang.

293
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,122
What took you so long?

294
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:45,587
Why did you help the Avatar?

295
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,381
Because it was once the sage's duty.

296
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,426
It is still our duty.

297
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,517
What a moving
and heartfelt performance.

298
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,770
I'm certain the Fire Lord
will understand

299
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,606
when you explain why you betrayed him.

300
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:05,941
Commander Zhao...

301
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,026
And, Prince Zuko,

302
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,237
it was a noble effort,

303
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,323
but your little smokescreen
didn't work.

304
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,201
Two traitors in one day.

305
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:18,328
The Fire Lord will be pleased.

306
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,121
You're too late, Zhao.

307
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,581
The Avatar's inside,

308
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,666
and the doors are sealed.

309
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,752
No matter. Sooner or later,

310
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,462
he has to come out.

311
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:35,262
I have something very important
to tell you, Aang.

312
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:39,849
That is why,
when you were in the spirit world,

313
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,185
I sent my dragon to find you.

314
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,020
Is it about that vision...

315
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,105
The one of the comet?

316
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,439
Yes.

317
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,649
What does it mean?

318
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,026
100 years ago,

319
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,404
Fire Lord Sozin used that comet

320
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,155
to begin the war.

321
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,700
He and his firebending army

322
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,035
harnessed its incredible power

323
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,037
and dealt a deadly first strike

324
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,123
against the other nations.

325
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:05,250
So the comet made them stronger?

326
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,379
Yes, stronger than you
could even imagine.

327
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,423
But that happened a hundred years ago.

328
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:13,717
What does the comet
have to do with the war now?

329
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,135
Listen carefully.

330
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:19,180
Sozin's Comet will return
by the end of this summer,

331
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,850
and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power

332
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,769
to finish the war once and for all.

333
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,563
Aah!

334
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,899
If he succeeds, even the Avatar

335
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,902
won't be able to restore
balance to the world.

336
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,531
Aang, you must defeat the Fire Lord

337
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,575
before the comet arrives.

338
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,036
But I haven't even started
learning waterbending,

339
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,038
not to mention earth and fire.

340
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:47,250
Mastering the elements takes years
of discipline and practice,

341
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,794
But if the world is to survive,

342
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,589
you must do it by summer's end.

343
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:02,390
When those doors open,

344
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,809
unleash all your firepower.

345
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,062
How's Aang gonna make it out of this?

346
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,625
How are we gonna make it out of this?

347
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:13,902
What if I can't master
all the elements in time?

348
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,153
What if I fail?

349
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:17,280
I know you can do it, Aang,

350
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:20,700
for you have done it before.

351
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,328
The solstice is ending.

352
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:27,832
We must go our separate ways for now.

353
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,959
But I won't be able
to come back to the temple.

354
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,836
What if I have questions?

355
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,046
How will I talk to you?

356
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,924
I am a part of you.

357
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,885
When you need to talk to me again,

358
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:41,179
you will find a way.

359
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:46,393
A great danger awaits you
at the temple.

360
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,688
I can help you face the threat,

361
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,398
But only if you are ready.

362
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,651
I'm ready.

363
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:06,621
Ready...

364
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,374
No! Aang!

365
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:10,917
Fire!

366
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:18,925
Avatar Roku!

367
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:22,887
- Uh!
- Uh!

368
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,432
Uh!

369
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,438
- Oh!
- Oh!

370
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,440
Avatar Roku is going to
destroy the temple.

371
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,899
We have to get out of here!

372
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,234
Not without Aang!

373
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:37,777
Huh!

374
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,266
We got your back.

375
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:10,518
Thanks. Where's Shyu?

376
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,603
I don't know.

377
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,817
Uh! Uh! Uh!

378
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,215
No prince, no Avatar.

379
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,425
Apparently the only thing I do have

380
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,260
is five traitors.

381
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,013
But, Commander,
only Shyu helped the Avatar.

382
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,390
Save your stories for the Fire Lord.

383
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:51,392
As far as I'm concerned,

384
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,353
you are all guilty.

385
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,104
Take them to the prison hold!
