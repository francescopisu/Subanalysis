1
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,400
That was so exhausting!

2
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,000
They were watching us the whole time, too.

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,310
Mr. Fu and Ran Fan, right?

4
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,210
Hey!

5
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,910
Where's the young master!?

6
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,380
I don't see him...

7
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,920
Could he have gone missing again?

8
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,880
Seriously... The instant I take my eyes off him...

9
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,720
Young master!

10
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,890
Where have you gone?!

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,890
I hope he hasn't collapsed somewhere like last time...

12
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,460
Good riddance.

13
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,230
Let's go.

14
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,440
Okay...

15
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,530
Young master! Where are you?!

16
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,570
There's something... odd about this country.

17
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,070
It's me. I came to visit.

18
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,340
Good work.

19
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,560
From the Colonel.

20
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,570
Yo, it's the cigarette kid!

21
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,180
How are you doing? Were you even able to beat him once?

22
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,510
Not a chance.

23
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,820
This game is pretty boring, too.

24
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,480
Hey, I can go cut people up if it's just at night, right?

25
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,910
Of course not!

26
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,040
Then, could you at least... bring that Hawkeye lady?

27
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,640
Yeah, I'll mention it to her.

28
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,720
How much longer do I have to watch over this guy?

29
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,220
What did the Colonel say?

30
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,050
"Sorry for putting you in charge of such a dangerous task."

31
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,600
"Don't worry about military duty, though."

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,810
"I've marked you down as absent due to illness."

33
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,260
"However, you're as good as dead if a civilian
or someone from the military besides us finds you."

34
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,410
...is what he said.

35
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,170
Any good news?

36
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,410
Yup.

37
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,740
Huh? What is it?

38
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,700
I got a girlfriend!

39
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,790
She really helped me out when I was struggling with the transfer and all.

40
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,150
She's such a babe, too!

41
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,210
Hey, do you think I'd enjoy cutting her up?

42
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,280
Just go home already...

43
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,090
Oh my.

44
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,510
What's wrong with him?

45
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,530
Hey, are you all right?

46
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,770
Is he okay?

47
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,630
F-Food...

48
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,810
He's completely out of it.

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,710
Where's he from?

50
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,550
What? You came from Xing?

51
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,070
That's so far...

52
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,430
By the way, where's your certificate of entry?

53
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,550
Make way! Make way!

54
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,530
Illegal entrant coming through!

55
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,830
Young master! Where are you?!

56
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,330
He's passed out somewhere... I just know he has!

57
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,030
Well, let's go say hi to the military first.

58
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,090
Let's.

59
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,640
Then... I think I'll go visit Mr. Hughes' place first.

60
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,140
I can't wait to see Miss Gracia and Elicia, either.

61
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,500
Okay.

62
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,440
We'll head over there afterwards.

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
Well, see you then.

64
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,280
I wonder if Lt. Colonel Hughes uncovered
more information about the stone for us since then.

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,170
Well, the FÃ¼hrer President warned him to stay out of it, too.

66
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,330
Let's give him the information we obtained, first.

67
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,830
Homunculus...

68
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,950
Yeah.

69
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,050
The Lt. Colonel should be at the military chambers...

70
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,590
Over there!

71
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,790
Sheska?

72
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,020
Sheska!

73
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,840
Yes?

74
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,110
You have the key to that room, right?

75
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,820
Yes, I do.

76
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,360
Oh... Room 3, you mean?

77
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,740
I've kind of made a mess in there...

78
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,250
Don't worry about it. I just need to grab some documents.

79
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,080
I'm telling you, it's not all right.

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,250
I'll clean it up right away, so please give me a moment!

81
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,110
Okay. I'll come get it later, so please finish by then.

82
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,010
Y-Yes, ma'am!

83
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,110
Umm... Colonel?

84
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,940
Colonel Mustang.

85
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,180
How many minutes was I asleep?

86
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,700
I'd say about ten.

87
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,850
I don't have much time before the army council.

88
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,980
Excuse my unsolicited advice, but perhaps
you should rest instead of straining yourself?

89
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,910
Yeah, I'll come again.

90
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,470
Was that Colonel Mustang?

91
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,510
G-Good morning, Captain Focker!

92
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,390
Morning, Sheska.

93
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,730
But why was the Colonel here?

94
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,170
W-Well... you see...

95
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,690
The door to the archives is open, too.

96
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,170
I'm sorry! The truth is, well...

97
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,500
Let me guess, the colonel railroaded through, right?

98
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,970
I'll keep it a secret.

99
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,250
Thank you so much!

100
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,170
But I wonder what he was looking up?

101
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,250
Any idea?

102
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,650
I don't know the details either,

103
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,030
but he asked me whether there were
any documents concerning Research Laboratory 5.

104
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,790
That, and the murder of Brigadier General Hughes...

105
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,510
It's thanks to the Brigadier General that I got a job here.

106
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,690
Ah, that's right.

107
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,190
Well, there's a lot of work to do today as always.

108
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,290
I'm counting on you.

109
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,880
Yes, sir.

110
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,010
Morning, Sheska.

111
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,030
Yes? Huh?

112
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,670
What?

113
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,450
Hello.

114
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,180
Did you perhaps lose some weight?

115
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,970
I might have.

116
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,390
You were injured?

117
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,290
Just some trouble down south.

118
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,760
It's just a scratch.

119
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,680
I see.

120
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,520
By the way, I met the Elric Brothers while I was down there.

121
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,850
A coincidence. They were meeting their master, who lives in Dublith.

122
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,370
Major.

123
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,230
Yes?

124
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,490
Have you told them about Hughes' death?

125
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,030
No, I couldn't bring myself to tell them.

126
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,490
They'll find out sooner or later.

127
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,320
I know that, sir.

128
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,200
Research Laboratory 5 and the philosopher's stones.

129
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,000
The ingredients to the stones are live humans.

130
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,790
He was such an accommodating guy.

131
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:38,760
He probably stuck his nose into what the Elric Brothers were researching and uncovered something he shouldn't have.

132
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,640
Is that why you won't tell them?

133
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:49,090
If they find out Hughes died because he got involved with them, they'd be devastated...

134
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,520
You're too kind.

135
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,650
And you know too much.

136
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,030
I'm almost there.

137
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,030
Please be careful.

138
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,540
No one knows who could be listening.

139
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,290
I'll be going on ahead.

140
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,480
Huh? Lieutenant Hawkeye!

141
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,410
Ah, it's been a while.

142
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,820
If you're here, that means...

143
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,750
Sorry to make you wait.

144
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,300
I knew it...

145
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,770
Oh, Fullmetal.

146
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,740
Why the hell are you here, Colonel?

147
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,360
I was transferred to Central effective last month.

148
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,740
And what about you? What brings you here?

149
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,910
Just collecting some information.

150
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,660
We were also thinking about going to say hi to Lt. Colonel Hughes.

151
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,330
How's he doing?

152
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,220
He's no longer here.

153
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,340
Huh?

154
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,980
He decided to retire to the country.

155
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,220
He's going to take over the family business along with his wife and daughter.

156
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,310
So he's not here.

157
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,880
Oh... that's too bad.

158
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,730
We were looking forward to seeing him, too...

159
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,320
Fullmetal.

160
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,100
Don't jump the gun and do anything reckless.

161
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,620
Sure.

162
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,170
Treating them like children only at a time like this?

163
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,660
They don't need to know right now.

164
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,000
It's better if there are fewer obstacles for those brothers to move forward.

165
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,560
But they'll find out eventually.

166
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,730
I don't have the right to call
Major Armstrong soft-hearted, either.

167
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,940
Soft-hearted?

168
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,360
Don't you mean cruel?

169
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,880
So the Lt. Colonel isn't around, huh...

170
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,360
Oh, I almost forgot, Brother.

171
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,300
We have to let Winry know.

172
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,080
She's headed for his home.

173
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,540
You're right.

174
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,550
Second Lieutenant Ross!

175
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,230
It's been a while, you two.

176
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,800
What's the hurry?

177
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,300
We heard about Lt. Colonel Hughes, so...

178
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,640
I see...

179
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,560
It's hard, isn't it?

180
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,310
There was so much I wanted to say to him, too...

181
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,600
I wish we had a chance to have a proper farewell with him.

182
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,770
No one contacted you about it, huh?

183
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,840
Don't worry.

184
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,160
The army gave him a proper farewell.

185
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,360
Really? That's nice of you guys.

186
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,990
Of course.

187
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,750
Also, you may have heard this already, but he was specially promoted two ranks to the rank of Brigadier General.

188
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,750
Specially promoted two ranks?

189
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,660
He was specially promoted for retiring to the country?

190
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,260
Second Lieutenant Ross!

191
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,870
Here you go.

192
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,240
Thanks.

193
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,290
You can't be serious! Why was he...

194
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,370
Why?!

195
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,710
Brother!

196
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,680
Brigadier General Hughes was murdered by someone soon after you were released from the hospital.

197
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,890
They haven't caught the perpetrator yet.

198
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,230
It's my fault...

199
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,270
I dragged him into this! Lt. Colonel Hughes!

200
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,040
Well, careful out there.

201
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,000
Be sure to drop by if you ever come to Central again.

202
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,090
Oh, Alphonse, you can't eat with that armor on, can you?

203
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,420
You guys probably haven't booked a place to stay at yet, right?

204
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,090
If so, stay at my place.

205
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,220
Papa!

206
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,360
What are you going to do?

207
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm going to tell them everything.

208
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,760
You head back.

209
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,260
I'm the only one who needs to face them.

210
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,350
It's not just your problem.

211
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,060
It concerns both of us.

212
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,740
So I'm going, too.

213
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,750
Hey, Al.

214
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,530
What if-

215
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,200
We chose to get our bodies back no matter what,

216
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,580
but if people end up dying because of it, I'd rather not.

217
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,500
Winry just came by, too...

218
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,010
We know.

219
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,720
Winry.

220
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,750
There's something I need to tell you, Miss Gracia.

221
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,960
Is that okay?

222
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,240
Something to tell me?

223
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,130
Yes.

224
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,820
And to Winry, too.

225
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,550
So my husband uncovered something about these philosopher's stones...

226
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,290
And his death is the murderers' way of saying "don't meddle in our affairs"?

227
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,380
We basically dragged him in.

228
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,570
I'm so sorry.

229
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,550
I'm terribly sorry...

230
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,310
If he died while trying to help someone, then that's just like him.

231
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,570
He's always been a meddling, accommodating kind of guy, and he'd always end up losing things due to his kindness.

232
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,400
But I don't think he's ever regretted it.

233
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,160
Even till the moment of his death.

234
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,160
We're...

235
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,760
Don't tell me you're going to give up.

236
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:13,030
If you two give up here, it'd mean
my husband's death was completely meaningless.

237
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,950
Even if it's impossible with the philosopher's stones, there may be other ways, right?

238
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,640
Miss Gracia...

239
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:30,740
Move forward on the path you're content with.

240
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,010
Mama...

241
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,980
Please don't cry, Mama...

242
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,720
You're in there, right, Winry?

243
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,680
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

244
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,550
The dining hall's going to close soon.

245
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,510
Okay...

246
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,690
You won't be able to function without food.

247
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,020
Yeah...

248
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,120
Well, I'm heading back to my room.

249
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,250
Apple pie?

250
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,670
I practiced making it a few times since then.

251
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,050
I don't mean to brag, but I've gotten really good at it.

252
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,560
Well, it's nowhere near as good as Miss Gracia's, though...

253
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,200
Someday...

254
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,810
I wanted Mr. Hughes to try it.

255
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,780
The Colonel is digging around
for information about Hughes' death?

256
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,920
Yeah.

257
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,290
I wonder if he's discovered anything?

258
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,450
Maybe.

259
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,800
What do we do?

260
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,300
We moved him to Central to keep an eye on him...

261
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,510
Can't he just behave?

262
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,190
He's a precious candidate for sacrifice.

263
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,150
You haven't gotten any information out of your boyfriend?

264
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,010
Nothing.

265
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,160
I can't even tell if he's foolish or able.

266
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,980
I'll go hunt for some information again.

267
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,010
We're going, Gluttony.

268
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,910
Geez, Gluttony! Don't leave this place a mess!

269
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,110
Seriously...

270
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,310
Hey, Lust?

271
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,670
We just need the Flame Alchemist to behave, right?

272
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,880
That's right.

273
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,180
Are you up for taking another measure?

274
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,680
Got something on your mind?

275
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,690
The best way to shut up an annoying dog is to give him some food.

276
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,620
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross.

277
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm Henry Douglas from military police headquarters.

278
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,660
Can I help you?

279
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,550
You're coming with me.

280
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:10,910
Your sidearm.

281
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,380
Care to explain?

282
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:23,010
Your name has been called as a
material witness in the murder of Maes Hughes.

283
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,470
That's impossible!

284
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,470
You can explain yourself later.

285
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:28,970
Come with me.

286
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,730
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross is denying all charges.

287
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,910
Collect all data concerning her.

288
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,080
Make it quick.

289
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,610
However, do it in strict secrecy.

290
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,900
Yes, sir!

291
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,870
Hey lady, could you wrap up these flowers for me?

292
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,150
Oh my, are you going on a date? You lady-killer!

293
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,160
Did I make you wait, Solaris?

294
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,900
No, I just got here.

295
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,220
I've been dying to see you, Jean.

296
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,550
I'm looking forward to hearing your interesting stories again.

297
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,950
The sacrificial lamb is engulfed in the flames of hatred...

298
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,710
...and leaves the boy with feelings of hate and regret.

299
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,720
And the man reaches out to the darkness.

300
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,970
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

301
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,990
Episode 17, Cool-Headed Flames.

302
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,010
All is playing into the hands of the unknown.
