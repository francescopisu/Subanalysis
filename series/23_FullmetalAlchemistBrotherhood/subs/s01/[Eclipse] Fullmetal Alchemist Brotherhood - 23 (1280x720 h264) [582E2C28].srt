1
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,170
A smoke bomb and a grenade.

2
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,160
That brat sure is reckless.

3
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,310
Can you track them by scent?

4
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,750
Yeah.

5
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,850
Hey, MP.

6
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,790
Please take her somewhere safe.

7
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,270
Winry, Al's still fighting, so...

8
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,520
I'm going to go.

9
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,350
Sorry.

10
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,530
I'll tell you everything when I get back.

11
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,230
How come... all I can ever do is wait?

12
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,750
We've taken a girl under protection at 8th District, San Louis Street.

13
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,280
Apparently, she's a close friend of the Fullmetal Alchemist.

14
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,210
Escort her to Central Headquarters.

15
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:43,920
I repeat.

16
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,860
We've taken a girl under protection at 8th District, San Louis Street.

17
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,700
Apparently, she's a close friend of the Fullmetal Alchemist.

18
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,390
I guess it's about time.

19
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,420
Escort her to Central Headquarters.

20
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,640
Go provide them support.

21
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,360
Roger.

22
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,270
There's a vacant house on the outskirts of town we can use.

23
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,150
Let's meet up here.

24
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,810
Make sure no one follows you.

25
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,530
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,400
I'll contact you if we make progress.

27
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,260
All right.

28
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,100
You can't come to the scene.

29
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,420
I know, I know...

30
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,340
So persistent!

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,230
I'm being driven into a part of town without anyone around...

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,860
Did I fall for their trap?!

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,490
Was that Scar?

34
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,710
You take care of the other one.

35
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,640
I'll put an end to those two.

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,350
My left arm is...

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,460
What's wrong?!

38
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,380
Young master!

39
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,050
I can no longer be of any use to you!

40
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,300
What are you saying?!

41
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,910
If you take me with you, you may fall victim, as well...

42
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,100
Without his people, there is no King.

43
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,220
But without their King, the people have no place to go.

44
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,660
You must survive, for the sake of our clan...

45
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,450
I won't leave you!

46
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,580
There are plenty of things worth throwing away for a great cause.

47
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,580
Lan Fan?! What are you planning?!

48
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,460
Don't do it!

49
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,180
There's nothing inside your armor, right?

50
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,990
How pitiful!

51
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,940
You continue to believe in alchemy
even after being placed in that miserable state?!

52
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,310
This body comes with many inconveniences.

53
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,490
But inconveniences don't make me miserable!

54
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,730
There's no reason for you to pity me!

55
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,090
My life was put back together with alchemy by my brother.

56
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,000
If I deny myself, that would mean
I'm denying brother, along with alchemy.

57
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,840
I believe in the potential alchemy holds.

58
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,400
I want to believe in it!

59
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,860
I see.

60
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,980
Brother!

61
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,170
What about Winry?

62
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,990
She's fine.

63
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,110
I'm such an idiot.

64
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,780
I made her cry again.

65
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,620
You're always so careless.

66
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,940
She saw us all covered in blood, too.

67
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,220
Yeah.

68
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,380
All right, time for act two!

69
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,370
Found you!!!

70
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,970
The Ishbalan!

71
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,580
You're...

72
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,340
That tattoo!

73
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,390
A Homunculus!

74
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,300
Lin!

75
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,370
Run!

76
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,200
Get me a sturdy wire!

77
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,240
R-Right!

78
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,800
The fact your regeneration ability is so powerful became your downfall!

79
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,870
Your own meat that expands from within the wire will end up binding you tighter!

80
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,240
Got you, Homunculus!

81
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,440
Well played.

82
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,290
I outwitted you, monster!

83
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,810
What? A Homunculus?

84
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,120
Get him on!

85
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,800
We're making a run for it!

86
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,270
Hey, wait a minute Lieute-

87
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,510
H-Hang on!

88
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,790
Al!

89
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,250
The military police are watching.

90
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,620
Pretend like you don't know them.

91
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,100
They ran!

92
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,340
Capture Scar!

93
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:42,850
Yes, sir!

94
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,140
The Colonel isn't the nicest guy around, but he's trustworthy.

95
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,080
But more importantly...

96
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,510
We need to capture Scar, Al!

97
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,220
Right!

98
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,480
Multiple crimes, including the murder of the Rockbells!

99
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,650
You'll pay for those crimes!

100
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,700
Are you all right, Mister Servant?

101
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,990
How dare you do something like this to the servant of my savior, Yoki!

102
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,950
You pipsqueak!

103
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,080
What did you say?! Speak for yourself!

104
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,070
Who is that child?!

105
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,910
Little girl, get away from him!

106
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,090
It's dangerous!

107
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,910
We're far outnumbered...

108
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,960
We ought to retreat!

109
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,610
Just what the hell was that alchemy?!

110
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,970
She performed transmutations from a distance?!

111
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,240
This way.

112
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,910
Dammit, I can't see a thing!

113
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,110
Scar!!!

114
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,280
I've already heard about you, Lin Yao.

115
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,810
We're heading straight to our hideout.

116
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,810
Wait! I left a comrade. Pick her up for me!

117
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,410
Huh?

118
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,700
No, we don't have time!

119
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,420
I'm begging you! She's in critical condition!

120
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,250
She's waiting for me to come and get her!

121
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,440
Make it quick.

122
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,870
If I recall, that woman is Mustang's...

123
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,680
You've gone and done it now, youngster.

124
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,310
So even I had those eyes...

125
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,400
No matter how far along we've come,
hatred only brings about more hatred...

126
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,870
That should have stopped the bleeding.

127
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,490
Thanks.

128
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,290
Master!

129
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,110
The military police are just around the corner!

130
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,330
We should run...

131
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,150
Our target is injured!

132
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,150
He couldn't have gotten far!

133
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,940
Search thoroughly!

134
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,340
Yes, sir!

135
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,170
Master!

136
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,210
Hurry! Hurry!

137
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,220
Shao May, we have to-

138
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,140
Huh?

139
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,850
I found something.

140
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,480
You! Is this really the time to be picking stuff up?!

141
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,730
But it was all alone in the midst of that!

142
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,770
You always do this!

143
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,740
You once picked up a stray cat and raised it inside your armor without telling me!

144
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,490
Get rid of that thing!

145
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,160
You're horrible!

146
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,690
Look how tame it is!

147
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,670
It's okay. Relax.

148
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,200
Please. This way.

149
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,270
Thanks.

150
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,250
Stay inside, okay?

151
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,640
Winry!

152
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,450
How's it going, Fullmetal Alchemist?

153
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,750
FÃ¼hrer President Bradley.

154
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,950
Why are you...

155
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,970
I heard your childhood friend was under guard here.

156
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,130
She's a person close to one of my valued, talented alchemists.

157
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,390
I have to treat her courteously.

158
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,470
Well then, young lady, I'll be taking my leave.

159
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,650
Okay. Thanks for everything.

160
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,250
She's a good, honest girl.

161
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,040
Treat her with care, okay?

162
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,450
Ed.

163
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,550
You promised.

164
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,170
Tell me everything you know about Mom and Dad.

165
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,820
I see...

166
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,450
So they were doing their best to help people until the very end...

167
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,590
But...

168
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,040
...I still wish they could have come back alive...

169
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,380
All I can do... is wait.

170
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,290
Oh, perfect timing!

171
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,200
There's a call for Miss Rockbell.

172
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,840
For me?

173
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,940
Hello?

174
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,220
Mr. Garfield?

175
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,210
Sorry, Winry.

176
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,230
I was hoping to take care of everything myself, but...

177
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,800
Is Winry still not back?!

178
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,530
Look at this! Only Winry can fix this!

179
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,200
Your customers really miss you!

180
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,090
Please come back soon, Winry!

181
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,040
Winry?

182
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,380
Tetsu?

183
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,220
Please, come back soon!

184
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,440
My foot feels so much better when you operate on it rather than Mr. Garfield!

185
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,320
Winry, I need you to finish off the exterior for my leg as soon as possible!

186
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,300
My arm, too!

187
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,510
No, I'm first!

188
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,950
I want to see you soon!

189
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,930
You idiot, Winry belongs to everybody!

190
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,220
That's right!

191
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,020
Sorry... I'll be back soon.

192
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,000
Please wait for me.

193
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,130
I'll do... I'll do my best...

194
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,460
Thanks.

195
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,040
Thanks for stopping me back then.

196
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,600
There are people who are waiting for me.

197
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,340
I was close to doing something that would make me unable to face them.

198
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,620
Winry...

199
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,490
Ed, don't forget to maintain your automail!

200
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,660
Y-You got it!

201
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,770
I'll send you some good polishing oil sometime, Al.

202
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,520
Okay!

203
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,760
Please don't die.

204
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,120
We won't.

205
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,130
Got it.

206
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,280
Next time I make you-

207
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,890
Huh? What?

208
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,870
I can't hear you.

209
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,570
Brother?

210
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,560
Wait!

211
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,290
Bye, Winry.

212
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,330
O-Okay.

213
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,290
Geez...

214
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,130
Hey, Ed!

215
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,100
What did you say?!

216
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,640
Next time I make you cry, it'll be with tears of joy!

217
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,470
Al and I will get our bodies back for sure, and we'll make you cry tears of joy!

218
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,600
You'd better remember!

219
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,490
Give me an arm and a leg.

220
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,080
One year.

221
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,750
We have no place to return now.

222
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,290
<i>Why are you</i>

223
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,110
Oh, I get it...

224
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,260
I... fell in love with him...

225
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,150
Colonel!

226
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,460
Get in.

227
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,060
There's someone seriously wounded.

228
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,650
We need a doctor.

229
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,520
Doing dangerous things again?

230
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,190
You stupid brat.

231
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,300
If I recall, you have family.

232
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,050
If it'll cause trouble, you don't have to do it.

233
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,690
I'll go bring some instruments, so hang tight.

234
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,270
Is it okay?

235
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,130
I divorced my wife soon after I came back from Ishbal.

236
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,600
You walked in the sewers with your arm cut off?!

237
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,420
I wouldn't be surprised if you got tetanus!

238
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,310
I've only dealt with corpses lately.

239
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,050
So I may be a bit rough.

240
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm sorry...

241
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,180
Don't get the wrong idea.

242
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,000
We're the ones who offered to help.

243
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,350
We only worked with you guys because we had a common interest.

244
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,250
I'm seeking something so great as immortality.

245
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,190
I was prepared for the worst when I left my country.

246
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,000
No... I wasn't prepared enough.

247
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,490
Lan Fan was more prepared than I was.

248
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,810
Are you all right?

249
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,220
Is there anything we can do for you?

250
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,720
Your trap wasn't half bad...

251
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,310
But I can't use it anymore...

252
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,190
I need a replacement arm.

253
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,910
Sure!

254
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,490
I'll introduce you to an awesome automail mechanic!

255
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,730
I'm Colonel Roy Mustang of the military.

256
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,470
I'm Lin Yao, twelfth prince of the Xing Dynasty.

257
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
I'm grateful that you found us a doctor.

258
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,940
You helped us out by helping Maria Ross, as well.

259
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,620
And this thing, too.

260
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,230
Hey, what the hell is that?

261
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,840
He's a homunculus by the name of Gluttony.

262
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,060
Ho-

263
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,360
Apparently, this guy has some sort of connection with a portion of the upper echelons of the military.

264
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,660
"A portion"?!

265
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,870
You have no idea!

266
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,040
King Bradley.

267
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,580
There's a possibility he's a Homunculus, as well.

268
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,570
He had a tattoo of Ouroboros on his eye underneath his eyepatch.

269
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,170
He and Gluttony both came after us.

270
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,210
No way...

271
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,720
The top man of the country is a Homunculus?!

272
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,980
But...

273
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,320
...Bradley did not give off a sense of not being a human, like Gluttony did.

274
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,230
He feels the same as an ordinary human.

275
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,950
Then...

276
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,650
First of all, if the FÃ¼hrer President is a Homunculus, what about his son?!

277
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,150
I read in a book that Homunculi are unable to reproduce!

278
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,380
No.

279
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,150
His son, Selim, was adopted.

280
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,200
He doesn't carry the blood of the FÃ¼hrer President.

281
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,440
A monster or a human...

282
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,260
Whichever it may be, now it's easier to drag him out of his position.

283
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,310
We'll get information out of this guy, first.

284
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,300
Let's take his philosopher's stone, too.

285
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,590
I may be able to use it to heal my man.

286
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,300
Hey, hey, hey!

287
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,270
Lan Fan lost her arm to obtain that!

288
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,610
We're taking that back to Xing!

289
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,610
Hang on! We've been searching for a way to get our bodies back for a long time, too!

290
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,110
I won't allow you to take it for yourself!

291
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,800
That's right.

292
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,950
Lin, you're an illegal immigrant.

293
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,990
I can't stand this!

294
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,930
Mustang, I'm going home.

295
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,450
Mustang...

296
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,580
Colonel Mustang... who killed Lust!

297
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,100
Roy Mustang!!!

298
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,130
What...

299
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,580
What is hidden behind the smile of goodwill and kindness?

300
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,750
One must be discreet in order to dig further.

301
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,200
They move forward and run about, not knowing what to do.

302
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,590
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

303
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,880
Episode 24, Inside the Belly.

304
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:25,100
If you leap in carelessly, all that awaits is a sea of darkness.
