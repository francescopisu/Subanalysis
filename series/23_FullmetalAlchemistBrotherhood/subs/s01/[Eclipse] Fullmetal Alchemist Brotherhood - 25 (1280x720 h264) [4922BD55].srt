1
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,530
Hey! Anyone here?!

2
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,950
Answer me, Al!!

3
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,470
Where the hell am I?!

4
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,450
Dammit...

5
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,830
Lin!

6
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,590
Stupid prince!

7
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,210
Who are you calling stupid?

8
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,310
Lin!

9
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,800
Is that any way to speak to a prince?

10
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,710
You're safe!

11
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,100
You...

12
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,050
What?

13
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,060
You're not actually Envy disguised as Lin, are you?

14
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,800
Come on...

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,740
Do you want me to recite the entire room service menu?!

16
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,150
Okay, you're not fake.

17
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,360
You're not a fake either, are you? You pea--

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,130
Who are you calling a pea-sized runt?!

19
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,820
Okay, you pass.

20
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,930
But seriously, where are we?

21
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,960
If I recall, we were swallowed up by Gluttony, and...

22
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,350
Yeah, but there's no way his stomach could be this big.

23
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,570
But...

24
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,260
Look.

25
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,780
It's the deserted house we were just in.

26
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,140
And this...

27
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,020
The Lieutenant's car?

28
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,020
I think it's safe to assume that all this fire came from the Colonel.

29
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,900
Yeah.

30
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,190
Which means...

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,420
...we're really inside Gluttony's stomach?

32
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
No idea.

33
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,940
But I can at least tell you we're not in Heaven.

34
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,080
Let me see this.

35
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,370
What's up?

36
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,880
Lin, look at this.

37
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,880
Isn't that Al's?

38
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,820
If we can only find his arm,
that means Al wasn't swallowed with us.

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,890
Thank goodness.

40
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,780
I bet Al is worried sick.

41
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,240
We've got no idea where we are, either.

42
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,990
Now's the perfect time for them to awaken!
My telepathic abilities!

43
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,120
Elric telepathy!

44
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,910
Hear me, Brother!

45
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,620
Have fun with that.

46
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,970
I see a lot of buildings and corpses,
but they're all from different times...

47
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,840
Is there even an exit to this place?

48
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,200
I don't know. And if there isn't, I'll make one.

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,620
And where are you going to make one?

50
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,880
All right, throw that stick in.

51
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,930
I see what you're up to.

52
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,470
There.

53
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,110
I don't think it's hit the bottom yet...

54
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,440
A wall! Let's look for a wall!

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,620
Yeah! No matter how big the place is, we'll eventually reach the edge if we just keep moving forward!

56
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,790
We should be able to find the exit, too!

57
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,040
I couldn't find her...

58
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,120
Where did you go, Shao May?

59
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,090
Maybe it got eaten up by a stray dog or something?

60
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,330
A stray?

61
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,350
That was a joke! I'm sorry!

62
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,350
She...

63
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,330
Shao May is a panda who has had a minor disorder since birth, which prevented her from getting any bigger.

64
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,360
I found her after she was abandoned by her parents...

65
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,220
...and we've been raised like sisters ever since.

66
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:13,870
My clan, the Chang, barely has any authority in Xing, making us one of the weakest clans.

67
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,450
Maybe that's why.

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,210
How can I put it... we were both attracted to each other because of our similar standings...

69
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,640
Yes. It may have been sympathy at first...

70
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,740
...but we were raised like family, carried the same burdens...

71
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,970
...and she eventually became someone irreplaceable to me.

72
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,840
There are lots of things I was able to go through, just because she was there.

73
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,220
I wouldn't have been able to cross the desert without her.

74
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,970
I don't think you really had to cross it in the first place.

75
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,890
Why would you do all this for something uncertain like immortality?

76
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:19,050
If I don't bring back the method of immortality...
If I don't present it to the Emperor and earn his favor...

77
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,220
My clan will die out at this rate.

78
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,360
That's why I came here with her...

79
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,790
With her...

80
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,020
Shao May!

81
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,020
Stop crying! I'm begging you!

82
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,490
Master.

83
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,130
We still have some time before the sun rises.

84
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,330
There shouldn't be alot of military police on-duty at this time.

85
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:49,960
Huh?!

86
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,850
You'll help me look for her?

87
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,950
You're such a nice person.

88
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,440
His people died out in that civil war.

89
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:10,330
So maybe he's empathizing with you and your weak clan?

90
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,280
What's wrong? Aren't you going to look for her?

91
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,700
Okay! I'm coming!

92
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,380
Having to walk in all this really drains your stamina, doesn't it...

93
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,140
Yeah. And no signs of an exit, either...

94
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,250
I'm so hungry...

95
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,930
If we manage to get out, I'll let you eat all you want.

96
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,000
Eat all you want, sleep all you want, and...

97
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Lin?

98
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,530
I can't take this anymore...

99
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,750
Come on, giving up already?

100
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,370
You're pathetic.

101
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,540
You going to collapse here, too?!

102
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,540
Get up! Walk!

103
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,870
I'm leaving you behind, dammit!

104
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,550
Then go...

105
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,830
You weakling!

106
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,300
I'm going!

107
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,120
I can't die here.

108
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,940
I'm really going to go ahead!

109
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,810
Not joking, you know!

110
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,910
Didn't you say you were going to go ahead?

111
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,260
I definitely don't want to die with you.

112
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,430
But you've got people waiting for you, too, don't you?

113
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,040
Hey, if you have the strength to talk, then...

114
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,270
If only we had something to eat...

115
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,230
Did you know, Lin?

116
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,370
Leather goods are edible.

117
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,280
Should be done by now...

118
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,820
Here.

119
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,500
You don't have athlete's foot, do you?

120
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,460
Do I look like I do, dumbass?!

121
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,460
What a meal.

122
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,800
Sorry about all this.

123
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,250
What do you mean?

124
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,470
If you hadn't tried to save me back then...

125
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,400
Forget it.

126
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,390
This is nothing compared to the training I went through as a kid.

127
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,440
It's kind of annoying we don't know where we are,

128
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,020
but we can search for the exit now that we've had our beans.

129
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,160
An optimist, are you?

130
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,010
I'm just relentless about staying alive.

131
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,750
If I even thought about giving up,
I'd get beaten and scolded by Al.

132
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,040
What's wrong?

133
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,970
Something's coming.

134
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,930
That's...

135
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,210
Oh, it's you guys.

136
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,260
Envy, just as I thought!

137
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,590
Please, tell us where the exit is!

138
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,370
That's pathetic, Edward Elric!

139
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,080
Shut up! Humans would do anything to live!

140
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,600
Despicable!

141
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,920
Unfortunately...

142
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,240
Shut up!

143
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,920
You're despicable!

144
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,600
...there's no exit.

145
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,960
Shut up! Shut up!

146
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,790
You really had to do that, didn't you?

147
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,520
Even I got dragged in because of you.

148
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,990
Where are we?

149
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,530
Are we really inside Gluttony's stomach?

150
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,280
We're inside his stomach, and at the same time, we're not.

151
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,150
Fullmetal ru-

152
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,540
I mean, Fullmetal Alchemist, shouldn't you have realized where we are by now?

153
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,350
Now that you mention it,
when I was sucked in by Gluttony...

154
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,380
I recognize that sensation...

155
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,780
Don't you?

156
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,630
Since you've gone through it in the past.

157
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,020
The Gate of Truth!

158
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,980
But this isn't how it was.

159
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,300
It was all white, and there was a gate...

160
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,470
Oh, so that's how the real one is.

161
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,360
"Real"?

162
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,620
Gluttony is the result of Father's unsuccessful attempt at recreating the Gate of Truth.

163
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,250
What... did you say?

164
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:38,130
A poorly-made Gate of Truth that even Father couldn't get right.

165
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,880
I guess it's safe to call this place the crevice between reality and the truth.

166
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,760
The crevice?!

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,290
There's no exit, nor a way to get out of here.

168
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,370
All we can do now is to wait until
the span of our lives comes to an end.

169
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,020
All we can do...

170
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,070
...is wait until we die here.

171
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,280
No...

172
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,920
No way in hell I'll let that happen!

173
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,710
Don't screw around with me!

174
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,870
Envy!

175
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,040
Hey!

176
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,770
There's no exit?

177
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,050
We're going to die here?

178
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,770
Hey... Hey...

179
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,820
Hang on.

180
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,430
If I die here, what will Al do?

181
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,340
I promised him...

182
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,440
I promised him we'd get our bodies back together.

183
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,220
Dammit!

184
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,820
Who the hell is this Father guy that tried to recreate the Gate?!

185
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,680
FÃ¼hrer President Bradley?!

186
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,270
Bradley?

187
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,610
Not even close.

188
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,620
He's just a Homunculus.

189
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,860
I knew it...

190
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,130
Research Laboratory 5.

191
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,250
Using people's lives.

192
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,130
Philosopher's stones.

193
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,770
Homunculus.

194
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,680
If the FÃ¼hrer President is also a Homunculus, then that means it was you guys who started the Ishbal conflict...

195
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,270
Ishbal?!

196
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,130
That was the most amusing task I'd ever been given!

197
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,270
Do you know what started that civil war in the first place?

198
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:26,320
If I recall, an army officer accidentally killed an Ishbalan child...

199
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,830
That's right.

200
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,830
I'm the one who shot the kid dead.

201
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,020
Umm...

202
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,540
I heard about Ishbal from Yoki.

203
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,100
That felt amazing.

204
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,160
Watching the civil war spread indefinitely from a single bullet.

205
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,660
Man, it was really refreshing!

206
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,790
Oh, by the way.

207
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:26,970
I disguised myself as a moderate officer who was against the military intervention of Ishbal.

208
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,550
Hear this!

209
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,560
He couldn't even give an excuse for it and was sentenced to death by court-martial!

210
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,740
Humans are so easy to manipulate.

211
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,360
So it was you...

212
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,900
The one who shot an innocent child dead...

213
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,660
The one who destroyed our hometown... The one who drove away the Ishbalans...

214
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,950
The one who created Scar, a vengeful murderer...

215
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,000
The root cause...

216
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,460
...of what killed Winry's parents...

217
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,690
You bastard!!!

218
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,130
What?

219
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,180
He didn't give an inch...

220
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,260
You brats want to fight?

221
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,010
Ed, pull back!

222
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,400
We're all going to die here anyway.

223
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,820
I'll show you something cool as a final gift.

224
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,230
Did you look beneath his feet when you were fighting him in the woods?

225
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,070
No.

226
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,640
That means...

227
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,900
He may not look like it, but he weighs quite a bit.

228
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,490
His true form must be...

229
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,940
Dammit...

230
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,140
What the hell is this?!

231
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,380
How could that be a Homunculus...

232
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,480
An artificial human?!

233
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,500
What...

234
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,050
...should I do?

235
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,150
Hell if I know.

236
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,770
What should I do... I'll...

237
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,820
I'll get yelled at by Father!

238
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,600
Father? You have a dad?

239
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,510
I do.

240
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,010
The one who created the Homunculi?

241
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,900
Yes.

242
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,960
What happens to the mass you swallow...

243
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,730
Is there a trick to it?

244
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,030
Think... Think!

245
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,030
We decided we'd get our bodies back together!

246
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,630
I can't give up here!

247
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,470
Gluttony, take me to your Father.

248
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,270
Okay.

249
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,600
You're a human sacrifice, right?

250
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,610
Y-Yeah, that's right. I'm a human sacrifice!

251
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,690
What the heck does he mean by that?

252
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:43,420
The only ones currently confirmed as such are the Elric brothers.

253
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,070
What about Doctor Marcoh?

254
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,430
You would think that it's about time...

255
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,880
There's Kimblee, too.

256
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,260
He doesn't have the nerve to open the Gate.

257
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,970
Well, what about Mustang, the other sacrifice candidate?

258
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,940
The FÃ¼hrer President wants to have a long chat with him.

259
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,520
Why are you letting me live?

260
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,420
To make you understand where you stand.

261
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,410
Since when has the military been beholden to the Homunculi?

262
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,340
It has been set up that way ever since this country was first reformed.

263
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,170
So you've been smiling with glee, watching us struggle.

264
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,090
Your hands that were shaking during Brigadier General Hughes' funeral...

265
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,050
Was that just an act?!

266
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,810
Everyone makes too big a deal out of the death of a soldier.

267
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:48,960
They should have known his military uniform might become his burial attire.

268
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,870
Brigadier General Hughes' daughter was so annoying during the funeral.

269
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,450
She really got on my nerves.

270
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,580
If I recall, you also have a child.

271
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,130
How could you say such a thing?

272
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,640
Are you referring to Selim?

273
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,380
He's a good boy.

274
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,230
I wonder how he'd react if he were to find out that his father, a man of utmost standing, is a Homunculus.

275
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,550
Are you trying to blackmail me?

276
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,730
It is futile.

277
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,470
He won't become my weakness.

278
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,480
But you're different.

279
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,480
She'll become your weakness.

280
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,360
Lieutenant Hawkeye!

281
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,630
What is it?

282
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,490
Someone from the personnel bureau dropped by earlier.

283
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,800
I was transferred to Southern Headquarters.

284
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,200
What?!

285
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,750
Not just me, either.

286
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,710
Second Lieutenant Breda was transferred to Western Headquarters,

287
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,460
and Warrant Officer Falman was transferred to Northern Headquarters.

288
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,600
You're Lieutenant Hawkeye, correct?

289
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,360
Yes, sir.

290
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,190
I'm Yakovleff, from the personnel bureau.

291
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,960
Personnel bureau...

292
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,700
I'm Shtolhi, an assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President.

293
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,650
Take this.

294
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,660
Is this a transfer order?

295
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,000
Correct.

296
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,580
Please allow me to review it.

297
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,420
This is...

298
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,750
What is with this insane personnel change?!

299
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,300
Where were you assigned?

300
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,180
"Starting tomorrow, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye will be stationed at Central Headquarters..."

301
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,280
"...as an assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President."

302
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,310
And that's how it is.

303
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,310
Colonel Roy Mustang.

304
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,760
How delightful!

305
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,150
Damn, this isn't delightful at all.

306
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,070
Not the least bit.

307
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,400
Lin!

308
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,700
Ed!

309
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,500
Can you make a weapon?

310
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,750
Leave it to me!

311
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,930
We're in a sea of blood.

312
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,420
There's plenty of iron here!

313
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,190
You have bad taste.

314
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,630
How so? I think it looks cool.

315
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,070
Can you do it?

316
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,900
I don't know...

317
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,580
Look at that figure.

318
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,430
And to top it off, that earlier attack broke a few of my ribs.

319
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,590
Same here.

320
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:07,470
But I won't be satisfied until I give him a good beatdown!

321
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,870
Gluttony, are you sure we're going the right way?

322
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,440
Yeah.

323
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,270
But this way... we're headed toward...

324
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,440
Your Father is in Central?!

325
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,390
Is the soul acting in the shadows a guidepost to the future?

326
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,330
Fight, boy,

327
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,460
if you are to see the truth and discover the depth of darkness.

328
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,930
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

329
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,710
Episode 26, Reunion.

330
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,180
I won't say farewell...

331
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,690
...because I believe we'll meet again.
