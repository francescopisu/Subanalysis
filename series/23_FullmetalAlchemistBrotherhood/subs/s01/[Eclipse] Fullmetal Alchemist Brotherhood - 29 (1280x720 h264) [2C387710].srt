1
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,300
Hey, where the hell are you taking us?

2
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,400
Get in.

3
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,100
This is...

4
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,990
Military Headquarters?!

5
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,480
What does this mean?!

6
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,510
Hey.

7
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,320
You guys are filthy.

8
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,460
I wouldn't have dreamed the Homunculi's hideout was under Headquarters...

9
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,590
So it means that the army is also associated with them, not just the FÃ¼hrer President.

10
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,420
But I've got something good to tell you, too.

11
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,900
Really?! You really found my body?!

12
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah.

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,260
Although you told me,
"You're not my soul, so I can't come with you."

14
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,810
Great, so my body still exists!

15
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,520
Awesome! Awesome!

16
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Okay!

17
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,610
This just means we're one step closer to our goal.

18
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,420
Hey, why do you still have that cat?

19
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,750
Oh, her?

20
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,070
Actually, inside of me, there's...

21
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,740
What?!

22
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,450
That midget?!

23
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,510
Brother! Stop being so loud!

24
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,790
Hurry and put your underwear on!

25
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,040
What are you guys doing?! Hurry up!

26
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,000
No!!!

27
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,230
Geez, why the hell did you have to bring her?

28
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,080
There was no other choice. She's injured.

29
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,780
Hey!

30
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,980
I'm leaving the rest to Wrath. Go in.

31
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,470
Wrath?

32
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,050
Wrath...

33
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,240
FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley?!

34
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,330
Colonel!

35
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,630
What the hell happened?

36
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,040
Quite a bit.

37
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,340
Sergeant Fuery was transferred to the South, Warrant Officer Falman to the North,

38
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,340
and Second Lieutenant Breda to the West.

39
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,730
And Lieutenant Hawkeye is going to be an assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President.

40
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,040
What the hell...

41
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,350
That's no more than taking hostages.

42
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,360
Have a seat.

43
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,360
Right now, it's just us and the FÃ¼hrer President in this room.

44
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,990
And he only has one weapon; a sword.

45
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,830
Yet, he's still confident he can beat all three of us?

46
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,340
FÃ¼hrer President!

47
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,780
You came to visit me in the hospital once, right?

48
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,590
I was completely fooled.

49
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,300
"Don't meddle in things.
Think of the entire army as your enemy."

50
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,610
That's what I told you.

51
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,780
You are all important to us.

52
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,480
You don't need to know about the minor details,

53
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,920
but behave until the time comes.

54
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,860
As long as you keep that promise, we won't harm you.

55
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,740
And when that time comes, what'll happen to the civilians who aren't "human sacrifices" like us?

56
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,700
I just told you. You don't need to know the minor details,

57
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,500
Fullmetal Alchemist.

58
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,490
"Fullmetal Alchemist", eh?

59
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,770
I chose to become a dog of the military in order to get my body back.

60
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,850
But the State Alchemist Institution itself was probably created to pick out these sacrifices.

61
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,230
If I'm going to be used by you guys again on top of that...

62
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,450
I quit my job as a State Alchemist!

63
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Your proof of being a dog is covered in blood.

64
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,450
Whatever you guys are planning, I'll put an end to it.

65
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,020
I'll tell the other alchemists, and...

66
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,710
What was her name again?

67
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,880
Oh, that's right. Winry Rockbell.

68
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,290
Born in Resembool.

69
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,300
A childhood friend of yours
and someone who is practically family.

70
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,640
A skilled automail mechanic.

71
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,470
She currently works at Rush Valley,
and she's loved by her customers and friends.

72
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,540
She's a good, obedient girl.

73
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,980
Lay a finger on her and see what happens! People around her, too!

74
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,360
So, what are you going to do?

75
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,070
If you still want to quit, then I'll cut her down.

76
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,070
Excellent.

77
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,090
Excuse me...

78
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,830
We get the idea.

79
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,230
So, umm...

80
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:54,350
Like before, please let us continue to search for clues
for getting our bodies back while being under surveillance.

81
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,990
Please.

82
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,390
Very well.

83
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,980
As long as you don't interfere with our plan.

84
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,010
What will you do, Colonel Mustang?

85
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,110
You're not going to tell me that you plan to resign from the military too, are you?

86
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,780
Let's see... even if I became a dog of the military, I'd rather not become a loser.

87
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:20,290
Either way, because of my ambition, I won't be able to take off this uniform or get rid of this. For now, at least.

88
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,670
Very well.

89
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,290
You all may leave.

90
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,220
May I ask you one thing, sir?

91
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,570
What is it, Colonel?

92
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,640
Are you the one who killed Hughes?

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,180
No, it was not me.

94
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,430
Then who?

95
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,940
You said "one thing", did you not?

96
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,900
Please excuse me.

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,410
Oh. Wait a moment, Alphonse.

98
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,780
U-Umm... Is there something...

99
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,680
No, you may leave now.

100
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,510
That was so close!

101
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,800
A sword just went right over my head...

102
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,990
Oh yeah, Colonel.

103
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,760
Money. Lend me some change.

104
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,350
What's this all of a sudden?

105
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,990
Don't worry about it!

106
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,640
Man, this is all you got?

107
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,310
What are you, a thief?!

108
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,400
Oh well.

109
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Later!

110
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,900
H-Hey!

111
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,490
Sorry, Colonel!

112
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,820
We'll report everything later!

113
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,520
What in the world are they up to?

114
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,090
Oh no, the Lieutenant!

115
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,080
Lieute-

116
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,980
Is something the matter, Colonel?

117
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,840
You don't look very well.

118
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,960
Can you blame me for feeling sick after seeing a musclehead when I was expecting to see a woman?

119
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,210
Colonel!

120
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,100
Lieutenant.

121
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,380
Is everything okay?

122
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,090
Oh, my apologies.

123
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,360
Lieutenant Hawkeye, just returning from the restroom, sir.

124
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,120
I accepted Major Armstrong's kindness and had him take my place for a short time.

125
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,920
Thank you, Major.

126
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,370
No problem at all.

127
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,310
You didn't run away?

128
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,620
Who's the one who told me
to never give up no matter what?

129
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,600
Don't regret later that you didn't run away, Lieutenant.

130
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,370
Like I will after all this time...

131
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,820
Hello?

132
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,980
Ed? What's with the sudden call?

133
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,040
Did you break your automail again?

134
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,060
No!

135
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,630
Hey, are you okay?

136
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,810
Are you doing well?

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,740
Anything new in your life?

138
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,100
You're not being stalked by anyone, are you?

139
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,320
Ed...

140
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,310
What is it?!

141
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,820
You're being creepy.

142
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,570
What did you say?!

143
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:05,010
I mean, it's rare enough for you to call, and it turns out you're worried about me?

144
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,080
Geez, there's something wrong here.
I bet it's going to snow tonight or something.

145
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,110
Hey! Do you have any idea how much I-

146
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,960
Hey, thanks.

147
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,650
I'm happy you called.

148
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,720
Thanks.

149
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,170
S-Sure.

150
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,250
So you're really okay, right?

151
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,350
Got it. Bye.

152
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,010
Good, she was fine...

153
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,470
It's your excitable nature that lets people take advantage of you.

154
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,510
Ling!

155
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,650
I told you, I'm Greed.

156
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,680
What the hell do you want?!

157
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,010
Your buddy asked me to give you this.

158
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,940
Ling did?

159
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,910
This is in Xing's language, huh...

160
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,500
What's it say?

161
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,410
I don't know. Can't read it.

162
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,160
He wants you to give it to the woman waiting for him.

163
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,060
Lan Fa-

164
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,000
You're not planning on following us and killing her, are you?

165
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,220
I'm not that low.

166
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,550
Besides, I don't like fighting girls.

167
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,430
I don't lie.

168
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,770
Later. Be sure to give it to her.

169
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,270
Hey, Ling!

170
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,590
I'm Greed.

171
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,130
Who the hell was that?

172
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,290
What reason did he have to start the civil war
when it would ruin this country?

173
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,450
Who is it?

174
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,260
Is someone up there?

175
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,850
You're injured.

176
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,880
Could you come down?

177
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,380
I'd like to know what's going on outside.

178
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,600
It's fine; the guard won't be coming again for a while.

179
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,740
I'm also a doctor. I'll tend your wounds.

180
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,300
An Ishbalan, huh?

181
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,780
That scar on your forehead...

182
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,210
Don't tell me... You're Scar?!

183
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,280
Who the hell are you?

184
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,960
What are you doing here?

185
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,220
Oh, God!

186
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,470
I'm...

187
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,980
I'm also an alchemist who assisted in the Ishbal Extermination!

188
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,360
She'll be fine. Nothing life-threatening.

189
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,100
She'll get better as long as she gets some rest.

190
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,480
Thank goodness.

191
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,950
"Thank goodness" my ass!

192
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,490
Giving me more patients by the day!

193
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,230
Both my bed and sofa are occupied!

194
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,000
Where the hell am I supposed to sleep, huh?!

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

196
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,890
Besides, two patients in my house at once?!

197
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,730
Alphonse.

198
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,890
Lan Fan!

199
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,320
You shouldn't be up!

200
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,490
Is... Is the young master not with you?

201
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,700
I-It's fine. He's alive.

202
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,180
I have a message from him.

203
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,980
Lan Fan?

204
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,070
He says... He says he's obtained a philosopher's stone...

205
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,630
With this, our clan is...

206
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,950
That's right! I must return to my country immediately and tell my people!

207
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,680
Where is he? Where is the young master?

208
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,880
What? Why won't you speak?

209
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,250
Don't tell me something happened to him!

210
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,150
Answer me, Alphonse!

211
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,550
Where is the young master?!

212
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,990
How is your body feeling, Greed?

213
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,910
So you're Wrath.

214
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,230
I'm feeling fine.

215
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,310
Did you hear? This body belongs to a prince of Xing.

216
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,780
He wanted power that would help him become Emperor, and thus accepted me.

217
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,460
He's a really interesting guy.

218
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,090
Him and I once had a discussion on what it means to be a true king.

219
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:20,090
He said something like, "A King exists for his people. Without his people, there is no King."

220
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,180
What an idiot. He gave in to greed and lost everything.

221
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,730
Shut up!

222
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,970
Don't underestimate us humans!

223
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,370
That's how it is.

224
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,180
He's vigilantly watching for a chance to take over.

225
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,560
He's even planning on taking control of a monster?

226
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,160
How greedy can these humans get?

227
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,030
The FÃ¼hrer President is a Homunculus?!

228
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:01,050
It's always been my honor to fight for the weak citizens of this country.

229
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,620
Many people feel the same,
believe in the military, and sign up.

230
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,070
And yet, the military itself...

231
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,480
Why not resign?

232
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,560
With your personality, being a soldier will only hurt you.

233
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,440
Sir! This is wrong!

234
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,340
Are you going against military command?!

235
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,760
Whatever! Call for a replacement State Alchemist!

236
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,420
I ran from battle during Ishbal...

237
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,600
...because I thought what the army was doing was wrong.

238
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,170
But instead, I should have fought against it instead of running away.

239
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,440
Since then, not a day has passed that I didn't feel ashamed for bending my principles and fleeing.

240
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:01,850
And this time, if the army itself is the battlefield, how can I run away again?

241
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,400
What are you going to do now, Colonel?

242
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,610
I told the FÃ¼hrer President I wouldn't quit because I still have an ambition.

243
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:19,610
The fact the FÃ¼hrer President revealed he's a Homunculus means that even if he was to be defeated,

244
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,290
there's still someone else in the shadows.

245
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,500
I'm being tested.

246
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,460
Don't you think that's an honor?

247
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,960
You're being pretty calm about this.

248
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,210
I don't know if I'd say that.

249
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,470
It was the same when I fought that other Homunculus, Lust, but...

250
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,390
Although people accuse me of being a "weapon" and a "monster", when fighting against real monsters...

251
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,350
...I truly feel as though I'm nothing but an ordinary human.

252
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,900
I see.

253
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,900
So the young master took in the stone.

254
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,670
Sorry.

255
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,950
If only we had been able to stop him...

256
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,020
You don't need to apologize.

257
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,930
I am only mad at myself for not being able to fulfill my duty as a bodyguard.

258
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,420
So...

259
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,010
So the young master is still inside this Greed person, right?

260
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,920
Alphonse, I want a replacement arm. And quick.

261
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,100
But... it'll take some time...

262
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,520
Please introduce me to an automail mechanic! Please!

263
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,210
Okay.

264
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,100
I will soon.

265
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,330
But you have to get better before I do that.

266
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,050
Let's get you something to eat from Dr. Nox...

267
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,760
You can get up now?

268
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,040
Let's see... was your name May Chan?

269
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,040
May?!

270
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,670
What?!

271
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,130
As expected of the Yao Clan's watchdog.

272
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,260
And you're... the Chan Clan's successor.

273
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,380
Indeed.

274
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,050
I'm the 17th Princess of Xing, May Chan.

275
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,610
Wait... um...

276
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,680
If you're here in this country, it means... you're after immortality, as well.

277
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,440
I'll never let you and your clan have it!

278
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,730
You won't even be able to find it!

279
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,740
Hang on!

280
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,470
I don't really get it, but let's play nice!

281
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,410
Don't interfere with our country's affairs!

282
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,410
Don't interfere with our country's affairs!

283
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,160
Don't underestimate me just because I'm injured.

284
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Same to you!

285
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,250
What the hell are you two doing?!

286
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,880
Patients should be asleep in bed!

287
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,130
Don't interfere with our country's...

288
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,510
Hell if I care about your country's affairs, moron!

289
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,300
Geez!

290
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,100
Patients are patients, no matter what country they're in!

291
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,630
You're planning on messing up my house even more?

292
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,710
Hey...

293
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,980
You've heard about cases where unknown pathogens mysteriously appear in a doctor's house and kill everyone...

294
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,530
...right?!

295
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,690
This place really is a mess.

296
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,880
Doesn't he have anyone to clean for him?

297
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,580
Doctor, look.

298
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,710
Oh, so that's where it was.

299
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,850
Wait! Isn't this a picture of your family?!

300
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,180
It's my divorced wife and my son.

301
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,060
What?

302
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,160
I'm free to do whatever I want with my stuff!

303
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,590
Have a cup of coffee after this is all cleaned up.

304
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,150
I'm so glad you came!

305
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,000
Seriously, look at this.

306
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,370
I was at a loss about what to do.

307
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,250
Huh? Now that I think about it, I can use alchemy again.

308
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,900
Very nice work! This is all for the repairs.

309
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,290
But seriously, State Alchemists are something else.

310
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,830
On a totally different level from other alchemists.

311
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,530
The thing is, we asked nearby alchemists to help us this morning.

312
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,970
They were completely useless.

313
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,790
They came to the scene all full of themselves, and as soon as they were getting started, they told us it wasn't working.

314
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,850
In the morning...

315
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,970
That's around the time we were underground.

316
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,390
Mr. Alchemist!

317
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,580
Thanks!

318
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,800
Thanks.

319
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,160
Can I really believe what Envy said?

320
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:47,140
That those people are only made of energy, without a body or a soul...

321
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,130
Pull yourself together! Think about the future, not the past!

322
00:20:52,910 --> 00:21:00,030
But at that time, other alchemists aside from Al and I were unable to use alchemy.

323
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,910
But that midget and Scar could.

324
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,860
What does this mean?

325
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,920
Alchemy that's different from ours...

326
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,110
If I could find out the secret behind it,

327
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:22,790
there may be a way to get Al's body back and fight against that geezer without using a philosopher's stone...

328
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,890
I have to return this to the Lieutenant.

329
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,110
They made me help them.

330
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,740
I created philosopher's stones and took the lives of many Ishbalans.

331
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:23,650
And now, I'm on the verge of being forced to work on an experiment that would cause more deaths.

332
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,130
So...

333
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,020
So please, I'm begging you! Kill me!

334
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,380
Right here, right now!

335
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,640
I'm going to get back at them with death!

336
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:40,350
Right now, in my eyes, you appear as God...

337
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,020
You haven't told me everything about Ishbal yet!

338
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,940
What the hell did you bastards do there?!

339
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,570
Tell me everything, Marcoh!

340
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,630
Before my right hand destroys you!!!

341
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,290
Force. Never-ending violence.

342
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,870
The earth is drowned in blood.

343
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,880
The air is choked with the stench of burnt flesh.

344
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,050
Ishbal...

345
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,760
A detestable memory.

346
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,220
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

347
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,850
Episode 30, Ishbal Extermination.

348
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,530
I will recite the truth.

349
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,560
Although I'm the only one left.
