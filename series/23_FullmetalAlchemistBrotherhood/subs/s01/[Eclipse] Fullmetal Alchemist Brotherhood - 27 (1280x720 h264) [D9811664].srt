1
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,270
Come on!

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,160
Drink up.

3
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,310
Pinako...

4
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,040
Mind if I join you?

5
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,800
It's nice to let loose like this every once in a while.

6
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,320
You probably think we're the most carefree people on earth, don't you?

7
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,100
But who can blame us?

8
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,750
This country's always at war.

9
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,840
And now there's something going on over in Ishval... is that all this country is good for?

10
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,150
They never learn.

11
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,120
Humans are foolish, pitiful creatures.

12
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,240
With Ishbal and other riots...
the East sure have their hands full.

13
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,930
Not just the East, but there are riots and border wars
sparking up in the North and the West.

14
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,430
Skirmishes are still ongoing on the border with Aerugo to the south and Creta to the west.

15
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,240
And there's still the great nation of Drachma up north, too.

16
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,610
Mountains of corpses everywhere, huh...

17
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,190
We may even get a coup soon...

18
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,740
Such a scary country to be in...

19
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,100
This country's been so military-focused ever since King Bradley became the Führer President.

20
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,630
Hey, let's dance!

21
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,880
You're quite the stud, Hohenheim!

22
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,580
Why don't you go dance by yourself?

23
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,640
But that's no fun!

24
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,050
This man isn't fancy enough to dance.

25
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,770
Come on, go dance with those girls over there.

26
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,860
I think that's about how old they were...

27
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,220
...when they started to even think about something like human transmutation.

28
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,170
Why didn't you take a stand as
their father and say something to them?

29
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,810
Even if I did, it wouldn't change the fact they'd have to repent for their sins.

30
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,020
You're harsh.

31
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,170
A sin is a sin.

32
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,090
Dammit!!!

33
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,970
They took it away!!!

34
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,360
Help me... someone...

35
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,750
Mom... Mom...

36
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,010
No way... No...

37
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,940
This isn't...

38
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,940
This isn't what I wanted!!!

39
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,890
Al... Alphonse...

40
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,020
Alphonse! Alphonse!

41
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,560
Because of me...

42
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,030
Alphonse!!!

43
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,110
Dammit... Dammit!!!

44
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,360
Give him back... He's my little brother...

45
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,130
Whether it be an arm or a leg...

46
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,440
Or even my heart! You can take it!

47
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,580
So give him back...

48
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,920
He's my only brother!!!

49
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,530
A heavenly stone that destroyed Xerxes overnight.

50
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,630
If we had this, we could get your body back...

51
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,520
Doctor, what exactly were you ordered to research?

52
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,270
The Philosopher's Stone.

53
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,820
You mustn't desire such a thing.

54
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,920
That is the Devil's research.

55
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,910
You'll see Hell if you study it.

56
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,910
"The Devil's research"...

57
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,450
"Something you mustn't desire"...

58
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,790
I resent you, Dr. Marcoh...

59
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,460
The ingredients of philosopher's stones...

60
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,920
...are live humans.

61
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,950
Fragile beings, don't you think?

62
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,460
They cower at the darkness and don't try to stand up to it.

63
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,150
And instead, they try to forget it temporarily and try to escape from reality.

64
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,260
Humans are such weak creatures.

65
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:36,470
Well, let's have them be of some use
to us as a precious resource.

66
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,090
Eh, Hohenheim?

67
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,120
"You may be able to reach
the real truth that is beyond truth"...

68
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,700
What the heck is this?

69
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,460
Could it be what's used to transmute philosopher's stones?

70
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,550
Let's see how good you are.

71
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,880
Looks like that arm saved your life!

72
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,260
But my beloved sword even slices through steel!

73
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,540
Brother!

74
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,050
It's shameful, but we lost.

75
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,400
You're not going to say something like, "Hey, we're actually a trio", are ya?

76
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,380
We won't, we won't.

77
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,740
Just destroy us already, boy.

78
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,140
Spare me from having to murder someone.

79
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,490
You consider us human?

80
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:14,030
If I didn't accept you two as human,
it would mean I'm doing the same to my brother, too.

81
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,000
My little brother is human.

82
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,700
And so are you two.

83
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,800
That's why I don't want to kill you.

84
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,630
Brother?

85
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,180
Us two have been stealing, destroying,
and murdering ever since we came of age.

86
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,600
And we're being treated as humans for the first time, after being turned into this?

87
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,250
Interesting.

88
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,550
I'll tell you everything as a parting gift, boy.

89
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,860
The one who created the philosopher's stone and told us to guard this place is...

90
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,110
That was close.

91
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,830
You can't be saying out things like that, 48.

92
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,950
You're so annoying, dumbass!

93
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,770
You guys were about to kill a precious sacrifice!

94
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,980
Don't you understand?!

95
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,640
Who the hell are you two?!

96
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,650
What plan?!

97
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,930
What do you mean by sacrifice?!

98
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,190
You're a human sacrifice, right?

99
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,180
Y-Yeah, that's right. I'm a human sacrifice!

100
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,270
What the heck does he mean by that?

101
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,690
...and perhaps their master, too... may also be a suitable sacrifice

102
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,670
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,620
You're a candidate for sacrifice,

104
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,220
but you're going to die here.

105
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,100
I've been thinking for some time..

106
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,620
...as to what you mean by "human sacrifice"...

107
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,000
...and about what you are trying to make me do..

108
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,300
Riots throughout Lior.

109
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,820
The ingredients of philosopher's stone are humans...

110
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,190
What we did in Ishval...

111
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,190
Whoa now, who's the mastermind behind all of this?

112
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,260
What you are trying to do right now...

113
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,900
...is create a giant transmutation circle, using this country and its people.

114
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,300
And the purpose of that...

115
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,850
...is to create a philosopher's stone. Am I right

116
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,550
Could it be that you actually knew?

117
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,560
Hohenheim.

118
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,020
Why didn't you tell anyone?

119
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,820
Hohenheim!

120
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,600
Even if I had, would that have changed anything?

121
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,680
What?

122
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,630
I've been watching them for some time.

123
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,360
The humans who continue to repeat the same mistakes without end.

124
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,230
And the same humans who had to helplessly escape from their actions.

125
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,020
Humans are fragile creatures.

126
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,760
I thought I told you.

127
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,480
The philosopher's stone is my core.

128
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,480
I'm a homunculus.

129
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,830
You've heard of them, have you?

130
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,220
Humans that were created artificially.

131
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,440
That's what I am.

132
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,240
We're all going to die here anyway.

133
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,620
I'll show you something cool as a final gift.

134
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,210
Can I eat him?

135
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,140
Mustang!!!

136
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,030
The monster was keeping another monster inside its belly!

137
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,980
It swallowed everything around him!

138
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,480
So even something like this is created...

139
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,980
...by alchemy...

140
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,490
Who are you, old man?

141
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,260
Just as you have an ultimate shield,

142
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,090
I have an ultimate eye.

143
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,650
Oh, now I get it, Hughes...

144
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,520
When you said that the army was in danger...

145
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,030
...you didn't mean a crisis was approaching the army...

146
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,440
You meant that the army itself was in a crisis.

147
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,220
Father? You have a dad?

148
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,050
I do.

149
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,930
The one who created the Homunculi?

150
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,750
Yes.

151
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,510
Humans don't have an ultimate spear or an ultimate shield.

152
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,710
Nevertheless, the most trivial things get the best of them, making them unable to get back up.

153
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,740
What can creatures like that do against homunculi?

154
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,610
Even so, we won't give up!

155
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,540
We wouldn't give up for the world!

156
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,600
That's also a human trait, isn't it?

157
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,650
How can you even move with that wound?!

158
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,420
I sealed it with fire!

159
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,640
Although I almost fainted a few times.

160
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,890
No matter how many times you try, you can't win.

161
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,690
How about you tell me the secret now?

162
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,340
Thanks for that.

163
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,580
The blood that was all up in my head went away, and I can think clearly now.

164
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,890
You're still going to resist?

165
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,210
Let this put you to sleep!

166
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,650
This body comes with many inconveniences.

167
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,830
But inconveniences don't make me miserable!

168
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,100
There's no reason for you to pity me!

169
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,410
My life was put together with alchemy by my brother.

170
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,380
If I deny myself, that would mean that I'm denying brother, along with alchemy.

171
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,530
I believe in the potential that alchemy holds.

172
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,660
I want to believe in it!

173
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,250
A State Alchemist!

174
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,140
Get down!

175
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,810
Hang in there...

176
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,130
Don't die!

177
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,460
D-Dammit... It won't stop bleeding...

178
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,320
Someone...

179
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,810
Live...

180
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,650
You can't die.

181
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,090
Lan Fan!

182
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:09,920
Run!

183
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,960
Lan Fan!!!

184
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,720
My left arm is...

185
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,260
What's wrong?!

186
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,800
Young Master!

187
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,330
I can no longer be of any use to you!

188
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,980
Lan Fan?!

189
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,310
Don't do it!

190
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,810
Well played.

191
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,830
No matter how many times we're stepped on...
No matter how many times we fall...

192
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,580
We'll get back up and keep walking.

193
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,650
And someday...

194
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,620
That's just a useless struggle.

195
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,120
You don't know until you try!

196
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,870
It's better than not doing anything at all!

197
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,240
Are you fine with that?!

198
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,180
If Ed, Al, and everyone else disappears?!

199
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,380
Why are you getting so worked up?

200
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,840
Even if we do work for the sake of the humans,

201
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,220
they'll just end up dying in the end.

202
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,950
It all becomes wasted effort on our side.

203
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:28,890
In that case, don't you think it's wiser to simply grab what's important and run away?

204
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,530
What did y-

205
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,450
A bit of your conscience?

206
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,090
Or a worthless sentiment?

207
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,780
Eh, Hohenheim?

208
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:46,540
No matter how hard you try,
no one will accept you anymore!

209
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,440
Just look at your own face!

210
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,490
Humans are nothing but a resource to be used.

211
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,480
And if you leave them be, they'll renew themselves.

212
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,840
Why would you need to do anything?

213
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,940
Would that change anything?

214
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,960
Would you be able to change reality?!

215
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,050
Would you be able to change how these weak humans are?!

216
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,480
We can change.

217
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,640
We'll be able to change.

218
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,160
I'm sure of it.

219
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,870
We really are weak creatures,

220
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,950
but that's why we can strive to become stronger.

221
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,520
Even if you feel it's useless,

222
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,120
each step we take leads to something great.

223
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,460
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth.

224
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,550
That should be possible, even for us puny humans.

225
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,410
No... I wasn't prepared enough.

226
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,730
Lan Fan was more prepared than I was.

227
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,060
Seeing people die before my eyes...

228
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,220
I hate it! I'm tired of it!

229
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,900
I'm not going to let anyone die anymore! I'll protect you!

230
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,070
No way in hell am I going to run!

231
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,530
After I beat the shit out of that "truth" guy, I'm going to drag your body out of there!

232
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,390
Al!

233
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,540
Al! Come here!

234
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,580
Hurry up! Al!!!

235
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,590
Alphonse!

236
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,380
Alphonse!

237
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,990
Alphonse!

238
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,420
Wait for me.

239
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,730
That's why I'm sure we'll be able to change.

240
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,410
Because we're weak... and because death is inevitable...

241
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,740
Humans try their best to live and end up becoming stronger.

242
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,240
If your heart is still hesitating...

243
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,170
Try to remember.

244
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,370
The days you spent in Resembool with us.

245
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,610
A dream, huh...

246
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,790
Thanks for everything.

247
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,630
If you'll cower at the sight of the great foe before you,

248
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,210
leave at once, coward.

249
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,420
If you'll lose the strength you believed in,

250
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,010
then fall to the ground, weakling.

251
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,520
Now is the time for the decisive battle.

252
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,850
Humans, give it all you have.

253
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,520
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

254
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,700
Episode 28, Father.
