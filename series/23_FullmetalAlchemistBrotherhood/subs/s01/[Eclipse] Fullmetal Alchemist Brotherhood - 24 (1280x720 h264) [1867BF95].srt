1
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,570
Geez, you still haven't had a bite?

2
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,400
You're an important human sacrifice candidate.

3
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,540
We need you to stay healthy.

4
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you listening, Doctor Marcoh?

5
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,550
I've been thinking for some time...

6
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,010
...as to what you mean by "human sacrifice"...

7
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,510
...and about what you are trying to make me do...

8
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,650
What you are trying to do right now...

9
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,770
...is to create a giant transmutation circle, using this country and its people.

10
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,320
And the purpose of that...

11
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,280
...is to create a philosopher's stone. Am I right?

12
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,780
You're close. On the right track, at least.

13
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,160
On the right track?

14
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,340
So, what are you going to do?

15
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,710
If you're not going to help us out, we'll destroy that village.

16
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,040
I heard from Lust.

17
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,050
You'll lend us a hand as long as we promise to leave that village alone, right?

18
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,750
What are you going to do?

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,310
Will you help us out and kill everyone in this country?

20
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,560
Or will you refuse and let everyone in that village die?

21
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,070
Such a fool.

22
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,080
By sacrificing something minor,
you'd be able to save something major.

23
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,070
It's a simple concept if you just think about it.

24
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,450
Well, I guess that's what makes you guys human.

25
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,950
Emotion always gets in the way of logic.

26
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,620
It was the same way with that guy I killed.

27
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,540
When I transformed into his wife, he couldn't fight back and lost his chance to get me.

28
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,630
It's really helpful to us that you humans are so vulnerable.

29
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,400
Seems to me you're really struggling against these humans,

30
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,770
Wrath.

31
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,360
To let Scar get away and even have Gluttony captured is unlike you.

32
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,540
Yes, you're right.

33
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,120
You look happy.

34
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,540
I won't deny that.

35
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,540
I'm having fun.

36
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,550
I've lived for sixty years, and now, I stand at the top of this country.

37
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,940
All according to Father's plan.

38
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,980
However...

39
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,310
Colonel Mustang, the Elric brothers,
and the ones who come from a foreign land.

40
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,570
We, the wise ones, are being thrown into complete disarray.

41
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,830
It may just be it's almost time for the young ones to take over the generation, Pride.

42
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,680
Wrath, you've interacted with humans for far too long.

43
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,340
That may be true.

44
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,590
I want you to remember what exactly we are.

45
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,220
I won't report to Father that earlier statement, which could be interpreted as treachery.

46
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,350
More importantly, we need to rescue Gluttony.

47
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,660
There's no need to worry about that.

48
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,360
I have a vague idea of their location based on information I received from the military police.

49
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,300
What is this...

50
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,740
Colonel! Where are you?!

51
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,490
Stop! Lieutenant!

52
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,630
Colonel!

53
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,100
Lieutenant...

54
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,760
Don't provoke him!

55
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,760
He's only after me!

56
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,100
Mustang!!!

57
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,030
Lan Fan! We're getting out of here!

58
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,940
What... happened?

59
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,940
The monster was keeping another monster inside its belly!

60
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,780
It swallowed everything around him!

61
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,450
So even something like this is created...

62
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,600
...by alchemy...

63
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,370
There's no other choice. I'll have to kill him.

64
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,330
W-Wait, we were finally able to capture a Homunculus!

65
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,590
Staying alive is more important.

66
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,960
Also, he knows our names and our appearances.

67
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,630
There's no reason to let him go alive!

68
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,180
He swallowed...

69
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,030
...the fire?

70
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,510
You really are useless, aren't you?!

71
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,500
Then why don't you try to do something about it?!

72
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,240
More like, stop following us! He's only after you, Colonel!

73
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,000
Run into the bushes! Spread out!

74
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,930
Dammit... talk about bad timing...

75
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,790
Hurry up, kid!

76
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Hurry! There's no reason to stay here any longer!

77
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,580
But Ed and the others are still...

78
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,620
Not my problem!

79
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,620
I'm just a civilian.

80
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,410
Getting dragged into some ridiculous battle like this and dying doesn't sound too great to me!

81
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,170
Dammit!

82
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,170
What's taking them so long?!

83
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,890
Roy Mustang!!!

84
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,480
No!!!

85
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,210
Sounds like he fell for the dummy.

86
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,900
He doesn't seem too happy about it either.

87
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,610
Come on, hurry up and go home,

88
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,210
Mr. Useless.

89
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,720
Lieutenant, you're on this side.

90
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,070
Please take care of Lan Fan.

91
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,620
Are you telling me to shamelessly run away in this situation?!

92
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,620
You'll just get in the way!

93
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,940
Please, just leave!

94
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,550
You're really not helping at all, Colonel.

95
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,340
Seriously, this stupid Colonel...

96
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,240
Just do your own job.

97
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,560
The fact that the highest ranked man in this country is a Homunculus isn't exactly a problem you can brush aside.

98
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,320
The highest ranked man...

99
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,770
You don't mean, FÃ¼hrer President Bradley?!

100
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,420
We can talk about this later.

101
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,770
Hop in!

102
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,530
Looks like there aren't any more empty seats.
Just go ahead without us.

103
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,090
You idiot!

104
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,030
There's no way we can just abandon you kids on the battlefield!

105
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,410
Your opponent is the upper echelon of the army, right?

106
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,650
We have to beat some information out of that Gluttony guy.

107
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,790
We're going to stay here and fight him.

108
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,300
It doesn't matter that we're kids.

109
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,420
We're the ones who came up with this, anyway.

110
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,430
Thanks for lending us a hand up until now.

111
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,810
Edward.

112
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,360
Take this with you.

113
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,810
You know how to use it, right?

114
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,730
That's something used for killing people.

115
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,980
It's something to protect your lives with.

116
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,160
Your hands aren't meant for killing people.

117
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,830
Please don't die.

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,040
I'll be borrowing this.

119
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,320
Please, take care of Lan Fan.

120
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,010
Young master...

121
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,430
Young master!

122
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,440
Let's go.

123
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,010
Go!

124
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,020
Damn those brats!

125
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,760
Those are the types that end up dying early!

126
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,230
Mustang...

127
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,460
Where is Roy Mustang?!

128
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,660
How dare you kill Lust...

129
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,090
I won't forgive you!!!

130
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,970
I said we'd fight him, but he's kind of scary.

131
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,080
He's like a whole new person now...

132
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,510
How are we supposed to capture him?

133
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,880
What's wrong?

134
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,220
A dog?

135
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,310
Stop, Gluttony.

136
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,780
I-It talked?!

137
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,990
Hey, it's been a while.

138
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,780
Fullmetal runt.

139
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,050
Who are you calling a flea-sized runt?!

140
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,990
Calm down! I just came to pick up Gluttony!

141
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,360
I have no intentions of fighting mister runt--

142
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,470
Seventh time!

143
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,130
What are you talking about?!

144
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,650
Twice just now, and fives times back at Research Laboratory 5.

145
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,810
All told, you've called me a runt seven times!

146
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,230
Don't tell me you forgot!

147
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,390
You've got such a good memory...

148
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,440
Wait!

149
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,570
Giving me so much trouble...

150
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,750
I saw Mustang!

151
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,400
The one who killed Lust!

152
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,430
I'm going to swallow him! Swallow him all up!

153
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,580
You can't do that to the Colonel.

154
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,700
Not to the Elric brothers, either.

155
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,080
No!

156
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,840
I felt it earlier, but...

157
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,340
How many people do you have inside of you, Homunculus?!

158
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,300
So you're the kid who crossed swords with Wrath.

159
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,220
What do you mean by "kid"?!

160
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm the 12th Prince of the Xing Dynasty.

161
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,050
My name is...

162
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,770
You can swallow him, though.

163
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,320
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

164
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,090
I see...

165
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,990
Looks like you can't do anything to us.

166
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,860
In that case...

167
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,290
Lin, we'll leave him to you!

168
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,290
Fine.

169
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,290
Show it to me, then.

170
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,290
Your skills that were enough to challenge Wrath.

171
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,770
Oh, really now?

172
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,260
He got the highest grade in his class.

173
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,300
On the essay he wrote about you.

174
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,470
Umm... do you mind if I read it here?

175
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,960
Not at the dinner table, dear.

176
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,180
Come on, what's wrong?

177
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,820
Let's hear it.

178
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,480
Okay!

179
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,320
My father is the FÃ¼hrer President of Amestris.

180
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,980
He works hard every day for this country.

181
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,580
He's always thinking about his people.

182
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:57,560
He's constantly trying to find solutions to problems so that everyone can live in peace.

183
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:04,350
But no matter how busy he is,
he has never forgotten that he has a family.

184
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,720
He loves me and my mother.

185
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,520
My father always listens to me.

186
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,210
He always respects my wishes.

187
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,770
I love my father and everything about him.

188
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,820
Thank you, Selim.

189
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,650
Not bad.

190
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,720
Thank you for the compliment!

191
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,410
You fell for it!

192
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,470
What do you think?

193
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,150
It's something you humans can't do, isn't it?

194
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,060
Now... do you want to be strangled to death?

195
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,600
Or bitten to death...

196
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,760
Or cut to death?

197
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,510
Actually...

198
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,750
You're cheap, kicking dirt into my eyes...

199
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,350
There have been many assassination attempts on me, ever since I was little.

200
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,740
I've had to learn a few cheap tricks of my own.

201
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,710
What do you say? Can't you just give up and turn yourself in?

202
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,170
I just want information about immortality.

203
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,340
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

204
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,940
You little shit!

205
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,010
You're just a human! Don't be looking down on me!

206
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,930
Don't underestimate humans, Homunculus!

207
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,000
Okay! Got him!

208
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,350
That was dangerous, geez...

209
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,190
Dammit, you...

210
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,400
I'm not allowed to eat you guys!

211
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,650
I want to eat that guy with the thin eyes!

212
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,070
Got him!

213
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,990
Hey now, don't be interfering with--

214
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,550
You're a human, after all.

215
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,920
Now, Gluttony!

216
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,710
Lin!

217
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,550
What?!

218
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,330
Dammit! I can't let him swallow human sacrifices!

219
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,890
Brother!

220
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,600
I swallowed them.

221
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,290
Brother! Lin!

222
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,920
Hey, spit him out! Spit out my brother!

223
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,610
I can't. I swallowed them.

224
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,050
No way...

225
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,180
You're fine, right, Brother?

226
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:09,790
I've got the rooms my wife and kids used to live in, but if I have too many lights on, the neighbors will get suspicious.

227
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,740
You're going to have to sleep in my bed.

228
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,950
I... I have to go to the young master...

229
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
Moron!

230
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,630
What can you do in that state?!

231
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,470
He still hasn't returned yet?

232
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,050
Got it.

233
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,620
Then I'll be on my way to Headquarters.

234
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,350
Yes. Thank you.

235
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,760
We're going.

236
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,560
Roger.

237
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,480
To where?

238
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,990
I need to find out who's on our side and who's not.

239
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,720
Geez, the whole lot of you...

240
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,240
You're still going to push yourself,
even though your wound hasn't healed yet?

241
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,750
The FÃ¼hrer President might be a Homunculus.

242
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,270
I can't just sit around.

243
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,860
Also...

244
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,500
We just left some kids on the battlefield.

245
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,090
I'll be setting a bad example as
an adult if I don't take action now!

246
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,300
What's so funny?

247
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,330
Nothing.

248
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:27,690
I was just thinking about how mad Edward would be if he knew you were treating him like a child.

249
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,190
I was just repeating your words, you know.

250
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,430
But still, I'm amazed.

251
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,480
I would have never expected you to take such a bold step.

252
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,810
It isn't bold at all.

253
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,980
I'm just trying to clear the field.

254
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,120
Also...

255
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,040
Have a lot of people who understand and are willing to support you.

256
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,550
It's a little late, but I'm going to take his advice.

257
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,770
This could either be the gates of glory or an entrance to a den of evil...

258
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,990
You wait here, Lieutenant.

259
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,830
If something happens to me, I want you to get out of here.

260
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,490
I refuse.

261
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,160
This is an order.

262
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,910
I cannot comply.

263
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,700
You're quite the stubborn one...

264
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,160
You should know that by now.

265
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,810
Fine.

266
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,080
I'll definitely come back, so wait for me here.

267
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,250
Yes, sir! Good luck!

268
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,660
So you're Roy Mustang, eh?

269
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,800
I got a call from my wife earlier.

270
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,150
Lieutenant General Raven! I deeply apologize for not coming to introduce myself to you due to duties.

271
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,560
Also, I'm terribly sorry for visiting you at this hour!

272
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,290
I don't mind.

273
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,310
How's the old geezer Grumman doing these days?

274
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,820
He's doing fine.

275
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,150
Check.

276
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,040
I'm beat.

277
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,640
That's eleven losses in a row.

278
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,170
Make that twelve.

279
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,330
Well, I guess you put up a good fight this round.

280
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,660
You started to lose your touch right after you started to think you had a chance.

281
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,920
So you're saying I let up?

282
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,070
That's right. You're not able to become heartless.

283
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,900
Just like Raven.

284
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,500
General Raven...

285
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,420
From Central?

286
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,640
He's exceptional, but very soft-hearted.

287
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,160
There was a case where he ran in to rescue one of his men, who was injured, and ended up disrupting his formation.

288
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,940
If he's like that, he'll need a lot of men on his side.

289
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,330
W-What an insult!

290
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,440
I was employed at Central because of the way I treat my men!

291
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,900
A geezer out on the frontier has no right to say that about me!

292
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,910
M-My apologies...

293
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,510
Please don't let it get to you.

294
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,990
Also, seeing how you got angry at this,
you must be a man of justice.

295
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,420
Lieutenant General Grumman told me I should go to you in times of trouble.

296
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,760
So that sly dog one-upped me again, huh...

297
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,620
Oh, it's almost time for the meeting.

298
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,060
I'll accompany you.

299
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,060
Have you gotten used to Central?

300
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,820
Not quite. I'm trying to bring myself to talk with the people more, but...

301
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,320
They've got rumors flying around all over the place, don't they?

302
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,850
But most of those rumors are nonsensical.

303
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,330
Something about Scar feeding a cat, immortal beings, and...

304
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,420
...something about the FÃ¼hrer President being a Homunculus.

305
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,590
You don't have a great sense of humor, do you?

306
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,870
Did you really work under Grumman?

307
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,720
I guess I didn't pick that up from him.

308
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,230
Well, even gossip like that may end up entertaining everyone.

309
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,890
Huh? Am I really allowed to...

310
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,990
So, about that earlier joke...

311
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,280
About the FÃ¼hrer President being a Homunculus...

312
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,290
I'd like you to continue.

313
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,300
What's the matter, Colonel Mustang?

314
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,050
What about me being a Homunculus?

315
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,560
Is there a problem?

316
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,560
Oh, now I get it, Hughes...

317
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,930
When you said that the army was in danger...

318
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,030
...you didn't mean a crisis was approaching the army...

319
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,680
You meant that the army itself was in a crisis.

320
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,950
Fullmetal.

321
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,710
Looks like I've arrived at the depths of hell.

322
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,140
Where am I...

323
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,730
Blood?

324
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,620
What?

325
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,840
What is this place?

326
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,130
Al!

327
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,730
Hey, isn't anyone here?!

328
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,970
Where the hell am I?!

329
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,920
Do people search for the lost because they fear being alone?

330
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,540
But even if he can't see them, he won't give up.

331
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,280
Because he believes.

332
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,850
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

333
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,290
Episode 25, The Door of Darkness.

334
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,190
Don't look at me.

335
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,530
Don't look at this figure.
