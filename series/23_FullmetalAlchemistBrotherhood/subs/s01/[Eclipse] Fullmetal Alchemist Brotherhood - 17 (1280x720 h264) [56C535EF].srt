1
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,710
This is the bullet used in the murder of Brigadier General Hughes.

2
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,650
.45 caliber, and only one shot was fired.

3
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,130
I'd like to say the murderer was skilled, but it was a close proximity shot.

4
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,090
Not impossible for a woman to do.

5
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,710
What is the caliber of your gun?

6
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,350
.45.

7
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,980
This is your ammunition request application.

8
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,560
Am I right?

9
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,740
It's written here you only needed to be supplied with one shot.

10
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,380
What did you use it for?

11
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,110
As it says right there,

12
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,950
I used it at Research Laboratory 5, while I escorted Edward Elric...

13
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,070
But Research Laboratory 5 is closed down, and there shouldn't be anyone there.

14
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,880
But there were.

15
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,380
...According to you.

16
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,650
Should I order a search for this bullet you supposedly shot?

17
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,810
Research Laboratory 5 is in ruins now due to an unknown explosion.

18
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,830
So the place where you say you used
your gun is usually unvisited by people,

19
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,900
and even if we wanted to search for
the bullet, it'd be under a heap of rubble...

20
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,580
There's witness testimony stating you left the scene of the crime, on the exact date and time it occurred.

21
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,870
That's ridiculous!

22
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,870
Compose yourself.

23
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,110
What were you doing at the time?

24
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,720
I was on leave that day and at my parents' house.

25
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,380
You can confirm with them.

26
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,470
Testimony from family members or people whom you are close with cannot be accepted as an alibi.

27
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,580
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross is currently being interrogated.

28
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,590
Though you may be her superior, I cannot allow you to see her.

29
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,090
I see...

30
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,070
Major Armstrong!

31
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,490
Sergeant Brosh.

32
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,580
You were here, too, Major?

33
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,480
Yeah. Are you here for Second Lieutenant Ross?

34
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,810
Yes. The truth is-

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,480
The truth is, like the lieutenant, I also fired one round at Research Laboratory 5 while escorting the Elric Brothers.

36
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,420
What?

37
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,160
I reported that, but they didn't listen at all.

38
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,680
So they're planning on passing her off as the murderer?

39
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,200
Now that I look closely, you're really scratched up.

40
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,100
Not an easy journey, huh?

41
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,080
Say, what are you going to do now?

42
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,590
Hey...

43
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,680
I wonder...

44
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,810
Mama, don't cry.

45
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,050
What do you want me to do?

46
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,260
What?

47
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,810
No, it's just that you've never asked me for advice about something concerning yourselves...

48
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh...

49
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,800
It really scares me.

50
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,240
Both of you are fighting in a place so dangerous that Mr. Hughes was killed.

51
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,100
I got really scared when I thought about that.

52
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,010
Because... you both could die.

53
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,510
And suddenly disappear from my side.

54
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,260
Just like Mom and Dad...

55
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,340
I got really scared when I thought about that.

56
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,300
To be honest, I want you to end your journey.

57
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,460
I want you two to get your bodies back.

58
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,300
But I don't want you to go on any dangerous journeys.

59
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,180
Because...

60
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,350
But...

61
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,640
Sorry.

62
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,110
I don't really know what I want either.

63
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,620
You're really kind, Winry.

64
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,030
Huh?! W-W-What are you saying?

65
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,870
I'm always kind!

66
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,170
Stop! You're going to scratch me up even more!

67
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,340
PLACEHOLDER

68
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,290
Geez Al, what are you saying?

69
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,910
There.

70
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,440
Evening paper!

71
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,840
Finally!

72
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,610
What, the paper again?

73
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,060
I'm forced to watch over you all day.

74
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,090
This is about the only thing I can look forward to.

75
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,440
Warrant Officer Falman speaking. I'm calling from an outside line.

76
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,420
Please put me through to Colonel Mustang.

77
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,850
That's right. My code is...

78
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,090
What's the deal?

79
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,830
Airam, George, Oliver, 4649.

80
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,580
It's that lady from back then!

81
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,100
Philosopher's stones...

82
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,080
Ones who have tattoos of Ouroboros...

83
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,970
Homunculus...

84
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,520
How are they...

85
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,400
Brother!

86
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,730
Look at this...

87
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,920
Don't scare me like that.

88
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,620
I... got this from the front desk!

89
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,280
What is it?

90
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,490
What?!

91
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,890
"Second Lieutenant Maria Ross convicted on charges of the murder of Brigadier General Hughes"?!

92
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,160
I don't believe this.

93
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,250
Maybe the colonel or the major might know something.

94
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,700
Aren't you going to tell Winry?

95
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,660
I'll explain it to her later.

96
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,260
I don't like this thing.

97
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,740
Quit complaining. It's kind of like a collar for a dog.

98
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,810
Oh, and I'm going to ask again just to be sure...

99
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,060
Are you really fifteen?

100
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,570
Yeah.

101
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,940
Stop lying.

102
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,320
But it's true...

103
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,320
What's all this?

104
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,260
What's going on?

105
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,370
An intruder!

106
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,660
Please lend us a hand!

107
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,570
What?!

108
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,580
You'd better behave!

109
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,330
Yes, sir!

110
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,950
Weak, weak, weak!

111
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,590
Are you guys even trying?!

112
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,460
What's with this guy?!

113
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,970
Guns aren't working at all!

114
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,200
Move!

115
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,840
You-

116
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,540
Whoa!

117
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,900
But it's awfully boring not being allowed to cut them.

118
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,980
Hello! Guy who's not affected by guns!

119
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,050
Could you let me out of here?

120
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,660
Who are you?

121
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,800
An illegal alien from Xing.

122
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,140
Oh, I see.

123
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,640
Must have been a long trip.

124
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,500
I'll help you if you let me out!

125
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,020
I don't have time to mess around with you...

126
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,930
What country did you say you're from?

127
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,500
Xing of the East.

128
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,640
Come with me.

129
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,800
Thanks.

130
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,270
What?

131
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,770
Hello, Honey!

132
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,780
I've finally found you!

133
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,200
You were at Research Laboratory 5-

134
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,120
I'm glad you remember me.

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,250
I think of you every time I see the hole in my right hand you shot through.

136
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,210
Ms. Murderer of Hughes.

137
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,040
That's a misunderstanding!

138
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,460
Is it really?

139
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,930
The paper says it's confirmed.

140
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,070
No way...

141
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,630
At this rate, it looks like you're going to have the guilt pinned on you and get executed by a firing squad.

142
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,430
You're kidding...

143
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,390
There's no way... If they investigate thoroughly-

144
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,660
Make a decision!

145
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,650
Get tortured to death by these guys or escape with me!

146
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,980
Those are the two choices you've got!

147
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,280
That's horrible...

148
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,630
Are those the only choices available?

149
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,290
Looks that way.

150
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,180
God, damn it!

151
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,460
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry!

152
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,180
Fine, I'll escape. Happy?

153
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,360
You'd better escort me, you stupid bone armor!

154
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,560
Wow, you've got spunk.

155
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,390
Women have to have guts!

156
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,600
Yes.

157
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,150
Yes, I understand.

158
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,550
Notify the entire city.

159
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,040
Maria Ross has escaped from jail.

160
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,160
She's with a fiendish partner. Capture her immediately.

161
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,910
If she resists...

162
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,970
...don't hesitate to kill her!

163
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,360
How much longer are we going to run?!

164
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,280
Shut up and keep running!

165
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,470
Second Lieutenant Ross?!

166
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,380
Edward! Alphonse!

167
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,560
Hey! You're that guy from-

168
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,100
And Ling, too?!

169
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,060
Hiya!

170
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,600
What are you guys up to?

171
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,710
That's what we should be asking!

172
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,440
We don't have much time!

173
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,100
You...

174
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,130
Lady, go straight down that alley to reach the warehouse district!

175
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,120
It's dark enough over there to make your escape!

176
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,010
Second Lieutenant Ross, about Lt. Colonel Hughes...

177
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,080
Hurry up! If the military police finds you, they'll shoot you dead!

178
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,920
Second Lieutenant Ross!

179
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,160
Don't follow her!

180
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,290
Second Lieutenant!

181
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,110
Second Lieutenant Ross!

182
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,460
You're Maria Ross, right?

183
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,650
What?!

184
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,450
Oh, so she did it?

185
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,430
Hey!

186
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,620
Hold it!

187
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,600
Whoa!

188
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,520
We're going, thin-eyes!

189
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,620
You got it!

190
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,630
Ling! Why are you working with a guy like that?!

191
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,380
We'll talk later!

192
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,380
Seriously...

193
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,390
Yo, Fullmetal.

194
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,900
What's the meaning of this...

195
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,550
What's the meaning of this, Colonel?!

196
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,250
Why...

197
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,780
Lt. Colonel Hughes was...

198
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,720
Why would Second Lieutenant Ross...

199
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,550
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?!

200
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,800
Attacking a superior?

201
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,990
Know your place!

202
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,900
You can't, Brother!

203
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Let go of me, Al!

204
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,290
No!

205
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,700
This bastard just killed Second Lieutenant Ross!

206
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,520
Second Lieutenant Ross?

207
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,160
What is this, Colonel?!

208
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,230
There was a kill-on-sight order issued for Maria Ross, an escaped convict.

209
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,470
That's all there is to it.

210
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,090
"That's all"?!

211
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,670
I do apologize for hiding Hughes' death.

212
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,980
But do not object to orders. Do not seek explanation.

213
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,940
Simply obey.

214
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,220
That's what it means to be a soldier!

215
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,510
Colonel Mustang.

216
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,950
Explain the situation to me.

217
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,380
There should have been a notice issued saying if she resists, we could gun her down.

218
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,260
She resisted, so I killed her.

219
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,210
The Brigadier General was a good friend of yours from what I hear.

220
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,680
Yeah.

221
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,150
He was a good man.

222
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,770
It weren't your men who helped
Second Lieutenant Ross escape from jail, right?

223
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,940
Mine?

224
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,910
Why would I?

225
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,160
Why?

226
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,010
So you could burn her to death like that yourself.

227
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,540
I'd appreciate it if you didn't make assumptions.

228
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:52,260
I'm truly sorry for not telling you about Brigadier General Hughes' death.

229
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,500
Because of me...

230
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,450
Don't brood over it.

231
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,150
It is not your fault.

232
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,820
So you're all here.

233
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,060
Dr. Nox...

234
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,070
The damage is extensive.

235
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:19,580
But from a scar on her tooth that was just narrowly left unscathed, we were able to identify her as Maria Ross.

236
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,370
How horrible.

237
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,030
Turning a babe like that into charcoal.

238
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,720
You must have really had something against her, eh, Mr. Mustang?

239
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,600
Are you satisfied you were able to avenge your friend's death?

240
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:47,900
It makes me sick a hero from the Ishbal War
would go so far against a little girl.

241
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,320
Colonel, I can't express to you how sorry I am for what my subordinate did.

242
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,330
I had no idea Second Lieutenant Ross would murder...

243
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,770
She's always been honest... hardworking...

244
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,920
And thoughtful...

245
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,560
Looks like you're exhausted, Major.

246
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,230
Why not take a vacation?

247
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,250
Eastern Headquarters, where I used to be stationed, was great.

248
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,400
It lacks the bustle of large cities,
and most of all, there are so many beauties.

249
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,210
And so, Mustang was able to avenge his best friend.

250
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,780
And everyone lived happily ever after.

251
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,770
You petered out.

252
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,520
Wasn't the purpose of this mission to make the colonel behave?

253
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,170
Who cares?

254
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,560
The dog ate its bait.

255
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,060
And it seems he's provoking people's antipathy.

256
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,070
His own men may even be disgusted at him.

257
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,940
What's this?

258
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,200
Request for leave.

259
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,540
At this time of the year?

260
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,070
Is something wrong?

261
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,180
No, it's fine. I permit it.

262
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
Thank you very much.

263
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,200
Oh, for crying out loud!

264
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,490
Why did you leave this place?! There's no knowing what the colonel will say to me if he finds out!

265
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,210
No one saw me coming back.

266
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,230
That's not the problem here!

267
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:58,730
You're a poor soldier that's in the hands of a vicious criminal, so it's okay.

268
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,200
Huh?!

269
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,050
Yo, what are you doing?

270
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,290
Sending a signal.

271
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,450
Signal?

272
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,710
And besides, why did you bring back some random stranger?!

273
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,360
Young Master! We've looked all over for you!

274
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,750
Oh wow, that was quick.

275
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,960
More guests.

276
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,810
Hey Elizabeth! How are you?

277
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,080
Thanks for calling all the time.

278
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,940
But won't your scary aide scold you if you slack off too much?

279
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,440
It's all right! She's on leave right now.

280
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,050
Which is why I can call you like this.

281
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,620
What do you think?

282
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,490
This starts as soon as the lieutenant goes on vacation.

283
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,070
I guess she really was...

284
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,370
...His babysitter...

285
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,900
That's right!

286
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,220
I haven't had any days off since I came here.

287
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,380
So I'm thinking about taking a holiday soon.

288
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Oh? Going somewhere?

289
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,720
I've gotten into fishing lately.

290
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,260
Want to come along?

291
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,340
Yes?

292
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,140
Who is it-

293
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,240
Why did you do that all of a sudden, Major?!

294
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,990
Edward Elric.

295
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,630
Oh no.

296
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,970
Your automail is broken.

297
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,000
Huh?

298
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,910
Yes. This is a serious situation.

299
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,760
We must get it fixed right away.

300
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,030
I'll escort you to Resembool.

301
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,890
Well, umm...

302
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,070
What? What?

303
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,010
We're going back to Resembool?

304
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,520
Al, listen to this...

305
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,900
Alphonse Elric, you stick out too much, so stay in Central.

306
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,940
All right! Let's make arrangements for the train ride.

307
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,290
Let's go, Edward Elric!

308
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,490
Can you cut it out already, Major?

309
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,820
No can do.

310
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,670
This is also an order.

311
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,160
From that man...

312
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,960
Yes, I understand.

313
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,680
Major Armstrong and Edward Elric just got on a train.

314
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,360
I see.

315
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,410
Now there are no hindrances.

316
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,820
I was able to come in contact with a witness who saw the guy who assaulted the prison.

317
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,570
And this is what he looks like.

318
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,080
Oh, he was alive?

319
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,080
I wonder if he has anything to do with the Flame Colonel?

320
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,370
Who knows?

321
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,840
But I think we can say for sure that there is a big possibility.

322
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,320
Where did he run off to?

323
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,250
Well, he's speedy, and to top it off,
he's also good at hiding...

324
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,530
So in other words, you don't know?

325
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,570
You're so incompetent.

326
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,630
Shut up, hag.

327
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,140
We don't have enough people, that's why.

328
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,230
People?

329
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,520
He's all we need.

330
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,900
You're up, Barry the Chopper.

331
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,740
The whole truth lies in Xerxes.

332
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,750
The residents left in the city that rusted away and disappeared...

333
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,710
...wipe away the darkness within the boy.

334
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,840
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

335
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,630
Episode 18, The Arrogant Palm of a Puny Human.

336
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,950
Humans, raise the signal of counterattack.
