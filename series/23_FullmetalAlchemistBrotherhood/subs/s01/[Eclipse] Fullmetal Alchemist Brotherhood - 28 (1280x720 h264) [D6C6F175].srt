1
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,080
I've got a bad feeling about this place.

2
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,750
Father! I brought a sacrifice!

3
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,340
"Father"? So suddenly...

4
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,850
Who is it?

5
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,840
Dad?

6
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,780
Envy.

7
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,220
Envy?!

8
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,920
This is him?!

9
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,690
Brother!

10
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,230
Brother!

11
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,340
Al?

12
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,000
Al in the armor... which means...

13
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,990
We were able to get back.

14
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,330
Yeah.

15
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,400
Brother!

16
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,600
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

17
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,250
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

18
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,210
I'm so glad to see you're safe!

19
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,330
That hurts, Al!

20
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,710
Your armor's hurting me!

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,010
It's just that I'm so glad to see you're alive...

22
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,550
You're right.

23
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,770
Sorry.

24
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,270
For worrying you.

25
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,030
But where the heck are we?

26
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,030
What a surprise.

27
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,360
Humans came out of his stomach?

28
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,950
Hohen...heim?!

29
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,520
An arm and a leg made of steel, and a suit of armor.

30
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,590
Are you the Elric Brothers?

31
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,660
It's not him?

32
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,240
Are you mistaking me for somebody?

33
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,970
Hang on...

34
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,970
Hohen...

35
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,490
Don't tell me you're talking about Van Hohenheim?

36
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,730
What is your relationship with him?

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,980
He's... our dad.

38
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,230
Dad?!

39
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,700
What a surprise! He ended up having kids?!

40
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,540
But aren't your last names Elric?

41
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,530
Elric is our mother's maiden name!

42
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,660
I see.

43
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,270
So, where is he now?

44
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,690
Hell if I know!

45
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,050
But more importantly, who the hell are you?!

46
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,970
You look just like Hohenheim!

47
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,170
There's no way he'd die.

48
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,610
Listen to me!

49
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,660
And he's even had kids...

50
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,170
Brother, this man is...

51
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,400
Oh? You're injured?

52
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,560
And you're missing your left arm.

53
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,320
How's that?

54
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,410
Ow!

55
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,250
A broken bone, huh?

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,040
I-It's fixed.

57
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,360
Hey!

58
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,720
Oww!

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,570
Now for your ribs.

60
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,000
You two are important to us.

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,060
Don't be too reckless with your bodies, okay?

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,770
He used alchemy without a single hand motion.

63
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,030
And he didn't make the rest of my armor thinner, either...

64
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,900
In other words, it's not equivalent exchange.

65
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,910
Who the hell are you?

66
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,910
It's unreal! How could your insides be in such a state?!

67
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,550
I'm going to ask you the same exact question.

68
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,910
Who are you?

69
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,640
You can eat him.

70
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,690
Okay!

71
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,840
H-Hang on!

72
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
He's my friend!

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,300
I'm a human sacrifice, so don't kill him for my sake. Okay?

74
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,380
That's not my problem.

75
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,530
He's useless to me.

76
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,930
What did you say?!

77
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,260
Brother, the Homunculi call him "Father".

78
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,540
He's the one who created them.

79
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,490
What?!

80
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,920
Even though he patched us up...

81
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,030
I don't like it.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,630
Your attitude...

83
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,160
You're the same as those who laugh at humans for being foolish.

84
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,210
Do you consider insects crawling about the Earth to be foolish?

85
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,360
Even if insects struggle, the difference between you and them is so great that you don't exactly give a damn.

86
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,470
That's precisely how I feel about you humans.

87
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,340
I appreciate you healing our wounds,
but I don't think I can get along with you!

88
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,900
Seems you're the cause of everything!

89
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,140
I'll take care of you quickly.

90
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,270
I can't be worrying about the small fry!

91
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,110
You're calling me small fry now, runt?

92
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,700
Runt?!

93
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,950
I've got their leader!

94
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,910
Ling!

95
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,720
What is going on?!

96
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,700
How can he use alchemy without a single hand motion?!

97
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,270
What a waste of time.

98
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,020
We can't use alchemy?!

99
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,400
Ed! Al!

100
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,450
What did that geezer do?!

101
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,320
Why...

102
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,860
Why can't we use alchemy?!

103
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,370
Seriously, these tiny beings are unbelievable.

104
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,920
They start to think they're at the top of the world as soon as they gain some power.

105
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,210
They don't even know what exactly they're using.

106
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,710
Do you really think all this prosperity was created with the powers of humans only?

107
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,930
How laughable, fools.

108
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,560
What the hell are you talking about?!

109
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,530
You promised you'd tell me as soon as we got out!

110
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,700
What?

111
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,840
I don't remember making promises with you insects.

112
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,980
You bastard...

113
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,510
You're talking too much, Envy.

114
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,710
Yeah, yeah...

115
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,610
He could be good for the job.

116
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,520
I may be able to create another pawn.

117
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,000
That's... a philosopher's stone!

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,140
What?!

119
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,370
So you're planning to do it, huh?

120
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,390
Do what?

121
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,760
He's creating a Homunculus.

122
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,110
He's going to inject the philosopher's stone into him.

123
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,970
If all goes well, a homunculus with a human base will be complete.

124
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,570
Well, most humans end up dying because they aren't capable of fighting the stone's power.

125
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,480
Like I'll let you!

126
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,050
Let go, Envy!!

127
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,490
Dammit, what's going on?!

128
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,450
Why can't we use alchemy?!

129
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,340
Hey, you!

130
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,750
Geezer! Stop it!

131
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,550
He has people waiting for his return!

132
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,180
Let go!!!

133
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,720
Humans can't shoot me if I do this...

134
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Right?

135
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,000
Damn you...

136
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,410
It's fine! Don't shoot!

137
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,380
Don't interfere.

138
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,560
This is fine by me!

139
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,820
What?

140
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,800
I came to this country looking for a philosopher's stone.

141
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,260
And he's just going to give it to me like that.

142
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,840
It's exactly what I wished for!

143
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,190
What the hell are you saying?!

144
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,700
Oh? Sounds interesting.

145
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,450
Then as you wish, it's all yours.

146
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,240
Stop it!

147
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,300
Ling!

148
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,100
I... I told you not...

149
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,940
...to interfere!

150
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,610
It's fine... Just wait for me...

151
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,180
I'm the man who will become the Emperor of Xing...

152
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,480
...Ling Yao!

153
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,300
What the hell is a brat doing here?!

154
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,270
Ah, well.

155
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,250
Let me have your body.

156
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,970
I'll put it to good use.

157
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,260
Fine...

158
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,470
It's all yours!

159
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,500
What?

160
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,100
I'm saying that I'll accept you!

161
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Wouldn't people normally be against it?

162
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,660
I'm going to become the Emperor of Xing.

163
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,700
How do you expect me to do that if I can't even accept a few dozen people in my body?!

164
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,380
I like decisive guys.

165
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,350
But you'd better not regret it.

166
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,080
Regret?

167
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:17,090
If I return empty-handed, how could I possibly face my servant who cut her own arm off to save me?!

168
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,990
I want power...

169
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,120
Absolute power that will help me protect and gain more!

170
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,970
I knew the risks from the beginning!

171
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,010
I like your greed.

172
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,770
Well then, show me how prepared you are!

173
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,120
Ling?

174
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,270
Huh? Oh, the guy who owned this body?

175
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,880
Sorry, but now it belongs to me, Greed.

176
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,000
Not Ling, but...

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,880
Greed?!

178
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,220
You're that Greed?

179
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,840
What do you mean by "that" Greed?

180
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,410
You don't remember?!

181
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,910
The one at Dublith...

182
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,110
Yeah, so what Greed are you talking about?

183
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,850
The Greed that came before you.

184
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,240
Oh, I see.

185
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,780
Well, as you can see,

186
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,160
I'm a different Greed from the one you guys know.

187
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,860
What happened to Ling?

188
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,300
He was an interesting brat.

189
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,920
He accepted me in a matter of seconds.

190
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,920
No way! There's no way he's that easy to take control of!

191
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,090
Answer me! Ling!

192
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,490
Ling!!!

193
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,000
What?

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,150
No...

195
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,400
I don't like him...

196
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,530
He's a person, but at the same time, he's not!

197
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,990
You're right, a lot of these guys aren't human.

198
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,530
Shao May!

199
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,540
I'm so glad to see you're safe!

200
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,430
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

201
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,550
Whoa, I don't really get it, but is this some tearful reunion?

202
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,900
It seems they aren't working together with the Homunculi.

203
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,490
Fullmetal Alchemist.

204
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,850
Huh? Where?

205
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,080
Where's Sir Edward?

206
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,070
Right there.

207
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,980
I don't see him anywhere!

208
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,610
I'm pointing right at him.

209
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,110
That small one is the Fullmetal Alchemist.

210
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,100
You toyed with my pure heart, you midget!

211
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,930
Speak for yourself, midget!

212
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,360
PLACEHOLDER

213
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,110
What did you do to her, Brother?!

214
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,660
He's the Ishbalan I didn't get to eat.

215
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,730
I didn't do a thing!

216
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,570
The disobedient people, huh...

217
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,150
He's the one who uses destructive alchemy and continues to interfere with our plans, right?

218
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,630
Take care of them, Gluttony.

219
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,380
He can't use alchemy right now.

220
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,370
Okay!

221
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,370
What?!

222
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,960
I'll never forgive you!

223
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,170
You stepped all over a maiden's heart,
and on top of that, you kidnapped Shao May!

224
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,600
Divine punishment...

225
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,100
...for all of you!!!

226
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,470
Lucky!

227
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,500
We still can't use it!

228
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,850
What gives?!

229
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,860
How can you two use alchemy here?

230
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,360
What do you mean?

231
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,720
Seriously, what's going on?

232
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,430
How can Scar and that little girl...

233
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,480
I have no idea.

234
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,120
No idea, but...

235
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,130
This could be our chance to fill them in.

236
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,080
Scar!

237
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,540
I'll tell you the truth behind the Ishbal rebellion!

238
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,580
The truth?

239
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,550
The death of the child which became the trigger of the rebellion...

240
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,260
...was caused by him, disguised as a military officer!

241
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,160
They're behind it all!

242
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,860
It seems like I'll have to ask you to explain this in detail.

243
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,290
Answer me.

244
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,620
Why did my people have to fall?

245
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,590
Depending on your answer, I'll send you to...

246
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,630
No.

247
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,780
I won't send you to God, where my fellow Ishbalans reside!

248
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,200
Think of yourselves as undeserving of eternal rest or redemption!!!

249
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,210
Wow, amazing!

250
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,350
Not bad for a human.

251
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,450
Greed, get rid of the intruders.

252
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,680
Yeah, yeah...

253
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,440
I refuse to believe it, Ling!

254
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,170
I'm Greed.

255
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,390
That's...

256
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,750
Could that be Ling from the Yao clan?

257
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,760
A little girl!

258
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,770
Soft body!

259
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,900
Hey you, how can you use alchemy?

260
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,660
Yes, you really are using it.

261
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,020
Human destruction...

262
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,200
No, decomposition.

263
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,800
A second later, and I would have been...

264
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,090
Mr. Scar!

265
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,290
Shao May... Run...

266
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,940
You're mine!

267
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,660
Are you okay?!

268
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,400
I never asked you to save me...

269
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,440
What are you talking about?!

270
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,410
They're ruthless toward humans who are of no benefit to them.

271
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,040
Hurry up and get out of here!

272
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,350
There's way too many of them!

273
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,760
You two didn't run away?!

274
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,180
Scar, could you take this girl and get out of here?

275
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,010
You're going to let me escape?

276
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,270
Even if I killed those doctors...

277
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,510
Yeah, I want to beat the hell out of you.

278
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,530
To be honest, I don't even want to ask you for any favors.

279
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,290
But right now, it's more important to take this girl somewhere safe.

280
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,470
What will you do?

281
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,370
Apparently, my brother and I are important to them in some way.

282
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,880
Even if we stay here, they won't kill us.

283
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:02,450
Right now, I won't be able to protect
that girl and escape from here at the same time.

284
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,050
And I don't have the slightest intention of running away, either!

285
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,930
He decomposed water?!

286
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,470
Geez, let me know before you do stuff like that!

287
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,110
How reckless!

288
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,960
Igniting hydrogen? That's clever of you.

289
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,540
Where is he?

290
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,580
Where did he go?!

291
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,670
I don't know!

292
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,130
Gluttony, track him by scent!

293
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,980
You're out of lives?!

294
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,450
You've died too much!

295
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,990
That was a nice kick.

296
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,640
I think this'll be more fun than I expected.

297
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,320
You stupid prince!

298
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,720
Come back to your senses!

299
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,590
I'm Greed.

300
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,540
I don't care!

301
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,030
Give Ling back his body.

302
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,370
No can do!

303
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,920
What are you, an idiot?!

304
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,650
What are you going to do about your country?!

305
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,580
What about Lan Fan?!

306
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,170
PLACEHOLDER

307
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,510
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

308
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,510
Father! I got him.

309
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,200
Take him upstairs, where Wrath is.

310
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,560
Seriously... Always screwing around with us...

311
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,400
As long as you guys behave, we won't do a thing.

312
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,690
Brother.

313
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,650
He...

314
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,430
Ling...

315
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,190
...is inside of him.

316
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,450
You used up your regeneration abilities, huh?

317
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,850
Worry not, my son.

318
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,600
I will recreate you.

319
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,740
With your memories, of course.

320
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,580
Humans in chaos, struggle and writhe in agony.

321
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,460
Because that serves as proof that one is alive.

322
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,340
And struggle and kneel before me.

323
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,470
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

324
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,470
Episode 29, The Fool's Struggle.

325
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,780
Will the man who had his limbs twisted be able to stand again?
