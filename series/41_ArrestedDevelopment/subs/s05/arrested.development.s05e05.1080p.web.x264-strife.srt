1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,050
<i>Michael was on his way
to see Rebel Alley</i>

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,680
<i>after being less than honest with his son</i>

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>about having broken up with her...</i>

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,680
I got a cactus, for God's sakes.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,730
That's a universal sign
for "things are over."

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,310
<i>...when he'd actually told her...</i>

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,310
I ain't going nowhere.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,360
<i>George Michael had similarly
made a false claim.</i>

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,820
- Do you have plans with Rebel?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,950
- Do you? Good for you guys.
- I do, yeah.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,070
- It's fun. Yeah.
- <i>When the truth was...</i>

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,120
I haven't seen her since I punched him.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,620
<i>And each was worried
the other would say,</i>

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,910
<i>"You lied to me, and that's worse."</i>

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,000
He's gonna say, "And that's worse."

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,130
<i>Michael decided to tell Rebel
he </i>was <i>going somewhere.</i>

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,880
<i>George Michael, meanwhile, was approaching
the same apartment with a plan of his own.</i>

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,380
You take my bag of lacy ticklers,
hoo-ha bras, dog toys,

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,970
and sex knobs with you,
and you act like you're expecting

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,600
a booty call, as the old people
think the young people say.

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,270
Tell her, "I'm here for a quickie,
and I'm out of here." Mr. Brash.

22
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,770
<i>So when Michael saw his son
brashly approaching,</i>

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,610
<i>he decided to be the adult
in the relationship</i>

24
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,570
<i>and avoid conflict by squatting in a bush,</i>

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,780
<i>until his son passed on his way
to what the young people</i>

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,990
<i>refer to as a booty call.</i>

27
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,910
Yeah, standing out here
with a bag of sex toys!

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,160
Let's go! Not getting any less horny
out here. How are you?

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,040
I think she's gone until tomorrow.

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,290
Is she? Good.
'Cause I was getting less,

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,920
uh... what I mentioned earlier.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,920
<i>Moments earlier,
a still squatting Michael</i>

33
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,970
<i>noticed something in the bushes.</i>

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,390
All right in there?

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,690
Hey. Toddler. Hey.

36
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,310
Uh, this looks, um...

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,650
You know, there's a woman in there
who's obsessed with me...

38
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,990
- Oh, this one, too?
- Yep. Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,870
Oh, actually, I have a question for you.

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,080
- Okay.
- I'll come out.

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,080
Oh. Okay.

42
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,540
Do you remember when I called you
about my brother Buster?

43
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,750
The missing person thing. Did he show up?

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,710
- Did anybody claim him?
- They got him.

45
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,710
- They did. I had a feeling.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,760
Well, I'm going home. Okay. Great.

47
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,390
I live here.

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,720
Oh. Didn't know they paid you that fair.

49
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,470
Yeah, good for you.

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,270
That is one dirty cop.

51
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,440
Dad.

52
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,880
<i>But diplomacy won the day.</i>

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,380
Yeah, I'm just... I'm making sure
that she knows that we broke up.

54
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,710
I could run that up for you.
Save you a trip.

55
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,590
Okay. Yeah.

56
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,510
Make sure she doesn't think
<i>you're </i>trying to break up.

57
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,220
Nah.

58
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,430
You reconsidered the scuba trip?

59
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,810
Oh, God, it's tempting as hell, but I...

60
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,480
- You're in love.
- So in love.

61
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,270
Maybe next time?

62
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,020
Promise?

63
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,060
I do.

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,280
Ciao.

65
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,860
I'll see ya.

66
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,910
<i>But moments after leaving
his father's gift</i>

67
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,530
<i>- outside Rebel's door...</i>
- George!

68
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,790
Hey! Oh!

69
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,870
What are you doing here?

70
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,620
Uh, uh, you mean without calling?

71
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,250
I know. I'm sorry.
I was shooting this tiny movie

72
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,250
in Mexico for two months,
and, uh, I meant to call you.

73
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,170
And I just landed.
How did you find out I was back?

74
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,680
Thought I'd get lucky.
Well, you'd get lucky.

75
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,550
I'm sure that strikes you
as inconsiderate... I got it.

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,890
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, he's my hero.

77
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,220
Well, I hope he's not expecting a tip.

78
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,980
- They instruct us not to ask.
- I don't have any cash.

79
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,770
<i>George Michael decided
to split the difference.</i>

80
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,230
Just take it. Jerk. Kidding.

81
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,070
Sorry. Thank you. Beat it.

82
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,030
- Nice guy. Tough job.
- What?

83
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,860
Tough guy. Thinks he's a tough guy.

84
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,620
But he does a nice job.

85
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,700
As do these sex toys
I caddishly brought you.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,580
Wait.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,880
What is <i>this </i>used for?

88
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,960
That is a device

89
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,460
that older people use
to put their shoes on...

90
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,300
<i>...without bending over!</i>

91
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,260
<i>Get Shoedini right this second.</i>

92
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,260
<i>Come on, please!</i>

93
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,510
<i>It's not just a shoehorn.</i>

94
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,890
<i>It's a shoehorn on a stick!</i>

95
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,060
From TV?
Well, I can think of another use for it.

96
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,730
But I've gotta be gone in five minutes.
I've gotta pick up my son.

97
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,150
It's gonna be a quickie,
and then we can get out of here.

98
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,440
<i>Which was the line George Michael
had planned to use,</i>

99
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,610
<i>so he improvised.</i>

100
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,320
Fine, but I hope we can spend
some quality time together later.

101
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,740
Oh, my God, you're the dream boyfriend.

102
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,160
Well...

103
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,290
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>

104
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,420
<i>who lost everything, and the one son</i>

105
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,300
<i>who had no choice
but to keep them all together.</i>

106
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,930
<i>It's...</i>

107
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,930
<i>Having just handed
his son a breakup cactus,</i>

108
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,600
<i>Michael boarded the boat</i>

109
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,270
<i>for his three-month sojourn
to stare at the ocean floor.</i>

110
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,650
<i>But not without some regret.</i>

111
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,860
<i>While up the wharf,
the other Bluths prepared</i>

112
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,620
<i>to graciously receive
the Family of the Year award</i>

113
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,660
<i>they were generously giving themselves</i>

114
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,290
<i>at the banana stand,</i>

115
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,620
<i>only to discover...</i>

116
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,830
- There's no banana stand.
- What happened?

117
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,250
Who was the advance?

118
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,380
Who was the advance team?
You're the campaign manager.

119
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,800
- This could ruin your mother's campaign.
- I can't take credit for this.

120
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,380
<i>Because she had a plan.</i>

121
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,590
Why don't you write a speech
for her to say about you?

122
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,470
When my mom's giving the speech,

123
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,220
we'll be in the background,
and we're going at it.

124
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,810
And then, I open my mouth,

125
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,480
and I have these rotted-out meth teeth,
and I'm like,

126
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,060
"Why do I gotta my cousin
for meth money, Mom?"

127
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,560
Yeah, we're circling it.

128
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,280
- Um, I'll get into it.
- Oh, my God.

129
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,990
Hi, this is Maeby Fünke,
for the Lindsay Bluth campaign.

130
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,700
Where are my meth teeth?
It's been over two hours.

131
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,830
Nobody's seen the stand since Cinco.
Kids probably threw it in the water...

132
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,000
- <i>Which was bad news for Tobias...</i>
- You can't have

133
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,040
a family-friendly banana stand award
without a man dressed... What?

134
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,460
<i>...who had finally found a way
to slip into the family.</i>

135
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,510
I'm out. I know.

136
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,220
I get it.

137
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,180
I feel like a moron.

138
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,270
All right. We're set up.
Paid the crew $75 an hour. Let's go.

139
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,390
- Let's go.
- Wait.

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,520
Lindsay's not here. Why are we starting?

141
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
It's okay. I'll go.

142
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,520
I got something for Dad, anyway.

143
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,690
This is <i>O.C. Can You Say by the Sea.</i>

144
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,860
We're bringing you

145
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,700
the first annual Family of the...

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,200
Of the Year!

147
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,620
Let's hear it for the... of the Year!

148
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,630
I thought there was gonna be music or...

149
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,960
Thank you, Beard, for...

150
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,840
"Dad...

151
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,850
You were always there for me.
You were always there for me.

152
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,890
And, man, we've had fun together.

153
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,190
How about that Mexico trip?

154
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,440
Things we'll remember:

155
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,320
'always horny' shirts...

156
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,150
eating chips in the car...

157
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,320
'Shut up, G.O.B.!'

158
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,790
And almost making love
to some roadside bushes.

159
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,290
'Shh. Don't tell Mom!'"

160
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,080
What?

161
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,420
"Remember how our Winnebago
got demolished by that train?

162
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,920
So many memories.

163
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,300
That's why all you have to do
is look at me, and you'll realize

164
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,560
that you've done something great
in this life.

165
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,980
You are the golden anchor of this family,

166
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,360
the man who not only left his mark
on Newport

167
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,820
with the great banana... stand...

168
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,160
up. Good habit. Standing is... Yep.

169
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,370
You always leave your mark
everywhere you sit.

170
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,700
So I give you

171
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,870
the biggest anchor of gold in the world.

172
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,500
I only wish it were real gold
so that you wouldn't have 30 years

173
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,170
of hard work ahead of you."

174
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,130
Thirty years!

175
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,090
<i>What a horrible speech.</i>

176
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,510
Oh, my gosh.

177
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,510
Uh, thank you.

178
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,930
I, uh...

179
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,980
Oh, wow, it's heavy. I haven't...
This, uh, well...

180
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,190
Let 'em try to take this away from me,
huh?

181
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,860
They'll have to pry it
out of your cold, dead hands.

182
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,320
<i>And soon, Lindsay arrived</i>

183
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,530
<i>in what was her second outfit of the day.</i>

184
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,610
Oh, you're not wearing that.

185
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,780
You're running to fill a House seat,
not a sofa.

186
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,410
I'm starting to worry
you're not even capable

187
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,620
of saying something nice
about me in your speech.

188
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,370
Lindsay, saying nice things
about you is easy.

189
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,750
Oh, Mom.

190
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,750
The hard part is not sounding sarcastic.

191
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,460
Oh, now, seriously, go change.

192
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,920
That outfit shouldn't even come
in that size.

193
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,300
How about this, Mom?

194
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,470
Nothing to criticize now. Happy?

195
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,310
Come on,
let me hear one of your crinkly smiles.

196
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,890
At least it fits.

197
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,230
- Look who grew out of her sheet.
- I thought about it.

198
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,940
It's a big day.
I'm being honored. I should look my best.

199
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,650
Well, let me know when you do.

200
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,070
And you just won yourself
a sheet-covered daughter.

201
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,910
Take that off.

202
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,580
The cameras are getting this.

203
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,490
You don't like anything
under this. Why should I take it off?

204
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,040
You don't have a speech for me.

205
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,660
You're going to be surprised

206
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,830
when I get up there.

207
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,590
Know what your number one tool is
for a scuba diver?

208
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,130
Your sun. All right?
You gotta see how the sun

209
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,100
is coming through the ocean,
'cause that's gonna be your guiding light.

210
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,760
<i>And as Michael
faced his biggest fear,</i>

211
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,930
<i>leaving behind his son...</i>

212
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,270
I gotta go back. You can't leave.

213
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,100
- Turn this around.
- Too late.

214
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,020
- Double dock fees. Got a tight schedule.
- <i>...his son showed up,</i>

215
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,780
<i>willing to face a big fear himself.</i>

216
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,070
Hey! Hey!

217
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,200
What are you doing?
I was coming back to you.

218
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,910
What? No, I just...

219
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,410
I don't want to leave things
emotionally ambiguous

220
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,330
- or unresolved!
- I don't want to leave

221
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,460
without having some sense of the...

222
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,290
- ...value of this relationship!
- What?

223
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,250
<i>The farther away they got,
the more they realized</i>

224
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,250
<i>they did have to say to each other.</i>

225
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,340
- What?
- Stay there.

226
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm coming back. We're coming back.

227
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,620
<i>And without the ability to speak,</i>

228
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,750
<i>they resorted to a language
they'd learned long ago.</i>

229
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,420
<i>Which was all
that needed to be said,</i>

230
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,170
<i>but the moment was short-lived.</i>

231
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,330
You do this!
You always try to save everyone.

232
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,670
I'm literally saving you. Come on.

233
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,420
Turn over on your back, like an otter.

234
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,470
- Were you trying to kill yourself?
- No.

235
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,340
I dropped my prize,
and I was trying to find it.

236
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,850
I would've been fine.

237
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,100
Maybe I was trying to save you. Want to save me?
Stop playing games with me.

238
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,350
Stop trying to teach me a lesson
by hiding Buster.

239
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,480
I talked to a cop. I know someone got him.

240
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,650
Got him?
Michael, we don't have Buster.

241
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,940
We would never make you worry.
We love you.

242
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,400
That's why we got rid
of your $700,000 debt.

243
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,820
Hang on. What are you talking about?

244
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,120
I thought that was Lucille 2.

245
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,240
- You forgave the debt?
- Of course we did.

246
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,540
I mean, well, no, technically,
we forgot the debt.

247
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,130
We can forget it,
but we can never forgive it.

248
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,840
- We need the write-off.
- Why'd you think

249
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,460
they were trying to teach you a lesson?

250
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,340
Because I was teaching them a lesson.

251
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,720
- Huh?
- He knows.

252
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,590
I declared Buster missing,

253
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,350
and then they were gonna try
to teach me a lesson, right?

254
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,930
By having the fake Buster over at Lucille 2's
today when I walked in, so that I would still think

255
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,270
that Buster was still missing.

256
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,110
How did they know
you were gonna walk in today?

257
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,230
What's that?

258
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,570
It was a last-minute trip.

259
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,780
You just came down to get your scuba gear.

260
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,700
<i>It wasn't a half bad point.</i>

261
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,410
Well, I gotta find a phone.

262
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,620
<i>And back at the ceremony,
Lucille had taken the podium</i>

263
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,540
<i>to deliver a speech her daughter thought</i>

264
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,080
<i>- she had failed to write.</i>
- "As grateful as I am

265
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,460
to be with my family today,

266
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,090
I want to make special mention
of my only daughter,

267
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,380
who thinks I didn't write a speech.

268
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,310
This young woman has had
to show enormous strength,

269
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,230
and not just to endure
having me as a mother.

270
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,400
But she's the one we honor today,

271
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,570
a woman I should have honored long ago,

272
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,240
because I've got a daughter
who has many faces,

273
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
and all of them are beautiful.

274
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,780
She stole my speech.

275
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,330
Maybe you can show the world
the smile I love so much.

276
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,790
That doesn't make sense
without meth teeth! <i>But it made sense to Lindsay.</i>

277
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,250
I've been wanting to hear that.
I didn't think I would.

278
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,340
- Well, now you have.
- God, it was my dream.

279
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,340
What a waste of a dream.

280
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,640
It's nothing.
I can see that now.

281
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,180
I think I'm gonna go now.

282
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,430
Find out who my real family is.

283
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,730
<i>And though her mother
had stolen a speech from Maeby...</i>

284
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,060
Find my real mother.

285
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,110
<i>- ...Lindsay stole a line from Michael.</i>
- I'm out of here.

286
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,030
<i>Maeby had planned on
humiliating her mother,</i>

287
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,780
<i>but her mother was leaving,
and she wanted to give her</i>

288
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,290
<i>one last kiss goodbye,
before the cameras left.</i>

289
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,290
<i>But George Michael
had learned a thing or two,</i>

290
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,250
<i>and he learned
both those things in Spain.</i>

291
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,500
- Hmm.
- That takes the fun out of it.

292
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,670
Maybe we should kiss again
to teach them a lesson. Yeah?

293
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,260
Okay,

294
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,510
you're presenting awards
on a crime scene, and that is,

295
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,050
of course, against the law.

296
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,510
What the hell is going on?!

297
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
Why?
Because the banana stand is gone?

298
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,600
No, because of
the bloody trail that led to it.

299
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,100
Ah, I've said too much.

300
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Where the hell did you run off to?

301
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,780
Michael tried to kill himself.

302
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,150
I got there in time to save him,

303
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,150
- but he doesn't have Buster.
- What?

304
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,990
<i>Which was good news for Tobias,
who was already in his backup costume.</i>

305
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,330
And my name is Buster Bluth,
and, yes, I am a monster.

306
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,620
Buster? Isn't he supposed to be in jail?

307
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,460
Well, that's not exactly
what I was going for, but sure.

308
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,790
Oh! But they're buying it, see?

309
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,800
Um, hey, uh,
I just found out that they're, uh,

310
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,840
holding Buster in jail.

311
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,470
- Buster's in jail?
- Why?

312
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,350
He walked into the police station,
and they're holding him for something.

313
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,430
Why would Buster go to the police?

314
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,730
The truth, Mom? I told him to.

315
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,020
But I wanted to make it clear
that I'm never coming back again.

316
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,190
<i>And that's when Michael decided
to try out a new line.</i>

317
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,900
Okay, I will stay.

318
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,330
<i>The Bluths were waiting
for news about Buster,</i>

319
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,790
<i>whom they'd just discovered
had been in jail.</i>

320
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,910
Buster's been trapped here for months. <i>His mother was worried.</i>

321
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,130
God knows what he's told them.

322
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,800
Like we don't have enough on our plate

323
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,210
with Lindsay running off
before the election.

324
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,220
I left word for Barry. The guy
in his office thinks bail's gonna be 50.

325
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Well, you're paying for it, not us.

326
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,470
That would wipe me out, Mom.

327
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,810
This is your fault.

328
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,980
You lied to us about
Buster being missing

329
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,560
to teach us a lesson.

330
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,110
Because you lied to Buster
that I agreed to look after him.

331
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,230
I didn't lie.

332
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,780
I saw you that night at the pier
and asked you to.

333
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,080
For the last time, I was not there.
Or, if I was there, I have no memory.

334
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,410
Okay. Does it matter
who remembers what, Michael?

335
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Just forget that.

336
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,120
Bluth?

337
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,460
Yes.

338
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,630
Only one of you.

339
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,880
Okay.

340
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,260
- What?
- You're the one he's gonna want to see.

341
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,510
He didn't want to see me
last time I talked to him.

342
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,850
He said he was all grown up
and found a new mother.

343
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,600
God.

344
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,140
What a baby thing to say.

345
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,400
I think this is a job
for the man in charge...

346
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,690
of the president, so, Dad.

347
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,360
Okay. I'll go in,

348
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,870
but I don't think it's gonna help
if I go in and take a swing at a guard.

349
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,200
Uh, maybe I stab one of them.

350
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,910
No, the only way you're stabbing
anything is if you have a knife.

351
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,880
That's what he meant.

352
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,880
- That's what I meant.
- Okay. I'm gonna go in.

353
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,340
It's getting rough out here. Guard?

354
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,340
So, Mom wouldn't come in, huh?

355
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,340
How'd you know she was here?

356
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,100
I can smell her on you.

357
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,850
Ah. Right. I forgot, you're good at that.

358
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,770
I remember that time
she changed her perfume

359
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,140
and she lost you at the park.

360
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,310
Yeah. That never happened.

361
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,860
It was at Nordstrom's, and Mother
was ambushed by the Charlie girl.

362
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,030
Yes. And we found you
in the break room with the Chanel man.

363
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,070
He should never have lost his job
for that.

364
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,950
What happened?

365
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,910
He was just giving me a Fanta!

366
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,160
I know I should've spoken up
for him, but I was only a boy.

367
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,000
- Barely out of my teens. I didn't...
- Currently.

368
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,420
I'm wondering what happened here.
You were supposed to lay low, remember?

369
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,710
Go to the station, say you're not missing.

370
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,590
That's what I did.
I was supposed to be mother bait,

371
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,760
but mother never came to pick me up.

372
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,010
Mm-hmm.

373
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,850
Did she even know I was missing?

374
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,890
No. You were no longer missing
after you got arrested.

375
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,810
Did you tell them that you found Lucille 2
passed out on the stair car?

376
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,980
I said "dead."

377
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,360
Maybe they said "dead,"
and I said, "I wish."

378
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,320
Why'd you do that?

379
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,150
I thought it was funny.

380
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,740
Oh, by the way,
I also told <i>you </i>that I saw her

381
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,200
on the stair car, Michael.

382
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,040
- I thought you were trying to be funny.
- You have a weird sense of humor.

383
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,040
<i>Weeks earlier...</i>

384
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,420
Tell me why she's there one minute
and gone the next.

385
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,290
<i>...the cops had no sense of humor.</i>

386
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,840
Maybe she crawled away.

387
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,050
She was always falling down
or crawling away

388
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,380
or rolling off-camera and stuff.

389
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,890
I don't know why it's a crime
to not know where someone is.

390
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,720
No. It's... This part is the crime.

391
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,470
<i>Having seen he was
caught on camera,</i>

392
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,520
<i>Buster had tried to erase
the security tape.</i>

393
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,440
<i>Unfortunately, to do so,</i>

394
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,480
<i>he used his nephew's software, Fakeblock,</i>

395
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,650
<i>which was fake,
so it couldn't block anything.</i>

396
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,070
<i>- But it was easy to dance to.</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

397
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,030
That's because if you saw the first video,

398
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,740
you'd think,
"Why didn't that guy just erase this?"

399
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,790
Some might consider that
tampering with evidence.

400
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,750
- Thanks. You can go.
- Thank you.

401
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,590
You had me come
all the way down here

402
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,460
so I could play a video off our Dropbox?

403
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,050
Oh. "Okay, evidence guy,
we're done with you."

404
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,590
Well, it's your job.

405
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,390
Putting it on Dropbox is my job.

406
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,600
Walking a mile to my parking spot

407
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,180
'cause you can't admit
you don't know how to use Dropbox!

408
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,020
That's not even his job.

409
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,230
He's as much of a detective as someone

410
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,310
- with "detective" in their title.
- I don't care about

411
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,770
- the evidence guy.
- Join the club.

412
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,280
Why were you trying to erase a tape?

413
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,400
I panicked.

414
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,910
I had had a fight with Lucille 2
because she made me miss Mom's trial,

415
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,700
and I guess somebody saw us fighting, and if anything happened
to her, you know they love to blame it on the crazy vet.

416
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,040
Oh. I'm trying to do air quotes,

417
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,960
but they metal-strapped my hand
because people were using it

418
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,670
to make tattoos when I was asleep.

419
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,460
- What's going on with the other?
- This is so I don't take the strap off.

420
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,710
Got it. Okay, I got a call into Barry.

421
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,720
He's gonna get you out, and I'm sure

422
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,430
nothing you've said is admissible,
unless you've...

423
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,550
Waived my rights to an attorney? I did.

424
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,810
- What for?
- What for? You told me to.

425
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,940
Plus, I didn't want the evidence guy
to have walked all that way for nothing.

426
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,320
<i>Michael had just left the prison</i>

427
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,030
<i>- when his attorney called.</i>
- <i>I'm here.</i>

428
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,400
At the prison? You're at the prison?

429
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,530
Yeah. And I'm not making a lot of friends,
either.

430
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,080
The guards hate me, 'cause what is
a defense attorney doing here?

431
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,370
And the inmates hate me,

432
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,420
'cause what is a defense attorney doing
in the shower?

433
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,290
What are you doing in there, Barry?

434
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,590
Legally, it's the only place
they can't record you

435
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,710
when you talk to inmates.

436
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,800
- <i>I don't think that's true.</i>
- Really?

437
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,590
<i>- I got the worst clients.</i>
- Look, have you seen Buster?

438
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,390
<i>No, my hands are tied till you post bail.</i>

439
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,810
I think the clerk said it was $50,000.

440
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,940
<i>Call Raphael at Atomic Bonds,
tell him it's for Barry.</i>

441
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,020
We can talk next steps with Buster
at your place tomorrow in person.

442
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,690
<i>- I prefer things face-to-face.</i>
- Less chance of a misunderstanding.

443
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,820
<i>Okay, I'll do it.
I'll get the bail. I'll cover it.</i>

444
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,240
I just, I hope that our position
has not been greatly weakened.

445
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,160
Of course we're gonna have
a great weekend.

446
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,540
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

447
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,500
<i>And so, the next day,
the family gathered</i>

448
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,670
<i>under a banner they'd been repurposing
for a party</i>

449
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,250
<i>customized to Buster's limited palate.</i>

450
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,600
Uh, yeah, I guess I'll take
a hamburger with two tops.

451
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,600
Michael said Barry would be here
with Buster over an hour ago.

452
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,770
Maybe Buster made him stop
to make sure nobody found the body.

453
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,650
Lucille 2's fine.

454
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,980
Believe me,
she's somewhere with a new chin,

455
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,940
sipping steak through a straw.

456
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,740
You know,
if Buster was a murderer,

457
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,240
your mother would be in danger.

458
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,330
Maybe I should move into the cottage
with you two.

459
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,700
That way, one of us can always be awake.

460
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,750
As your therapist, I encourage you

461
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,130
to let go of relationships
that don't serve you.

462
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,090
You're no longer my therapist.

463
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,170
Okay. We're making progress.

464
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,050
Then, as your roommate,
I encourage you to claim your space.

465
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,470
You're no longer my roommate.

466
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,180
You are just progressing
by leaps and bounds.

467
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,430
A victim of my own competence.

468
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,020
And this goes for your... hold this...

469
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,860
"acting partner," too.

470
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,530
Oh, he's more than my acting partner.

471
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,820
Much more. He's my, uh...

472
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,990
Boyfriend.

473
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,030
They think, they think
that we're boyfriends, Dad.

474
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,450
Well, thanks for giving away
that surprise!

475
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,120
I'm his bastard father.

476
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,000
This is my bastard son, Murphybrown.

477
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,250
Murphy? And his last name is Brown?

478
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,000
No. Murphybrown is his first name.

479
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,590
His last name is... uh...
Well, now it's Fünke.

480
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,760
- Oh, that's how you say it.
- Yes.

481
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,600
He's named after a famous
private investigator who worked

482
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,600
for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>
and then for <i>The Washington Post.</i>

483
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,270
I believe it is a character from TV

484
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,190
that was played by Candice Bergen.

485
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,360
Mm.

486
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,360
Well, that is a coincidence.

487
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,410
Uh, now I have two things
to be embarrassed about,

488
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,450
the second being keeping this a secret
for so long, and...

489
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,870
I feel like I should apologize
to maybe...

490
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,540
half the people in this room,

491
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,670
but maybe most of all...

492
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,300
Mother Bluth, because bringing my son

493
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,550
back into our family
clearly drove Lindsay away.

494
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,220
Wait, Mom left?

495
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,430
Then why am I wearing this?

496
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,520
Oh, uh, before I forget,
this is your half-sister, Maeby.

497
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,310
Close one! I think

498
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,480
she's rather very hot.

499
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,690
She okay?

500
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,020
Oh, she'll be fine.

501
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,980
I was here for her entire childhood.

502
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,030
Let's put a nugget in your mouth.

503
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,070
You're being sweet to me.

504
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,780
He's here. He's here!

505
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,660
- Should we hide? Everybody, hide.
- He's innocent, coward.

506
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh, God, Barry. Barry.

507
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,290
You guys, you guys, you are the best!

508
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,340
- This is so wonderful.
- Barry?

509
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,880
- Yeah?
- Where's Buster?

510
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,220
In jail.

511
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,970
Is this your cover
just to throw me this party?

512
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,350
- Thank you.
- Barry, what's... hang on.

513
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,600
What's going on? I talked to you.
I told you Buster was in jail.

514
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,600
You said you were, too,
and that if I could get bail

515
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,400
to your guy...

516
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,860
...then we can talk next steps with Buster

517
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,900
<i>at your place tomorrow in person.</i>

518
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,490
Thanks.

519
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,740
So, you're saying
I paid to bail you out?

520
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,660
You weren't gonna leave me there,
were you?

521
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,660
I did not know you were <i>in </i>jail.

522
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,750
That's why I like to do things
face-to-face, okay?

523
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,540
- Understood.
- Oh-ho-ho!

524
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,120
Michael, you did it!

525
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,000
You didn't know that Barry was in jail?

526
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,460
God, this is so...
This is hysterical. This is priceless.

527
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,670
One for the ages, Dad.

528
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,930
No, this is never gonna get
out of my system.

529
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,680
- You okay?
- What made you think Buster was in jail?

530
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,850
- You thought that he was gonna kill you.
- True.

531
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,520
G.O.B., Buster <i>is </i>in jail.

532
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,650
Oh. Right.

533
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
We were just there.

534
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,070
Michael made an honest mistake.

535
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,410
Geez, I hope Buster doesn't kill us
for laughing.

536
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,210
<i>With danger lurking,
the Bluth family tightens their ranks.</i>

537
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,920
- This doesn't leave this house!
- All right.

538
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,420
All right. It's fine.
The boy can be trusted.

539
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,090
Are we absolutely sure about that?

540
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,970
Why don't we let the boy
speak for himself?

541
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,550
Am I the boy?

542
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,890
- I've never heard a man ask that question.
- Nor have I.

543
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,930
You know
what would be a good idea?

544
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,690
Why don't you get me a Fanta
on your way out of the family.

545
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,770
It's in the fridge.
