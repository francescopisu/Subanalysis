1
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,430
All right!

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,640
<i>Michael Bluth had been away
from his family for two months,</i>

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,600
<i>and his life had never seemed better.</i>

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,640
Oh, head in the sand!

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,690
<i>While at a tech company famous
for providing access to any information,</i>

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,150
<i>except for its own name,</i>

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,730
<i>- he had found friends...</i>
- Jim.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,440
- Oh, nice return, Jim.
<i>- ...been retrained for the workplace...</i>

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,650
It's just <i>one </i>space after a period?

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,030
That's okay. Let's try it again.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>...and was learning new skills every day.</i>

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,540
Hi, sorry I'm late.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,620
- How you doing?
<i>- Konnichiwa.</i>

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,750
- So, is your family joining you?
- No.

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,750
They will not be joining, um,
but, um, maybe just, uh,

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,340
one of their kids can take a swing at me,
huh?

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,300
<i>While he believed
he had put his family behind him...</i>

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,550
This class is geared more to self-defense
<i>for </i>the family, not...

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,930
Not <i>from </i>the family.

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,470
<i>- ...there were some unresolved issues.</i>
- I get that.

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,890
Do you have family-on-family stuff?

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,440
A few years ago,
I would have given you the same look.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,070
<i>In those few years,
Michael's life had changed quite a bit.</i>

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,990
<i>After borrowing money
from a flirtatious family friend...</i>

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,490
- Just till I get on my feet.
<i>- ...whose vertigo made it hard</i>

26
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,780
<i>for her to stay on her </i>own <i>feet,</i>

27
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,830
<i>Michael finally started
his own housing business.</i>

28
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,710
- The collapse of the housing market...
- <i>At the worst possible time.</i>

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,500
That's not a great sign.

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,000
<i>But Michael soon had
another business opportunity.</i>

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,960
- I'm a producer?
- Well, it's a movie about the family.

32
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,800
Although, the heartbeat of this thing
is the father-son dynamic.

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,390
- <i>Which put Michael off the project.</i>
- I'm not able to do this.

34
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,060
<i>Until a chance run-in
with actress Rebel Alley...</i>

35
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,850
- I'm sorry.
- Where's a producer when you need one?

36
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,230
<i>- ...put him back on it.</i>
- I'm a movie producer!

37
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,310
<i>And having found
his new leading lady...</i>

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,980
I could put your name in for something.

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,230
<i>...who turned out to be
Ron Howard's daughter,</i>

40
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,740
<i>Michael was soon acting
like a movie producer, too.</i>

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,410
<i>Michael's son was starting
a business</i>

42
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,910
<i>after claiming to have invented
a new privacy software.</i>

43
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,620
...software that's also anti-piracy?
You have a way of doing this?

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,580
This could be huge.

45
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,290
<i>Not exactly. It did do this.</i>

46
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,210
...of what programmers
call "hacker traps."

47
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,630
- It's called Fakeblock.
- <i>And word spread.</i>

48
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,090
How does your software work?

49
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,340
<i>Garnering attention
from the same actress to whom</i>

50
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,010
<i>- he gave a fake name.</i>
- George Mi... Harris.

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,300
<i>And soon,
George Michael was acting like a...</i>

52
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,640
<i>well, a movie producer, too.</i>

53
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,600
<i>She was raised by a different mother
than Ron's other kids.</i>

54
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,650
<i>It's just a whole different thing
over there.</i>

55
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,150
<i>Anyway, with Maeby
in charge of the business,</i>

56
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,360
<i>George Michael soon found himself in debt.</i>

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,990
Maeby, we can't afford this.

58
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,780
And my software isn't even rea... dy.

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,280
- <i>He found one place to save money.</i>
- Maeby, you're fired!

60
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,490
<i>And though Michael was losing Rebel</i>

61
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,210
<i>- to her mystery man, he got good news.</i>
- You're dating Rebel Alley?

62
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,250
Do you know the other guy
that she's dating?

63
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,710
No. I know it's over.

64
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,000
She is dumping him.

65
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,920
<i>Which he promptly acted upon.</i>

66
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,090
<i>But it wouldn't be long
before Michael discovered who George...</i>

67
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,800
<i>- "Maharis" really was.</i>

68
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,470
<i>Something he kept to himself
when his son admitted...</i>

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,970
- I think it might be over.
- Great.

70
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,850
Pain... fades slowly.

71
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,610
- <i>But Michael knew...</i>
- Quickly.

72
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,730
<i>...he'd have to end it.</i>

73
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,400
Tell me about your girlfriend.
You're producing this movie...

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,820
I think they're both over.
Wasn't meant to be.

75
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,990
You owe my sister $700,000.

76
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,870
<i>This, combined with a threat
from Lucille 2's brother...</i>

77
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,160
- You can't hide in a gorilla suit from me.
- <i>That one's hard to explain.</i>

78
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,290
<i>...sent Michael to a night of drinking
and a desperate proposal</i>

79
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,210
<i>to get his $700,000 debt forgiven...</i>

80
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,670
I'm gonna have sex with you, for money.

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,470
<i>...that perhaps overestimated his value,
at least according</i>

82
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,220
<i>to the latest
Balboa Bachelor Auction totals.</i>

83
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,520
<i>And returning from a night with Lucille 2,</i>

84
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,900
<i>which ended poorly,
Michael ran into a brother...</i>

85
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,860
I went to see Lucille 2,
and I lost control.

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,440
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

87
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,490
<i>...who had also done something
he wanted Michael to forget.</i>

88
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,110
- Was that wax?
- <i>Put the mask on!</i>

89
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,030
<i>Which is how he ended up drugged
on the floor of the model home...</i>

90
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,080
- It's easy to forget.
<i>- ...where he peacefully slept,</i>

91
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,120
<i>deterring at least one badly needed buyer.</i>

92
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,000
...some of the neighbors
are not to be desired. Oh!

93
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,050
One got in.
You know, I have other properties...

94
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,760
<i>And missing a visit
from </i>Predator Entrapment <i>host</i>

95
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,430
<i>John Beard, who had arrived to retrieve</i>

96
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,720
<i>some hidden cameras, now that it looked</i>

97
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,010
<i>like his predator hole
had been fished out.</i>

98
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,020
<i>It would be another full night</i>

99
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,150
<i>before Michael would come up with a way
to work off his $700,000 debt...</i>

100
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,440
...repay you that loan.

101
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,610
<i>...that he'd forgotten
he'd already come up with.</i>

102
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,320
<i>It was the next call to the woman
he believed his son had broken up with...</i>

103
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,200
The thing with the other guy,
we don't have to talk about that.

104
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,200
<i>...that Michael would most regret.</i>

105
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,620
- Goodbye.
- <i>But there would have to be</i>

106
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,080
<i>one more conversation.</i>

107
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,750
Who was that?

108
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,800
No one.

109
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,630
<i>Michael Bluth left
for his date with Rebel,</i>

110
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>surprised to find people working on
what he thought was a holiday.</i>

111
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,390
Boy, you guys don't miss a day.

112
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,430
- <i>Michael had missed two.</i>
- Yeah.

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,690
- What, are you tenting the place?
- Hey, Michael. Yeah.

114
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,310
We're getting everything prepped.

115
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,520
Not sure if Maeby's in there,
or Tobias, or something?

116
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,940
Mind if we use the stairs?

117
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,070
Gob said he heard something in the attic.

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,530
Oh, yeah, uh, well...

119
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,700
Hopefully, it's not my father.

120
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,240
George Sr.!

121
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,620
Okay.
This bug guy really knows our family.

122
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,620
<i>Michael went to find the source
of the noise,</i>

123
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,630
<i>and soon came across a reminder
of a simpler time,</i>

124
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,800
<i>and his dream of taking his son
on a scuba diving trip.</i>

125
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,140
<i>He'd started the boy young,
getting him trained in</i>

126
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,970
<i>- underwater communication.</i>
- Underwater communication.

127
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,350
"Are you okay?"

128
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,100
- "Yes, I'm okay."
- Okay.

129
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,770
I've wanted to ask you that underwater.

130
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,770
<i>But soon,
the sign language turned...</i>

131
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,520
- "Out of oxygen."
<i>- ...to more pressing threats.</i>

132
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,780
Now, that's one
you're gonna need to know.

133
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,650
- Mm-hmm.
- Who remembers

134
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,650
- "shark"? Huh?
- Shark, that's easy.

135
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,160
- Yeah. Huh?
- "Manta ray."

136
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,490
But don't do that around the shark.
They eat them.

137
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,450
You got "boat," "jellyfish,"

138
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,460
"propeller," and "electric eel." Ouch!

139
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay. Let's hit the pool.

140
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,920
<i>Ironically, it was this final threat
that did young George Michael in.</i>

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,460
- We put on our tanks and we...
- Oh.

142
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,760
George Michael? George Michael?

143
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,970
Hey, pal.

144
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,590
Here we go.

145
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,260
<i>Michael soon found reminders</i>

146
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,060
<i>of other scuba attempts they've made.</i>

147
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
- Huh? That was great.
- Oh, yeah.

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,150
You really conquered the pool.

149
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,150
I think you're ready for the ocean.

150
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,690
Huh.
I thought we were going to the Reef.

151
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,650
We are. It's in the ocean.

152
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,900
I thought it was a restaurant
by the pool.

153
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,410
Why did you think I said,
"Watch out for the crabs"?

154
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,950
Why did you think I said, "I always get a hamburger"?
- I thought you were kidding.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,830
Buddy? Hey. George Michael?
Oh, he's done it again.

156
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,880
There it is.

157
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,090
Deep breath, buddy.

158
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,210
<i>And Michael found himself
caught off guard</i>

159
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,170
<i>by the fact that his son had grown</i>

160
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,760
<i>right out of his childhood.</i>

161
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,140
<i>And by the brother
who had squeezed himself</i>

162
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,390
<i>- right into it.</i>

163
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,310
Oh, God!

164
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,980
Buster? Buster? Hey.

165
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,690
<i>Fortunately, this wasn't
Michael's first scuba scare... scare.</i>

166
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,320
Ah! Okay. Hey.

167
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,900
Michael. Hi.

168
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,530
Am I that much of a monster, Michael?
Even to you?

169
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,870
No, not at all,
I just wasn't expecting, uh,

170
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,250
you know, a man to be sitting
in a Scuba Jr.,

171
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,250
leaping out at me
up in the attic, that's all.

172
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,960
That's all.

173
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,710
I guess that is a little strange.

174
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,010
- You should've seen your face.
- Yeah, yeah, well...

175
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,340
You looked like a little girl.

176
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,720
Oh, God!

177
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,140
Look at that.

178
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,510
Got a new hand?

179
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,760
No, I just took the skin off.

180
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,390
- It's in the dryer.
- All right.

181
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,940
- Buddy, you cannot be up here, okay?
- The tent thing, I know.

182
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,230
I mean, thank God
I found some scuba equipment

183
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,150
because they are fumigating.

184
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,820
Yeah. The skin really muffles the sound
on that.

185
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,570
There's another suit over there;
it's a smaller size, though.

186
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,370
Uh... That's my son's.

187
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,240
- We never got a chance to use it.
- Oh.

188
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,540
Probably too young
to be around the fumes.

189
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,500
No, pal, we were gonna use
this scuba gear for scuba diving.

190
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,750
- Mm.
- Underwater.

191
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,050
- Not to hang out in a poison cloud.
- Mm...

192
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,420
It's father-son bonding
we never got to do.

193
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,220
- Aw.
- Put it on the long list of regrets.

194
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,220
Well, I've had plenty of those
with Mom.

195
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,720
- Have you?
- We used to want to play dress-up.

196
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,020
Her as Jackie O., me as John-John...
But we...

197
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,640
No, I guess we did get to do that
a couple of times.

198
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,850
♪ <i>Motherboy... </i>♪

199
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,310
- I'm sure...
- That isn't a regret.

200
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,190
- Yeah, no, it should be.
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,440
So why are you here at the house?

202
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,610
Ma said she asked you
to look after me.

203
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,910
No. She actually didn't.

204
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,910
And I <i>can't </i>look after you.

205
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,620
And you cannot be here.

206
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,830
You can't say I can't be here
and say you're not looking after me.

207
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,500
Pick a lane, Michael!

208
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,880
I can't believe she did that
without consideration

209
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,420
for what's going on in my life.

210
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,710
Hope I never do that to my own, uh...

211
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,550
um...

212
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,090
- Mom.
- Son.

213
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,220
- Ah. Oh, right.
- Hope I never do that to my son.

214
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,850
<i>And perhaps it was
in this moment</i>

215
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,020
<i>that Michael realized
he couldn't date Rebel anymore.</i>

216
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,060
Okay. Sorry.
I got my own problems I gotta deal with.

217
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,810
Well, I guess I'm a problem.

218
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,150
- Now I'm a problem.
- No, you're not a problem.

219
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,650
Little help? The tank's heavy...

220
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,450
I gotcha.
Oh, you found the flippers, too, huh?

221
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,570
- No, I don't need help.
- You don't? Or you do?

222
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,780
- Oh, pick a lane, Michael.
- I'm trying to help.

223
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,790
- Pick a lane, Buster.
- No, <i>you </i>pick a lane!

224
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,580
- Come on. Ow, ow, ow.
- I picked a lane!

225
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,580
Release that. Release it!

226
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,920
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,960
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

228
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,210
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

229
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,510
<i>It's...</i>

230
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,730
<i>Michael arrived at Rebel Alley's apartment
determined to be honest and end things.</i>

231
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,020
Hey. What are you doing here?

232
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,070
<i>And almost immediately
found himself</i>

233
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,860
<i>helplessly doing the opposite.</i>

234
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,950
I'm dating Rebel Alley.

235
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,450
<i>I'm </i>dating Rebel Alley.

236
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,000
- It's like we're identical...
- <i>There are moments</i>

237
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,790
<i>that are hard to take back.</i>

238
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,250
<i>Moments that create too great a shift
in dynamics.</i>

239
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,260
<i>An earthquake in a family that shatters
both members' notions of themselves.</i>

240
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,970
- ...twin...
- <i>Like when you punch your dad.</i>

241
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,810
I was going to get out of it.

242
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,520
<i>And as they both began to absorb
the weight of what had just happened...</i>

243
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,150
- Hey, I hope I didn't...
- It's forgotten.

244
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,990
- <i>...they acted as if they hadn't.</i>
- And, um, and you...

245
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,990
- I mean, I hope that I...
- Oh, it's in the past.

246
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,700
I'll let you get back to it.

247
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,620
Yes, great, thank you.

248
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,410
Um, I was just leaving, actually.

249
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,620
Yes. Me, too.

250
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,250
I thought you...

251
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,090
I am now.

252
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,300
And was going to earlier.

253
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,640
- Ciao.
<i>- Bella.</i>

254
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,720
<i>Michael returned to the penthouse,</i>

255
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,310
<i>eager to downplay what had happened
with his son.</i>

256
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,190
Otherwise,
I'll just assume that we're good.

257
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,860
Okay. Are we good?
All right.

258
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,230
<i>Michael was equally eager
to avoid Lucille 2...</i>

259
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,690
Goodbye, Missus.

260
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,950
<i>...whom he believed to be
in her apartment...</i>

261
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,120
Boy. It's like the Weimar Republic
in that place.

262
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,790
<i>- ...when his phone finally rang.</i>

263
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,460
Don't hang up, don't hang up,
don't hang up, don't hang up,

264
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,330
don't hang up, don't hang up. Hey, I've been looking for you.

265
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,590
<i>It's Lucille Austero.</i>

266
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,630
<i>- I've been looking for you.</i>
- Oh, hey.

267
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,260
Uh, Lucille, yeah, look...

268
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,220
I...
I called you before, um...

269
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,100
I'm right across the, um, uh, street.

270
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,470
Uh, or city. Street, really.

271
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,680
Our city, um... the... uh...
but we keep

272
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,390
- missing each other, uh...
<i>- ...checkbook...</i>

273
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,350
Uh, I'd much rather do the checkbook.

274
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,770
But I am driving away right now,

275
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,740
so if you actually come out
onto your balcony,

276
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,610
you might even be able to see me driving.

277
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,240
In fact, I think I see you.

278
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,120
Is that you? Can I see you?

279
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,580
<i>Michael couldn't be sure
that she </i>was <i>out on her deck.</i>

280
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,710
<i>While he had second thoughts
about writing... "Love you,"</i>

281
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,210
<i>he couldn't risk her coming out that door.</i>

282
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,710
Hi.

283
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
- She still out?
- Uh, no, no.

284
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,590
She's... she's, uh, she's still
in there, but I gotta...

285
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,010
She's kind of obsessed with me,
so I gotta... go.

286
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,140
<i>But she wasn't in there.</i>

287
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,560
<i>Because moments earlier,
a still very upset George Michael</i>

288
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,110
<i>- called a cousin in that apartment.</i>
- <i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

289
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,570
I'm done being George Maharis.
I need to talk to you.

290
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,690
Look, this isn't a great time, okay?

291
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,450
I'm doing a scrub-down.
Nobody can know I was here,

292
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,450
having a little smooch with my boyfriend.

293
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,620
<i>A boyfriend she was briefly seen
at Lucille 2's apartment with.</i>

294
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,040
<i>While she believed
that he was an undercover cop</i>

295
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,920
<i>- posing as a teenager.</i>
- A señor?

296
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,080
- I'm 17. Ha!
- <i>He turned actually out...</i>

297
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,170
...to be a teenager,
posing as an undercover cop,

298
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,550
posing as a teenager.

299
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,840
<i>It's hard to explain.</i>

300
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,090
No, that actually happened to, like,
two of my neighbors at Sudden Valley.

301
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,010
They're not putting me in Sudden Valley.
I'll tell you that much.

302
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,230
That's why I'm here,
picking up anything I left behind

303
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,940
that might be incriminating.

304
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,190
You know? Just panties, leggings, corsets,

305
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,230
<i>the sex knobs, and one of those
double-headed bondage things</i>

306
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,740
<i>with the curly choke leash.</i>

307
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,900
That's probably a landline.

308
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,820
Ew, gross!

309
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,030
- She put her ear on that?
<i>- I need to talk to you.</i>

310
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,620
It's about my dad.
I'm pulling up to the penthouse

311
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,830
to see if he's here, so...

312
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,540
Wait, you're at the penthouse?
No, no.

313
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,210
Don't come up.
This place is crawling with cops.

314
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,580
<i>I'll meet you there in a second.</i>

315
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,290
<i>I gotta figure out how to get out of here
without being noticed.</i>

316
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,840
Okay, I'll meet you in the courtyard.

317
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,300
- For my dog?
- Whoa!

318
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Wow.

319
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,880
You really snuck in.

320
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,510
Hey, you know
what might look cute on you,

321
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,050
instead of that smock?

322
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,350
Also, do you have any scissors?

323
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,600
<i>And moments later...</i>

324
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,310
Don't hang up,

325
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,690
- don't hang up...
- Okay.

326
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,860
<i>And soon, the cousins</i>

327
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,150
<i>met up in the courtyard downstairs.</i>

328
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,530
- Hey.
- Hey.

329
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,990
- You were at Gangie's penthouse?
- Lucille 2.

330
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,870
Wh...

331
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,120
You drive her car.
How do you still not know who that is?

332
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I punched my dad.

333
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,950
Wow. Uncle Michael?

334
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,460
- Yeah.
- Wow.

335
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,830
You're burning bridges all over the place.

336
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,210
I don't know what to do.

337
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,250
Well, for starters,
you could post it on <i>Dadfights.</i>

338
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,550
Wait, that's a thing?

339
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,130
It's just, like, a bunch of guys
punching their dads, or...?

340
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeah, well, you're supposed to say,
"Guess what, Dad,"

341
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,140
but some dads were catching on,

342
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,390
and they were just whaling on their kids.

343
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,350
You can watch those clips
on <i>That'sWhatSon.</i>

344
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,640
Well, my dad didn't hit me back,
which is even worse.

345
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,150
Still, I mean,
he knew I was the other man.

346
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,480
For God knows how long.

347
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,320
It couldn't have been for long.
He didn't know when I told him.

348
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,950
You told him I was dating Rebel?

349
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,620
Well, technically, I said she was
dumping her boyfriend, but...

350
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,290
Yeah. I was hoping this would happen.

351
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,790
- Hey, you had fired me. I was... bored.
- Mad.

352
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,250
I guess I need to apologize
to him or something.

353
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,880
Well, if he said it was nothing
and now you apologize,

354
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,550
you're gonna make it something.

355
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,300
I mean, what did Gangie always say?
"Forget, but never forgive."

356
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,890
You think she meant to say it that way?

357
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,970
- Yeah.
- Do you think "A friend in need

358
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,480
is no friend indeed"
was also on purpose?

359
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,390
What about "They should take
the rapists and murderers

360
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,360
and put them all together
on an island...

361
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,770
"...and the murderers can be raped,
the rapists can be murdered...

362
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,110
until you only have either
two rapists or

363
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,360
- one murderer
- one raped murderer

364
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,030
- but who cares about him?"
- Oh, was it "one <i>raped </i>murderer"?

365
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,160
I've heard her say both.

366
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,700
I mean, in all likelihood,
the guy would be raped.

367
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,910
I should call him and say I'm sorry.

368
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,910
Look, if you apologize to him,
it's gonna make him feel horrible.

369
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,960
So I think you should do it.

370
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,270
<i>And so,
Michael left another message,</i>

371
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,650
<i>careful not to make his son
feel horrible</i>

372
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,400
<i>with an apology of his own.</i>

373
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,400
I wanted to hit you back...

374
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,530
Uh... sorry, um...

375
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,030
I wanted to make
one thing clear, um...

376
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,830
She, uh... She does not know
that we are father/son.

377
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,700
That I was your, uh, your father.

378
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,330
Uh, that I <i>am </i>your father.

379
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,290
Okay? I will not apologize for that.
Okay?

380
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,420
Or anything, really.

381
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,290
So, no pressure to call me back,

382
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,920
but if you want, um,
you know, hit me back.

383
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,260
Okay? Well...

384
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,390
Again, sorry.

385
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,390
Okay, bye.

386
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,100
<i>And while listening
to make sure the coast was clear,</i>

387
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,810
<i>Michael noticed something
he'd missed before.</i>

388
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,030
Sorry to bother you.

389
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,900
Apparently, Lucille Austero's missed
a couple of speaking engagements.

390
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,070
We're trying to find her.

391
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,570
She-She's not in there?
I thought I heard her in there.

392
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,530
No, it must have been
her housekeeper.

393
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,290
Nobody's seen her since Cinco.

394
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,830
Isn't today Cinco?

395
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,960
Today's the sixth.

396
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,630
Huh. Well, I just talked
to her on the phone,

397
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,300
so she's somewhere.

398
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,210
- If you'll excuse me.
- You're Michael Bluth? - I am Michael Bluth. - Did you write this note?

399
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,010
Yeah, that's one of mine. Who are you?

400
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,680
Uh, Newport Beach Police Department,
Lieutenant Toddler.

401
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,310
Ah. Officer.

402
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,440
- Yeah, hi. I was hoping you were a cop.
- Hi. - Always wanted to be a cop. - Uh-huh.

403
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,650
But they just don't pay fair.

404
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,820
I do okay.

405
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,320
Hmm? Yeah, I'm sure you do.

406
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,570
But, you know, you probably...

407
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,370
you haven't had to pay for
a meal in years, though. Huh?

408
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,910
I mean, I'm sure that you offer, yeah?

409
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,460
Do you talk to Ms. Austero often?

410
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,620
I do not. Not often, no.
I barely know her.

411
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,960
Really? 'Cause it says
right here that you love her.

412
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,510
It does, doesn't it? Yeah.

413
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,090
You know...
"Sorry we keep... love..."

414
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,930
It's the way that I say goodbye.

415
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,640
- Hmm.
- Um...

416
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,430
because you never know, um...

417
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,810
if you're never gonna see someone again.

418
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,140
You should know that.
You see people actually die.

419
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,850
- I've seen one person die.
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,230
A postman.
Uh, was not my favorite day of the year...

421
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,730
...to say the least.

422
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,940
And he is the one that taught me

423
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,820
<i>- about loving each other.</i>
- Love each other.

424
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,160
I guess this is sort of my way
of keeping him alive.

425
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,200
<i>No, it was not.</i>

426
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Is your mother here?

427
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,080
My mother? No.
I'm-I'm all grown up, Toddler.

428
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,330
Okay, 'cause my partner
was here yesterday,

429
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,670
talked to someone who said
that she lived here.

430
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,290
It was a woman with red hair.

431
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,380
<i>In fact, it was George Sr.</i>

432
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,670
<i>Who, after discovering he had
almost no testosterone at all</i>

433
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,050
<i>was frightened and confused</i>

434
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,140
<i>and eager to hide from the world.</i>

435
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,810
I don't allow men in my apartment
without my husband present.

436
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,980
<i>But George Sr. soon realized</i>

437
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,560
<i>his impression of a woman</i>

438
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>wasn't going to win him any awards.</i>

439
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,530
<i>So he took off in his trailer
for Mexico to forget</i>

440
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,440
<i>- his shameful mistakes.</i>

441
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,740
<i>His son Gob, meanwhile,
was also in Mexico.</i>

442
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,160
Hey, there.

443
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,910
Friend of mine left me a note,
um... in my handwriting,

444
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,660
and he said that you might be able
to set me up with the pill

445
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,130
that makes the memories go away,
like a... like a shame-wow.

446
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,960
<i>A request he'd made over 500 times.</i>

447
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,340
See, I did something
a little out of character.

448
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,600
And, um, the window's kind of
closing in on, you know,

449
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,810
before it lodges in the long-term, um...

450
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,390
What do you call it? Um...

451
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,060
What do you call it?

452
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,520
Brains.

453
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,820
Long-term brains.

454
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,660
<i>But the store vendor had seen Gob
more times than he was able to forget.</i>

455
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,910
- Yeah, make a call. Yes, definitely...
<i>- Policía.</i>

456
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,700
Definitely check with Belicia.

457
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,910
Wish her a Happy Five, by the way.

458
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,500
You guys get that here
or is that just out in the States?

459
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,960
Getting in on it.

460
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,340
- Happy Five.
- Oh, thank you.

461
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,550
- How's your Five treating you?
- Dad?

462
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,220
<i>That's when he ran into his father.</i>

463
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,470
Gob. Gob.

464
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,430
What are you doing here?

465
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,100
Here? I'm just getting some boner pills...

466
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,390
...and this guys says
I don't need them.

467
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,560
He knows from boner...
Anyway, what are you doing here?

468
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,270
Me, too, I don't need 'em.

469
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,400
<i>And then Gob had an idea.</i>

470
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,690
What do you say you and I...

471
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,990
<i>A horrible idea.</i>

472
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,320
... our way through Mexico?

473
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,910
<i>This wouldn't be an option</i>

474
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,790
<i>for George Sr., which is why he replied...</i>

475
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,200
Mexico won't be able to walk for a week.

476
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,290
Two full weeks!

477
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,540
- <i>Michael knew none of this.</i>
- <i>That's impossible.</i>

478
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,880
My mother's got brown hair.

479
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,510
You don't know anyone with red hair?

480
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,880
No, I don't know anyone...
Well, I know...

481
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,680
I'm just ending something right now

482
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,550
with a woman who has red hair,
Rebel Alley.

483
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,850
Oh, Ron Howard's daughter.

484
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,560
That's the one. And Ron's got red hair.

485
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,480
So, I guess that's two people
I know with red hair.

486
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,860
Of course, I'm holding a wig
that is made of red hair.

487
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,700
So that's those two and the wig,
I think that's got it.

488
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,200
And my sister has recently
gotten the red hair.

489
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,660
But she's nuts, so...

490
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,080
<i>Actually, Lindsay
had been hiding her identity</i>

491
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,250
<i>with that very wig while dating
a right-wing candidate</i>

492
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,000
<i>whose positions she opposed...</i>

493
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,920
I can't do this

494
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,500
unless you promise to be against the wall.

495
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,800
What the hell?

496
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,210
<i>...and was determined to change.</i>

497
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,970
- Better for my back, anyway.
- Thank you.

498
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,800
<i>But soon, photos of Herbert Love
with a mystery redhead</i>

499
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,510
<i>were used to blackmail her.</i>

500
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,560
- God, that was a photo booth?
- Mm-hmm.

501
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,220
<i>So, it was only once
she ditched the red hair...</i>

502
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,480
I'm a Bluth and so are you.

503
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,060
<i>- ...that she joined the opposition.</i>
- Put up this wall!

504
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,320
<i>Unfortunately,
her candidate encountered</i>

505
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,530
<i>some new opposition.</i>

506
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,990
<i>We have an unconscious</i>

507
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,360
black male choosing not to comply.

508
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,240
<i>Having discovered
he dropped out of the race...</i>

509
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,740
Aggressively come at me!

510
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,830
<i>...Lindsay's political enthusiasm waned.</i>

511
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,000
<i>So, I have no idea where she is,</i>

512
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,670
but, uh, my mother is at Austerity.
It's a rehab clinic.

513
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,670
Actually, we checked the rehab
and your mother wasn't there.

514
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,000
<i>Actually, when Lucille 2
first went missing,</i>

515
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,590
<i>Lucille 1 took the opportunity
to compel her therapist</i>

516
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,430
<i>to change her status
from in- to outpatient,</i>

517
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,260
<i>bypassing both
the Austerity Clinic's red tape</i>

518
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,770
<i>as well as its security tape.</i>

519
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,900
And she was remanded to the care
of your brother-in-law, Tobias Funghi?

520
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,730
- F...
- You don't happen to know

521
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,200
the license plate of the car he drives,
do you?

522
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,820
His license plate number? No, I don't.

523
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,240
I barely know my own license plate number,
much less my brother-in...

524
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,910
It's A-N-U-S
and then for some reason T-A-R-T.

525
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,710
"A new start."

526
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,210
If you saw it written out,
I don't think that you would...

527
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,050
Let me try this one on you.
A-N-A-L-R-A-P...

528
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,220
Well, it doesn't matter.
Listen, I gotta go.

529
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,220
I don't know where my mother
and Tobias are, excuse me,

530
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,800
but they're clearly up to something.

531
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,560
They're not gonna be easy to get back.

532
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,350
Well, Ms. Austero isn't quite
a missing person yet.

533
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,560
We are particularly interested
in talking to Byron,

534
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,440
who she apparently
had a relationship with.

535
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,820
It's Buster. Uh, and that's why I know
that they're up to something,

536
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,990
'cause the last time
that I saw Buster was, um...

537
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,490
Oh, God!

538
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,950
<i>And, resentful of his family,</i>

539
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,490
<i>Michael came up with a plan
to make them come back.</i>

540
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,160
Tell me how
this missing person thing works.

541
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,660
- You want to report him missing?
- I might.

542
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,460
You'd call it in,
but not until he's been gone for 72 hours.

543
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,800
Hmm. I think it's worth the wait.

544
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,510
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay.

545
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,220
That's what we'll do.
Find Buster, you're gonna find Lucille.

546
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,340
Which one?

547
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,590
I don't think he cares.

548
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,390
See you later.

549
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,770
Thank you for your service.

550
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,190
Love you.

551
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,570
<i>Lindsay arrives at the border
she had just called for a wall to protect.</i>

552
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,280
Oh, they have one.

553
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,870
He wants your passport.

554
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,870
Oh, I didn't bring a...
I'm American.

555
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,630
How do you say "I'm American"
in Mexican?

556
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,960
<i>Soy americano.</i>

557
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,130
Hmm. That does sound good.
Ask him for two.

558
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,470
<i>Lindsay is proud</i>

559
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,550
<i>that she thought to include her driver.</i>

560
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,560
<i>And Lucille and her therapist arrive - at their beachside </i>casita.
- Look at them.

561
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,690
Dancing on the beach
like they own the place.

562
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,110
Good. We'll use that.

563
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,190
I want to laser in on that anger.

564
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,690
Look out at the ocean.

565
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,780
Tell me, what does it make you think?

566
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,530
Like, "Everyone's having fun but me,

567
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,080
running and laughing and...

568
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,040
I feel like men run away from me.

569
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,920
- I'm stuck here doing therapy."
- I've been deserted.

570
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,880
Is that my fault? Is it because of my anger? When
I see a squirrelly, little fruitcake like that one

571
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,010
skipping into the ocean, I think,

572
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,890
"Why do I hate him so much?"

573
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,600
That little bald one there
with the fringed cut-offs who...

574
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,720
- Yay!
- Oh,.

575
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,930
It's you.
