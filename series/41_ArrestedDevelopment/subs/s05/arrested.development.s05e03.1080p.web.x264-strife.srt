1
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,220
<i>Now the story
of a wealthy family</i>

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,470
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,100
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,890
<i>It's...</i>

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,900
<i>Michael Bluth had just reunited
with his family.</i>

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,610
Now that the original Michael's back, I suppose we don't
need two hands-on-our-hips, pipe-up-our-rectum scolds.

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,910
So you can go.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,200
Back to playing Tobias. Yes.

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,710
Exactly, because I am still
a valued family member.

10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,500
At least until both signatures are
on the divorce papers, which were

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,840
so cruelly served to me
from the back seat of my car

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,970
by someone who thought
I was a Lyft driver.

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,760
Could have been the pink mustache.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,260
Oh, how funny.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,890
Lucille thought it looked pink, too.

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,810
That's because everybody's thinking

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,480
about Tony Wonder's beard.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,140
- It was pink, right?
- I dyed it

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,400
what I assumed was the color
of Michael's skin.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,110
Although now that you're back,
I do wish I had used

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,900
a less permanent dye.

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,860
I only remember the thing about Tony

23
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,700
because of the "W,"
and his beard was a "W,"

24
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,200
which I thought, you know,
for Wonder, was funny.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,740
You know, it tickled me.

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,660
- His beard tickled me.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,040
And is that part of what
you look so confused about?

28
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,710
It is on the list.

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,960
I want to go back
to why you're all in here, though.

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,420
Oh, we're shooting footage for Lindsay.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,960
Campaign footage.

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,010
<i>- You're </i>running for office now?

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,800
As a matter of fact, I am.
I want to be part of the problem.

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,680
<i>Although, weeks earlier,</i>

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,140
<i>Lindsay wasn't eager
to rejoin the family herself.</i>

36
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,640
So, how's Mom? Is she mad at me?

37
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,440
Mad at you?
Why would she be mad at you?

38
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,610
You didn't hear?

39
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,150
There may be some
compromising pictures of me

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,860
with the candidate Herbert Love.

41
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,910
If she saw those,
she'd never let me hear the end of it.

42
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,660
Oh, listen,

43
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,410
you're intelligent
and you're wonderful and ethical

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,250
and you're great. I mean, don't worry.

45
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,540
She's jealous.

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,130
<i>Lindsay had never heard
her father talk this way.</i>

47
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,880
- Jealous of me?
- Mm.

48
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,300
It's probably just because I'm younger.

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,930
A <i>puta.</i>

50
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,800
You know, yes, she did mention that.

51
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,560
Maybe it's time to just, uh,
change your ways.

52
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Start fresh.

53
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,310
<i>And perhaps Lindsay would have
gotten a little healthier...</i>

54
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,270
<i>...had the cell reception
been a little worse.</i>

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,400
It's Mom.

56
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,780
<i>Mom. Hi.</i>

57
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,490
I need you to run for office.

58
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,410
I told Herbert Love's campaign
that you'd be taking over.

59
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,870
What? No. Mom, I can't do that.

60
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,660
It would mean going up against Lucille 2,
and Sally Sitwell is running her campaign.

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,580
Lucille 2 is not going to be a problem.

62
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,750
<i>And Sally hasn't been seen since Cinco.</i>

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,170
<i>It was true.</i>

64
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,090
<i>Sally had stolen a lot of money.</i>

65
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,720
If G.O.B. finds out you're straight,
he'll use it to ruin you.

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,640
I'll lose the hundred grand
I stole from Lucille Austero

67
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,470
to rebrand you as the gay magician.

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,970
<i>But when Sally found out</i>

69
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>Lucille Austero's political opponent
had been knocked out...</i>

70
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,480
<i>she chose to get out of town</i>

71
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,070
<i>before people started asking questions.</i>

72
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,280
<i>- She packed light.</i>
- I'm wondering if someone could help me.

73
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
- Somebody say "Wonder"?
- Not wonder.

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,990
- No one's wondering!
- <i>Just Tony.</i>

75
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,620
<i>So, you're unopposed...</i>

76
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,660
and I need you. <i>It was the first time</i>

77
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,160
<i>Lindsay's mother had ever told her
she needed her.</i>

78
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,170
You said it.

79
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,290
I said it!

80
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,960
<i>Well, she read it.</i>

81
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,300
<i>George Sr.
and G.O.B. had also been in Mexico</i>

82
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,220
<i>and were growing tired
of their fruitless peacocking.</i>

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,930
I hate everything about my life,
including you.

84
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,440
Well, that's not the horniest thing
I've heard.

85
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,900
Daddy not horny.

86
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,940
Yeah, I guess these shirts

87
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,230
kind of pumped up the pressure on that.

88
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,150
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

89
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,320
I feel like one of these bulls
on my breasts.

90
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,700
His whole life,
he's bred to be the strongest

91
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,830
and the toughest
and he's got to have the biggest balls.

92
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,830
Why?

93
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,500
So when you're in your prime,
they can drug you

94
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,000
and throw you out
in front of a crowd of people

95
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,630
who just want to see you die

96
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,220
so some guy
in crushed velvet pants can come out

97
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,680
and just stick a sword in you.

98
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,810
You're a bull who wants
to stick it in everybody,

99
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,980
and everybody ends up sticking it in you.

100
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,770
<i>And G.O.B. started opening up, too.</i>

101
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,650
I tried to buy those velvet pants.

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,400
But I chickened out
and got these shirts instead.

103
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,410
I have a friend, this guy Tony...

104
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,740
not a friend.

105
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,660
He's nice.

106
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,750
He had a face like mine...

107
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,040
but same.

108
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,550
♪ <i>I started a joke </i>♪

109
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,920
Hello, darkness.

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,010
- ♪ <i>Which started the whole world crying </i>♪
- Sorry, I'm taken.

111
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
What's that from?

112
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,310
<i>G.O.B.'s transformation...</i>

113
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,220
<i>- ...would also be interrupted.</i>
- It's your mother.

114
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,810
We're going back to work.

115
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,520
You're going to be the new face
of the company.

116
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,980
That was Mom.
She wants me back.

117
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,110
My God. Must be nice to be wanted,

118
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,240
even if it's just your mom.

119
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,950
Oh, cry me a blizzard, snowflake.
I gotta run.

120
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,870
You got this, right?

121
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,080
Look who's horny now.

122
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,790
G.O.B. <i>wasn't the only family member</i>

123
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,420
<i>on the verge of growing in Mexico.</i>

124
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,420
As you can see,
the reward is simply in the giving.

125
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,380
Most people, they cannot resist

126
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,220
taking advantage of the truly vulnerable.

127
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
<i>When she, too, received a call.</i>

128
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,050
Oh.

129
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,350
- <i>Mom?</i>
- No, it's Lindsay.

130
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,520
Uh, uh...
Mom. Yes. To you.

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,270
<i>Of course I'm Mom.</i>

132
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,520
I'm running for Congress,

133
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,400
and I don't have a campaign manager
and I need you.

134
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,450
<i>Maeby had never heard
her mother this vulnerable.</i>

135
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,530
Yeah. Sounds great. I'm in.

136
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,410
Hey. It is hard to resist.

137
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,580
Taking advantage of the vulnerable.

138
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,090
- And I'm her campaign manager.
- Is that Maeby?

139
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,840
Oh, my gosh. I didn't even recognize you.

140
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
It's a teenager thing.
I could never pull that off.

141
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,510
They want to look old, we want to look...

142
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,640
You don't look very young.

143
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,890
Oh, the laughter.
That's why we're gonna get the award.

144
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,520
No one's taking it away from us!

145
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,520
Let them try.

146
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,520
The award?

147
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,980
Oh, look at him, like he doesn't know.

148
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,530
- We're going to win Family of the Year.
- Family of the Month.

149
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,200
Year?! Are you for...
Mother Family

150
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,030
- of the Mother Year!
- Of the year.

151
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,450
We just found out!

152
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,330
- Wow.
- We're getting the Golden Anchor Award.

153
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,330
Guess they think
our family's been an anchor

154
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,080
of the O.C. community.

155
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,870
Huh. Who is giving you this award?

156
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,670
Check it, Mike.
My anchor is giving us the award.

157
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,710
See, she used to be
an Orange County weather girl,

158
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,420
which is just tits, teeth and ass, right?

159
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,260
Now she's the host of <i>O.C. Can You Say,</i>

160
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,600
which is tits, teeth, public affairs, ass,

161
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,100
some light interviews.

162
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,220
I mean, it's so much more responsibility!

163
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,520
He's making it sound more important
than it really is.

164
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,520
Is he?

165
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,690
She was married to that news anchor
who said such horrible things

166
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,690
about me when I was trying
to save Buster with that boat.

167
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,360
- John Beard.
- Yeah.

168
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,110
She's my Beard now.

169
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,910
What I meant was,
what organization

170
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,910
- is giving you the award?
- Well,

171
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,700
technically,
it's from the Bluth-Austero Company.

172
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,750
Oh, I see.
So you're giving it to yourself.

173
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,460
Well, it's mostly from the Austero side.

174
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,290
Perfect timing for my campaign.

175
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,630
 Our Lindsay.

176
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,210
I've never been less ashamed of her.

177
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,680
- Did I say what I think I said?
- Yes, you did.

178
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,850
Hey, man, look who's joining in!

179
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,140
Where is Lucille Austero?

180
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
No one knows.

181
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,820
Oh.

182
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,410
She flew the coop.
In the middle of running for Congress.

183
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,420
I mean, no one remembers seeing her
since Cinco de Cuatro.

184
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,840
And we didn't want the crew in our house.

185
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,210
No, and it was okay with Lucille 2.
She gave us the key.

186
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,680
It was during the 1992
African-American riots,

187
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,300
and they had every right.

188
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,100
- Every right.
- Every right.

189
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,970
Mm.

190
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,310
I find all of this...
it's just very hard to believe.

191
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,140
Tell you
what is hard beyond belief.

192
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,730
My God, I wish you could get
a feel on these two things

193
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,520
that Joni's got going over here.

194
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,360
They're like two geodes!

195
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,820
- Hmm.
- You can feel them.

196
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,820
I can't. My go-to joke

197
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,780
is that these are the best two things
John Beard's money can buy.

198
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,080
That's a go-to.

199
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,240
Now you're back.
You'll bring George Michael.

200
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,750
We'll show the world
what a great family we are.

201
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,330
Oh, that's good.
Family is so important to me.

202
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,500
- Sometimes my own family.
-<i> Actually,</i>

203
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,550
<i>Michael hadn't spoken
to his son in months</i>

204
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,260
<i>and didn't even know he had been
in Mexico.</i>

205
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,760
Can we get four pretzels, two Cokes,
and two Mexican Cokes?

206
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,930
My friend, you're in <i>México.</i>

207
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,180
We have Coke and American Coke.

208
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,850
I didn't wish to offend.

209
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,430
I'm sorry. I'm probably grumpy
because I was out

210
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,440
late last night, raping and murdering.

211
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,230
Not cool. I wouldn't joke about that.

212
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,980
I rape and murder, and I joke.

213
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,610
<i>And feeling unwelcome in this land</i>

214
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,910
<i>that was still pretty welcoming,</i>

215
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,950
<i>George Michael returned home,</i>

216
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,370
<i>but wasn't quite ready
to deal with real life.</i>

217
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,170
<i>And seeing his father had left town,</i>

218
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,750
<i>and perhaps not ready to return
to the responsibilities he'd left,</i>

219
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,550
<i>he decided to ease back in,</i>

220
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,680
<i>returning to his childhood home.</i>

221
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,430
Hello? Here to clean the windows!

222
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,430
<i>And upon finding it empty,</i>

223
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,640
<i>he soon began what can
only be described as...</i>

224
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,190
<i>Total regression!</i>

225
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,150
<i>Dangerous Cousins!</i>

226
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,990
Oh, my God, Quicken.

227
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,620
God, it's so much smaller
than I remember.

228
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,290
<i>Perhaps it was a yearning</i>

229
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,290
<i>to go back to a simpler,
less complicated time.</i>

230
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,590
<i>But there was no denying he was older
and more mature.</i>

231
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>Not to mention, looking for love.</i>

232
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,440
<i>But aside from a few setbacks,</i>

233
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,820
<i>George Michael was enjoying
a break from responsibility.</i>

234
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,200
 For scenario two,
you just found out

235
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,410
that your Darth Vader figure
is dating your girlfriend,

236
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,950
and you find out he knew she was your...
Whatever. Who gives a shit?

237
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,370
As usual, guys,
just apply your own scenarios to these.

238
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,130
<i>Soon he, too, was teaching a course
in a program of his own creation.</i>

239
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,250
Go left.

240
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,300
<i>He even inspired a certain move
that would eventually appear</i>

241
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,340
<i>two years later
in a Han Solo origin picture.</i>

242
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,560
<i>But the desire to return to a simpler time</i>

243
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,430
<i>might explain why his heart raced</i>

244
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,890
<i>when Maeby texted him a message.</i>

245
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,400
Shit.

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,910

She can figure it out.

255
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,600
<i>And he headed off to the penthouse,</i>

256
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,650

- Hi... don't like it.
<i>- ...that he was soon shaken out of.</i>

258
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,530
What? My hair?

259
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,200
No, no, I like it. I just, uh,

260
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,700
don't like that I'm just seeing it now.

261
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,450
I guess I was picturing you at 16.

262
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,040
But I-I don't know why I... do that.

263
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,870
- But why did you do that?
- Well, truthfully...

264
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,420
No, I'll just tell you the truth:
it's a wig.

265
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,960
Now that I'm working
for my mom's campaign,

266
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,420
I thought a gray-haired daughter

267
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,180
would add some years to her,
but, turns out, nope.

268
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,680
She thinks it's a cool new thing
and it makes her look hip.

269
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,050
Everything I've given her

270
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,140
to do or say has only made her
go up in the polls.

271
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,930
It's like the more offensive it is,

272
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,980
- the more people get behind her.
- <i>It was true.</i>

273
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,770
Remember, just stick to the words. Okay?

274
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,610
<i>She had her mother mock a reporter</i>

275
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,940
<i>- who had a speech problem...</i>
- This so-called reporter

276
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,820
from the <i>Wee Guardian </i>says I was right.

277
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,410
Now, suddenly, she's...

278
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,490
"Perhaps I've recalled incorrectly.

279
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,910
I'm positively knackered."

280
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,950
The candidate made no fans in Wee Britain,

281
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
but on the other side of the Anaheim pond,

282
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,830
the comment only made her more popular.

283
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,420
<i>...and release a hot mic tape.</i>

284
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,550
...after the damning
hot mic piece surfaced.

285
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,420
<i>Although, remember,
this was in 2015,</i>

286
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,680
<i>and many of the offensive comments</i>

287
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,800
<i>almost seem quaint by today's standards.</i>

288
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,600
- Did you get that?
- Oh, yeah.

289
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,560
Okay.

290
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,060
While shocking,
the video seems to have only given her

291
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,770
a big rise in the polls.

292
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,060
It certainly had that effect on me.
- Not necessary! - Don't sack me.

293
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,320
<i>She keeps polling higher.</i>

294
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,570
What am I doing right?

295
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,610
Well, it probably doesn't help that,
except for you, she's running unopposed.

296
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,370
Yeah. That's why I came up with
the idea for us to kiss.

297
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,370
So the kissing is part of a plan?

298
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,710
Yeah. I thought we could do it
when the whole family

299
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,870
is on camera getting
the Family of the Year Award.

300
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,250
Family of the Year Award?
Who'd give us that?

301
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,050
- We're giving it to ourselves.
- Right.

302
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,970
Still doesn't seem like
we'd get the votes.

303
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,840
So when my mom's giving the speech,

304
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,260
we'll be in the background,
and we're just going at it.

305
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,760
And I'm like,

306
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,510
"Why have I never thought of that before?"

307
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,430
Kind of feels like you have.

308
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,270
To me, it seems like what you really want

309
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,440
is for your mother
to see you for who you are.

310
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,360
Why don't you write a speech
for her to say about you,

311
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,230
about how lovely and smart you are,

312
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,530
how you've blossomed as a young woman

313
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,950
into this incredibly beautiful
and special person

314
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,830
that anyone would be lucky
to get to share their life with.

315
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,580
I think I see
where you're going with this.

316
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,500
An incredibly attractive,

317
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,330
incredibly rare and precious gem.

318
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,340
And then, I open my mouth,

319
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,840
and I have these rotted out meth teeth.

320
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,970
And I'm like,
"Then why do I gotta my cousin

321
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,470
for some meth money, Mom?"
You know, or something like that.

322
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,510
- I feel like we're circling it.
- Yeah.

323
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,220
I don't know, maybe that's just a shade

324
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,680
unnecessarily cruel.

325
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,440
Well,
at least I didn't punch her in the face.

326
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,650
Ah, I still feel so weird.
I haven't even seen my dad since that day.

327
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,570
Yeah. He seems fine.

328
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,650
- Oh, you've seen him?
- Yeah. He's across the hall.

329
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,450
- Wait, who is?
- Everyone.

330
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,530
- Your dad, my mom, the whole family.
- My dad's across the hall?

331
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,330
<i>Where Michael's father currently had</i>

332
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,080
<i>his own son in a panic.</i>

333
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,660
- No, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

334
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,750
I'm fine. It's just, uh,
I like, you know...

335
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,500
I just like the feeling of, uh...

336
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,800
...feeling something.

337
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,880
It's just nice to have
some control over one's life.

338
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,640
But your mother is a wonderful person!

339
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,510
I've screamed the same thing many times I was worried she was in earshot.

340
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,930
You sure you two are okay?

341
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,270
I mean, the last I heard,
you two were getting a divorce,

342
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,520
and now it seems like everything's just...

343
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,650
- Forgotten?
- Yeah.

344
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,650
You know our family motto.

345
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,150
We forget, but we never forgive.

346
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,150
I remember the framed needlepoint.

347
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,410
You'll see. In life,
you don't want to carry that much hate.

348
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,660
Although, by not forgiving,

349
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,290
you're throwing everything out
and <i>just </i>keeping the hate.

350
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,040
Well, how do you think
she keeps that figure?

351
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,500
No. Okay, I'm going for a feeling.

352
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,830
- Let's get inside.
- I'm fine.

353
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,460
- That's enough air.
- I'm fine. Hey!

354
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,630
What's that trophy gonna look like, huh?

355
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,920
Oh! Everyone gets a trophy, huh, Pop?

356
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,840
- Well...
- When I was a kid,

357
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,890
you said, "You want a trophy?
Try harder, G.O.B."

358
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,430
Huh. Well, maybe I...

359
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,310
- did something right, huh?
- But I was like,

360
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,560
"But you gave one to everybody else.

361
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,600
What happened to everybody gets a trophy?" There
was that then. It was getting started, but...

362
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,400
Meanwhile,
the guy who could've tried harder

363
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,900
is now giving it to the not super young,
obviously,

364
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,030
but still fairly well known
local TV host whose breasts...

365
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,780
and you're gonna be surprised
to hear this coming from me...

366
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,660
may be a little bit too hard.

367
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,790
High class problem, huh, Mike?

368
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,750
I wish you could get a feel
next time, Mike. There is something not right with those.

369
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah, well,
I'm in town such a short time,

370
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,800
- so next time.
- Well...

371
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,050
One less trophy, huh, Mom?

372
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,630
There's one trophy: The Golden Anchor,

373
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,260
and Lindsay gets it.

374
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,050
Wait, what?
For Family of the Year?! No!

375
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,060
We need her to be the center of this.

376
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,850
She's the one running for office.

377
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,730
What about Dad?
You're the head of the family.

378
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,270
You're the alpha. Or me, for that matter.

379
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,480
I am the CEO. Mom said.

380
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,110
Fine, I'll get trophies for everyone.

381
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,110
Everyone gets a trophy.

382
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,400
Count me out.

383
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,820
- Fine. Everyone but G.O.B.
- No!

384
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,530
<i>You sure I didn't mention that
in the text?</i>

385
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,990
Yeah. I read that thing down.
- Hmm. - Should I go say hi to him?

386
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,080
I haven't seen my Darth since I hit him.

387
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
What if he asks me about Rebel?

388
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,750
That's the love of his life,
that he gave up for me,

389
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,540
and I haven't even called her once.

390
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,630
Just tell him that.

391
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,090
- The truth, huh?
- Yeah.

392
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,670
Sometimes, the truth can hurt a man

393
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,550
more than the most brutally fashioned lie.

394
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,180
I should get out of here.

395
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,220
<i>Is anyone else noticing</i>

396
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,770
that the family isn't quite,
uh, as we remember them?

397
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,860
- In what way?
- That is not Buster.

398
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,230
Oh, I'm in.

399
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,190
Uh, Buster,

400
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,070
oh, um, it's about time you got here,
um, to the penthouse.

401
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,700
Did the skit start?
I don't have the hook thing.

402
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,530
- Hey, what's happening?
- Shh!

403
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,290
Can I just do this
with my hand instead, Tobias?

404
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,330
Michael. I'm Michael.

405
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,170
Just stay in it, Murphy...
uh, Buster, stay in...

406
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,460
He did a fantastic job as Buster

407
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,760
in the campaign interviews,
so I will get him there,

408
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,800
uh, for the awards ceremony, I will.

409
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,550
He's a young actor.

410
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,140
I don't really want to be an actor.

411
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,770
- It's not what I want to do.
- Oh, and, uh,

412
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,310
who's making you be an actor, Buster?

413
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,440
He's talking to you...

414
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,980
Shut up, Lindsay!
Li... your sister.

415
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,480
Your sis... Lindsay... sister.

416
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,570
Who's making you be an actor?

417
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,240
- My father?
- What?

418
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,860
Who? Him?

419
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,570
How could you do this to our son?

420
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,700
His son. Your son. I...
Okay.

421
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,280
I have to pull myself out of this part.

422
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,200
I'm going in and out of Michael
like a cuckoo clock bird.

423
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,290
Okay, so, I'm Michael,
uh, G.O.B. is G.O.B.,

424
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,170
Michael is no one.

425
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,590
And opening night energy, Places and re...

426
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,460
- Peas and carrots. Red leather...
- Tobias! Hey, hey!

427
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,800
- We do not need a Buster, okay?
- That's right! Michael has him.

428
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,930
Indeed,
and here he comes.

429
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,390
- Has who?
- Has who?

430
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,560
Buster.

431
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,310
Y-You said you'd look after him.

432
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,690
- That's the first I'm hearing about it.
- We've heard about it.

433
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,820
Michael, why are you lying about
not having Buster with you?

434
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,530
- Oh, no, I'm not lying about anything.
- <i>Well, he kind of was.</i>

435
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,820
<i>As months earlier,
he had laid out a scheme</i>

436
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,570
<i>to make it seem like
Buster was a missing person.</i>

437
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,790
So, we gotta wait about 48 hours
before we declare you missing.

438
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,870
- Then they put out an APB.
- <i>At which point,</i>

439
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,250
<i>Buster was to go to the police station
and say...</i>

440
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,830
"You were looking for me.
Here I am."

441
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,290
Let them race back into town
and save everyone for a change.

442
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,920
In fact, I keep forgetting to ask,
uh, what was it

443
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,720
that brought everyone back
together in town this time?

444
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,930
Well, Lucille 2 was missing,

445
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,760
and we had an obligation
to look after the company.

446
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,100
So, it's not because of Buster.

447
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,980
- I see. Listen, I don't...
- Yeah.

448
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,190
<i>What Michael didn't know
was that while the police</i>

449
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,940
<i>had gotten ahold of Buster...</i>

450
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,730
You think that's me?

451
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,400
<i>...they were more concerned</i>

452
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,820
<i>with a different missing person.</i>

453
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,740
I mean, that guy obviously
has a giant rubber hand,

454
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,070
and I have a giant melted hand
that smells like Bounce.

455
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,830
<i>I'm in the movie.</i>

456
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,830
Okay, that's definitely me.

457
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,500
I'm just surprised to see it,
since I'm pretty sure I erased that video.

458
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,500
You sure you don't want an attorney?

459
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,510
No. Michael was very clear about that.

460
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,260
- I'm just a missing person.
- Not anymore.

461
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,340
We don't need a bad cop.
Go home.

462
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,140
- See your kid.
- Thanks, Rick.

463
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,430
That's why you're the good cop.

464
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,730
I don't know what lesson you're trying
to teach me, but you're back.

465
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,690
You're probably hiding Buster.
I mean, who knows? It's just...

466
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,480
Not my problem anymore,
in any event, okay?

467
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,860
I got my own son to worry about.

468
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,610
I am, uh, I'm leaving. Goodbye.

469
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,150
- Bye.
- I will not be back this time.

470
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,650
It's all about my son.

471
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,110
That was so helpful, thank you.
If you could...

472
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,410
- Get your stuff. Let's get out of here.
- Dad.

473
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,330
- Hey.
- Oh!

474
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,670
Hey. Hey, son.

475
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,880
Oh, my goodness, look who it is.

476
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,340
I was just gonna call you.
This is, uh...

477
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,470
- Back in town or...?
- Are you, um...

478
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,840
Briefly. You going
to the family thing that we're...

479
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,720
- Giving to ourselves? No.
- Huh? Yeah.

480
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,680
- I, uh, can't make it.
- Yeah? No?

481
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,470
- Should I tell them?
- Well, you know, listen,

482
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,930
I-I wasn't gonna go,
so don't-don't not go,

483
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
because I'm... you know.

484
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,770
- You're the reason I <i>would </i>go.
- Oh, yeah?

485
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,110
- I just have some plans, so I can't. Yeah.
- Sweet.

486
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,440
You got plans, huh?
Well, we make plans, and God laughs.

487
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,440
- That's right.
- Right?

488
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,950
- No, I always want to make plans, but...
- Hmm.

489
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,660
You don't want to be laughed at.

490
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,990
Tell me. Yeah. Well, I won't laugh.

491
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,290
Do you have plans with Rebel?

492
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,830
- Uh, yeah, I do, yeah. I do. Yeah, no.
- Good for you guys.

493
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,290
It's-it's fun stuff, yeah.

494
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,330
Stuff I think, even if you weren't God,
you'd find funny.

495
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,880
You can't ask for more than that.

496
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,380
But that's none of my business, yeah?

497
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,930
Only reason I ask,
'cause I'm going on a scuba trip.

498
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,010
Um, yeah,
came back in town to get my gear.

499
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,640
Only reason I'm here, um, you know.

500
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,560
It's a last-minute thing.
Several weeks at sea.

501
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,390
- You'd hate it. So, yes.
- Yeah, not my thing.

502
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,980
- I shouldn't have even asked you.
- Oh, did you ask?

503
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,110
Ah... I don't want to inter... You shouldn't cancel your plans
with Rebel, you know.

504
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,150
- Rain check.
- Uh, it's tomorrow or...?

505
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,780
- Hmm? We leave today, so, yeah.
- Ah.

506
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,200
God's probably...

507
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,660
- I can almost hear him laughing, you know?
- Wow, yeah.

508
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,370
Although, maybe, I imagine,
it doesn't make him laugh anymore.

509
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,620
I mean, so much of life is, uh, plans.

510
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,660
It would just be the same joke
over and over.

511
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,830
So he's...

512
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,880
- It's not funny anymore.
- What's he laughing at?

513
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,800
Hey.

514
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,260
You happy?

515
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,630
Oh, man.

516
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,590
You know, in truth, it's, uh,

517
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,800
it's-it's been a while since I've seen...

518
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,930
- you, first of all, but, um...
- Yep.

519
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,480
The thing with, um...

520
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,310
So, Rebel, you know, 'cause she...

521
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,150
I wanted to say, between the two of you,
you know,

522
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,480
if you ever felt like...
Because, like, she's indicated

523
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,610
that things were...
I don't know what she said,

524
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,030
but maybe things were not quite
wrapped up completely with...

525
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,620
- Between me and her?
- Yeah.

526
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,950
She said that I left things unfinished?
Hang on.

527
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,670
That's got me, that's got me spinning out,
'cause, uh...

528
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,090
That could be how she talks.
You know how she is.

529
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,920
No, I-I think I was-was
pretty clear that I...

530
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,220
You know, I broke up with her.

531
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,180
You know, I show up there,
I got a cactus, for God's sakes,

532
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,350
you know, which is...

533
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,600
that's the universal sign
for "things are over."

534
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,600
No, she must have just thought
that you would also, um...

535
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,400
Say it.

536
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,770
Yeah. Say it.

537
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,320
Oh. Yeah, I did. I said lots of things.

538
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,150
I'm standing there, you had just left.

539
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,400
- Ciao.
- <i>Bella.</i>

540
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,910
<i>When Michael ran into Rebel</i>

541
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,910
<i>- leaving her apartment...</i>
- That's for me.

542
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,580
<i>...but she had some bad news.</i>

543
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,000
It's not gonna work out between us.
I just wanted to tell you in person.

544
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,330
<i>Michael didn't know why he said
the next thing out of his mouth.</i>

545
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,800
<i>Maybe it was relief
that he didn't have to break up with her,</i>

546
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,210
<i>but for some reason, he came up with...</i>

547
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,340
Well, if you ever change your mind,
I ain't going nowhere.

548
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,310
Uh, I was afraid that maybe
I was too hard on her, verbally. You know?

549
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,560
And then, I, you know...

550
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,150
Plus I had to leave
for a couple of months for work.

551
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,900
- Movie stuff?
- Hmm?

552
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,270
Mexico.

553
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,690
Hope she's not getting a signal
from you that you are not

554
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,160
fully into her because you're worried

555
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,990
that maybe I've got
some unfinished business,

556
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,080
- so you're holding back?
- No. No, I'm all in.

557
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,370
<i>Actually,
the only contact George Michael had had</i>

558
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,170
<i>with Rebel was watching
one of her movies,</i>

559
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,960
<i>with a Shane and three Noahs.</i>

560
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,250
<i>And you can say goodbye to these!</i>

561
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,840
Maybe I do miss her.

562
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,340
No, I told her. You know, I even said,
"Y'all are it for me."

563
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,340
- You know.
- Go a step further and say,

564
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,180
- "Y'all ain't going nowhere."
- She's it. I don't know

565
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,930
why she wouldn't think I was...
wasn't going nowhere.

566
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,770
Pa.

567
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,350
Oh, that's me. Um, good. All right, well, are you going down or...?

568
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,980
- No. I forgot my bag.
- Well, it's good to see...

569
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,580
- Ciao.
<i>- Bella.</i>

570
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,250
That's it, I'm out of here!

571
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,550
<i>Michael returns for his bag.</i>

572
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,590
Okay, I get it.
Is that supposed to be me?

573
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,840
No, that's my impression
of Tobias doing you.

574
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,470
Wait, what? But that...

575
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,140
Oh, that's it. I am out of here.

576
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,770
Tobias doing Tobias. Yep?

577
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,360
I don't care. I'm...

578
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
All right.

579
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,110
<i>And Buster wonders why Michael
isn't doing Michael.</i>

580
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,330
Why hasn't Michael come back?

581
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,290
What happened to
"Michael always comes back"?

582
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,580
Oh, God. Oh, God.
