I love it.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,950
But the big question is: will Tony? I mean, sometimes,

11

I'm really into something, and he hates me.

Did I exaggerate about her?

38
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,580
She really is just like the mother in<i> Two and a Half Men.</i>

39
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,700
No, you did not.

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,750
Start watching that show? Yes, I did, Mother.

41
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,410
And you lied to me.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
There's no scary half-man that I couldn't handle.

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,660

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,040
Well, there's a lot of stuff I've done

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,700
in this prison that you might not approve of.

46
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,250
I touched a mouse.

47
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,950
I read an illustrated Qur'an for kids, and at recess once,

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,830
I sat in "Blacks only."

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,750
Oh, I keep doing that.

51
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,160
But maybe what you really don't approve of is... me.

52
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,830
If you must know the truth, I'm not thrilled with you.

53
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,660
- Okay.
- The last time I saw you,

54
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,620
you told me you didn't need me anymore.

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,080
Okay... So I'm to believe

56
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,290
that's what you're upset about?

57
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,700
Not that you think I'm a murderer?

58
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,330
Or that I touched a mouse?

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,410
I happen to know for a fact

60
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,160
- you're not a murderer.
- What?

61
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,450
Lucille 2's fine,

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,330
but she can't come back right now.

63
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,750
You know where she is?

64
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,120
I know who she's with, -

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,750
and that's all I can say.

66
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,080
Why don't you say it to someone to get me out of here?

67
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,910
I can't do that right now.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,660
You'll just have to sit tight and trust me

69
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,290
for a little while longer.

70
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,290
So it's like that again.

71
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,790
History repeats.

72
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,910
You remember that?

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,370
I remember you paying me off

74
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,290
by letting me go to the Fourth of July parade,

75
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,750
but I'm a man now.

76
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,040
Paying me off isn't gonna be that easy.

77
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,750
You'll need the warden's permission, and then

78
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,290
you'll have to sponsor me for my furlough, and they probably

79
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,950
won't let me on the float again, but that's just...

80
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, God, it's still the parade, isn't it?

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,120
We're still talking about...

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,040
Oh, we're talking about it!

83
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,790
Buster, please.

84
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,290
The parade's in two days.

85
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,910
The whole city will be there.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,830
The last thing this family needs right now

87
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,370
is a Bluth in a chain gang, picking up trash.

88
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,160
Well, it's either that, or I'm gonna start spewing it.

89
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,410
And your job's not gonna be easy since,

90
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,200
of course, I got dinged because I screamed, "Turn it off!"

91
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,160
after they showed the half-man.

92
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,950
It's like they need another reason to call me...

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,330
- Half-man?
- ...Jon Cryer.

94
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,250
Oh.

95
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,370
<i>Soon, George Michael sought out Maeby</i>

96
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,750
<i>where she was living</i>

97
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,200
<i>- as the sexagenarian Annette...</i> 
- MAEBY: One minute!

98
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,080
- It's me. It's me.
- Oh, where are my glasses?

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,410
Oh, they're right on top of my head, for God's sake.

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,080
It's me. It's me.

101
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,330
- Hey.
- In. Come in.

102
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,000
<i>...who wasn't feeling very sexagenaric.</i>

103
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,080
So, you're not gonna believe this...

104
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,500
What are you doing?

105
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm doing another scrub and run.

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,830
My sex date is tonight,

107
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,370
and there's no other way out of it.

108
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,040
And honestly, if I wanted a hairless lover,

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,080
I'd probably go underage rather than overage, you know?

110
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,580
- What's that?
- No, I mean, not that I would do it on purpose.

111
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,410
I'm just saying if I had a gun to somebody's head.

112
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,540
- If you had a...
- What do you want me to do?

113
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,290
You want me to shoot a kid? What kind of monster are you?

114
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,160
I'm not sure how I became the monster there,

115
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,200
but what happened to your plan to make Annette forgetful?

116
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,290
Like, she can't keep track of things, to get out of the date?

117
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,540
Well, it ended up having the opposite effect.

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,910
<i>Because when Maeby showed up late,</i>

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,410
<i>she saw something troubling.</i>

120
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,950
Oh, what a relief.

121
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,250
I thought you disappeared on me.

122
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,870
Mwah. Thank God.

123
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,120
Before I could even act confused,

124
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,160
he had already called the cops.

125
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,830
<i>Well, not exactly.</i>

126
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,410
<i>- They weren't cops.</i> 
- This is wonderful.

127
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,080
I've always wanted to be a Keystone Cop.

128
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,660
It would be my honor to wear this handlebar mustache

129
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,410
- in the 2nd of July parade.
- LOU: That's right.

130
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,620
It's your first parade not playing the jailbird.

131
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,660
So you should know,

132
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,410
those can be tricky to stick on.

133
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,750
Hey. I think I know what I'm doing.

134
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,410
Kind of what I'm doing.

135
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,410
<i>And these were, like, senior guys, you know?</i>

136
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,330
Long coats. He's not gonna let her go,

137
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,750
which means I have to.

138
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,790
Good-bye, Annette.

139
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,750
Good-bye to our teeth that make it look like I'm smiling

140
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,200
so I don't have to.

141
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,660
And you, I'll miss you most of all,

142
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,750
neighbor's pain medication.

143
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,200
I never even got the chance...

144
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,080
Nah, I'll just take you with me.

145
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,540
So, now that you found out your dad's sneaking around

146
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,790
with your girlfriend, looks like you need a roommate, too, huh?

147
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,410
No, that's what I came to talk to you about.

148
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,290
He wasn't going to see Rebel in Mexico.

149
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,830
The whole thing was just a crazy, paranoid idea.

150
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,410
Who knows where we get these ideas from, right?

151
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,200
Well, you. I got that from you. It's always from you.

152
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,620
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say that sounded like one of mine.

153
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,790
Yeah, so I was going down there to catch my father in this lie,

154
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,410
and it turns out that I was the one caught in a lie,

155
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,040
because there's a picture of the stair car in Mexico.

156
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,910
<i>Something George Michael discovered</i>

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,370
<i>while trying to be honest with his father,</i>

158
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,200
<i>on the way to purchasing 12 new tires.</i>

159
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,580
So, George Michael,

160
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,870
<i>- why did you follow me down here?
- The truth?</i>

161
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,290
I-I thought you were coming down here to meet Rebel.

162
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,660
Come on, I'm so over Rebel.

163
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,700
You were lying about so many other things,

164
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,160
Pea Soup Andersen's and being at the barbecue...

165
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,660
No, no, you're right.

166
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,830
How about, starting right now, no more lies.

167
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,080
That doesn't include me, though, does it?

168
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,370
No, no, no. You'd be out of business, and by the way,

169
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,830
Barry, you had the best lie of all,

170
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,330
saying that they had a picture

171
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,950
of-of Lucille 2 and Oscar in the stair car.

172
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,040
That is not a lie. You said, "Keep it as real as possible."

173
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,330
Prismo, texting mode.

174
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,330
<i>Self-drive on.</i>

175
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,080
This was real? If they've got this,

176
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,330
there's no reason for them to hold Buster and they know it.

177
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,500
- Did you know about this, Dad?
- GEORGE SR.: Are you kidding?

178
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,120
Thanks to your mother, I can't even feel

179
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,910
- your son on my lap.
- Can I see that, Dad?

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,700
<i>Ugh, so Lucille 2 is alive? Great.</i>

181
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,870
Another reason I got to get the hell out of here.

182
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,250
No, it wasn't her, it was us.

183
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,120
From when we went to Mexico with Steve Holt.

184
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,950
Don't you remember how we got there?

185
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,950
<i>It was just after Cinco</i>

186
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,700
<i>when Maeby suggested fleeing the country.</i>

187
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,500
Screw it. No rules, anything goes.

188
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,370
- Just the cousins.
- Hey, why don't we take that?

189
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,040
<i>Primos!</i>

190
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,160
So anyway, now my dad and everyone else

191
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,370
thinks that they have proof that's gonna exonerate Buster

192
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
that I know isn't true.

193
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,160
And I'm not sure whether I should...

194
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,790
Lie to him.

195
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,040
What do you think?

196
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,830
Oh, okay. You just told me. Really?

197
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,040
Even though we just left

198
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
the stair car there when it broke down?

199
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,870
I mean, what if they find it?

200
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,830
I'm sure somebody got it working and it's long gone.

201
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,040
And it's not like you're actually lying to your dad.

202
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,830
You're just letting him believe something that isn't true.

203
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,750
You know? Like how people think the world's melting

204
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,250
because people drive cars,

205
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,750
or that Hillary should continue to roam free.

206
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,290
<i>And Maeby realized</i>

207
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,580
<i>she had something else to say good-bye to.</i>

208
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,790
Good-bye,<i> Fox &amp; Friends.</i>

209
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,250
<i>Meanwhile, Lucille was growing concerned</i>

210
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,500
<i>that her daughter Lindsay</i>

211
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,120
<i>wouldn't be back in time for the parade.</i>

212
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,620
<i>Sally, Sally, where are you headed?</i>

213
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,330
<i>I think the more important question here is:</i>

214
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,830
<i>where is my opponent, Lindsay Bluth?</i>

215
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,620
<i>Maybe she's hiding behind this wall she wants to build.</i>

216
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,660
<i>If she does indeed show up at the parade,</i>

217
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,000
<i>I will be very surprised, though I may not look it.</i>

218
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,790
<i>- No further questions.</i> -

219
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,660
Hey, hey. -

220
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,950
Oh, George, I've been worried sick.

221
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,040
About Buster being stuck in-in that jail.

222
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,040
They are making him a patsy, parading him around,

223
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,790
frightening the masses before the Fourth of July.

224
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,580
It's on the second this year.

225
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,950
And being in the parade was his idea, like it was in 1982.

226
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,250
We're trying to get Lindsay elected,

227
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,830
and Buster wants everyone in the world

228
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,200
to see him in an orange jumpsuit.

229
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,000
- So he'll be out in public?
- I don't want to tell you

230
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,000
what I had to give the warden to make that happen.

231
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,250
I don't want to hear it.

232
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,080
Meanwhile, we still don't have a Lindsay,

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,040
and Sally is calling us out about it.

234
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,910
We've got this elaborate float to help distract from the fact

235
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,700
that there's no stair car this year,

236
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,500
and nobody to put on it. -

237
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,080
- Ugh, God.<i> 
- Fortunately, Tobias was finally calling.</i>

238
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,540
Oh, thank God, it's Tobias.

239
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,410
You better have found my daughter.

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,580
Sally is now in the race, and she's pointing out

241
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,700
that no one has seen Lindsay in a week.

242
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,750
Yes. I didn't want to get your hopes up,

243
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,870
<i>but I'm in Mexico and I have found Lindsay...</i>

244
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,870
- Oh, thank God.<i>
- ...to be very stubborn.</i>

245
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,120
<i>Oh, damn it,</i>

246
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,250
I just did exactly what I said I wouldn't do.

247
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,790
Anyway, I'm at Ma Bark's,

248
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,580
and she tells me Lindsay should be back this afternoon,

249
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,950
before I'm out of my postal plumage. Of course,

250
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,080
when she does come back,

251
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll still need to get her into the car.

252
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,620
Well, say whatever you need to.

253
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,410
<i>Yes. I was thinking I would just say,</i>

254
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,700
"Your mother is so sorry she upset you."

255
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,160
Out of the question.

256
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,200
Yes. It felt a little out of character.

257
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,250
<i>How about I just make it about me?</i>

258
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,540
"It's incredibly important to me and my life..."

259
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,040
Where is this going?

260
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,500
"...and if you do this for me,

261
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,250
"I'm sure Lucille will make me permanent member

262
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,700
of the Bluth family."

263
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,870
That way, you're not lying to Lindsay...

264
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,370
You are. Well, that sounds like the best

265
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,330
of our diplomatic options,

266
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,250
but you're in Mexico, for God's sake.

267
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,540
Please tell me you prepared a few "against her wills."

268
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,750
Oh, my gosh. I do miss that wit, Mother.

269
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,160
It's Mrs. Bluth. I wasn't joking.

270
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,250
And you're right, we need her standing,

271
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,120
<i>and dressed and ready for the parade.</i>

272
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,410
On it. In the meantime, wow, what a trip!

273
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,160
Murphybrown saw an armadillo,

274
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,830
men held us up at gunpoint, and I got to dress up

275
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,330
<i>- as an os...</i> -

276
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,250
<i>It would be five minutes before he would realize</i>

277
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,620
<i>she was no longer on the phone.</i>

278
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,700
<i>And, as Tobias awaited bringing Lindsay home,</i>

279
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,250
<i>Maeby was reluctantly leaving hers.</i>

280
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,500
You're Annette's granddaughter, aren't you?

281
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,790
Yeah, I am.

282
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,410
I'm getting out of here.

283
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,870
Saying good-bye to her.

284
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,500
Well, she's in good hands.

285
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,160
Stan would do anything for your grandmother.

286
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,410
If that woman told him to jump off a bridge, he would.

287
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,200
He would, wouldn't he?

288
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,910
<i>And she found herself feeling reflective.</i>

289
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,080
Nah, I love this place.

290
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,830
I'll just tell him it's over, and kick him out.

291
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,660
<i>It was the 2nd of July,</i>

292
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,290
<i>and the Funkes had just finished</i>

293
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,540
<i>working off their water and phone debt.</i>

294
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,000
I guess you earned your shower.

295
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,830
Ugh. This thing does not breathe.

296
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,540
I'll tell you who doesn't bitch like that, your son.

297
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,450
I'll give you 500 bucks cash

298
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,750
for this youngin' right now.

299
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,330
<i>And maybe that's when Tobias learned</i>

300
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,500
<i>what it meant to be a father.</i>

301
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,580
My son is not for sale.

302
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,040
Thanks, Dad.

303
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Then shower's off. There's your wife.

304
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,370
Now you can both go.

305
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,410
Lindsay?

306
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,450
- Tobias?
- DeBrie?

307
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,910
No, you were right the first time. Uh...

308
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,660
I've been pretending to be Lindsay

309
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,540
the past few months, on account of Marky's face blind.

310
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,410
But Marky's buying it.

311
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,450
You should hear him: "Oh, Lindsay, you've let yourself go.

312
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,660
Oh, Lindsay, why'd you stop showering?"

313
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,660
You're missing some back teeth, there.

314
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,700
Yeah. Just like that.

315
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,700
But I don't think I can be Lindsay anymore.

316
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,250
They're so critical.

317
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,160
And... I fall apart at criticism.

318
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,580
And Marky doesn't see me for who I really am.

319
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,160
I see you for who you are.

320
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
DeBrie Bardeaux.

321
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,120
A first-class Lindsay Bluth impersonator.

322
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Now, let's go to Newport Beach, and you can be Lindsay there.

323
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,700
Oh, I can't go back to Newport, -

324
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,910
'cause that's where Marky's headed right now,

325
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,330
to protest the 2nd of July parade with a paint bomb.

326
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,540
- You know what?

327
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,330
I could go to Newport.

328
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,580
- Let's do it.
- NARRATOR: <i>And soon, preparations</i>

329
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,580
<i>for the 2nd of July parade</i>

330
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,580
<i>were underway.</i>

331
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,500
We're 20 minutes from float-off.

332
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,750
Ugh, but at least nobody's noticed

333
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,750
that the stair car's not here.

334
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,500
<i>And that's when Sally arrived in a float</i>

335
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,120
<i>that would make sure they did notice.</i>

336
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,120
Oh, hello.

337
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,870
What do you think of the new stair car?

338
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,660
I had to make one, because yours disappeared.

339
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,790
Sally Sitwell.

340
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,870
Well, you're no stranger to stuffing tissue places

341
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,290
when you don't have the goods.

342
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,200
Well, what we don't have is the candidate

343
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,200
that would've been Lindsay's opponent.

344
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,910
But we made one, and put her up top.

345
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,200
Although, she's not as hollow as your candidate.

346
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,580
Uh, where is she?

347
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,040
Uh, she went off somewhere to pretty herself up

348
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,160
for the parade.

349
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,500
Aren't you in it, too?

350
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,750
Ticktock.

351
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,330
The sun is nobody's friend.

352
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,500
Speaking of which, where is that friendless son of yours,

353
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,870
Buster?

354
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,580
Is it true he's in prison?

355
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,540
Well, yes, in the Keystone Cops skit

356
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,500
in your father's old role.

357
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,330
<i>Something Buster had only discovered</i>

358
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,750
<i>- moments earlier.</i>
- Mr. Bluth, you're not on cleaning detail.

359
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,330
What?

360
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,040
Is this because I accidentally choked Ron Howard?

361
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,750
Because they already made me pay for that.

362
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,910
They chopped your hand off?

363
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,450
No, they just downgraded me to a manual.

364
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,290
Listen, I don't mean to namedrop,

365
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,790
but Mother was supposed to have already arranged for me

366
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,080
to follow the parade.

367
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,330
Sorry.

368
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,750
I got a note from the warden himself.

369
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,830
You're in a cage on a Keystone Cop float.

370
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,870
What?

371
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,370
You mean I'm in the parade?

372
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,370
Are there dressing rooms for the talent?

373
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,950
Oh, well, at least Buster's being held.

374
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,750
Which is more than he had as a child.

375
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,950
<i>Sally wasn't that sweet after all.</i>

376
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,080
When this is all over, let's get coffee.

377
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,250
<i>And Tobias made sure his son was occupied</i>

378
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,290
<i>while DeBrie prepared for her role as Lindsay.</i>

379
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,370
I will leave you here

380
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,160
and what could be more exciting

381
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,620
than to be backstage

382
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,040
♪ At a parade? ♪

383
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,580
♪...ade. ♪

384
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,000
♪ Being watching the parade. ♪

385
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,660
No. With the curb huggers? No.

386
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,540
I meant, for one whose dream it is to be a clown.

387
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,450
Oh, yeah, 'cause he'd be, like,

388
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,250
"This is the one place where I'm not embarrassed of my dream."

389
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,750
Hey, no. Never apologize for your dream.

390
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,080
No. I was-I was making fun of the guy.

391
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,500
What guy?

392
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,870
Whose dream... whose dream it is.

393
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,330
It's your dream.

394
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,750
We just talked about dreams,

395
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,540
and you said you could unicycle and juggle.

396
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,120
Oh! That's because my uncle,

397
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,540
he taught me that stuff, when he used to come over

398
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,370
to cheer me up on Father's Day.

399
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,620
Robbie knows how to juggle?

400
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,120
Who's Robbie?

401
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,660
Oh. Yes, of course.

402
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,910
You wouldn't know my brother.

403
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,750
Are you one of our parade clowns?

404
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,750
Me? No, I'm too shy.

405
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,080
No... yes, yes, he... yes, he is. Yes.

406
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,790
T-This is, uh, Relucto, the apprehensive clown.

407
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,410
No, I'm not, where do you...

408
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,910
There's the catchphrase.

409
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
Let's get you into a chair.

410
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,540
Well, I-I bet right now,

411
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,790
there's a very, very jealous fan out there who would-who would

412
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,370
give anything to-to trade places with you and get up on that...

413
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,200
No, I can't, because I have to be her husband

414
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,000
in that stupid Lindsay float.

415
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,500
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

416
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,500
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was second-guessing his float,</i>

417
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,040
<i>as he waited for Tony Wonder, who had yet to show up.</i>

418
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,870
- Aw, damn it!
- Hey, Gob, have you seen Mom?

419
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,290
No. Um, hey, how would you like to help me

420
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,500
in a double-closet sexuality switch

421
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,950
two-hander float illusion,

422
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,540
no credit, no money? Oh, and you turn gay.

423
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,830
- I'll pass.
- Yeah, that's what I thought of you.

424
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,290
Look, we're gonna pull out of here in five minutes,

425
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,500
and Tony's not here; what if he doesn't show?

426
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,910
Gob, you'll be fine.

427
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,080
Do you remember high school commencement,

428
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,450
when they asked you to represent all the kids

429
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,450
that were being left back, and then you had

430
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,500
to quickly find a replacement for Buster

431
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,370
who was too afraid to be sawed in half?

432
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,660
So you're saying nothing's worse

433
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,410
than the sound of the dog screaming?

434
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,330
No, I just meant you're not a very good magician.

435
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,120
<i>And that's when Gob noticed a less discerning brother,</i>

436
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,450
<i>who also happened to be his former magician's assistant.</i>

437
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,830
Hey.

438
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,750
- Hey.
- Oh.

439
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,830
- Sup. Listen, I'm glad you're here.
- Sup...

440
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,330
I might need you to fill in for Tony Wonder

441
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,950
- in my illusion.
- Mm.

442
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,450
It's gonna involve you being put into a small,

443
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,290
confined space, and you come out gay.

444
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,870
If that's a swipe about me being in prison, I understand it.

445
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,500
Oh, right, you're in prison.

446
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,750
What are you doing here?

447
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,080
Well, Mom arranged it.

448
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,950
Although, it is nice to be able to see family again,

449
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,750
because, not to be rude,

450
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,500
- but you didn't visit me in...
- Oh, there's a dog.

451
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,950
<i>And Tobias and a nervous DeBrie</i>

452
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,000
<i>approached Lucille to pitch their deception.</i>

453
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,000
Tobias, and if it isn't... what is it again?

454
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,830
- LeTrasha?
- Hello, again.

455
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,660
Those last few teeth aren't going without a fight, are they?

456
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,950
- Mm, thank you.
- So where's Lindsay?

457
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,160
- You said you had Lindsay.
- TOBIAS: Yes.

458
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,540
But it turned out to be the professional actress DeBrie.

459
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,290
The only acting this one's good at is feigning interest

460
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,200
in her drug dealer's hobbies.

461
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,200
You do see a lot of aquariums. But she was coming off

462
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,200
a three-month run as Lindsay

463
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,250
in front of a sold-out audience of one face blind man.

464
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,040
The point is, if she can fool him, why not have her violate

465
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,910
federal election guidelines by fooling

466
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,870
the entire electorate as the next representative

467
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,700
of the great 48th congressional district of Californ-i-ay?

468
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,500
Upon a float where, unless she gives a perfect performance,

469
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,910
she goes to jail for fraud.

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,750
Fine. You've left me no choice.

471
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,000
Maybe if you turn away from the bleachers

472
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,580
and cover your face with your hand...

473
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,790
I'm sure that's not the first time you've been told that.

474
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,370
Oh, God, no.

475
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,790
I can't do this. T-This is...

476
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,040
- No, no, no.
- ...why I gave this up.

477
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,410
- DeBRIE: Shy.
- No. No, you can.

478
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,830
- You can do this.
- No.

479
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,620
- No, no, no. Shy.
- You can't be this critical.

480
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,250
Not too shy, not shy. No... happy, good.

481
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,370
Good, happy, not sad. Don't worry, Lucille.

482
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,830
I've got this covered.

483
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,200
I... no, no, no. Shy.

484
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,370
- Sad, shy. Sad...
- Just get her up there!

485
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,410
<i>And so, the parade finally began.</i>

486
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,200
<i>Although, "finally" might not be the right word,</i>

487
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,080
<i>because it was still two days before the Fourth of July,</i>

488
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,950
<i>and one day before the big fireworks show on the 3rd.</i>

489
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,500
Welcome to the third annual 2nd of July Fourth of July parade.

490
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,790
To start the festivities, please welcome

491
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,660
the Milford Academy marching band,

492
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,000
known throughout the state

493
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,750
as California's quietest marching band.

494
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,660
Let's all be perfectly still and see if we can hear them.

495
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,000
There you are.

496
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,040
<i>And Michael finally caught up</i>

497
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,750
<i>- with his mother.</i> 
- Hello, Mother.

498
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,750
Michael.

499
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,700
Please tell me you're back, no one new has been arrested

500
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,370
and that your father is on the way, but first, a kiss.

501
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,620
- Hmm.
- There are cameras everywhere.

502
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,040
Well, that... something you ought to have thought of

503
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,080
with regard to Lucille 2 and Oscar in Mexico.

504
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,750
I can't believe they were so stupid as to flee town

505
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,410
- in the stair car.
- Mm-hmm. Mom?

506
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,410
Come on, you knew that Lucille 2 was with Oscar,

507
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,120
and you let your son sit in prison

508
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,830
instead of telling anyone.

509
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,160
Knew? Michael, I can't...

510
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,330
I mean, the thought that I wouldn't run to the D.A.

511
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,750
the moment I...
- Mom. Please.

512
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,830
Do you have a tissue?

513
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,950
You haven't needed a tissue since Nixon resigned.

514
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,660
I think that you asked Oscar

515
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,540
to take her out of town, didn't you?

516
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,750
I think that you needed her out of the country

517
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,160
so that you could, what?

518
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,620
- Plunder her business?
- Now, listen,

519
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,290
nobody was hurt, everybody's getting what they deserve.

520
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,750

528

- He can do a few weeks for me.
- Well, guess what?

529

He's gonna be out a little bit sooner than you think,

530
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,160

531
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,790

532

Michael, you stay away from that D.A.

533
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,410

534
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,910
So, there's nothing you can do.

535
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,620
The D.A.'s office is closed until after the 5th.

536
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,200

Huh? Yes. Hi.

572
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,250
Um, so, does the D.A.'s office make a regular practice

573
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,620
of holding people under suspicion of murdering victims

574
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,160
that are clearly still alive?

575
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,620
- Huh?
- We're not holding him on murder charges.

576
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,660
It's a tampering case, right?

577
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,580
Yeah, well, if there's no crime, then what has he tampered with?

578
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,160
Lucille Austero's clearly alive

579
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,160
after the moment that she disappeared.

580
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,500
You know? That-that's my uncle Oscar.

581
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,950
My-my mother just confirmed it.

582
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,870
Oh. And we couldn't find him, either,

583
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,790

584
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,410

585
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,370
Yes. All here. All in one picture.

00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,410
Oh, my God. This is so embarrassing.

587
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,540

588
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,120
Well, you gotta, you gotta release my brother from prison.

589
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,370
- We did.
- Hmm?

590
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,580
- You did?
- I mean, it has to be processed out,

591
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,040
but he wanted to be in a parade.

592
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,830
Oh. Well, he looks to be enjoying himself.

593
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,910
Okay, well, I'm glad that we talked this through, though.

Right. Yes. And you find a crime scene. -

601

602

So I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna help the clown.

00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,410
Help, we need a doctor. Oh!

870
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,830
It's okay. She's usually on pain pills.

871
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,410
Ugh. I'm gonna call it.

872
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,250
Looks like she's been stiff for about 18 hours.

873
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,750
Oh, no, no. She's very much alive.

874
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,080
She just crashed through a papier-mâché wall.

875
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,370
DeBRIE: I'm under the impression

876
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,830
that if you're carried in

877
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,540
they put you immediately on the morphine drip?

878
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
- That's what we've been told before.
- Okay, look.

879
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,160
- We prioritize according to need.
- Of course.

880
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,250
- Here.
- Oh, okay. All right.

881
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,790
Help! Please! It's a higher priority emergency!

882
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,290
Help!

883
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,660
Oh, bullshit you didn't redo these floors.

884
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,160
They look amazing.

885
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,040
Help!

886
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,250
I got to stop coming out this way.
