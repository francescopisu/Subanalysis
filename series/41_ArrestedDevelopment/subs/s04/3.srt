Resync for ABjEX by VeRdiKT

2
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:14,596
On the top of a hillside,

3
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:17,798
deep in the mountains
of Shuturmurg, India,

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,634
sits a mystical retreat
long sought out

5
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,761
- by those seeking answers...
- Is this real?

6
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:24,347
to the questions
that define us.

7
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:26,015
I mean, is any of this real?

8
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:28,017
How do I know what's real?

9
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,478
This is Lindsay Bluth-Fünke.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,438
You see me before you, yes?

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,358
I am real to you.

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,486
And this bag next to me,
it is as real as you or me.

13
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:40,863
No, I know that one's real.

14
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:42,447
I meant the other one--
the Louis Vuitton.

15
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,407
I don't remember Vuitton
having two E's.

16
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:46,244
The hillside was also known

17
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,329
- for their bargains on designer handbags.
- Oh, no!

18
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:50,039
That's how they do it here.

19
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:52,291
You can't go wrong.
Best bag on the mountain.

20
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,543
I love this bag.
I give you 60 for it.

21
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:56,212
- It's the best bag on the mountain.
- Excuse me.

22
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:58,256
- I just promised it to her.
- I'll give you $70.

23
00:00:58,297 --> 00:01:00,507
Lindsay Bluth had come
to India for both reasons.

24
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:02,927
- Uh, $120. - You just bought
the best bag on the mountain.

25
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:05,263
- Congratulations.
- Best bag on the mountain.

26
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:09,641
Now the story of a family

27
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:12,144
whose future
was abruptly canceled

28
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:14,438
and the one daughter
who had no choice

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,648
but to keep her life together.

30
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:22,863
It's Lindsay's...

31
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:27,034
- I love it.
- Lindsay was on

32
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:28,702
a spiritual journey to let go

33
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:31,330
of all possessions
and to find something cute

34
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:32,957
- to keep her stuff in.
- It's gorgeous.

35
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:35,626
Months earlier,
Lindsay had lost her bearings

36
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,129
after finding out
she wasn't born

37
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,005
to the family
she couldn't bear.

38
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:42,174
- I'm adopted?
- So, after getting

39
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:44,135
briefly creepy
with her brother...

40
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:46,220
I'm just not that into
older women.

41
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:47,721
- Don't worry about it.
- You bastard!

42
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:49,098
She shared some resentments

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,975
with her family
at the boat party.

44
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:52,893
Kitty likes to scratch...

45
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:54,603
But before she could
disassociate herself

46
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:56,688
- from the Bluth name...
- Because now I know that

47
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,065
we're not related.
Anyway, Michael...

48
00:01:58,107 --> 00:01:59,442
Oh, my God. The SEC.

49
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:01,902
...the Bluth name
would become...

50
00:02:01,944 --> 00:02:04,363
...as sullied as Newport Bay
on the fifth of May.

51
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:06,282
They are persecuting me.

52
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:09,285
It was an accident.
This is ridiculous!

53
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:12,121
If I'd told them we were taking
a bunch of gays out there

54
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:14,081
to get married,
they'd have thrown me a parade.

55
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:17,793
Let's tell them we were taking
a bunch of gays to get married.

56
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:19,586
Yeah, I don't think your record
on that issue

57
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:20,838
is going to back that up, Mom.

58
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,298
In fact, it was an issue

59
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,966
of theBay Windowmagazine

60
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:25,926
that would most damage her
with the gay community.

61
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:28,179
Fine. We'll say
they took it on a joyride.

62
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,306
And you have no right
to criticize me.

63
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:32,850
At least I was able
to turn myQueenaround.

64
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:34,185
None taken.

65
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:36,020
This is Tobias Fünke,

66
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,729
who should have taken more.

67
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,357
- Oh.
- You cannot say

68
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:42,026
one nice thing
to your daughter, can you?

69
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:43,235
Adopted daughter.

70
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:45,404
And that's not true.

71
00:02:45,446 --> 00:02:48,157
Could I have the Bluth
family over here, please?

72
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,659
And over here, the victims
of the Bluth family?

73
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,953
And that's when Lindsay

74
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:55,622
found a label more fitting
than "Bluth."

75
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:57,916
No, Lindsay, you're going
to the wrong area.

76
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,585
Kenny, Chet, Curtis, Mike,
Bix and Gator are over here.

77
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:03,422
We should be over here
at the Bluth area with Gob

78
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:06,384
and Buster and, uh... uh...

79
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:08,969
uh, your brother, uh...

80
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,929
- Michael?
- Michael. Yes.

81
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,807
Sorry. I was thinking
of Mike, the hot seaman.

82
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:16,060
- No, where is Michael?
- It doesn't matter.

83
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:17,311
He's not my brother.

84
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:18,687
This isn't my family.

85
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,065
No, I've spent years...

86
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:23,401
Yes! Got my yes.
I got that big yes.

87
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:26,653
I've spent years trying
to fit into this family,

88
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,030
and it's not me.

89
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:30,408
My life is a fallacy.

90
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,034
Oh...

91
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:33,702
♪ Is that a gal I see? ♪

92
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:37,373
♪ No, it's just
a phallus... eee! ♪

93
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:39,875
We loved that.
Where's that from?

94
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,544
It's from nothing.

95
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:43,795
But it made her
realize this, too.

96
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:46,631
I don't know if there's
a right time to say this,

97
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:50,010
but this marriage of ours,
it hasn't been working.

98
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:54,265
Yeah... there's nothing
keeping us together.

99
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:59,478
I... I believe we're thinking
the same thing.

100
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,855
- Yeah, we should end it.
- Let's give it another shot.

101
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:03,690
To the head. Kill it.

102
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:05,234
Yes.

103
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:10,989
Lindsay was looking
for inspiration

104
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:14,535
before she set out
on her new path.

105
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:16,745
And it only took
until the "Pray" section

106
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:20,124
of Eat, Pray, Love
for her to find it.

107
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:21,833
Hmm.

108
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,337
Soon, she was beginning
a journey to reinvent herself.

109
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:27,047
Ugh. I'm doing it again.

110
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:30,008
I have to let go
of these material things.

111
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,470
To leave the trappings
of her old life

112
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:35,139
and try to live with less.

113
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,932
There.

114
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:38,934
Her immersion
into Indian culture began

115
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:40,727
even before reaching
the airport.

116
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,396
And, uh...
and so this daily prayer,

117
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:43,680
it connects one to the whole.

118
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,943
You know,
you sense the oneness in all.

119
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:56,072
And they have
normal toilets, right?

120
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:57,740
And after an hour or so

121
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,867
withSkyMall,where she was

122
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,704
proud of herself
for only buying two things--

123
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:05,998
a self-cleaning litter box
in case she ever got a cat

124
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,587
and an inflatable hat box
in case she ever got a hat--

125
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:13,297
she got to a great article
in the in-flight magazine

126
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:15,383
and found herself filling up

127
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:17,510
with inner peace
and acceptance.

128
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:19,762
I mean, not right away.

129
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,305
What is she doing back there?

130
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:23,266
That passenger had been

131
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:25,685
pushing on her seat
for like four hours.

132
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:29,188
Lindsay's journey
to let go of her baggage

133
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,982
got off to a bad start
at baggage claim

134
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:34,860
when she picked up
the wrong baggage.

135
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,154
And her Western notions
of the value of life

136
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:39,490
were challenged on the bus ride
to the hotel.

137
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,867
Oh, my God.

138
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,370
Did... did we just
hit something?

139
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:45,955
Shouldn't we stop?

140
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:47,957
No. It wasn't a cow.

141
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:50,918
It was just a tourist.

142
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,920
And that's howLindsay's path

143
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:55,339
- to living with less...
- Wait. This isn't my...

144
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,508
How am I supposed to find out

145
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,385
who I really am
dressed like this chick?

146
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:02,764
...took a brief detour into
a shopping spree at India's

147
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:04,848
- famous Mall Mountain.
- It's cute on me.

148
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,268
But I thought it was
supposed to say "Kate."

149
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,104
Oh, no, anything under a small
is considered

150
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,689
a "David Spade."

151
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:13,691
I love this jacket.
I'll give you 60 for it.

152
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:14,858
Best coat on the mountain.

153
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,069
- 65.
- 70! It'd look great

154
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,780
on my wife or my sickly son.

155
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,698
- 100 bucks. Yes!
- $100, yes.

156
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,116
And soon, she was back

157
00:06:22,158 --> 00:06:23,534
at the hotel and ready

158
00:06:23,576 --> 00:06:25,787
for her spiritual experience.

159
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:29,831
Yeah, hi.

160
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,751
Uh, were you able
to book my 3:00 shaman?

161
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:33,544
Oh, yes.
Did you want the deep wisdom

162
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:34,836
or just a light ego cleanse?

163
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:36,172
We do those by the pool.

164
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,048
- There's a pool?
- It's hard to tell

165
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,801
because there are
so many people in it,

166
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:41,927
but yes, it is a pool.

167
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,346
Well, yeah, by the pool, then.

168
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:45,515
And, uh, do you think
you can get someone

169
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:48,434
to remove the smell of lamb
from my room?

170
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,687
Of course. And which
animal smell would you prefer?

171
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:52,229
Which do you prefer?

172
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:54,649
But at her 3:00 p.m. shaman...

173
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:57,234
You are living a life
without love.

174
00:06:57,276 --> 00:06:59,236
- Lindsay got a deeper treatment
- How do I learn to...

175
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,822
- than she had hoped for.
- be happy?

176
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:02,406
You know, to love?

177
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:05,702
When love is near your heart,
you'll be happy.

178
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:08,788
You must live life truthfully.

179
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,999
Yeah, no, I-I-I do live
truthfully,

180
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,668
but, uh...

181
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,212
I'm just so full of passion.

182
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:18,297
You are so full of.

183
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,674
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:21,884
Although, in my culture,
"full of"

185
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,260
is kind of like a dig.

186
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:25,388
I mean, you'd never say it
to a customer.

187
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:27,557
But, uh, yeah, no,
I-I know what you mean.

188
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,476
This bag is as fake as you are.

189
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,687
Well, how do I learn?

190
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:34,104
Just look at the spelling.

191
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:35,565
God. No, I...

192
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,650
Pull your head out of the sand.

193
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:40,027
Love is where you left it.

194
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,488
You mean... back home?

195
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,740
God.

196
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:45,742
The only person back home
is Tobias.

197
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:47,993
You have no children?

198
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,371
Lindsay thought
she was being hit on.

199
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:52,832
No. Why do you ask?

200
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,376
Wait a minute.
You're saying I've come

201
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:57,294
halfway around the world
to find out

202
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:58,713
I need to go back home?

203
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:01,257
God, I haven't even gone
to the beach yet.

204
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:05,261
She had. It was just
too crowded to see the water.

205
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:08,013
It was a moving experience,

206
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,182
but after leaving the tent,
it wasn't just

207
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,560
the shaman's words
that got through to her.

208
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:13,895
It was this.

209
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:15,897
I'm sorry.
Your AmEx was declined.

210
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:17,231
Your account is maxed out.

211
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:19,108
We had to cancel
your shaman appointment.

212
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:21,026
No, no, I just talked
to the shaman,

213
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,779
just right back at...

214
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,115
Get out! Get out!

215
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:28,701
Go away! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

216
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:33,247
I'm sorry to yell at you,
but as I said, it was declined.

217
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,708
So get out.

218
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,668
But, fortunately, the universe

219
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,754
offered a solution
to her financial problem

220
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:43,006
that wasn't too far off
from what her shaman had said.

221
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:45,175
Oh, I've
got money for you, sweetie,

222
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:47,804
but it means my loving daughter
smiling next to her husband

223
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,305
sitting behind me at the trial.

224
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:50,890
Would you take a grimace?

225
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,351
So it was with
this dual intention

226
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:58,272
that she reached out
to a husband she'd left behind,

227
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:00,733
with a new sense
of inner peace.

228
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,485
Of course, there was still
some outer stuff

229
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:03,736
she needed to work through.

230
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:05,070
Hello. It's Tobias.

231
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,322
Leave a message.

232
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:07,907
I'm ready to make this work.

233
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:13,162
It was with a sense
of enlightenmentthat Lindsay

234
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:15,122
returned from her
spiritual journey...

235
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:17,416
...to get her hands on
the stimulus money, too, right?

236
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,960
Stop with the prayer hands.

237
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:20,628
It just looks
like you're out of ideas.

238
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,922
Seriously, shoot me
if you ever catch me doing that.

239
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:24,632
Says the least spiritual
man I know.

240
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:26,759
What deal
did you strike with her?

241
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:29,178
What part of her soul
did you buy?

242
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,847
All I've asked
is that she testify

243
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:33,724
that I was a wonderful mother
who did her best.

244
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,100
So all of it.

245
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,269
No, Michael.
I'm not a whore.

246
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,688
I don't get any of the money

247
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,147
until after I do
the disgusting thing.

248
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:42,316
But I'm not here
just for the stimmy.

249
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:43,985
I'm here
because a shaman told me

250
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:46,195
that love is where I left it.

251
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,905
Which, after much soul searching

252
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:51,784
and by process of elimination,
is Tobias.

253
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:53,995
I got the part.

254
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,873
And so Lindsay and Tobias

255
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:59,542
took another shot
at being husband and wife,

256
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,377
and although they wouldn't
have money

257
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:03,880
until after the perjury,
they set about

258
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:05,965
- buying a home.
- Are you ready to make a move?

259
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:09,969
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

260
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:12,137
Oh! Good heavens!

261
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,305
Right!

262
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,765
Well, this is a great area.

263
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:16,475
There's some wonderful
surgi-centers nearby.

264
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,644
We're doing it.
We're really doing this.

265
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,688
Yes! We're gonna get you
in the right house.

266
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,857
And it's just the two of you?
You have no children?

267
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:25,067
We don't.

268
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,611
We should be honest here.

269
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:28,905
We have no income flow.

270
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:30,197
No incoming income flow.

271
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,699
We have plenty
of outgoing income.

272
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:33,409
No savings, no credit.

273
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,702
I mean, we had some stimmy,

274
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:37,120
but that went
to his hospital bills.

275
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:39,498
But there's one thing
we do have--

276
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,499
Work ethic!

277
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,751
Right. No work ethic.

278
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,085
But there's one thing
we do have--

279
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,879
we do have a daughter.

280
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:47,715
I was just on auto-pilot
before, when I said we didn't.

281
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,132
I should have caught that;
yeah, but...

282
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:50,718
I could've spoken up,

283
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,845
but I just wanted to see
if you guys got there.

284
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,471
Well, you guys seem like
a great family.

285
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,181
We have to be realistic.

286
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm in the real estate business.

287
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,351
It's 2006.

288
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,437
That's all good enough for me.

289
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:02,980
We're gonna put you
in a NINJA loan.

290
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:05,024
"No income, no jobs,
no assets."

291
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:06,901
And you don't have to pay
a penny for two years.

292
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:08,360
Oh, NINJA! Please!

293
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:10,195
So we'll take something
cozy and intimate.

294
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,656
- A one-bedroom.
- Or bigger.

295
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:13,908
Yeah, how about something nice?
A three-bedroom?

296
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,992
Three does sound bigger.

297
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:16,744
Oh, it definitely is.

298
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,704
You have to remember
that this was a time

299
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,873
when banks were eager to create
as much debt as possible.

300
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:22,666
...the five-bedroom,
four-car garage.

301
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,252
And I know that you guys
are going to be okay

302
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:26,796
with just one master bathroom,

303
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:29,465
because a lot of people
do prefer two.

304
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,216
You know, they like
to just have it.

305
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,176
Maybe separate, so we have it.

306
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:34,720
So we have it.
That way we have it.

307
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:35,888
That way you have it.

308
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,264
Do you think
we really need one?

309
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:38,724
I'm just gonna
interrupt for a second.

310
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,517
You don't need a wine cellar,

311
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,104
if you want to do wine tastings
in your butler's kitchen.

312
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:45,230
I mean, this really isn't
what we discussed.

313
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,109
Well, we didn't discuss
any of this, but, uh...

314
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,486
yes, uh, I guess, that way,
we... we have it.

315
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:51,737
Well... yeah...

316
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,864
That way,
you'll definitely have it.

317
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:56,742
And then once you have it,
that way, you'll have it.

318
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:59,078
But do we need a gatehouse?

319
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,331
I just put John Beard into a
house with a double gatehouse.

320
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:04,792
Now, that's John Beard;
he's on television.

321
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,251
No one's gonna look down on you

322
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,211
just 'cause you have less
than John Beard.

323
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:09,964
- Is this crazy?
- I think so.

324
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:11,465
We'll take
the double gatehouse.

325
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,174
Oh, is that what you thought?
Because...

326
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,802
- Well, that way, we'll have it.
- We have it. We have it.

327
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:16,386
And that way, you have it.

328
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:17,471
There was a lot of this
going on back then.

329
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:19,556
This way, we have it.

330
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:21,308
And soon, they were
starting their new life

331
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,227
- Good point!
- in their new, beautiful home.

332
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,980
Mother's Day Eve

333
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:28,231
was the most joyous day
of the year.

334
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,400
Maeby, you're gonna
be late for school.

335
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:32,444
And what they lost
in coziness...

336
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,155
God, they grow up so slowly.

337
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:37,198
...they made up for in
cavernous, unfurnished space.

338
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,452
- And the robot's dead again.
- Oh! Poor little guy.

339
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:44,498
Ran out of juice before
he could reach his...

340
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,751
With her mother's
trial coming up,

341
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:51,172
Lindsay made an effort
to work on her testimony.

342
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:52,506
...when I was hungry, I...

343
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:54,717
Go on.

344
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,260
You don't want me to say
this next part, do you?

345
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:58,888
I think it tells the story.

346
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:02,058
But am I
accidentally being funny,

347
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:04,476
or am I purposely being funny?

348
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,936
It's not supposed to be funny.

349
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:08,605
"Suckled at her champagne
glass breasts"?

350
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:09,690
Is it a joke?

351
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:10,900
Buster wrote it.

352
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:12,359
Recently?

353
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:14,611
I adapted it from a letter
he wrote from camp.

354
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:16,113
I miss you, Mommy.

355
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:17,573
Camp is scary at times.

356
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:19,282
When I was cold, you clothed me,

357
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:20,784
when I was hungry...

358
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:23,244
Uh, how do I say this?

359
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:26,790
Suckled at your champagne
glass breasts.

360
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:28,375
Oh, that's good.

361
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:29,919
It doesn't matter.
I'll be proofing it, anyway.

362
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,170
Oh, God.

363
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:33,714
This is from
Camp Kiss-A-Me-Mommy?

364
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:36,008
Just read the copy.
You're getting paid for this.

365
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,093
No. You know what?

366
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:38,301
The money is not
important to me.

367
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:39,720
My shaman said...

368
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:42,932
Oh, don't give me that
mystical nonsense.

369
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:45,017
You think you're
better than I am.

370
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,603
But you're a lot more like me
than you think you are.

371
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:50,064
Now, let's take it from:

372
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:53,025
"I hope she gives me
bubble baths forever."

373
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,027
And I want to smell the suds.

374
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,320
But worse news was
around the corner.

375
00:13:57,362 --> 00:13:59,573
The collapse of the
California housing market

376
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,117
is taking a personal toll...

377
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:03,119
- Uh-oh.
- ...with layoffs here at the station.

378
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,162
In addition,
I'm leaving the keys

379
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:07,248
to my 10,000-square-foot home
in Harbor Shallows

380
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:09,416
- here on the desk...
- Well, it probably

381
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,751
shouldn't affect our area.

382
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:12,086
He's over by
where the fountain is.

383
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:13,212
Might I say to them

384
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:14,964
good luck getting that

385
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:16,924
raccoon smell
out of the gatehouse,

386
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:19,468
because I never could.

387
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,470
But you and I are okay, right?

388
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,472
I mean, this works, right?

389
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:25,099
Never better.

390
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:30,146
And the week
of Lucille's trial,

391
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:32,022
they got some even worse news.

392
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:34,858
What's this?
Mother's not going to pay?

393
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,777
She actually said
she'd only pay me

394
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,361
if my testimony is believable.

395
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:39,863
Lindsay! Lindsay!

396
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:41,406
...but how am I supposed
to say something like

397
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,407
"I love you, Mother!"

398
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,576
and sound believable?

399
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,912
Well, geez... Jesus C. Penny!

400
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,789
You know,
I wish I had the luxury

401
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,666
of not sounding believable.

402
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:53,335
But that's not an option for
an out-of-work actor, is it?

403
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:55,504
Or it's why you're out of work!

404
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:59,091
Well, I beg one's pardon,
but I have been dying to go

405
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:02,011
to that Method Acting Clinic
that I see on my nightly drives,

406
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:03,553
but you won't let me!

407
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:05,722
Because you already
wasted all that money

408
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:08,100
on Carl Weathers'
Master Acting Class.

409
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:11,228
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm such a star

410
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,190
that I didn't pay attention
to anything he said!

411
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:17,526
Oh, well then, maybe I should go
to your Method Acting Class,

412
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,611
to make my testimony
more believable!

413
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:20,988
That's actually a good idea.

414
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,448
Maybe you could--
Oh! Hi. Yes.

415
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,909
Well, perhaps we should
go together.

416
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,288
Yeah. Might be good
for us, as a couple.

417
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,123
I do hope so.

418
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:33,416
I really want
to make this work.

419
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,169
Me, too.

420
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,462
I really love you, Tobias.

421
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,173
Oh, Lindsay, we have

422
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:41,925
got to get you to
that acting clinic.

423
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,678
And that was with me
picturing fudge.

424
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,263
Fudge.

425
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,394
To bond with her husband

426
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:54,730
and prepare for her testimony,

427
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:57,607
Lindsay had decided to attend
an acting class with Tobias.

428
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:59,193
This is the first time

429
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:00,694
I've actually done something
like this with you.

430
00:16:00,736 --> 00:16:02,571
I think I always
kind of looked down on it.

431
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:04,489
You know, Lindsay, I think
you'll find that

432
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,909
some of what used to seem
clueless about me

433
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,619
is actually something
I'm quite good at.

434
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:12,497
This... is where I belong.

435
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,375
If you're new here,
you need to go to the window.

436
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,001
Uh, fill out this form first.

437
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,254
And there's some personal
questions on it, like, uh,

438
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:19,504
how you first got hooked.

439
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:20,881
Well, that's an easy one:

440
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:22,132
You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown.

441
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:24,885
No, uh, no,Mame.

442
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:26,136
No, ma'am...?

443
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:27,554
You're A Good Man...

444
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,014
You're A Good Man,
Charlie Brown.

445
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,266
Gypsy. Gypsy.

446
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:31,558
Just come up here and be

447
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,352
as truthful as possible.

448
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:36,272
Okay, this is
overwhelming.

449
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:37,689
They're starting the monologues.

450
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,234
I think this is from
Songs for My Father.

451
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:41,526
This  is
up, right?

452
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:42,861
What did you say

453
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:43,946
the name of this acting class
was again?

454
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:45,114
Method One Clinic.

455
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:47,157
Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.

456
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,743
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

457
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:52,079
And moments later,
as Lindsay, once again,

458
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:55,665
found herself questioning
her husband's choices,

459
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:56,750
one of hers was questioned.

460
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,210
Ugh! That's not Free Trade,

461
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,962
and if it's not Free Trade,
it's.

462
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:01,671
I wouldn't...

463
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:03,382
You don't look like a junkie.

464
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,217
You do. What do you weigh,
like, 90 pounds?

465
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:07,428
That's so funny!

466
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:08,971
God, um... thank you.

467
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:10,513
But-but no, no.

468
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:12,349
If I'm addicted to anything,
it's alcohol.

469
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:13,683
I'm Lindsay.

470
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:16,728
And you're... hmm!
"Bitéme."

471
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,315
No, I don't like giving my name
to any state organization,

472
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:21,275
especially after I got kicked
off the voter rolls,

473
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:23,777
'cause I accidentally signed up
for the wrong political group.

474
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,821
Wow.
What group was that?

475
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:28,115
You know, I don't even remember.

476
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:30,075
Just some guy in a booth
on the boardwalk.

477
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,701
He joined Al Qaeda.

478
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:32,869
And I only signed up
'cause he was giving away

479
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:34,371
a free beard brush.

480
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:36,457
...that says "Al Qaeda" on it.

481
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:39,335
But maybe he thought it was
the designer of the brush.

482
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:40,710
I'm Marky Bark.

483
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,545
Of the tree-freer Barks?

484
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:44,673
Marky was the son
of Johnny Bark,

485
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:47,550
an activist that Lindsay
had once helped save,

486
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,719
and then kill, a tree.

487
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:50,971
Oh, my God!
I remember him!

488
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:52,222
I remember thinking, one day,

489
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:53,849
he was just gonna
fall out of a tree

490
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,850
and break his neck.

491
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:56,310
Whatever happened to him?

492
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:57,519
He fell out of a tree
and broke his neck.

493
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,603
Oh, God...

494
00:17:58,645 --> 00:17:59,688
No, I'm just kidding.

495
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,482
Oh...

496
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:02,565
So how is he?

497
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:03,608
Oh, he's dead.

498
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,568
But natural causes.

499
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,154
A bunch of deranged bees
chased him out of a tree

500
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:08,322
and he fell to his death.

501
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:09,656
So, are you here alone, or...?

502
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:10,866
No, I'm with her.

503
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:13,618
She's a committee member.

504
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,454
Which committee is that?

505
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:16,955
Itty-bitty.

506
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:19,541
What a wonderful sense of humor.

507
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:22,085
Listen, the only time DeBrie
can keep food down

508
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:23,586
is for about 20 minutes
after she comes crashing

509
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:24,796
off the methadone, so...

510
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,340
- Oh...
- would you care to join us

511
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:27,924
as we rustle up some grub

512
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,801
to shove down our mouths?

513
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,553
I would like that very much.

514
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:33,555
So Tobias and Lindsay drove

515
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,682
to meet their
new friends for lunch.

516
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:38,185
They are such a neat couple!

517
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:39,811
Aren't they neat!

518
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,355
It's so fun to have another
couple to go out with.

519
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:42,898
He's amazing.

520
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,234
I mean, so passionate
about real issues.

521
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,486
He's a real activist--
like me.

522
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,280
And she's a real actress,
like me!

523
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:52,366
Oh, she used to be
in big movies,

524
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,576
but then, like a lot of actors,
the teeth go...

525
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:55,702
Mm!

526
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:56,912
But she is the perfect age

527
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:59,540
to be a Hollywood actress--42.

528
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:00,790
Is that all?

529
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:02,251
Oh, I think this is the place.

530
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,336
It's a barter restaurant.

531
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:06,296
Marky doesn't believe in money.

532
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,340
Do I like barter?

533
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,467
No, it means
they don't deal with money.

534
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:12,135
That's why I swiped
that methadone tray.

535
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:13,803
Hmm.

536
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:16,098
What interesting friends
we've made.

537
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:19,184
I think this is exactly
what our marriage needed.

538
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:27,025
Lindsay and Tobias gathered

539
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,444
with their new friends...

540
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:29,570
Hi, y'all!
This your first time...?

541
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:32,030
...at CW Swappigans,

542
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:34,699
a chain that sprung up
after the economic collapse.

543
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,994
We are like a Salvation Army
meets a soup kitchen,

544
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:39,746
meets a gastro pub,

545
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:43,083
meets a Marxist-or
Leninist-type social structure.

546
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,834
These are things
that you can order

547
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,836
and these are things
that we will accept.

548
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:49,965
As you see on the bottom,
we don't have the fish,

549
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:51,674
and we're not taking
any more lava lamps.

550
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:54,136
Uh-oh!
I can see this one's got

551
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:55,720
that deer
in the headlights look!

552
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,181
Oh, no.
He just took some methadone.

553
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:01,351
He thought he was driving,
with a cocktail tray.

554
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,978
Oh, speaking of that...

555
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:05,105
How about mozzarella sticks
for the table?

556
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:08,317
Cocktail tray, light scratching,
for mozzarella sticks.

557
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:11,027
Six, no sauce.

558
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:13,947
And maybe some sparkling water
for the table.

559
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:16,283
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We're no
longer taking hotel soaps.

560
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:17,826
This is fun.

561
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,911
A lot of people couldn't handle

562
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,746
a Dumpster dive
for their first double date.

563
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,791
Is that what this is?

564
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:27,419
Now, wait... wait a second.

565
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,921
I wasn't driving?

566
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,424
It's just so refreshing
to meet people

567
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:35,385
with real passion
about changing the status quo.

568
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:39,681
Lindsay and I
don't have a single friend.

569
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:40,932
Is the food here yet?

570
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,726
I'm not hungry,
but... but, uh...

571
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:46,229
- Oh, look, it's butter.
- DeBrie.

572
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:49,941
DeBrie, that's our butter.

573
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,277
We were going to swap it
for dessert.

574
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,363
No, she's improvising.
Uh, yes, ma'am.

575
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:56,406
You seem to be liking
that butter substitute

576
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:57,699
at Swappigans.

577
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,159
Uh, yes, and...

578
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,411
wh-what else could you swap for?

579
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:03,830
Uh, yes, and... uh...

580
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:05,290
Oh, I'm out. She's too good.

581
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,875
I... I don't know who my guy is.

582
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,335
I don't... I don't have a guy.

583
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:09,711
No, she just likes butter.

584
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:11,380
Come on, let's get you
cleaned up.

585
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:12,797
- Don't touch anything.
- Marky, I'll take her.

586
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,132
You two just got here.

587
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:15,842
Have a chat about.
I'll clean her up.

588
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:17,636
- Come on, DeBrie.
- Num, num, num, num.

589
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:19,137
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

590
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,639
I-I love it here.

591
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,807
My mother would hate this place.

592
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,601
You know, Lindsay,
I-I have to tell you,

593
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:26,895
when I first met you,
I thought you were one of those

594
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:30,732
typical, uptight, snobby,
Newport Beach,

595
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:32,859
vapid... nut-busters!

596
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:36,363
You know, one of those monsters

597
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:37,906
that lives in
a 10,000-square-foot house

598
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:39,408
that they destroyed
the wetlands for.

599
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,117
Those were wetlands?

600
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,579
That explains
our Thanksgiving miracle.

601
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,163
What do you mean,
you didn't make dinner?

602
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:46,873
I didn't realize
it was Thursday, okay?

603
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:48,625
There's got to be
something here.

604
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,503
Oh! Oh!

605
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:53,338
Oh! Get it! Get it!

606
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,048
Chase it into the oven!

607
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,384
Come on. Come on.
Here, little ducky.

608
00:21:57,426 --> 00:21:59,135
- That's a good duck.
- Good duck.

609
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:01,597
In you go!

610
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:04,933
This is going to be
the greatest Thanksgiving ever.

611
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,185
It's a miracle!

612
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:08,895
Well, I actually do live

613
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:10,647
in a fairly large house
right now.

614
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:12,274
But we've never made
a payment on it.

615
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:13,858
So you're sticking it
to Big Banking.

616
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,027
- That's cool.
- Yes.

617
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,946
In fact, I'm only in America

618
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:19,656
because a shaman told me
that love

619
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:21,908
would come to me
when I accepted who I am

620
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,826
- and didn't run away.
- Sounds like a good shaman.

621
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:26,913
Oh, he was the house shaman
at the Four Seasons Mumbai,

622
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:29,790
so you figure
he's got to be pretty good.

623
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,711
Oh, and he turned into
an ostrich at the end, so...

624
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:35,130
They're not going to have that
at the Embassy Suites.

625
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:38,216
That's funny.
I actually run an ostrich farm.

626
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:42,512
♪ Co... incidence! ♪

627
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:44,598
That's not a coincidence.

628
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,891
♪ Yes, it is. ♪

629
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,144
Mini pizzas, no pepperoni!

630
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:50,604
Marky, I've got to tell you,

631
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,272
talking about these
social issues, it's...

632
00:22:52,314 --> 00:22:54,857
the first time I've felt
like myself

633
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:56,485
in a really long time.

634
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:59,362
That's because I say
what I mean, I do what I feel.

635
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:00,781
No lies.

636
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,240
Lindsay felt guilty

637
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:04,117
because she was about
to go enter

638
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,161
a crab house/courtroom
and do just that.

639
00:23:06,202 --> 00:23:07,621
That's why my motto is:

640
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:10,332
"Live truthfully
and skate through life."

641
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:13,460
Marky felt guilty
because it wasn't his motto.

642
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:16,505
It was the motto of a surf
and skateboard company.

643
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:17,714
Live truthfully.

644
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:19,257
Skate through life.

645
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:21,842
That's amazing.

646
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,345
I haven't felt this deep

647
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:26,556
a connection with someone
in a long, long time.

648
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:31,978
Other than DeBrie.

649
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,938
I can't believe
we just did that.

650
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,898
I can't believe how little give
your teeth have.

651
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,984
So, where do you keep
your ostriches?

652
00:23:38,026 --> 00:23:39,319
Sheraton mini soap
for a taco salad?

653
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:41,070
We don't take hotel soap!

654
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:43,031
And perhaps it was
to get back at her mother...

655
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:45,492
- Leave a tip! Leave a tip!
- ...or to get out of

656
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:48,161
a relationship that had
been over for a long time,

657
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:50,163
but that's when
Lindsay hopped off

658
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:53,333
to pursue a life
she felt was her destiny.

659
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,918
And the new lovers
discovered each other.

660
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,296
The beautiful female body,

661
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:00,549
the horrible male.

662
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,598
Wow. That was so...

663
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,475
- fast.
- Thanks.

664
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:13,061
Well, I didn't know how long
we'd be stuck in traffic, so...

665
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:14,604
Oh! And it sounds

666
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:16,857
- like it's moving, so...
- Move it!

667
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:17,940
Come on! Come on!

668
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:20,151
- Let's go!
- Careful!

669
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:23,488
And as they drove, they learned
so much about each other.

670
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,948
I was always just
in such a rush to grow up

671
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,326
and change this world,
and foolishly,

672
00:24:28,368 --> 00:24:30,704
the teeth I pulled
were my adult teeth,

673
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:33,498
so this guy all the way
to that guy back there,

674
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,792
that's a... just a piece
of wood I stick in there.

675
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,252
I mean, they're just
chewing tools.

676
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:39,003
I don't care about looks.

677
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,256
But you find me pretty,
though, right?

678
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:42,549
No.

679
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:44,217
I have no idea
what you look like.

680
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:46,010
I have this condition
called face blindness.

681
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:48,054
I mean, I can tell
you're a woman.

682
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:49,472
Oh, stop.

683
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:51,974
But, honestly, no,
all I see is, like,

684
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:55,437
eyes and nose, you know,
hair, ears and...

685
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:57,856
But I can tell you got
a great heart, Lindsay.

686
00:24:57,898 --> 00:24:59,900
I can tell
you've been living a lie.

687
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,193
You and I are going to change
this world together.

688
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:05,697
You know, my shaman

689
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:07,948
told me that I should stop
caring about appearances.

690
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,536
You know, my whole life, that's
all anyone has ever praised.

691
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,954
All my mom ever cared about.

692
00:25:13,996 --> 00:25:16,082
Because I'm really pretty.

693
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:19,335
I just thought I'd tell you that
so the story made sense.

694
00:25:19,377 --> 00:25:22,171
- I don't care.
- But I guess it's kind of karma

695
00:25:22,213 --> 00:25:24,841
that I ended up with someone
who wanted to make love to me

696
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:26,259
no matter what I look like.

697
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:28,428
Also wanted to make sure
you weren't a dude.

698
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,598
I can tell with voices usually,
but some guys, they'll...

699
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,601
they'll fool you
if that's what they want to do.

700
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:36,770
Hey...

701
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:40,857
Are you smiling at me?

702
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,609
Lindsay decided
it was only fair

703
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:44,569
to let her husband know

704
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,822
their new start
had reached a new end.

705
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:48,239
I left.

706
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,449
I guess you noticed.

707
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:51,159
Um, look, I'm sorry.

708
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,871
I-I really do care about you,
Tobias, but we were trying

709
00:25:54,913 --> 00:25:57,749
to save something
that just couldn't be saved.

710
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,919
And I have to follow
my shaman's advice. I...

711
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:05,423
I have to be true
to myself for once.

712
00:26:05,465 --> 00:26:09,218
And Marky, he sees me
for who I really am.

713
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,346
- He respects me and...
- Come on, lady!

714
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:12,722
You want to wrap this up?

715
00:26:12,764 --> 00:26:14,474
My lady needs to call
her loser ex.

716
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:16,643
Marky, it's me.

717
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:18,227
It's Lindsay.

718
00:26:19,187 --> 00:26:20,355
Oh.

719
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:21,773
I thought you
were taking a dump.

720
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:22,858
Oh, I must have
scared the

721
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:24,442
off that lady in the bathroom

722
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:27,737
when I threw the door open
and told her I loved her.

723
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:31,491
He loves me?

724
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,075
Sorry. False alarm.

725
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:34,577
- I don't love you.
- Uh, I got to go.

726
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:36,371
Can you delete this
so I can leave

727
00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:37,914
- a message for Maeby?
- It's good. She's fine.

728
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:39,916
And soon, the lovers arrived

729
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:42,878
and discovered the joys
of their new desert home,

730
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,006
dancing and making love
all night.

731
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:49,133
Now, that time...

732
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,011
was also very quick.

733
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:54,597
And now we've freed the night up
to dance again.

734
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:55,849
- Come on.
- Oh. Okay.

735
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,350
And the next day,

736
00:26:57,392 --> 00:26:59,227
Lindsay awoke
to discover the destiny

737
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:03,231
foretold to her in India
in drab colors before her.

738
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:05,191
Get away from her.

739
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:06,317
Don't mess with her!

740
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,527
She's none of your business.

741
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:09,237
Thank you.

742
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:11,322
I said get away from her,
you slut!

743
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:12,281
You're scaring the bird.

744
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:13,825
No, no, Mom.

745
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,535
Mom, she's with us.

746
00:27:15,577 --> 00:27:17,620
She lives with us now.

747
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:20,957
And, Mom,
she tells me she's pretty.

748
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:24,044
I have the worst  shaman.

749
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:35,471
The defense calls to the
oyster bar thing where they sit

750
00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:37,223
the adopted daughter,
Lindsay Bluth.

751
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:39,768
Another chair is empty

752
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:41,310
- at Lucille's trial.
- Lindsay...

753
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:43,187
Mr. Zuckerkorn,

754
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:46,315
Shrimp-Shooter Nights
starts in 15 minutes.

755
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:47,567
Is your witness going to appear?

756
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,611
"Appear."

757
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:52,697
Oh, I thought the one
on the pier was a Bubba Gump's.

758
00:27:54,323 --> 00:27:56,659
And, in an effort
to be less glamorous,

759
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:59,704
Lindsay cuts her hair
only to discover,

760
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:02,415
- much to her frustration...
- Great. Even cuter.

761
00:28:02,457 --> 00:28:04,500
And Tobias becomes addicted

762
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:07,378
- to his new profession.
- I'm an addict, and I'm starving.

763
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,714
Yes, you are starving,
so would you like some butter?

764
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,091
I could give you some butter,

765
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:14,010
and, uh, you can pay for it
w-with a shoe.

766
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:15,762
Um... I'm sorry, but, uh,

767
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:18,306
his guy's not giving my guy
anything, uh, to react to.

768
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:20,850
Uh, could I get some more
of that, uh, acting juice?

769
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:23,939
