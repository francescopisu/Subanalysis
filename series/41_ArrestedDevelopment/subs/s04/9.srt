00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:13,840
<i>The Austerity Clinic</i>
<i>was a well-known rehab facility</i>

2
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:15,800
<i>that, on this particular day,</i>

3
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:17,844
<i>was about to get</i>
<i>a new therapist.</i>

4
00:00:17,886 --> 00:00:22,223
Hello, everyone,
I am Dr. Tobias Funke

5
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:24,434
and I will be your therapist.

6
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:26,895
Yes, I'm getting to that.

7
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,898
And I am also
a registered sex offender.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,399
Now, let's have a wrap-about.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,444
I am here because...

10
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:38,323
Lucille Austero has given me
the opportunity

11
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:40,117
to pay my debt to society.

12
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,910
- I'm doing this pro bono...
- <i>Although technically</i>

13
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:44,788
<i>it was society that owed him,</i>
<i>as he was the victim</i>

14
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,206
<i>of a merry mix-up.</i>

15
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,708
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,251
Daddy needs to get his rocks...

17
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,045
<i>We don't have</i>
<i>to hear this again,</i>

18
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:54,756
<i>but he was arrested</i>
<i>despite his innocence.</i>

19
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:56,549
Oh, hey, Officers,
are you here for the raccoon?

20
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,259
Oh, no, I'm not a raccoon,
I'm...

21
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,469
<i>Because, instead</i>

22
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:01,180
<i>of asking for a lawyer...</i>

23
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:03,015
<i>...this creep chose to ask</i>

24
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:04,224
<i>about a more pressing matter.</i>

25
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:05,684
Oh, is this going to be
SAG or AFTRA?

26
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,019
<i>And for the first time,</i>

27
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,436
<i>Tobias started</i>
<i>to get recognized</i>

28
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,481
<i>for his television work.</i>

29
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:14,567
Oh, no, no, that's not
representative of who I am.

30
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,569
- Anus tart.
- Yep, that's me.

31
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:18,404
<i>Fortunately</i>
<i>Tobias, who had once</i>

32
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:21,241
<i>turned down an offer</i>
<i>from Lucille 2...</i>

33
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:24,911
- How would you like to come work
for me at Austerity? -Hmm... no.

34
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:27,330
- Hmm...-<i>... had, after</i>
<i>a particularly vicious beating</i>

35
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:30,250
<i>with a soup ladle,</i>
<i>changed his tune...</i>

36
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,794
<i>but didn't want</i>
<i>to look too eager.</i>

37
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:34,213
Yes.

38
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:38,008
I'm also an analyst
and a therapist,

39
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,634
which makes me...

40
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:42,679
<i>Prison had taught Tobias</i>
<i>at least one thing...</i>

41
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,723
...a theralyst.

42
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:47,017
Now, let's have a wrap-about,

43
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:49,477
and what we'll do is just
take a comfy pose.

44
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,397
I want everybody just to sit
back and relax where they are

45
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:54,482
and let's learn
about each other

46
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:57,360
and let's find out about each...

47
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:59,029
Oh, my goodness.

48
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:02,657
Wow, well, uh, it seems as if
we are amongst royalty here.

49
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:04,993
I-I'm sorry, how old are you?

50
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:06,745
- 23. -Ah, well within my rights.

51
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:09,998
Yes, why don't you, uh, take
the comfortable chair?

52
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,417
And, um, and we're going

54
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,130
Hi, I'm Mark.

No, no, Mark Cherry,
I was, I was having fun.

59
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:33,813
I, I have a bit of a wit.

60
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,941
Sometimes I have to tell people
'cause they can't figure it out

61

63
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:43,489
So I got involved with drugs,

64
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:46,451

179
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:19,932
<i>It's Tobias'</i>
Arrested Development.

180
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:27,023
<i>Tobias had found a way to spend</i>
<i>time with the woman he loved.</i>

181
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:30,443
Please, DeBrie,
you've got to do this.

182
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,362
<i>Now he just had</i>
<i>to talk her into it.</i>

183
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:35,781
I mean, this could be good for
you and it could be a huge hit

184
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,868
and it's really the only way
they're gonna keep us together.

185
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,245
They won't let me be
your therapist,

186
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:41,996
but they'll let me be
your director.

187
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:45,708
I want the world to be able
to see this angel face.

188
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,668
- Oh.
- Oh, oh, dear.

189
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,046
Well, that's a good luck sign
on Broadway.

190
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:51,964
On the East Coast it's "break
a leg," on the West Coast it's

191
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:53,592
- "lose a tooth."<i>-And so,</i>
<i>excited that he'd found a way</i>

192
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,343
<i>- to both be with DeBrie...</i>
- Let's get you some epoxy.

193
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:57,554
<i>- ...and help her recovery,</i>
<i>Tobias went...</i>-Beard!

194
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:59,055
<i>...to Sudden Valley.</i>

195
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:01,974
Beard, I'm only here
to pick up my car keys.

196
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,643
Tobias?

197
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:04,644
Gob?

198
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:08,898
Good to see you, old friend.

199
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,191
What have you been up to?

200
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,569
Oh, uh, things are good,
nothing much.

201
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:13,819
I'm a registered sex offender,

202
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,405
- but things are good.
- Yes, yes.

203
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:17,449
And I'm working
at Lucille 2's rehab center--

204
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,077
the one she owns, not the one
she famously went to 12 times.

205
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,870
Can we finish this up
over breakfast? I'm starving.

206
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:24,956
Oh, is it finishing?
Okay.

207
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:26,666
<i>And the two friends caught up.</i>

208
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,543
But if I wouldn't have gotten
arrested, I wouldn't have

209
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,002
ended up working at the rehab

210
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:31,879
and I wouldn't have reconnected
with my love.

211
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:33,923
True, I can't ethically ravage
her body.

212
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,967
I have to leave that
to time, but

213
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,094
she's just so much fun
to be with.

214
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:39,596
I too am in a relationship,

215
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:41,431
but this person is
sort of a celebrity.

216
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:45,226
Well, turns out my femme fatale
is a bit of a celebrity herself.

217
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:48,521
Well, looks like life is going
pretty well for both of us,

218
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:49,855
except that I'm broke.

219
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,399
And I'm a sex offender.

220
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,775
Michael expects me to sell

221
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:54,152
these split-level death traps.

222
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:56,195
And how am I
supposed to do that?

223
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,573
I mean, there are no schools
or libraries or Internet

224
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,492
or playgrounds
within 20 miles of here.

225
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:05,455
You know, it's funny, I've been
looking for a place to live,

226
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:07,957
and that fills virtually
every parole requirement I have.

227
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,000
That's great.

228
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,251
When can you move in?

229
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:12,837
Uh, duh. Now.

230
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:14,714
<i>And with his living</i>
<i>arrangements taken care of,</i>

231
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,966
<i>Tobias returned to his</i>
<i>court-appointed work-release.</i>

232
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:18,510
One, two, three, four, five...

233
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:21,304
<i>And so began</i>
<i>an intense workshop to create</i>

234
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:25,099
<i>the</i>Fantastic Four<i>musical,</i>
<i>written and directed by Tobias.</i>

235
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:27,393
Now, the script is in process,
but the goal is

236
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:30,104
that we all get a little outing
on the Cinco de Cuatro,

237
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:32,440
where we'll be performing it
on a boat.

238
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,192
I hope no one gets seasick.

239
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:38,070
Okay. And Mark Cherry is going
to be doing the music for us.

240
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,698
And this will make
my stay shorter, right?

241
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:41,282
I'll get out of here
a week sooner?

242
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:43,451
Well, sobriety is
the most important thing,

243
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:45,828
but we'll see
how good the music is.

244
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,121
<i>Tobias inspired the troops.</i>

245
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,456
All right, let's get up!

246
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:50,542
<i>And after some</i>
<i>initial trepidation,</i>

247
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,918
<i>Argyle set to work</i>
<i>with the choreography.</i>

248
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,212
Back, step.

249
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,672
Out, back, step, back, step.

250
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:57,215
Out-- now, try that.

251
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:59,551

<i>And even though</i>
<i>DeBrie had some trouble</i>

253
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:03,680
<i>with the choreography</i>
<i>at first...</i>

254
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:05,139
- ...shuffle, step.

255
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:06,516
- Oh, God.
- Are you all right?

256
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:07,808
- Yeah, yeah.
- Baby steps, Argyle.

257
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,227
She's brittle.

258
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:11,312
Tobias, it does not
get babier than this.

259
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:13,189
- Maybe I can't do this.
- You can do it.

260
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:15,107
Tobias, I can do it.
I used to be a hoofer.

261

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,591

between $50 and $100?

326
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,719
How much of the remainder
could you generate?

327
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,347
Well, if my sister could call in
some debts, probably all of it.

328
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:52,891
- Oh.
- But that means

329
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:55,727
we'd have to use
the Cinco show as a preview,

330
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:58,020
and she would want to know
that we have the rights.

331
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,397
Of course, of course.

332
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:01,440
Wait a minute.
We don't have the rights?

333
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:03,067
Well, not yet.

334
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:04,861
Not yet, but I was
going to ask you about that.

335
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:06,278
Who produced the one
you were in?

336
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,907
Uh, I think
it's Imagine Generic.

337
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:10,449
Ron Howard's company.

338
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:13,118
<i>Imagine Generic</i>

00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:21,586
Three of us?

343
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:26,507
Houston, we're having a baby.

344
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:30,344
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to get arrested again</i>

345
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:31,763
because we don't
have the rights.

346
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:32,805
Okay, no, all right.

347
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,432
No, no! All right. Settle down.

348
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:36,058
Settle down.
This has happened to

349
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,770
every Broadway show in
the history of Broadway shows.

350
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:43,566
And I swear I shall
acquire the rights.

351
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,610
<i>So Tobias went to do so,</i>

352
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:47,737
<i>as Argyle set a dinner date</i>
<i>with his sister</i>

353
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,822
<i>at the Balboa Club...</i>

354
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:51,866
- Imagine Entertainment.
- Oh!

355
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:53,868
<i>...on the same night</i>
<i>that Michael's date, Rebel,</i>

356
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,828
<i>was finding her father's</i>
<i>character under attack.</i>

357
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,914
...uh, Ron is not
like that at all.

358
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:00,165
<i>Of course, Michael thought</i>
<i>Ron was Rebel's boyfriend.</i>

359
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,876
In fact,
he's almost too generous.

360
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,252
Sounds like the Ron Howard

361
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:04,587
Man of the Year Awards, though,
you know?

362
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:05,588
<i>And the evening broke up</i>

363
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,047
<i>of its own accord.</i>

364
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:08,925
- My son is sick, so...
- Oh, no.

365
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,259
I have to go.

366
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:11,636
Rebel.

367
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,638
Rebel, let me come.
I'm great with kids.

368
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,139
It's not about the kid.

369
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,682
I'm not comfortable here.

370
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,601
Okay. Are you off to see him?

371
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:20,060
Listen, if you've got a problem
with me seeing other people,

372
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:21,479
why don't you just
come out and say it?

373
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,730
No, no, no, I can.

374
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:24,231
What do you mean?
I can handle that.

375
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:25,733
We'll see each other a la carte,
you know?

376
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:26,985
Like the $18 baked potato

377
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:28,861
you ordered
that you didn't touch.

378
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,863
Yeah, you're not comfortable.

379
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,156
Yeah, no, well, listen.

380
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,157
Rebel, Rebel.

381
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:34,199
Fine. See you later.

382
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,035
Say hi to Ron Howard for me.

383
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,912
<i>And perhaps because neither</i>
<i>Michael nor Lindsay</i>

384
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:40,748
<i>could handle rejection,</i>
<i>they blamed each other.</i>

385
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,207
Well, hope you're happy.
My girlfriend left,

386
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,584
'cause she can't stand
your right-wing

387
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:45,127
American scallop-eating
boyfriend.

388
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:48,006
Well, he left because
your chirpy little actress

389
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,841
- couldn't keep her mouth shut.
- That's it.

390
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:51,425
Know what?
You're out of the movie.

391
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,969
Fine.

392
00:14:53,011 --> 00:14:55,554
- Good night.
- Good night.

393
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:58,516
<i>And with his evening freed up,</i>
<i>Michael reached out to a son</i>

394
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:00,184
<i>- he'd earlier blown off.</i>
- Good night.

395
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:01,226
George Michael, hey.

396
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,520
Got out of it.

397
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:04,814
I just-- I made
a ton of people angry,

398
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:06,816
family...

399
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:09,027
Well, ah, gosh,
you know, I really wanted to,

400
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:12,279
uh, do that, but I just had
this work thing come up.

401
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,073
And, uh, it's like
you always say:

402
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,701
family first,
unless there's a work thing,

403
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,160
and then work first.

404
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:19,745
I have said that, too.

405
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:23,123
Well, I've got politics
and producing stuff I can...

406
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:25,459
<i>After being kicked out</i>
<i>of his son's dorm</i>

407
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:27,252
<i>and stood up</i>
<i>at the Ealing Club,</i>

408
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,505
<i>this particular rejection</i>
<i>really hurt.</i>

409
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:30,882
Another time.

410
00:15:30,923 --> 00:15:32,717
<i>But he tried to put on</i>
<i>a brave face</i>

411
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:34,927
<i>when he ran into a woman</i>
<i>he was in debt to.</i>

412
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:37,013
- Who is this?
- Oh, this is

413
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:38,180
my baby brother, Argyle.

414
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:39,849
And here's the family joke:

415
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:42,685
I'm a tall drink of water,
and he's the chaser.

416
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:46,022
Should be flipped, right?

417
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:48,900
No, because here's another joke:
you owe my sister

418
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:52,904
$700,000, and I'm going to
chase you down until you pay up.

419
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:54,947
And if you don't pay up
by the fourth,

420
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,407
you're gonna be washing up

421
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:58,910
with the rest of
the broken piñatas on the fifth.

422
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:00,327
Lucille!

423
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:01,328
Oh, hello.

424
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,663
Who's-- ow, ow!

425
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,164
God, what is on the bottom
of those shoes?

426
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,541
Taps.

427
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,210
And I can tap dance
all over your face,

428
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:09,628
if you know what I mean.

429
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,922
Even if my heart won't

430
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:12,631
snap back into place.

431
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:14,550
I don't know what you meant
with the last part there.

432
00:16:14,592 --> 00:16:17,053
I'll chase you down
and find you, Michael.

433
00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:19,179
You can't hide
in a gorilla suit from me.

434
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:23,976
♪<i>Mr. F.</i>♪

435
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,477
<i>Argyle was wrong on that count.</i>

436
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,898

Any progress on the rights?

439
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:34,653
I'm in talks with Imagine.

440
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:35,780
<i>Well, kinda.</i>

441
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:38,198
<i>Ron Howard's office.</i>

442
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,992
Yes, this is Tobias Funke.

443
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,577
I'm a registered sex offender,

444
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,454
and I'd like to talk to Ron...

445
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:46,124
Well, then you're gonna have
to work with our new patient,

446
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:47,416
and good luck with her.

447
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,627
We call her the "B" word
from the "C" ward.

448
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:51,963
Or is it the "C" word
from the "B" ward?

449
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:57,468
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>Tobias got some more bad news.</i>

450
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:59,303
Hello, anus tart.

451
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:02,264
<i>And she never even saw</i>
<i>the license plate.</i>

452
00:17:04,683 --> 00:17:07,186
<i>Tobias had no way</i>
<i>of being around DeBrie</i>

453
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:10,230
<i>without the rights</i>
<i>to</i>Fantastic Four.

454
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:13,943
<i>And that's when he ran into</i>
<i>an equally worried Michael.</i>

455
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:14,902
You okay?

456
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:16,695
Michael.

457
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,823
What a pleasant surprise.

458
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:21,075
Please, make yourself at home.

459
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:22,576
I am. I'm home.

460
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:25,454
This is my-- I own
all the homes here, actually.

461
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:27,706
And Gob's supposed to be
selling these, so...

462
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:28,958
Where is he? Do you know?

463
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,042
Oh, out and about.

464
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:32,544
Me doth think he hath a lady.

465
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,588
- As doth I dooth.
- Oh.

466
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,966
And they're both
bit of, uh, celebrities.

467
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:39,927
Well, that is odd, because
I-I'm also dating a celebrity.

468
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,887
Oh, perchance a double date
is in our future,

469
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,848
- eh, brother-in-law?
- I don't...

470
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:44,932
Tell me about her.

471
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:47,434
I-- you know, I-I don't think

472
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,020
that-that you're the best one
to talk to

473
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:51,313
about my relationship
difficulties.

474
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:52,940
Fair enough.

475
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:56,360
It's only what I do
for a living, Michael.

476
00:17:57,945 --> 00:18:00,823
What I'm trained to do.

477
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:03,701
- Well, let-let me tell you
a little bit about her. -Okay.

478
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:05,203
So it's a simple choice, really.

479
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:06,495
If I keep seeing her,

480
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,080
he'll find out
and kill the movie.

481
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:10,415
So I either keep the girl
and lose the movie,

482
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,668
or I keep the movie,
lose the girl.

483
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,713
But the whole reason that I did
the movie was to get the girl.

484
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:16,755
It's...

485
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:20,926
Michael, I appreciate
your bravery.

486
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:22,803
And I know
everything seems doomed now--

487
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:25,097
and believe me, I'm in
a similar situation myself--

488
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,267
but trust me...

489
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:30,435
...we are .

490
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,603
You're .

491
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:35,399
I mean, unless some sort of
miracle coincidence happens.

492
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,695
But, no, the best thing to do
is just walk away,

493
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:42,865
and we'll lick
each other's wounds.

494
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,117
I guess I'm just going
to have to give up my dream

495
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,452
and my love forever.

496
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,289
I think I should just go tell
Ron Howard that it is over.

497
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,083
Yes. R-Ron Howard?

498
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:53,584
- Ron Howard's making this movie?
- Yeah.

499
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,502
Michael, you can't just
walk away from this.

500
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:56,962
You have to go talk to him.

501
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,380
You just told me
the exact opposite.

502
00:18:58,422 --> 00:18:59,924
Reverse psychology.
It didn't work.

503
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:01,259
How's this?

504
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,968
What I'm going to do for you,
Michael,

505
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,723
is, I am going to go there
with you for moral support

506
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,474
and I will act as your assistant

507
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:12,519
and maybe I'll do
my famous gay character.

508
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:14,396
I don't think you've seen
that character.

509
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:16,190
I think I have.

510
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:19,902
Mm... I don't think so.

511
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,863
<i>The next day Michael sat down</i>

512
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:26,575
<i>for a one-on-one meeting</i>
<i>with Ron Howard</i>

513
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:28,035
<i>- at Imagine.</i>
- Hi, thank you for seeing me.

514
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:29,787
Oh, well, that's fine, but

515
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:33,082
I should warn you, this is what
I call a haircut meeting, so

516
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:35,167
- we probably don't have
much time. -Okay.

517
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,877
It would be so much better
if we could just lose

518
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,545
- the baseball cap.
- We go through this every time.

519
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:40,256
This is a hat-on haircut,

520
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:42,133
so you just cut
what they can see.

521
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:43,301
You got it, Floyd?

522
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:44,302
I call all my barbers Floyd.

523
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:45,594
I'm gonna make this quick.

524
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,058
Are you not going
to introduce me?

525
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,060
Thought you were going
to wait in the lobby.

526
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:54,312
Tobias Funke.

527
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:55,437
I am a producer as well.

528
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:57,940
- Hey.
- But I'm also an actor.

529
00:19:57,982 --> 00:19:59,275
That's probably
what confused you.

530
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:01,277
Um, I've done
several inmate roles

531
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,570
as well as a couple
of "And as it is such,

532
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:05,823
so also as such is it
unto you"s,

533
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:08,117
but I'll get to you after.

534
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,827
Well, that's terrific.

535
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:11,870
- Do you notice that he's already
on my neck hair? -Yes.

536
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:13,664
Last time I was in here,
we talked about,

537
00:20:13,705 --> 00:20:15,582
I wouldn't come back until I had
all the release signatures.

538
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:17,417
- I wanted to give you
an update on that. -Terrific.

539
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:19,461
You can just leave 'em
on Louisa's desk.

540
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:21,505
What-- but that, uh,
that's the update.

541
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:23,465
I don't have them.

542
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:25,259
Done.

543
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:26,760
Okay, well, thanks for coming.

544
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:28,512
Well, um...

545
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:30,430
- Don't you have something else
you wanted to say? -Yeah.

546
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:32,266
If not, I'll do mine.

547
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,476
No, no, no.
What? I don't...

548
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:36,187
Ron,

549
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:38,856
I care about someone deeply
and I think

550
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:41,066
that you may also care
about this person.

551
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:42,901
Hey, that's terrific.

552
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:45,321
It's Rebel-- Rebel Alley,

553
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:49,074
and she thinks that you're going
to always be in her life.

554
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,285
I'm glad to know
she thinks that.

555
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,412
- Yeah. -Tell him
how you feel about her.

556
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,247
Yeah, I-- you know,
I'm crazy about her,

557
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,749
and, and I just-- I'm not going
to be able to do anything

558
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,379
about that until you let her go.

559
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,963
- She's my little num-num.
- Sure.

560
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,340
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Of course.

561
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:06,258
I-I've changed her,
I've bathed her.

562
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,510
Well, now you want to bathe her.

563
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:10,804
Yeah, it's, it's my time
to bathe her.

564
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:12,181
She should be your num-num.

565
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:14,975
She should be my num-num,
and you've got

566
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:18,145
to just let her go, I think,
once and for all.

567
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:20,022
You know, a father doesn't
really like to hear that

568
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:21,523
when it comes to his daughter.

569
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:23,608
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her father.

570
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,277
Yeah, I have,
I have not yet had a chance

571
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,820
to talk to her father, but...

572
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:29,698
No, no, I was,
I was saying that.

573
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,868
Because you are talking
to her father.

574
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:49,634
Did you not know
that I'm Rebel's dad?

575
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:52,679
I knew that part.

576
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,269
But I, I also--

577
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,731
I thought that, that, that,
that you might also be...

578
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:04,900
her...

579
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:09,280
Her lover?

580
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:11,115
- No.
- Well,

581
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:13,533
this is hardly an episode
of<i>Happy Days.</i>

582
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:14,826
I get it.

583
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,745
I was arrested
as a sex offender,

584
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,747
but at least I knew
it was my daughter

585
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:21,333
I was arrested for coming on
to. -

586
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,543
Now, about my project,
it's a family piece.

587
00:22:23,585 --> 00:22:25,463
Does this mean
our project is dead?

588
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:29,216
Listen, I never let personal
matters interfere with business.

589
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:32,219
However, you should know
she's dating someone else, and

590
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:33,720
I'll do everything in my power
to make sure

591
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:35,264
she never dates you again.

592
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:37,349
Incredibly fair of you.

593
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:40,060
Well, that was
a merry mix-up, eh?

594
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:42,020
Now, about my project--

595
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:44,273
it's based on something
that you produced in '92--

596
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:46,150
<i>The Fantastic Four.</i>

597
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:48,444
- Well, that was a favor that I
did for Fox. -Well, it turns out

598
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:52,323
that one of the leads, DeBrie,
played Sue Storm.

599
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:54,074
In fact, she is the leading lady

600
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:58,329
in my production
<i>- The Musical,</i>

601
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,081
which, with a wave
of your little pink hand,

602
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:02,624
you could make happen,

603
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,168
and then I'd owe you one.

604
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:07,171
Well, uh, thanks,
but, uh, I couldn't do that.

605
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:09,465
It, it would just be
so incredibly meaningful

606
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:11,591
an-an-and change so many lives.

607
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:13,802
I can't do it, but...

608
00:23:14,678 --> 00:23:16,847
...I also don't want to.

609
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:24,646
You are ruining my life,
Ron Howard!

610
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:25,814
No, no, no, no, no, no.

611
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:27,566
- No, no, no, no...
- You're ruining... -Aah, Louisa!

612
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:33,238
I'm gonna start wearing a hat
when I get my hair cut, too.

613
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,781
What is wrong with you?

614
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:38,369
You knew that Ron Howard was
Rebel Alley's father?

615
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,204
Yes, everyone does.

616
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:42,206
I didn't realize that's who
you thought the other man was,

617
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:44,458
but the good news is,
at least one of our projects

618
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,919
is still going, which, by the
way, I haven't signed this yet.

619
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,129
Should I?

620
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:52,550
Yes, absolutely, thank you.

621
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:55,677
Okay, my movie rights.

622

00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:16,360
is okay with all of this?

684
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,987
Hmm, I'm sure they think of this
as an homage.

685
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:21,906
Yes. Okay, well, I'm going to go
put on my rock monster outfit

686
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,450
and pass out some fliers.

687
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:24,951
You can take any boat
to the float.

688
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:26,578
Oh, Tobias.

689
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,787
I don't think I can do this.

690
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:30,624
You can do anything
I want you to do.

691
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,834
And-and you want to do as well.

692
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:34,628
We need this.

693
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,630
This will make
all our old dreams come true.

694
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,757
But maybe they're old
for a reason.

695
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,719
Oh, you're focusing
on the wrong words.

696
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,554
If we can get through tonight,
DeBrie,

697
00:26:43,595 --> 00:26:45,013
we can get through anything.

698
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:46,348
Don't worry about it.

699
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,183
The audience will be
completely drunk,

700
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:50,101
and if we're not perfect,
they'll take it out on us,

701
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:52,437
but... that's why you're going
to be perfect.

702
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,980
You have to be perfect.

703
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:55,524
- : Okay.
- : Okay.

704
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,359
- All right.
<i>- But Tobias was about</i>

705
00:26:57,401 --> 00:27:00,320
<i>to discover a situation</i>
<i>that was less than perfect.</i>

706
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:02,740
- What?! Oh, no.
- Fantastic Four!

707
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:04,783
Who would bring kids here?
This is no place for...

708
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,826
I'm a registered sex offender.

709
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:08,036
All right.

710
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:09,287
I'm a registered...

711
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:10,497
I'm a registered sex offender.

712
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,249
I'm a registered
sex offender.

713
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,626
<i>Tobias knew that wearing</i>
<i>the Thing outfit</i>

714
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:16,920
<i>would only make him</i>
<i>more recognizable,</i>

715
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:19,297
<i>- so he was at a loss.</i>
- Fantastic Four!

716
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,092
<i>- DeBrie was also at a loss.</i>
- Okay, okay.

717
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,885
<i>Feeling frightened and fragile,</i>

718
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:27,222
<i>she tried to keep it together</i>
<i>in a very slippery place.</i>

719
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:29,099
<i>And she probably would have</i>
<i>made it,</i>

720
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,269
<i>if the calming waves</i>
<i>she was looking at</i>

721
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,229
<i>weren't down current</i>
<i>from where Dr. Norman</i>

722
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:36,273
<i>was flushing away the remains</i>
<i>of his medical career.</i>

723
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:40,318
<i>And so DeBrie, who had been</i>
<i>in the safe harbor</i>

724
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,195
<i>of a drug-free zone,</i>
<i>found herself</i>

725
00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:45,156
<i>in the free drug zone</i>
<i>of an unsafe harbor.</i>

726
00:27:45,198 --> 00:27:48,993
<i>And that's when fate dealt</i>
<i>Tobias a new hand.</i>

727
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:50,788
Buster. Oh, thank God.
I need your help.

728
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:52,330
I've got a show to do
in ten minutes and I haven't got

729
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:55,083
a thing to wear...
this Thing suit.

730
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,835
<i>And that's how Buster</i>
<i>was drafted</i>

731
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,671
<i>to be in Tobias' musical.</i>

732
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:01,715
You're a monster,
you don't have to be good.

733
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:04,175
- What?<i>-It wasn't a great</i>
<i>choice of words.</i>

734
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:06,804
Butch it up
and sing your heart out.

735
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:08,597
<i>- Having recast the Thing,</i>
- DeBrie! DeBrie?

736
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:10,432
<i>Tobias returned to check</i>
<i>on his leading lady.</i>

737
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:12,350
: No, I'm looking
for a woman named DeBrie.

738
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:14,770
DeBrie!

739
00:28:14,812 --> 00:28:16,020
Fantastic Four!

740
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,481
Have you been drinking?

741
00:28:17,522 --> 00:28:21,192
No... it's pills.

742
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:23,487
How could you do this to me?

743
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:26,906
Or did I do this to you?

744
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:28,325
You to me.

745
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:31,077
I should have left you happy
and healthy and sober

746
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,872
in that rehab instead of trying
to rekindle the career

747
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,874
that brought you there
in the first place.

748
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,084
Is she drunk?

749
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,544
Uh, no.

750
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:42,380
- It's pills.
- Eh.

751
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:43,882
Can I talk to you for a second?

752
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,468
Yes. Uh, yes. Yes.

753
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,428
That is unacceptable.

754
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,598
Patients doing pills
on a literal pile of garbage,

755
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,475
that's not what we're about
at Austerity.

756
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:55,811
Where's Argyle?
It's his...

757
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:57,562
I can't let you blame Argyle
for this.

758
00:28:57,604 --> 00:28:59,815
It would destroy his confidence
and he's a little shaky

759
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:02,150
on the lyrics as it is.

760
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:03,819
He's not very good.

761
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:05,153
Fine, then I blame you.

762
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:06,864
Someone has to pay for this.

763
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:09,407
You're putting Austerity
in jeopardy.

764
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:10,659
You're out!

765
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:13,077
No, don't fire me. I'm on
a work-release program.

766
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,371
If you fire me, then I have
to go back to prison.

767
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:15,664
I can't go to prison.

768
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:18,124
And you're investing
in this show.

769
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,793
What if we get killer notices?

770
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:21,586
We'll talk about it on Monday.

771
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:23,171
Now, get rid of her

772
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:25,924
before someone sees her
with their camera phone.

773
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,926
You know they have those
nowadays.

774
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:34,224
So I've got until Monday
to fix this.

775
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:47,529
That red-haired lady can't throw
her wad at that guy.

776
00:29:47,571 --> 00:29:49,239
Oh, DeBrie.

777
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,824
<i>But on the other side</i>
<i>of the Dumpster,</i>

778
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:53,493
<i>things hadn't been</i>
<i>so laughable.</i>

779
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:55,620
Hi, honey.
Are you in the play?

780
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:57,121
- Yeah.
- What is the play, honey?

781
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,874
<i>Fantastic Three</i>

782
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,500
<i>and Lousy One,</i>

783
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:01,543
so<i>Four.</i>

784
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:02,711
- Four?
- Yeah.

785
00:30:02,753 --> 00:30:03,795
And who do you play?

786
00:30:03,837 --> 00:30:05,046
Sue Storm.

787
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:06,840
Okay, Sue Storm
and the Fantastic Four

788
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:09,718
are both trademarked by the
Marvel Entertainment LLC.

789
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,511
This is a cease and desist
letter.

790
00:30:11,553 --> 00:30:14,347
If you violate it, you will go
to prison for a long, long time.

791
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:17,100
And you certainly can't wear
a four in a logo.

792
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:18,518
<i>In fact, it wasn't even Marvel</i>

793
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,437
<i>that owned the four</i>
<i>in a circle.</i>

794
00:30:20,478 --> 00:30:22,689
<i>It was trademarked</i>
<i>by the Four Feinbergs.</i>

795
00:30:22,731 --> 00:30:25,066
Hey, can anyone just throw
one of these little Mexico

796
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:27,151
- guitars off the dock?
- I don't want to go to prison.

797
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,362
I'm going to do it.

798
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:34,785
Well, Lucille 2 has threatened
me with prison,

799
00:30:34,826 --> 00:30:37,245
but it's going to take more than
one prison threat...

800
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:39,748
Oh, you got one, too.

801
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,374
Well, universe,
you seem to be putting up

802
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:43,293
all sorts of walls between me
and my dreams.

803
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:44,836
Today.

804
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:47,672
Well, if we have any chance
of beating this,

805
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:49,967
it's by putting on
the best show possible.

806
00:30:50,008 --> 00:30:52,176
A real wowzer.

807
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,471
I just need to find a Sue Storm.

808
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:57,682
I guess I'll need this.

809
00:30:57,724 --> 00:31:00,435
Before I go any further
with this,

810
00:31:00,477 --> 00:31:02,854
there's no way a hot cup
of coffee and a

811
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:05,189
glass of "the show must
go on" spirit

812
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,901
will encourage you in any way,
will it?

813
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:09,903
Let me die.

814
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:16,200
No, you're not in any shape
to go out and perform tonight.

815
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:19,412
<i>Tobias knew he couldn't leave</i>
<i>DeBrie in the trash</i>

816
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:21,122
<i>in a highly trafficked area,</i>

817
00:31:21,164 --> 00:31:23,792
<i>but also knew he had a show</i>
<i>to put on.</i>

818
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:27,504
<i>And so he went off to search</i>
<i>for any Sue Storm in the port.</i>

819
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:31,049
<i>And when the search proved</i>
<i>unsuccessful,</i>

820
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,135
<i>he ended up finding one</i>
<i>inside himself.</i>

821
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:37,138
Time to channel
my inner Storm.

822
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,599
<i>And because he didn't have</i>
<i>the costume,</i>

823
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:41,559
<i>he created one</i>
<i>out of some makeup</i>

824
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:44,312
<i>he'd always had</i>
<i>in case he got a call.</i>

825
00:31:44,354 --> 00:31:47,148
<i>And perhaps it was his muscle</i>
<i>memory that led to this.</i>

826
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,528
Tobias, what are you doing?

827
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:53,947
Oh. Pardon the mess.

828
00:31:53,989 --> 00:31:57,742
I just blue myself for the first
time in five years.

829
00:31:57,784 --> 00:32:00,495
: Excuse me.
Make way for Sue Storm.

830
00:32:00,537 --> 00:32:03,247
<i>And now the almost invisible</i>
<i>Invisible Girl,</i>

831
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:06,376
<i>got on the boat to head</i>
<i>to the floating stage.</i>

832
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,837
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>and not for the first time,</i>

833
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:11,965
<i>Tobias got on the wrong boat.</i>

834
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:15,010
<i>Except this one</i>
<i>was piloted by a man</i>

835
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:18,013
<i>who not only expected a woman</i>
<i>in disguise,</i>

836
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:21,516
<i>but also had a real bad case</i>
<i>of face blindness.</i>

837
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:24,769
<i>And as it turned out,</i>
<i>the woman he was expecting</i>

838
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:26,646
<i>had just given a rousing speech</i>

839
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:30,108
<i>and joined the Love campaign</i>
<i>as they took the message</i>

840
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:34,237
<i>that Marky had vowed</i>
<i>to torpedo to the sea.</i>

841
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:36,865
I think this is going
to make quite a splash.

842
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:41,202
