2
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:11,221
It was May...

3
00:00:12,436 --> 00:00:13,812
It was May 4,

4
00:00:13,854 --> 00:00:16,566
and in the bayside town
of Newport Beach,

5
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:18,027
the annual celebration

6
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:20,947
known as Cinco de Cuatro
was underway.

7
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:25,387
The holiday started as
a particularly vicious response

8
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:28,557
by a young Lucille Bluth
to the Mexican holiday...

9
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,894
- This still isn't made?
- ...of Cinco de Mayo.

10
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:34,107
- No, no, it's not.
- Rosa, why is this still a mess?!

11
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:36,402
She said it's, uh,
it's Cinco de Mayo.

12
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:37,643
She's taking, uh, the day off.

13
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:39,413
- She said that?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:40,915
- She called it Cinco de Mayo?
- She did, yeah.

15
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:43,627
Oh, why can't they
just call it May 5?

16
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,046
This is what
I was talking about.

17
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,631
It's all part
of the Mexican war on May 5.

18
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,353
- War on May 5, I know, yeah. It is.
- It is.

19
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,470
But even a skeptical George Sr.

20
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:52,932
soon found himself feeling
similarly embattled.

21
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:54,600
Where the  are my socks?!

22
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:56,686
Now it's not so funny, is it?

23
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:58,689
No, not funny.

24
00:00:58,731 --> 00:01:00,608
We should start our own holiday.

25
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,863
You see, the Hispanics
of Newport liked Cinco a lot,

26
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:07,409
but high up on Coast Highway,
Lucille Bluth did not.

27
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:10,372
Doesn't look like they'll be
done any time soon.

28
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:13,000
And then Lucille had
a horrible thought,

29
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:16,505
a thought that was thoughtless
and better to not.

30
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:18,925
"What if," she thought
with a sneering grin...

31
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:23,890
Next year what if the party
didn't even begin?

32
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:26,811
And so began
a holiday on the eve

33
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,730
- of the fifth of May...
- ♪ The cockroach... ♪

34
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:31,901
...originally intended
to deplete the party supplies

35
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:34,488
the Cinco de Mayo celebrants
were relying upon.

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,156
Fill the bay with chorizo.

37
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:38,660
- Chorizo dump!
- Over 30 years, however, it grew

38
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:41,163
and was soon embraced
by the Hispanic community...

39
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:42,541
You buy it, you break it!

40
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,584
...for financial reasons...

41
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,379
and as the celebrations peaked

42
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,967
with a boat parade
called the Festival of Lights--

43
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,720
another phrase
they wanted back--

44
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:55,224
one man was about
to hit his lowest point.

45
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,857
♪ On the sixth of May... ♪

46
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,111
Happy Cuatro, happy Cuatro!

47
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:05,488
Let's throw
some more taco shells.

48
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,531
Olé!

49
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:07,909
Sally, can I...?

50
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,704
I need to speak
to Lucille 2, please.

51
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:13,708
It's okay, Sally,
I'll talk to Michael.

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,126
This is Lucille 2,

53
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:18,173
a longtime patron
of the Bluth family.

54
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:20,091
I'll be downstairs
kicking myself

55
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:22,428
for not marrying you
so many years ago.

56
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,182
Michael, do you have
something for me?

57
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,643
Does bad news count?

58
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:28,019
There's that Bluth wit.

59
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:29,939
Oh, I love your family.

60
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,523
She certainly
had demonstrated that

61
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:33,652
with many of the men
in the family...

62
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:35,738
Oh, stop it,
you're making me dizzy.

63
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,200
...even having fallen
for a few,

64
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,454
although some of that was
the vertigo she suffered from.

65
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,790
But not all of it.

66
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:45,710
- Dad?
- No, no.

67
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:48,798
But seriously, she had gotten
intimate with Buster and Gob.

68
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:49,924
I need that money I lent you.

69
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:52,010
I am in the middle of a campaign

70
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,888
and I am desperate
for the ad money.

71
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,973
You're going to get it.

72
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:56,850
I just need an extension.

73
00:02:56,892 --> 00:02:57,935
Why don't you go to your family?

74
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,813
I don't need them.

75
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:01,189
What I need is you.

76
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:03,651
What are you suggesting?

77
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:14,624
No.

78
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,878
Okay, that was nasty.

79
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,464
Aren't you sweet?

80
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:20,841
- Thank you.
- Okay.

81
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,972
Don't tilt your head, okay?

82
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:27,559
And that's
when Michael debased himself.

83
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,727
What are you doing?

84
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:31,147
I'm gonna have sex
with you for money.

85
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:37,071
Later that night,

86
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:40,117
after Michael did
something unthinkable,

87
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,787
he was looking
for a place to hide

88
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,791
and he returned
to a long neglected model home

89
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,586
he believed to be empty.

90
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,174
Thanks for coming

91
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:53,302
so late, Maria, I know
that you won't be cleaning up

92
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:55,722
tomorrow, and we did make
quite a mess of that bedroom.

93
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,558
Michael.

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,728
This is Michael's brother Gob.

95
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,521
Neither had expected
to see each other

96
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:03,649
after some recent
unpleasantness.

97
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:05,194
I didn't expect
to be seeing you again

98
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,571
after all the unpleasantness.

99
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:09,282
I-I've, I've,
I've been out of control.

100
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:10,910
Sorry.

101
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,328
In fact, I-I just did something
that I-I don't,

102
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,331
I don't, I don't know
why I did it.

103
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:15,707
Do you want to talk about it?

104
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:17,877
No, I do not,
I've said too much already.

105
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,046
You cannot help me.

106
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:20,047
Well, I wasn't hoping to help.

107
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,298
I was hoping to rub it in

108
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,176
because of all
the unpleasantness.

109
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:25,679
- Got it. - Oh, damn it, I meant
to throw these in the chipper.

110
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,266
God, I'm just not
into Cuatro this year.

111
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,144
I was the one that was wrong,
not you,

112
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,230
and besides, you could not
make me feel worse right now.

113
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,607
Well, I'd be willing

114
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,942
to let you have
your apology back

115
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,361
if you give me
the chance to try.

116
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,842
I mean, I'm gonna need
some specifics

117
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,281
about the thing
that you're ashamed of.

118
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:41,701
Otherwise I'll just be
taking general potshots.

119
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:47,626
Bad example: if you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

120
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:49,879
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

121
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:52,383
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

122
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:53,759
- It's not that.
- I said "Bad example."

123
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,178
I went to go see Lucille 2

124
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,641
and I just, I just--
I lost control.

125
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,435
I did something
that I wish I could forget.

126
00:05:00,477 --> 00:05:02,271
You have got no idea how I feel.

127
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:03,982
Well, if you're talking about
doing something embarrassing

128
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,609
with a woman, then no, I don't.

129
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,111
But he should have.

130
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,989
It's almost
as if he found a way

131
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,243
to simulate amnesia.

132
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:14,329
Hey, I'm down
to my last Forget-Me-Now.

133
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:16,708
In fact,
that is what he had done.

134
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,378
Hey, remember me?

135
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,130
Gob had always taken a pill

136
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:23,633
he called a Forget-Me-Now
for that...

137
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:25,303
- No más.
- ¿No más?

138
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:26,762
...but was commonly known
as a roofie.

139
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:27,764
There's only one left.

140
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:29,266
How could that possibly be?

141
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:30,310
Unless... John Beard Jr.

142
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,020
I don't need to get into it.

143
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:33,814
I came here because I thought
the house was empty,

144
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:35,691
but I can go
somewhere else, okay?

145
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,320
- Hey, listen, Michael, if you
want, we can split this. - No,

146
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,239
I feel like this is something
that I shouldn't forget,

147
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,117
okay, and believe me,
this is the last time

148
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,245
I ever judge you for anything

149
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:45,246
that you ever do.

150
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:47,082
Oh,.

151
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,461
Is that who you were with?

152
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:51,338
I knew it, I always knew it.

153
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:52,965
- Take this, Michael, forget, forget.
- No, no, no, no, no.

154
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,300
Put the mask back on.
Forget this, Michael.

155
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:56,470
- Forget, forget, Michael.
- Gob.

156
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:57,931
Forget, now is the time
to forget.

157
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,182
Now you're forgetting.

158
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,894
- Now you're forgetting.
- God.

159
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:03,438
♪ It's so easy to forget... ♪

160
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:07,818
♪ It's so easy to forget. ♪

161
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,447
Stupid, forgetful Michael.

162
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:12,408
Now, the story of a family

163
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,163
whose future was abruptly
canceled and the one son

164
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:18,250
who had no choice
but to keep himself together.

165
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:25,385
It's Michael's...

166
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:31,017
Six months
before the Forget-Me-Now,

167
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,061
Michael had made good
on a long-standing threat

168
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:34,855
to go to Phoenix,

169
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:38,987
and even though the Phoenix
he went to was online,

170
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:41,824
he still enjoyed
the full college experience

171
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:44,785
by living in a dorm room
while doing so.

172
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:47,290
George Michael, what is
my log-on password again?

173
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:49,375
Unfortunately
it was his son's dorm room

174
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,169
at the University of California
at Irvine.

175
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:55,843
Dad, come on, what have we said
is the most important thing?

176
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:57,344
I have tried "family."

177
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:58,930
- It does not work for me.
- No, privacy.

178
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:01,183
This is Michael's son

179
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:03,895
George Michael-- a nice kid.

180
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,357
Uh, no one should have
your password but you.

181
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,900
I shouldn't even know it.

182
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:09,820
- You've made that point.
- Have I?

183
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,948
My point is, we have
no secrets from each other.

184
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,451
We know everything there is
to know about each other.

185
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:15,453
We're like twins.

186
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:17,456
I don't see us as twins.

187
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:20,335
Yeah? You name me one way
in which we're different.

188
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:22,253
I think you tend to be better

189
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:25,549
at feeling
like you belong places.

190
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:27,594
Do I?

191
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,101
I want you to start feeling
like you belong places.

192
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:34,228
Look at that guy.

193
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,439
He thinks he's a musician.

194
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,122
You know, like,
you've got to start having

195
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,403
a little bit better sense
of humor about yourself.

196
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:41,404
Look at me.

197
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:42,615
People say I don't age.

198
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:44,200
You know, like,
"Hey, look at that guy.

199
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:45,994
He's got the hair
of a teenager."

200
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:48,373
And I say, "Take your best shot"

201
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:50,249
because I think
that that's a good thing

202
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:51,960
because I'm self-effacing.

203
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,213
Hmm?

204
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:54,631
I want you to be able
to do that.

205
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:56,467
Well, it's hard
to be self-effacing

206
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,180
when you're a perfect specimen
of rugged manlessness.

207
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,228
Well, you can't hear this, but,

208
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:05,813
but we're gonna work on it.

209
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:07,482
That's why I'm living
in your dorm.

210
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:08,924
Well, I thought
you were living here

211
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:10,528
because you had
nowhere else to go.

212
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,989
Yeah, and because of the fact
you had this big double room

213
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:14,241
all to yourself
because of your name.

214
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:16,077
The name George Michael

215
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:18,872
did create confusion
in the campus housing office.

216
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,374
This guy's name is actually
George Michael.

217
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,543
No, it's two different guys.

218
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,338
They're twins, ugly.

219
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,299
We should sign them up
for Twin Club.

220
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:29,387
And let's give them
the big handicap room.

221
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:31,055
Yeah, you see,
that's the other thing, is that

222
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:33,183
I kind of wanted to use
this time to almost kind of,

223
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:35,895
you know, wean off
of the name George Michael.

224
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:38,524
What?

225
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:41,278
I don't know, you know,
you get older, you do

226
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:43,614
a something search
of your own name...

227
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,534
In George Michael's
case, you find this.

228
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:48,580
It was in this men's room in--
get this-- Beverly Hills

229
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:51,000
that singer George Michael
was arrested

230
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:54,129
for soliciting sex
from an undercover cop.

231
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:57,133
Well, it was your mother's idea
to call you George Michael,

232
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:58,301
you know, and I think
it was just

233
00:08:58,342 --> 00:08:59,970
so that we didn't confuse you

234
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:02,223
with your Uncle George or
your Grandfather George.

235
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:04,894
- Right.
- I got it, let's call you Boy George.

236
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:05,895
Singer Boy George

237
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:06,896
in the news again today,

238
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:07,981
this time for sexual assault

239
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:09,984
in a men's public bathroom.

240
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,235
Beatrix Hebberly-Sneed,
Wee BBC 2.

241
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:13,071
You know, I think

242
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:15,240
I'll, I'll just--
I'll stick with George Michael.

243
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:17,076
I mean, at least
it was consensual.

244
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:19,246
But I guess the, uh,
the bigger point

245
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:21,458
I'm making is just that,
uh, it's hard to have

246
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,293
any privacy
now that they've stuck me

247
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:25,546
- with an actual roommate.
- Well, you know, listen,

248
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:27,966
I'm all for kicking P-Hound out,
you know that.

249
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,178
Well, you know, I didn't
really mean privacy from him.

250
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,223
I know, I know, I know.

251
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,020
You want your space from me?

252
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:38,523
Um, look,

253
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:42,319
listen, hey, hey,
look, look, listen.

254
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,447
Listen, look it.

255
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:47,284
Are you listening?
You want your space.

256
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:48,578
I get it.

257
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,041
I did not mean
to crowd you, pal.

258
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,087
Listen, I thought that this was,
that this was fun, and,

259
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,215
- and it is okay if you didn't
see it that way. - Oh, Dad.

260
00:09:57,257 --> 00:09:59,259
Buddy, it's not like
I don't have someplace to go.

261
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,428
You know, I'll just go
right back to the model home.

262
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,223
They don't have Internet there,
so I'll just put

263
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:05,101
the law school on, on, on pause.

264
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:06,727
It's not like the first time
that I've done that.

265
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,772
You know, last time I did that,
you were born. You know what?

266
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:10,441
Screw it, maybe I'll just go
to the real Phoenix

267
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,068
and finish school.

268
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,362
They got one in Costa Mesa.

269
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,155
Plus they want me
for an article.

270
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,533
Media wants to talk
to Daddy about the real

271
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,118
estate business,
and once they do that,

272
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,829
I'm gonna be right back on top.

273
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,330
You know what?
This is your school rally shirt.

274
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,208
You know, same size--medium.

275
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,169
Do you know where mine is? We
wear the same size like twi...

276
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,548
We're just like twin--
couple of identical...

277
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,258
Dad, Dad, no, I...

278
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,763
Look, I was not talking
about privacy from you per se.

279
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:37,269
I was talking about my software.

280
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,730
What's that?

281
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,358
It's privacy software.

282
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,776
That's why the word came up.

283
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:44,529
It's not why the word came up.

284
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:46,490
But George Michael
was writing code

285
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:48,326
for a block software

286
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,829
with his roommate
that was proving challenging.

287
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:52,290
...you're leaving a hole

288
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:53,875
just right in the middle
of the block.

289
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,211
Both because of online threats
to his privacy...

290
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:58,174
Otherwise, people will be
able to hack in through

291
00:10:58,214 --> 00:11:00,301
a mobile platform portal, and
it won't be a block anything 3G.

292
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,511
...and some in-room threats
to his privacy, as well.

293
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:04,473
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

294
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:05,808
No, we're just right
in the middle of this software.

295
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,602
Great, good.
Give me the lappy.

296
00:11:07,644 --> 00:11:09,438
I'll hit save for you.
I got to Skype with my advisor

297
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,316
in Phoenix, and if I don't
get on right now,

298
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:15,655
he's gonna have to Skype me
from a T.G.I. Friday's.

299
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:17,658
- Oh.
- Yeah.

300
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,202
Whew.

301
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,536
'Cause that hurt for a second.

302
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,206
I was like, he wants me to go.

303
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:24,249
- No, no, no, no, no.
- But no. Yeah? No.

304
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,418
- Software.
- No.

305
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,628
I mean, yeah, I may need

306
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,756
some privacy, you know,
to work on it,

307
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:33,388
and that might mean...
you going.

308
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,851
Oh, you mean here.

309
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:39,521
Yeah, clearing out.

310
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,232
An hour, here, there. Yes?

311
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:42,566
Got it. Not a problem.
You give me a little

312
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:44,611
fair warning,
I clear right out of here.

313
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:46,405
Let's schedule it now.
We can do it.

314
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:47,907
I need help with
the calendar though.

315
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:50,536
It's, like, stuck on 2003.

316
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,538
- Help me just break into...
- You just hit "today."

317
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,249
- The "today" button.
- Sorry. It's stuck in 2003,

318
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,418
so I don't have "today."

319
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:56,460
I need to jump forward...

320
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:57,921
No, I know, there's a button

321
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,631
- that says "today."
- Yeah, this has no button.

322
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:00,800
Anyway, you know,
I'm just gonna run downstairs

323
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:01,718
and, uh, grab a bite.

324
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,887
Wait, I want to go.

325
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:06,725
Let me go. I'll go. I'm hungry.

326
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,728
Come on.

327
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:12,649
Michael Bluth
was fitting right in

328
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,318
with his son's
college experience.

329
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,945
Be good for you, huh?

330
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,031
Gettable, right?

331
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:19,701
Hey, tell me about
the software thing.

332
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:21,286
This is the Faceblock thing
you were working on?

333
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:22,288
Is it like Facebook?

334
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,039
Uh, well, no.

335
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:25,667
It's kind of the opposite
of Facebook, you know.

336
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,669
Facebook connects you
with everyone,

337
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:29,839
this blocks you from everyone.

338
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:32,217
Oh, okay. Kind of like
the antisocial network, right?

339
00:12:32,258 --> 00:12:33,887
- That's very good.
- You can use it.

340
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:35,430
I don't understand
the Internet stuff.

341
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:37,850
You give me all the parts
and you tell me to build

342
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,103
a television set, I can
bang that out, but I, you know,

343
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:42,186
I can't get the right day
to display on my calendar.

344
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,150
- Just press "today."
- Yeah, just tried that.

345
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:45,944
Doesn't work on mine, pal.

346
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,864
This is very, very, very
exciting, you know,

347
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:50,951
because once they come out
with that article on me

348
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:52,871
in that in-flight magazine,

349
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:55,081
now, the family's gonna be
right back on top.

350
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:57,292
- The guy's doing a whole spread on me.
- In-flight magazine?

351
00:12:57,335 --> 00:12:58,879
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's called Altitude.

352
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:00,088
It's for OutWest Airlines.

353
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,257
Next to SkyMall, it's, like,

354
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:02,926
the number two most read
in all of coach.

355
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,386
Well, three with
the safety card,

356
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:07,098
but get a lot of attention
for Sudden Valley.

357
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,143
And then with your Internet
company, it's gonna be like--

358
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:11,145
we're gonna have two businesses,
you know?

359
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:12,856
And yours sounds like
such a natural.

360
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:14,984
I mean, no one likes
to share their identity.

361
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,194
- Right?
- Well...

362
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:17,320
Okay, give me
your meal plan card.

363
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,948
I'm gonna run in there,

364
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:20,242
I'm gonna grab a tray,
you run around back,

365
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:21,243
make sure you get there in time,

366
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:22,369
before my hand stamp dries.

367
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,371
Okay?

368
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:25,330
Here we go.

369
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,376
Michael had a right
to be excited.

370
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,796
It had been many years
since the Bluth family

371
00:13:29,838 --> 00:13:31,757
had had any business success.

372
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,012
Not since Michael's mother
Lucille had sold off a quarter

373
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:39,226
of the company just before the
onset of the great dark period.

374
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,478
But after examining
the company's prospects...

375
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,356
Are those police boats?

376
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,110
Lucille 2.

377
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:47,779
...Stan Sitwell
quickly divested himself.

378
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:50,408
How'd you like to be bumped up
to Lucille 1?

379
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:52,367
So the Bluth family
had a new stakeholder,

380
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,205
while the old one,
who knew she'd be implicated

381
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:57,000
in some of
the family's misdeeds...

382
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,961
You boys know
how to shovel coal?

383
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:01,840
...headed out on whatever the
opposite of a maiden voyage is.

384
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:05,303
Michael, however, made a pledge

385
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,015
not to get pulled
into the drama

386
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,144
and to let the family
keep themselves all together,

387
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,897
- for a while.
- ...for a while.

388
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:14,900
And he set off to sea, even as

389
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,277
his mother mysteriously
turned back.

390
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:20,156
Why the alleged ship-jacker
changed direction

391
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:21,783
is still unexplained.

392
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,203
But what is known
is that many of the charges

393
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:26,832
against this seaward matriarch
will fall under

394
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:30,462
the dominion of the little
understood maritime law.

395
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,840
And soon,
the hearing drew near...

396
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:34,301
Well, I missed the hearing.

397
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:36,011
...and then passed.

398
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,889
Oh, it just snuck up on me,
and then they called,

399
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,600
and they wanted me there
at eight bells.

400
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:42,144
You know, I thought
that was their 5:00 p.m.

401
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,272
By the time I got back,
the courtroom was

402
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:46,233
reverted back
to the crab restaurant.

403
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:47,903
"Eight bells" refers
to a watch length.

404
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:49,237
It's maritime law.

405
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,324
Yes, Michael returned
after all.

406
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,284
You know, one bell is struck
after 30 minutes, two bells...

407
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:54,620
It seems Michael
had been interested

408
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:57,374
in maritime law
since playing a lawyer

409
00:14:57,415 --> 00:14:59,293
in an original school play

410
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:01,922
titled The Trial
of Captain Hook.

411
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:03,507
♪ You're a crook,
Captain Hook... ♪

412
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:05,343
Prior to this,
his only dream had been

413
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:06,844
to possess the power of flight.

414
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:09,306
But that one turned out to be

415
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:10,850
not as much fun as he thought.

416
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:13,104
Watch out for the seal!

417
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,941
Loose seal! Loose seal!

418
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,901
I'm watching!

419
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:22,324
You're out of the play!

420
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:24,285
That's why, at sea, a watch with
no incidents is described as

421
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:25,620
"eight bells and all is well."

422
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:28,124
Wow, maybe you should be
the maritime lawyer.

423
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:29,209
This is what I've been saying.

424
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:30,544
Because I did go to law school

425
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,005
with an emphasis
on maritime law.

426
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:34,007
Oh, your one year of law school

427
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:35,926
is going to beat Barry's three?

428
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,512
It's ridiculous.

429
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:38,596
We'll hire the best.

430
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:39,597
And who's gonna pay

431
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,100
for the best, Mom?

432
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:42,393
We have money from
selling some shares.

433
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:44,354
Plus, we got
that stimulus package.

434
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:45,606
What are you talking about?

435
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:47,275
That money is spent.

436
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:50,404
I just bought 4,000 acres
of California desert.

437
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:51,406
Time-out.

438
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,949
Hang on.

439
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,618
- What's this?
- Yeah.

440
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,664
I'm gonna be moving there
for a little while.

441
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,418
Old big bear's not gonna be
around much anymore.

442
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,421
- I don't care about that.
- He's in denial.

443
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,922
- We're getting divorced!
- Your mother and I

444
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:04,924
are getting a divorce.

445
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:10,265
I want to know...

446
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:18,025
I want to know about
the stimulus package.

447
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,945
You couldn't use any of that
money to finish Sudden Valley?

448
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,615
You don't consider
that finished?

449
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,577
So the family got
a little stimmy.

450
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,413
Don't make a federal case
out of it.

451
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:30,000
That is exactly what they're
going to make out of it.

452
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,585
And when you say "family,"
you mean our family?

453
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:32,962
They've already got
their hooks in it?

454
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:34,297
Buster, no offense.

455
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:35,299
None taken.

456
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:36,759
Oh, I keep losing my jewels.

457
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:39,179
Michael, you never
accept help from anyone.

458
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:41,265
That's why we didn't cut you in.

459
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:42,683
We didn't want to demean you.

460
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:45,104
It's like tipping
an African-American.

461
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:47,524
You wouldn't tip
an African-American, would you?

462
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:49,527
Of course I would.

463
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:51,696
On a train?

464
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:53,156
What...

465
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:55,118
Did you know about all this?

466
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,454
No, I've been tipping them.

467
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:58,789
Even a waiter?

468
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,708
Okay, the treadmill's
up and running.

469
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,003
We got the door on,
and we were able

470
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:05,215
to match the faux on the paint.

471
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:11,765
Thank you so much
for your hard work.

472
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,149
So long.

473
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:22,155
Michael, we can't
give you that money.

474
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:23,656
We got to keep you clean.

475
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:25,409
You're the key witness
in your mother's trial.

476
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,535
Let me get this straight.

477
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:28,413
I still have to do all the work

478
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:31,250
as the president of the company,
but I can't use any of the money

479
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:33,503
for the company, and you won't
let me help with your case,

480
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,673
but you'd still like for me
to testify at your trial.

481
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:37,258
Is that right?

482
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,803
I just want you to say
I was a loving mother.

483
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:41,181
And now perjury.

484
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:42,515
Hey, it wasn't easy to get

485
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:44,852
Lucille 2 to keep you on
as president.

486
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:47,439
- I'll be sure to thank her.
- Don't thank her.

487
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,609
She doesn't have
enough shares to stop us.

488
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,569
Hmm.

489
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:53,614
And that's how Michael
found a way

490
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,616
to finish
Sudden Valley himself.

491
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

492
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:01,333
He simply traded his shares of
the Bluth company to Lucille 2.

493
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,044
I hold on to Sudden Valley;
it's like a pet project...

494
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:04,462
- Getting himself out,
- Thank you so much.

495
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:06,506
and giving the balance of power

496
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:09,636
to a woman who had
no power of balance.

497
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:11,096
Oh.

498
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:16,144
And for the first time,
he didn't feel he needed

499
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:19,608
to tell his family
he was done with them.

500
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,151
But he did anyway.

501
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:23,488
You know what,
I am done with this family.

502
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:25,115
I hope you've saved some money,

503
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:27,201
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

504
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:28,453
What's this?

505
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:31,207
And with his newfound wealth,

506
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,543
Michael was not only able
to send his son off

507
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:35,712
- Get out of here!
- to a bright future

508
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:38,341
in college,
with the family car...

509
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:41,846
...he was also able to finish

510
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:45,476
the long-delayed housing
development Sudden Valley,

511
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:50,566
but this time,
under his own company name.

512
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:52,193
Maybe I can give you a tip.

513
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:53,821
Might want to put a road
up to this place.

514
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:55,490
Well, we paved the neighborhood.

515
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,492
Just waiting for the city
to build a road to it.

516
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,704
And although his mother's
day in court was something

517
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:03,876
both he and his college-bound
son would miss,

518
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:06,422
Michael truly felt
that nothing could go wrong.

519
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:08,800
And then something did.

520
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:12,805
Not that.
That happens all the time.

521
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,391
This.

522
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,852
The collapse of the California
housing market

523
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:20,316
is taking a personal toll with
cutbacks here at the station.

524
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:22,694
And since the main Internet
and information cable

525
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:26,407
had been severed when the
community pool was installed,

526
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:29,745
Michael suddenly found himself
living in a ghost town

527
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:31,789
he himself built.

528
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,217
Well, that's not a great sign.

529
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,403
This is why you don't
confide in a competitor.

530
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:58,826
Michael was desperate to cover

531
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:00,578
his copious building costs...

532
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,789
Just till I get on my feet.

533
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,499
...so he returned to a woman

534
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,835
he could count on
to put off his downfall.

535
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:07,671
- I got you!
- Just as he could count on

536
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:09,716
her putting him off
and falling down.

537
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:11,134
You did. Bye-bye.

538
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,512
Oop.

539
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:14,765
That's a hot mess.

540
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:16,517
But weeks
stretched into months,

541
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,019
and the situation got bleaker.

542
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:23,902
And it was either this
that made him lose hope...

543
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,116
Love each other.

544
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:29,952
Pete! Pete!

545
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:32,831
...or possibly it was
the death of that mailman...

546
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:33,873
Wait here.

547
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:35,167
Hang on, Pete!

548
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,168
...but Michael finally gave up.

549
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,587
I got one bar!

550
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:39,256
And having alienated

551
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:40,883
everyone else in the family,

552
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:43,053
turned to the one person
he had left.

553
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:46,724
I thought we'd have Thanksgiving
here for your senior year.

554
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:49,270
I don't have a kitchen.

555
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:51,314
Oh, these are my clothes.

556
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:54,944
Pete died.

557
00:20:54,986 --> 00:20:56,864
God.

558
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:00,910
And so Michael moved into
his son's college dorm room.

559
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:04,207
You are kidding me.

560
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:05,750
They're gonna be
in seat backs today?

561
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:06,793
That is great news.

562
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:08,671
Which, in the new economy,

563
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:10,716
wasn't as unusual a phenomenon
as you might think.

564
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,677
Don't go through my stuff,
Granddad.

565
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,139
Hey, who do you think
paid for your stuff?

566
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:17,141
Excuse me. Sorry. Do you know
where George Michael is?

567
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:18,768
Um, he's in the computer lab.

568
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,270
Great.

569
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,315
- There's a computer lab?
- There's a computer lab?

570
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:23,316
Huh.

571
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:25,068
I'm putting up a wall.

572
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,655
We need to rework
our whole system here.

573
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:29,575
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

574
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:30,868
Hey. How'd you find me?

575
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,829
Uh, Trang's grandfather.

576
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:35,875
Boy, shoot me if I'm 86, living
in my grandson's dorm, huh?

577
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,920
Pal, good news.

578
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:39,755
The article that they did on me
in Altitude magazine

579
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:40,757
comes out today.

580
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:42,635
You're in Attitude?

581
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,261
That magazine is gay.

582
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,848
Oh, he wasn't being flip
with the word "gay."

583
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,061
Attitude is a British magazine
for homosexuals.

584
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,647
Altitude.

585
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,273
It is OutWest Airlines'
in-flight magazine.

586
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:54,317
Can I see it?

587
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,069
Probably doesn't have it.

588
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,113
Try finding a flight at this
time of the year.

589
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:00,867
You ever even been on a plane,
you piece of?

590
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:04,581
So can I see it?

591
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,627
It-it is not in the terrestrial
newsstands just yet.

592
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:09,337
Guess what though. You,
my friend, are in the article.

593
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:11,257
- I'm in it?
- You're in it, you're in it.

594
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,301
I mentioned you; I mentioned
that I'm living in your dorm.

595
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:15,763
I thought that it might help
with your popularity problem.

596
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:18,140
Well, I'm gonna get going

597
00:22:18,182 --> 00:22:20,018
- while the room is empty, so...
- Okay. Great.

598
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,396
See you later.

599
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:23,077
Boy, that's got to
drive you crazy, right?

600
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:24,275
The whole reason you had to come

601
00:22:24,316 --> 00:22:26,067
to the computer lab
was for privacy.

602
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,405
It's no wonder you can't
get a real girl up there.

603
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,950
Michael was referring
to something he'd walked in on

604
00:22:30,992 --> 00:22:32,411
a few days earlier.

605
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,912
There's a girl in there.

606
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:36,249
There is?

607
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,294
Where the hell is
George Michael?

608
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:40,086
- Excuse me. Hello. Oh.
- Dad.

609
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:41,131
- Hi.
- Yeah.

610
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:42,299
There's nobody in here.

611
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,135
Buddy, bad news.

612
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:46,013
P-Hound is yanking
our chain again.

613
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:47,723
- Uncle Michael.
- Oh, my God.

614
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:48,850
- Hi.
- Hello there.

615
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:51,854
There is a kind of girl here.

616
00:22:51,895 --> 00:22:53,439
Didn't say it was your cousin.

617
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,816
Well, he doesn't know.

618
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,108
Now, that's smart.

619
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:58,779
Let him think
there's a girl in here.

620
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:00,741
Actually, we've been talking
about how crowded that room is,

621
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:04,287
and P-Hound was suggesting that
maybe we, maybe we do a vote

622
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,122
to see who stays
in the dorm room.

623
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,959
He suggested that?
Are you serious?

624
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:10,880
Well, the thing is that the room
is only sanctioned for two.

625
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,089
Right, and we have a vote.

626
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,342
He's gone in two seconds.

627
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:15,093
Ah.

628
00:23:15,134 --> 00:23:16,471
Two against one, right?

629
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,389
- Well, actually...
- We got to do it.

630
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,018
The thing is that it kind of
puts me in an awkward position.

631
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,729
- Hi.
- Hey.

632
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:24,482
Because since there's only
three people voting,

633
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:27,110
everyone's gonna know
who voted against who.

634
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:28,987
Well, what about if your
"girlfriend" wants to move in.

635
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:30,114
That way, she gets a vote.

636
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,785
I'm just here for tutoring.

637
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:34,244
She's not my girlfriend,
she's my cousin.

638
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:35,330
I'm not attracted to him.

639
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,998
Well, why's that even an issue?

640
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,335
P-Hound doesn't know
any of that stuff. Okay?

641
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,130
He'll just think that her vote's
the vote that got him out.

642
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,009
Well, wouldn't my girlfriend
want to get rid of my father?

643
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:46,428
- I'm not your girlfriend.
- Not your girlfriend.

644
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,389
No, but he doesn't know that.

645
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,058
No, well, someone's got to vote
for me, that's right.

646
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,393
Otherwise, it's suspicious.

647
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:53,145
We don't want
a palace coup, right?

648
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:54,773
- Well, I'll vote you out.
- Yeah, I will.

649
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:56,233
- Happy to do it.
- I wouldn't make you do that.

650
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:57,777
You know, then I fall down
a flight of stairs,

651
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:58,861
I crack my head open,
you feel bad

652
00:23:58,903 --> 00:23:59,946
about yourself your whole life.

653
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,323
And perhaps it was the chair

654
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:03,159
that fooled Michael
into thinking

655
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,161
his next idea was a good one.

656
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:08,082
What if I vote myself out?

657
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:09,835
You'd do that?

658
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:11,045
How would that help?

659
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,880
It's simple algebra.

660
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:15,342
You two vote against P-Hound,
nobody knows who did what,

661
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:17,470
because there's a vote
against me in there,

662
00:24:17,512 --> 00:24:19,557
and it's adios, brothiero.

663
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:21,308
It cannot fail.

664
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,562
Michael was pleased
with his plan.

665
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:25,273
Won't that make it a tie?

666
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:26,274
Briefly.

667
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:27,818
Hmm?

668
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,445
I mean, if the two of us
vote against P-Hound,

669
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:31,406
and you and P-Hound
vote against you,

670
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,367
then it's two against two,
right?

671
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,163
Wow, you think, you think
that'd he'd vote against me?

672
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:37,539
I mean...

673
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:39,375
Um...

674
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,835
All right, new plan.

675
00:24:40,877 --> 00:24:42,504
The details of the plan

676
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:44,340
continued to develop
through lunch.

677
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,842
So we got two scenarios.

678
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,887
It's either two votes
against P-Hound,

679
00:24:47,928 --> 00:24:49,598
one vote against Maeby,
one against me,

680
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:53,060
with that vote being my own;
or if it's two votes against me,

681
00:24:53,102 --> 00:24:54,645
then clearly
P-Hound is being nasty,

682
00:24:54,687 --> 00:24:56,857
that triggers a recount,
and then it's a P-Hound blitz.

683
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,359
We all vote against P-Hound,
he's gone.

684
00:24:58,401 --> 00:24:59,569
Mm-hmm.

685
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:01,279
What if whoever loses...

686
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:02,531
Yeah?

687
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:04,493
...refuses to go?

688
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:06,913
You think P-Hound would do that?

689
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:08,372
Okay, new plan.

690
00:25:08,414 --> 00:25:10,042
And so the planning
continued through

691
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:12,253
what should have been
organic chemistry.

692
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:14,423
We all pack ahead of time,

693
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:17,219
really pack a bag, so it doesn't
look rigged, you know?

694
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,845
And then the loser,
straight out the door.

695
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,305
I mean, that's-that's the deal.

696
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:22,099
You know, that's the cost
of having a vote,

697
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:23,101
that's the price of freedom.

698
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:24,561
You know, maybe it's...

699
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:26,105
maybe it's better
if we're all just

700
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:27,440
direct with each other,
you know?

701
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:28,984
Just-just say
what's on our minds.

702
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:30,528
Yeah, I think it's gonna
come out anyway.

703
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:35,034
Um, Dad, you know, I-I've really
loved living with you...

704
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,077
No talking.

705
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,958
No talking
once the votes come in.

706
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,627
You're just right out the door.
That's the missing piece.

707
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:43,295
That's it.

708
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:45,131
This plan is foolproof.

709
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:47,927
Oh, I've cherished this,
too, pal.

710
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:49,470
Yeah. I mean, how many,
how many fathers

711
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:51,390
get to go to college
with their kid, huh?

712
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:53,518
So obviously
this is what happened.

713
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,354
Michael read
his own vote first.

714
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:59,401
First vote to remove...

715
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:00,569
Michael.

716
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,238
Huh, what are you gonna do?

717
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:06,703
Second vote to remove...

718
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:10,583
...Michael.

719
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:14,254
Michael expected this,
but didn't expect the sting.

720
00:26:14,296 --> 00:26:16,173
Wow.

721
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:19,678
Obviously, if there's a tie,
there's an immediate runoff.

722
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,389
Third vote to remove...

723
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:25,687
...Michael.

724
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:35,158
Did you mean
to write "George Michael"?

725
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:38,120
Obviously, the verdict was in.

726
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:40,165
And it's hard to know exactly

727
00:26:40,206 --> 00:26:42,000
why Michael opened
the fourth ballot.

728
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:46,006
Was it out of hope
or confusion?

729
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:49,260
Either way, it couldn't be
what he wanted to read.

730
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:12,709
Michael did the only thing
he could think of

731
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:15,296
that would save face.

732
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:38,285
Michael had just been
stunned by some bad news.

733
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,163
And with nowhere to go,
he decided

734
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:42,959
to pick up a copy of Altitude
to lift his spirits.

735
00:27:43,001 --> 00:27:44,460
- Hi. Hello.
- Hey.

736
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,046
Where you heading today, sir?

737
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:47,715
Well, actually,
I just wanted a copy

738
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:49,968
of your in-flight magazine
Altitude.

739
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,971
Ah, this is ticketing.

740
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:54,099
You can get the magazine
on the flight.

741
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:56,811
I get it. But I'm actually--
I'm in the magazine.

742
00:27:56,853 --> 00:27:58,271
How many bags?

743
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,816
Oh, I'm not checking these.

744
00:28:00,858 --> 00:28:01,860
Ah, sorry, you actually

745
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:03,445
can't carry those on board.

746
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:05,239
Let me start over.

747
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,367
Uh, I-I am the star of
Altitude magazine this month--

748
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:09,286
or quarter, actually.

749
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:12,040
It's an April-September issue,
and I just wanted to get a copy.

750
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:13,459
I'm not flying anywhere.

751
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,877
Why do you have suitcases?

752
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:16,171
Those are irrelevant.

753
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:17,255
Not to me.

754
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:19,216
Okay.

755
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:22,262
I was mistakenly voted out of
a four-person housing situation,

756
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:25,016
uh, in a pack-first,
no-talking-after scenario.

757
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:26,392
Does that clear it up for you?

758
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:28,896
What do you mean
by "mistakenly"?

759
00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:31,066
I voted against myself to spare
my son the embarrassment

760
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:34,028
of, of having to vote
his own father out of his dorm.

761
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,238
That's all.

762
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,865
But that leaves
three other votes.

763
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:38,034
Yeah.

764
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:39,911
Can I get a copy
of the magazine, please?

765
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,289
No, I'm sorry,
they're actually for passengers.

766
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:44,042
We don't even give out
honey nuts, so we're not gonna

767
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:46,212
- give you a magazine.
- Who wants honey nuts?

768
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:47,421
I don't want the honey nuts.

769
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:48,757
I want to just jump
onto the plane,

770
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,966
- grab a magazine.
- Oh, okay,

771
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,385
yeah, sure, we just, uh,
let people walk

772
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:52,929
onto the plane all the time.

773
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,474
Do you want a box cutter also?

774
00:28:55,516 --> 00:28:57,102
- Oh.
- Nice.

775
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:59,020
These guys are jerks.

776
00:28:59,062 --> 00:29:00,272
Take that, take that.

777
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:03,026
Enjoy.

778
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:04,277
Tell you what--
give me a one- way ticket

779
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,364
to your cheapest destination,
please.

780
00:29:06,405 --> 00:29:08,909
Oh, you lucked out.

781
00:29:08,951 --> 00:29:10,870
Today it's Pittsburgh.

782
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:13,207
He's good.

783
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:15,000
What's the second cheapest?

784
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:16,962
So Michael ended up
spending a little more

785
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:18,798
to fly a little less,

786
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,134
and after some confusion
at security...

787
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:22,427
But you've got nothing
in your luggage.

788
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,512
I wasn't supposed to be
traveling today.

789
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,098
I told you, it was

790
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,182
a voting situation, there was a
miscalculation.

791
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:27,476
Well, I mean, obviously

792
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:29,061
P-Hound's gonna vote
against you.

793
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:30,856
- I've never seen nothing...
- These three people with burkas

794
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:32,567
just walked right by you.

795
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:34,944
...he found his seat.

796
00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:38,032
Unfortunately the seat
he was assigned didn't have

797
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:39,951
a seat back pocket.

798
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:43,080
Hello, hi,
does each ticket entitle

799
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:44,833
the passenger
to an in-flight magazine?

800
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,335
No, it only guarantees you
a seat.

801
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:48,337
Perhaps I can ask
another passenger for one,

802
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:50,424
or if I'd rather, you can.

803
00:29:50,465 --> 00:29:53,303
Michael had
to go back four seats

804
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:55,681
before someone would.

805
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:03,400
And Michael kicked himself
for a pose

806
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:06,613
he thought would express
humility to Sanjiv,

807
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:09,575
the Altitude photographer.

808
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:12,078
And so Michael--

809
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,999
a man who'd for years
threatened to leave

810
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:18,378
his family but had always
stayed for his son,

811
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,384
a man who no longer had that
excuse nor anywhere to live--

812
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:24,930
found himself
with nothing to lose

813
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:27,558
in a town
that he'd always imagined

814
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,602
would be his destiny,

815
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:33,149
and for the first time
in many years,

816
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:35,193
Michael had hope.

817
00:30:41,285 --> 00:30:43,412
Michael steps out
of the air-conditioned airport.

818
00:30:43,454 --> 00:30:46,416
Hope you know a good place
to live because I'm...

819
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:49,003
Ooh, dear Lord.

820
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:50,547
'Cause I'm looking

821
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:52,384
- to make a new start.
- Don't touch that handle.

822
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:53,718
Whoa, Mother of God!

823
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,680
Dear Lord!

824
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,098
Whoo!

825
00:30:57,139 --> 00:30:59,101
And Michael returns

826
00:30:59,142 --> 00:31:03,023
to the only viable place
he can think of to live...

827
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:05,359
Gentlemen, start your engines.

828
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:08,154
...where he begins his new life
cleaning up

829
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:10,157
after his family's old one.

830
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,743
Buster.

831
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:16,040
No... no, Gob.

832
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,043
Oh!

833
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,088
It was Lindsay.

834
