1
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:12,613
<i>Even though</i>
<i>it was only a hundred miles</i>

2
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:15,699
<i>from her hometown</i>
<i>of Newport Beach,</i>

3
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:19,203
<i>the desert created a whole new</i>
<i>value system for Lindsay Bluth.</i>

4
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,705
I'd give $20,000
for a lemonade right now.

5
00:00:21,747 --> 00:00:23,624
<i>For the most part.</i>

6
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:26,501
<i>It was here that she'd moved</i>
<i>with her activist boyfriend...</i>

7
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:29,713
Marky! Mommy needs mescaline!

8
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:30,756
<i>...and his mother.</i>

9
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,883
And tell your girlfriend DeBrie

10
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,135
to shovel that ostrich crap!

11
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:35,761
It's not DeBrie, Ma Bark.

12
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,429
It's Lindsay.

13
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,098
I just cut off my hair.

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,390
I know who you are.

15
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:41,683
Now start shoveling!

16
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:43,644
God, you're lazier than Lindsay.

17
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:46,688
Marky, hurry!

18
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,565
- There's another dead iguana.
- Oh.

19
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:50,316
What does this mean?

20
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:52,236
Probably those bastards
next door.

21
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:55,114
<i>The bastards next door were</i>
<i>actually a gathered group</i>

22
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:59,243
<i>of CEOs who were attending</i>
<i>a mid-summer sweat and squeeze.</i>

23
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:00,869
They want us off their land.

24
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:02,830
Probably so they can
build a border wall.

25
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,749
They just want to separate
the whites from the browns.

26
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,584
You really are color-blind.

27
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:08,877
Face-blind.

28
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,504
Fortunately, I can see color.

29
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:13,381
That's how I can tell
the browns are the Mexicans.

30
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:16,010
Anyway, I thought
I scared those bastards off

31
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:17,219
<i>by scaring their leader.</i>

32
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,054
The strong will become the weak.

33
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,890
<i>But I think I overdid it first</i>
<i>on the maca, because I ended up</i>

34
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:23,517
<i>seeing two of him.</i>

35
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:25,311
But to kill an innocent iguana,

36
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,313
this beautiful creature
of the desert...

37
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,772
That lizard bastard bit me!

38
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:30,065
God!

39
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:31,900
Who keeps numbing
these desert animals?

40
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:32,985
No, no, we'll kill it later.

41
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,153
Mom, lizard bite!

42
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,737
Put some rubbing mescaline
on it!

43
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,531
<i>Lindsay hated her new life,</i>

44
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:38,824
<i>but even more,</i>
<i>she hated herself</i>

45
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,575
<i>for hating her new life.</i>

46
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:42,619
Marky, I just don't know how
much more of this I can take.

47
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:44,496
I'm surrounded
by squalor and death,

48
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,498
and I still can't be happy.

49
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,083
Yeah, well,
it's only gonna get worse,

50
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,127
'cause they're chasing us
off the land.

51
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:51,419
I mean, where are we gonna go?

52
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:52,504
Hey, new girl, I just heard

53
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,173
about your mother's trial.

54
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,757
She was sent away.

55
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,677
<i>Lindsay had missed</i>
<i>her own mother's trial,</i>

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,263
<i>and for that, she'd never</i>
<i>be able to forgive her...</i>

57
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:03,098
Hey, I know a place
that just opened up.

58
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,391
<i>...herself.</i>

59
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:06,393
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

60
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:08,562
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

61
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:11,065
<i>and the one daughter</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

62
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:13,275
<i>but to keep her life together.</i>

63
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,406
<i>It's Lindsay's</i>
Arrested Development.

64
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,077
<i>- Lindsay wanted to move</i>
- That's great.

65
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:25,120
<i>to her mother's</i>
<i>empty penthouse,</i>

66
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:26,372
<i>- but Marky wouldn't think</i>
- You dropped your shovel.

67
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,623
<i>of leaving the old bird behind.</i>

68
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,668
<i>So it was a party of three</i>

69
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,963
<i>that had to sneak into</i>
<i>the Balboa Towers.</i>

70
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:38,508
<i>Although Marky</i>
<i>was having trouble</i>

71
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,344
<i>- accepting what appeared to be</i>
- Come on, Cindy.

72
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:41,595
<i>a lavish lifestyle.</i>

73
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:43,013
- What do you think?
- Ugh.

74
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,848
Smells weird in here.
What is that?

75
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,268
I think it's just... not urine.

76
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:48,810
And we're not moving in,

77
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:51,397
we're occupying a space
with central air.

78
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:53,357
Cindy?

79
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,192
You okay?

80
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:57,945
: Look, Lindsay,
Cindy already marked the master.

81
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:58,946
Okay.

82
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:01,156
This will be where she goes.

83
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:02,783
So we're staying.

84
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:06,703
And we will change the world
and hold our heads high.

85
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:11,083
And it might be nice to live
like normal people for a change.

86
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,668
Let's put some newspaper
on these windows.

87
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:19,674
<i>One year later, however,</i>

88
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,843
<i>the only thing</i>
<i>they'd actually changed was</i>

89
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,388
<i>getting the "not urine" smell</i>
<i>out of the penthouse.</i>

90
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:28,558
You're looking at Lindsay.

91
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,601
Still Lindsay.

92
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,061
Oh. Hey, Linds.

93
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:32,980
- How was beg?
- Beg was good.

94
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:34,731
I found some<i>tres leches</i>cake.

95
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:35,774
That's great.

96
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,484
Hey, did you clean up?

97
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,028
No, no, I just cleared out a
space to work on the Love bomb.

98
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,990
Oh, okay. I'll, uh, change
out of these filthy clothes

99
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,450
and into some filthy lingerie.

100
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,243
I don't think I washed it.

101
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,621
No, I meant what we're gonna do
to this guy-- Herbert Love.

102
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,206
Oh.

103
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:53,167
<i>Herbert Love was a very</i>
<i>conservative candidate</i>

104
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,169
<i>for a very conservative seat</i>
<i>in the very conservative</i>

105
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,795
<i>- House of Representatives.</i>
- Look, look, look.

106
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,089
Am I guilty of anything? Yes.

107
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:01,342
Of having a great
sense of humor.

108
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:03,885
But the two women
who accused me of this crime

109
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:06,054
do<i>not</i>have
a great sense of humor.

110
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:08,849
Look, in fact, I'll tell you the
joke and let you be the judge...

111
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,434
<i>Although he was prone to</i>

112
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:12,144
<i>the more than occasional</i>
<i>harassment scandal.</i>

113
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,561
I forgot the joke.

114
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:15,939
Oh, he's about to be harassed,
all right.

115
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:18,566
I'm gonna spray the bastards
with ink and glitter.

116
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,694
It'll be in their ears
for weeks.

117
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,737
Thing is, I can't find
the glitter anywhere.

118
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,156
Did you take the silver glitter?

119
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,283
Nope. I mean,
I'd say check the junk drawer,

120
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:28,076
but I can't
differentiate anymore.

121
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:30,454
Oh, God, what is this?

122
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:31,663
Oh. Okay, good.
Perfect timing,

123
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,165
because this is
where you come in.

124
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,501
A lot of this has to do
with ink compression,

125
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,127
oxygen capacity,
expulsion pressures.

126
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,214
But the point is,
three days before the event,

127
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:42,341
I'm gonna take the explosive
and hide in the podium.

128
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,259
On the night of the event,
at exactly 7:30,

129
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:45,802
I'm gonna pull the pin
to the tank.

130
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:47,429
Then you're gonna
knock on the podium door

131
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,264
to let me know
that the coast is clear.

132
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:52,226
When Love steps up to the podium
at exactly 8:00, blam!

133
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:55,521
The podium doors burst open,
and he and everyone will be...

134
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,231
Blue in the face, yeah.

135
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:59,024
That's better than
what I had, actually.

136
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,859
I was gonna say they'd be
covered in ink and glitter.

137
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,404
Or we can support Lucille 2,
who he's running against.

138
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:04,988
She's right across the hall.

139
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,574
No, no!
She's part of the problem.

140
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,617
Wait, you haven't been
going over there, by the way?

141
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,412
- No one can know we're here.
- Of course not.

142
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,372
Does it look like I'm lying?

143
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,457
<i>It did.</i>

144
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:18,335
<i>But not to a man</i>
<i>with face-blindness.</i>

145
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:20,254
Yeah, no, I guess not.

146
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:22,005
<i>Because Lindsay</i>
<i>could only spend</i>

147
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,049
<i>so many hours with a shrill,</i>
<i>feathered creature...</i>

148
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,510
<i>...and needed to get away.</i>

149
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:28,554
You look marvelous in that!

150
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,888
Here, try this on.

151
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,473
I can't believe
how much I've missed

152
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:33,141
the feel of anything
that isn't hemp.

153
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:34,184
And try this on.

154
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:35,601
Isn't that funny?

155
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:37,354
I used to wear that
with the Captain.

156
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:38,355
And I was...

157
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:39,731
Tennille?

158
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,900
And not make contact, yes!

159
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,278
What am I gonna do,
cut it down for my foster child?

160
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,071
<i>That is what she wanted to do,</i>

161
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:49,615
<i>until he threatened to call</i>
<i>Social Services.</i>

162
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:51,617
Oh, look what I made you.

163
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,287
Oh! I love it!

164
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:55,163
It's glittery!

165
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:58,624
<i>Lindsay was no stranger</i>
<i>to making campaign posters,</i>

166
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,211
<i>having made several</i>
<i>in her seventh grade</i>

167
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:04,131
<i>class president campaign</i>
<i>against Sally Sitwell.</i>

168
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:06,716
<i>Sally ultimately</i>
<i>proved successful</i>

169
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:09,261
<i>with a more fact-based</i>
<i>campaign.</i>

170
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,762
A couple of tiny notes, hon.

171
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,348
There are two S's in "congress."

172
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,142
And I just
call myself Lucille...

173
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:16,893
Lucille 1. I'm so sorry.

174
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:18,145
No.

175
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:19,229
Just Lucille.

176
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:20,772
But I love it!

177
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,317
Oh, I wish you'd officially work
for my campaign.

178
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:24,568
We could make such a difference.

179
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,736
Well, Marky says that's not

180
00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:28,155
the way we should make change.

181
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:29,655
Oh, speaking of, do you mind

182
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:31,699
if I go through
your couch cushions?

183
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:34,744
Oh, honey, I wish you'd take the
rest of this<i>tres leches</i>cake.

184
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:37,080
It's from a dear
Hispanic supporter.

185
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:40,167
And I'll never get it
into the bay in one piece.

186
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,544
Honestly, Lucille 2,
you've been like a mother to me.

187
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:44,045
Aw.

188
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:46,965
Except kind and loving
and willing to let me eat.

189
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,259
It just blows me away.

190
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:50,885
<i>Lindsay knew she had to keep</i>

191
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,180
<i>her secret life</i>
<i>of luxury hidden...</i>

192
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:54,515
You're looking at Lindsay.

193
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,681
Still Lindsay.

194
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,142
<i>...from a boyfriend that was</i>

195
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,977
<i>preparing to squat in a podium</i>

196
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,770
<i>for three days</i>
<i>with a paint bomb.</i>

197
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:02,730
But, Marky, I mean,
won't you go crazy in there?

198
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,774
Oh, no, that's nothing.
I once did a week and a half

199
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,276
in an oil drum
just to throw a pie

200
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:07,361
at Arnold Schwarzenegger.

201
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:08,778
I never heard about that.

202
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,780
Oh, yeah, well,
the press tried to spin it as

203
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:13,116
"Hippie tries to play pie-tin
Frisbee with the governor,"

204
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:15,118
but... this time,
I'm eating beforehand.

205
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,120
Yeah, I-I see that.

206
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:18,872
Hey, can I get you a fork?

207
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:22,167
'Cause that's my brother
whose face you're licking.

208
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,336
That's a face?

209
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,547
Everything I do is wrong.

210
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:27,797
I knew you wouldn't be

211
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,840
on board with this, Lindsay.

212
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:29,924
I'm sorry to say this,

213
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,426
but you are losing your passion.

214
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,679
What passion?
You don't even look at me.

215
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,597
I don't know
if I've said this before--

216
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,057
it's not important or anything--

217
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:38,684
but I'm really, really pretty.

218
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,310
I'm the straightest guy
you know!

219
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:41,645
Why does every man feel like

220
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:43,146
they have to say that to me?

221
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:45,357
Quiet! Cindy's in heat.

222
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,192
You know how much she hates it
when we argue.

223
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,985
: Now listen to me.
This protest of mine

224
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:51,321
- can really make a difference.
- Yeah, it's gonna land you

225
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:52,573
- in jail, Marky.
- Oh, there it is.

226
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:53,865
Oh, yeah, so that's-- oh, yeah.

227
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,450
You know what,
you are just as selfish

228
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:56,993
- and money-hungry
as you ever were. -No, I'm...

229
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:58,870
- Yes, you are.
- That's not true.

230
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,788
Ooh, a Neiman's catalog.

231
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,376
<i>But it was what she found</i>
<i>stuck inside the catalog</i>

232
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,919
<i>that got her attention.</i>

233
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,629
<i>And that's when she found</i>
<i>the mother lode.</i>

234
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:10,798
"From Gangie 4: Facelift."

235
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,427
What a load of...

236
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:15,011
Mother.

237
00:08:15,053 --> 00:08:17,805
<i>And this time, she did</i>
<i>make a court appearance.</i>

238
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,767
Cheryl, you've got no backhand!

239
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,269
I'm working the whole court,

240
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,439
and you keep hitting the balls
high.

241
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,900
Oh, great, looks like we've got
another high-end hooker in here.

242
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,318
Oh, thank you, Mother.

243
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,529
<i>So, let's cut to the chase.</i>

244
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:36,157
I want to talk to you about
a check for plastic surgery.

245
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,243
I already wrote you
a check for that.

246
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,245
<i>Lucille had,</i>
<i>back when Lindsay thought</i>

247
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,872
<i>- she was only 12 years old.</i>
- New nose.

248
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:45,792
<i>Worrying it would hurt</i>
<i>her daughter's feelings...</i>

249
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,210
Put a "Y" on there.

250
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:49,212
<i>...she put a fun spin on it.</i>

251
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:50,838
- "Nosy."
- <i>And you should be</i>

252
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,215
<i>thanking me for that.</i>

253
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:53,967
You looked like a can opener.

254
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:56,219
No, a check for my daughter.

255
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:57,429
She's gorgeous.

256
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,139
And I love her
just the way she is.

257
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,141
When was the last time
you saw her?

258
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:04,269
She's been living
with her father the past year,

259
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:08,440
and it's been... really hard.

260
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,652
I'll be out on parole
by the time you work up a tear.

261
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:14,613
What makes you think I wrote
a check to your daughter, nosy?

262
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:15,989
It came to the penthouse.

263
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,658
Well, well.

264
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,076
Little Miss Lives-Off-the-Land
is living in my penthouse.

265
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:23,371
Okay, so you figured it out,
Gene Parmesan.

266
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:27,709
Just goes to show, the apple
does not far from the tree fall.

267
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:30,086
I am like you nothing.

268
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:32,339
You're not even my real mother.

269
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,965
I am a political activist.

270
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,344
Oh, you're a lot more like me
than you know, sister.

271
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:39,596
Except I can back up
my bad choices.

272
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:41,431
I'm doing hard time.

273
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:43,809
Your 3:00 p.m.
hot rock massage is open.

274
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,644
Thanks for coming, sweetheart.

275
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,604
- Mm.
- <i>But Lindsay wanted</i>

276
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:49,815
<i>to prove that she wasn't like</i>
<i>her so-called mother.</i>

277
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:54,027
<i>And that's why she did this.</i>

278
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:56,738
I'm in.

279
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,824
Let's bomb the bastard.

280
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,576
It's Lindsay.

281
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:04,120
Oh, yes!
: Yeah!

282
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,292
<i>Lindsay and her</i>
<i>boyfriend Marky arrived in--</i>

283
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,837
<i>get this--</i>
<i>Beverly Hills to prepare</i>

284
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,381
<i>for their act</i>
<i>of glittery social protest.</i>

285
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:17,384
<i>But Lindsay was having</i>
<i>second thoughts.</i>

286
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:19,469
Marky, look, um,

287
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:22,514
I have this check that my mother
wrote for my daughter.

288
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,308
It can buy us a lot of leaflets
against Love.

289
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,227
And also a lot
of Nature's Miracle.

290
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:29,771
You know, there's a huge sale
going on right now at Petco...

291
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,314
No, never! Rip it up! No money!

292
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:33,941
And don't worry,
I've thought of everything.

293
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,151
<i>He had.</i>

294
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:36,403
Except for someone
to watch Cindy.

295
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:38,238
Oh, but she's locked in.

296
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,447
What's the worst
that can happen?

297
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:44,952
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

298
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:46,705
Ah! What a great day to step out

299
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,915
onto an over-irrigated
golf course and play a game

300
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:52,377
that wastes vast acres
of usable, farm-able land.

301
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,379
<i>And after a few nights</i>
<i>in the trailer,</i>

302
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:58,341
<i>Lindsay showed up</i>
<i>in Lucille 2's Tennille wig</i>

303
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:00,677
<i>to be ready to release Marky</i>
<i>from the podium</i>

304
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,721
<i>at the appointed time,</i>

305
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,139
<i>and then stroll out together</i>
<i>in disguise.</i>

306
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,267
<i>I think that's what</i>
<i>this part refers to</i>

307
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:08,727
<i>back when the disguise was</i>

308
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,771
<i>going to be</i>
<i>a two-part horse costume.</i>

309
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:14,148
<i>But soon, she ran into a father</i>
<i>she hadn't seen in over a year.</i>

310
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,819
Lindsay, I forgot,
you dyed your hair.

311
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,237
Do you have any money?

312
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,363
<i>And that's how Lindsay</i>

313
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:22,783
<i>parted with the check for Maeby</i>

314
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:25,577
<i>that Marky had told her</i>
<i>to rip up.</i>

315
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,120
<i>And it was then</i>
<i>she ran into a daughter...</i>

316
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:28,747
Maeby.

317
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,457
<i>...whose $50,000 check</i>
<i>she'd just given away...</i>

318
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:31,750
Mom.

319
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,167
<i>...stealing some</i>
<i>coconut shrimp.</i>

320
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,377
Of course you're here.

321
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:36,129
I should've known you'd be

322
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,005
- supporting this right-wing,
dangerous crackpot. -No, no.

323
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,634
I am here undercover
with my boyfriend.

324
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:42,552
We are gonna take down Love

325
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:46,180
with a random act
of senseless nonviolence.

326
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,224
<i>Maeby felt a foreign feeling.</i>

327
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:50,310
I actually respect that.

328
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:51,937
- Thank you, Maeby.
<i>- Which is why,</i>

329
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,147
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in her adult life...</i>

330
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:55,732
So what are you doing here?

331
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:58,192
<i>...Maeby was totally honest</i>
<i>with her mother.</i>

332
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,236
I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award

333
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,489
for my work
in the entertainment business.

334
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,989
I tried.

335
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,700
Tell your therapist I tried.

336
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:08,244
<i>But realizing</i>
<i>she was still too early</i>

337
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:10,163
<i>to let Marky out of the podium,</i>

338
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,457
<i>Lindsay headed to the bar,</i>

339
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,417
<i>and that's when she met the man</i>
<i>she was there to sabotage...</i>

340
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,877
Is it just me,

341
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,672
or are we the only two people
who don't fit in

342
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:21,925
with all these
Orange County phonies?

343
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:25,553
<i>...and had no idea who he was.</i>

344
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:27,722
They are a bunch of phonies.

345
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,056
I usually don't even go
to these things.

346
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:30,266
<i>And perhaps it was</i>

347
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:31,893
<i>because he reminded her so much</i>

348
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:34,479
<i>of Tobias</i>
<i>when they first started dating,</i>

349
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,189
<i>but Lindsay flirted back.</i>

350
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,649
What's your name, princess?

351
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,151
Cindy Featherbottom.

352
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,529
Of the Laguna Beach
Featherbottoms?

353
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,364
Are you trying to find out
where I live?

354
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:46,950
And your favorite kind
of jewelry. -

355
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:48,785
<i>Lindsay hadn't heard</i>
<i>the word "jewelry"</i>

356
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:51,162
<i>in a long time</i>
<i>but tried to stay strong.</i>

357
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:54,123
How do I know you're not
one of these phonies?

358
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:58,252
The only phony I'm interested in
is your phony number.

359
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:00,254
<i>And like Cinderella</i>
<i>at the ball,</i>

360
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,799
<i>Lindsay really felt</i>
<i>like a princess for a change...</i>

361
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:04,009
Okay.

362
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,760
<i>...but also like Cinderella,</i>

363
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:08,304
<i>- she lost track of the time...</i>
- It's, uh, 714... -Mm-hmm.

364
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,434
<i>...and had forgotten</i>

365
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:16,145
<i>to release Marky</i>
<i>from the podium,</i>

366
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:18,063
<i>and that's when she was struck</i>

367
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:19,315
<i>- with an eerie sense...</i>
- Right this way, sir,

368
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:21,066
- right this way.
<i>- ...of déjà vu.</i>

369
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,151
Lindsay.

370
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:25,446
Oh, God, he blued himself.

371
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,785
<i>Lindsay's attempt</i>
<i>to create a disaster</i>

372
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:33,120
<i>for Herbert Love was</i>
<i>a complete disaster,</i>

373
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:35,957
<i>and as she tried to slip away</i>
<i>without drawing attention</i>

374
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,959
<i>to herself, she was</i>
<i>once again approached...</i>

375
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:39,794
- Cindy Featherbottom.-<i>... by the</i>
<i>man whose name she never got.</i>

376
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,212
Here's my private number.

377
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,547
Give me a call;
perhaps we can engage

378
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,216
- in some sexual congress.
<i>- Although that's</i>

379
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,176
<i>a total giveaway, right?</i>

380
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:49,679
What a wonderful sense of humor.

381
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:51,723
I'd like that very much.

382
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,516
Sir, the press awaits.

383
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:54,726
Now, I don't know what this nut
was protesting tonight.

384
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,101
I thought you were supposed
to be sticking it

385
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:57,896
to the man,
not the other way around.

386
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,272
Maeby.

387
00:13:59,313 --> 00:14:00,774
You think he likes me that way?

388
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:03,192
No, Mom, that's Herbert Love,

389
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,235
the man you're here to protest.

390
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,445
And I hear the guy with the bomb

391
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:06,613
snuck up here from Mexico.

392
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:07,655
That's why I say,

393
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:10,992
we have got to build a wall

394
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:13,118
- between us and Mexico.
- Oh, no.

395
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,996
H-How could you not
recognize him?

396
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:17,248
<i>In fairness</i>
<i>to Lindsay, it was Marky's</i>

397
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,167
<i>face-blindness that led him</i>
<i>to mistake this photo</i>

398
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,419
<i>for the candidate.</i>

399
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,004
<i>Why Lindsay failed to recognize</i>

400
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:26,883
<i>musical icon Nat King Cole</i>
<i>cannot be explained.</i>

401
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,927
But he's so modern looking.

402
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,678
I mean, obviously I didn't know
it was the man

403
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,764
whose politics
I'm here to protest.

404
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:33,932
I guess I was just having fun,

405
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,642
pretending I had
my old life back.

406
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:37,393
Well, we'll just be friends,
and I'm gonna keep it

407
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,980
light and fun with him
and not talk politics at all.

408
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,065
I can't believe
you're such a sellout.

409
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:44,734
-Are you really going
to whore yourself out like that?

410
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:46,861
- I am not a whore.
- Yeah, you're a whore.

411
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:47,779
I am not a whore.

412
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,280
Look, I am still committed
to my ideals

413
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,491
and to my Marky.

414
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:52,951
Lindsay!

415
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,577
Lindsay, Lindsay!

416
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:55,954
Well, you certainly have a type.

417
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,580
Lindsay? Have you seen a
woman named Lindsay?

418
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:58,832
If you see a woman
named Lindsay,

419
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:01,250
tell her to bail me out.

420
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:03,086
I'll do my best, sir.

421
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:04,170
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

422
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,713
Taxi.

423
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:07,214
Tell Lindsay to feed Cindy.

424
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,424
- She thinks she's...
- : Taxi.

425
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:13,054
<i>Lindsay was</i>
<i>as blue as one of her men</i>

426
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:15,348
<i>when she returned</i>
<i>to the penthouse,</i>

427
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:18,559
<i>and that's when she decided</i>
<i>to get half in the bag.</i>

428
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:22,730
<i>But even though she felt</i>
<i>bad...</i>-

429
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:25,358
<i>...she was at least able</i>
<i>to turn a man's head...</i>

430
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,027
Gentlemen, start your engines.

431
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:28,736
<i>...although, perhaps had</i>
<i>his head not turned...</i>

432
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:30,321
- Buster.
<i>- ...he would have seen</i>

433
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,656
<i>- the ostrich warning</i>
<i>on the door.</i>-No, Gob.

434
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,949
Oh!

435
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,575
<i>After another night</i>

436
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:37,704
<i>in the trailer,</i>
<i>Lindsay went to the model home</i>

437
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:39,372
<i>to give a daughter</i>
<i>who called her a whore</i>

438
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:40,832
<i>a piece of her mind.</i>

439
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,126
Hi, sweetie.

440
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:45,294
<i>Of course, she needed a place</i>
<i>to stay, so she couldn't</i>

441
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:47,714
<i>- just jump right in.</i>-I thought
I'd surprise you with a visit.

442
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:49,924
Yeah, well, the bags are
certainly a surprise.

443
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,258
You're not thinking
of moving in, are you?

444
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,260
- What? No.
- Yeah, because

445
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,554
I don't think
Dad would be cool with it.

446
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:56,014
- No, of course not.
- Yeah.

447
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,059
- Is he in?
- No.

448
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,978
Oh, what happened there?

449
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,564
Kids or people who like kids.

450
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,024
So, where's Marky?

451
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:09,861
God, Marky will be
in jail for quite a while.

452
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,529
<i>She actually had just</i>
<i>come from visiting him.</i>

453
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,824
So it, uh, turns out
the glitter was shrapnel grade.

454
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:16,868
They're upping my charges

455
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,205
from prank bomb
to non-Arab terrorism.

456
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,664
This is where
you letting me out

457
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:22,790
of the podium
would have really helped.

458
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,209
Why didn't you just come out?

459
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,169
I couldn't do it;
someone locked me in.

460
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:27,587
<i>In fact, it was Gob,</i>

461
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:30,339
<i>thinking he was trapping</i>
<i>the magician Tony Wonder</i>

462
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:31,716
<i>into one of his illusions.</i>

463
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,300
<i>Hey, Mark, you guys want to see</i>

464
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:34,594
a real failed magician,
you might want

465
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:35,678
to get down to the Opies
tonight.

466
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,222
It's going to be hysterical.

467
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,639
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to bail me out, Lindsay.</i>

468
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,307
- I need you to use that check.
- Oh, I...

469
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:41,517
I don't have that check anymore.

470
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,644
- What?
- You told me to rip it up.

471
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:45,063
I thought you said you
didn't believe in money.

472
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,480
I didn't until I realized
what it could keep me from.

473
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,024
Jail's a lot like Swappigans,

474
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:50,359
except there's only
one thing to swap.

475
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:51,652
It's scary.

476
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:52,946
- Anus tart.
- Yep,

477
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:55,156
Oh, God,
that could have been me.

478
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:57,242
Lindsay, listen to me--
I'm scared.

479
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,451
I'm scared,
I'm scared, I'm scared.

480
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:00,161
- I'm really scared.
- No touching.

481
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,495
<i>Actually it's kind of nice</i>

482
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,206
to have a little me time.

483
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:05,250
Oh, of course, that's why
you were giving Herbert Love

484
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,418
a little you time last night.

485
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,837
You were flirting with him
to get Marky out of jail.

486
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,380
Well, yeah, that is

487
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:15,718
what I should have been do--
what I did, yeah, yeah.

488
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,887
That's exactly
what I should have and did do.

489
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:21,015
And it's not that bad an idea,
actually.

490
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:22,892
You could get him to do anything
'cause he's probably

491
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,186
just one of those shallow guys
who's only interested in looks.

492
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:26,854
I miss that.

493
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,106
Missed that.

494
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,440
Yeah, you know,
maybe it would be

495
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,776
a good idea if I got
in touch with him.

496
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,946
I mean, he did give me his card.

497
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,948
Although I could never call him.

498
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,783
I could call him for you

499
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,035
and I'll tell him
it has to be tonight.

500
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:42,954
Well, the sooner the better.

501
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,122
Got to get Marky out of jail.

502
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,207
That's why the sooner
the better.

503
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:48,168
<i>So Maeby arranged</i>
<i>for a meeting</i>

504
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:50,878
<i>that evening at Hollywood's</i>
<i>exclusive Ealing Club</i>

505
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,922
<i>between Herbert Love</i>
<i>and Cindy Featherbottom.</i>

506
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:55,175
I like this place.

507
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:57,718
No cameras, no phones.

508
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,053
Everyone's cool.

509
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:01,222
Well, thank you
for being willing to meet.

510
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:02,723
Meet, greet.

511
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,309
Sure are sweet.

512
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,392
What a treat.

513
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:07,103
What did the lamb say?

514
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:09,189
Baa?

515
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,190
Bleat.

516
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:11,565
Ah, yes, of course.

517
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:12,984
I was just wondering,

518
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,111
is anything really bad going
to happen

519
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:17,488
to that blue guy from the rally?

520
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,531
Do you want to press charges?

521
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:20,200
Who can think of Little Boy Blue

522
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:23,203
- when I've got this beautiful
face in front of me? -Oh.

523
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:26,122
Thanks, haven't heard that
in a long time.

524
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:28,499
Your cheekbones are even higher
than my approval rating.

525
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,960
Your brain can register
my cheekbones?

526
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:32,586
I'll register 'em to vote.

527
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,048
-Your lips are
like a Murphy bed.

528
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:36,216
They don't take up much space,

529
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:38,301
but they are there
when you need 'em.

530
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:42,347
Okay, you are a poet.

531
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:45,474
You're wonderful.

532
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:47,434
But, um, yeah,
I-I do want to talk

533
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:49,187
to you about a couple of issues.

534
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:53,607
Can we just have one night where
we don't talk about politics?

535
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,443
Yes, yes, just one night.

536
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,112
- We deserve it.
- Let's get a room.

537
00:18:58,154 --> 00:18:59,322
Yes-- no.

538
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:00,323
What?

539
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:02,408
Uh, I... okay.

540
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,035
We can talk in a room, I guess.

541
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,039
<i>And later,</i>
<i>down in the lobby, as Herbert</i>

542
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,832
<i>went off to do some business...</i>

543
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:11,458
You hang tight.

544
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,212
I'm going to meet with some
of my, uh, "constititutes."

545
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,504
<i>...Lindsay ran</i>
<i>into her brother Michael.</i>

546
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,257
- Hi-lo.
- Michael?

547
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:18,341
Hi.

548
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:19,926
- How are you?
- Oh, good, good.

549
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,261
I almost didn't recognize you.

550
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:22,845
- It's my hair.
- That's some of it,

551
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,597
but it's also, you're with a guy

552
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:26,891
that pretty much represents
everything you pretend to hate.

553
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,601
- Was that Herbert Love?
- Great, now I remember

554
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:30,186
why we fell out of touch.

555
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:32,272
No, Lindsay, I'm kidding,
kidding, kidding, I'm so sorry.

556
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:33,731
I'm sure that you're having
a great influence

557
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,358
on him, you know.

558
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,943
Thanks.

559
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:39,737
But if you really want
to blow him-- away,

560
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,449
you know the wall issue
that everyone is talking about?

561
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,326
The wall between Mexico
and the U.S.?

562
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,702
Tell him to take it down?

563
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:49,122
Or just not to put it up.
No wall yet.

564
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:51,207
Oh, no, there's no--
I knew that, yeah.

565
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,000
If you could get him

566
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:55,128
against the wall, Lindsay...

567
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,463
Well, I had no idea you were
this socially conscious.

568
00:19:57,504 --> 00:19:59,299
<i>He wasn't.</i>

569
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,675
<i>In fact, he was just using</i>
<i>her Love connection</i>

570
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:04,470
<i>to make good</i>
<i>on a deal he'd struck</i>

571
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:06,597
<i>to get</i>
<i>his father's movie rights.</i>

572
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,016
Can you help me,
then, with Love?

573
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:11,144
Of course I will.

574
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:14,855
If you do something for me.

575
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:16,399
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

576
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:18,567
I would like to use your
membership at the Balboa Club.

577
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:20,320
The girl
I've been telling you about--

578
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,738
she likes nice things, and
if everything goes well tonight,

579
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,657
I think I may want
to take her out

580
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:25,658
for a nice dinner.

581
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:27,660
You really like this girl?

582
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,829
- She's Tracey.
- Oh.

583
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,082
Fat Tracey
or thin Tracey at the end?

584
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:35,209
I think, just on this,
you owe me the membership.

585
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:36,669
You know,
we're kind of maxed out

586
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,838
at the club,
but if you show them my card,

587
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:43,550
I'm sure they won't turn you
away at the door.

588
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,636
You'd do this for me?

589
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,138
I will if you...

590
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,640
- Yeah, sure, fine.
- Yeah?

591
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,892
Yeah, I'll talk to him
about the wall.

592
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,978
- Good. -I mean,
I want to change politics.

593
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,314
- Great.
- What's in it for me?

594
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,107
So not completely change them?

595
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:59,317
What do you want?

596
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,567
Well, actually

597
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,028
I want you to talk
to that warden guy

598
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:03,904
about getting my boyfriend out

599
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:06,366
'cause I really don't think
Herbert's gonna help with that.

600
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:08,326
Well, I have a script notes call
with him on Tuesday.

601
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:11,871
- Yeah, I'll talk to Warden
Gentles. -Great, thank you.

602
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:13,247
This is good.

603
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,124
- Of course.
- Glad we ran into each other.

604
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,417
If you do something for me.

605
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:18,794
I'm making this movie and I need
everybody's rights.

606
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:20,963
<i>And that's how Lindsay agreed</i>

607
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:23,549
<i>- to give Michael her rights for</i>
<i>his movie.</i>-I'll do it. -Great.

608
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,884
Thanks.

609
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:26,469
That's it.

610
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:28,429
<i>But it shouldn't have been</i>

611
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:30,681
<i>because he should have asked</i>
<i>for help getting into a club</i>

612
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,434
<i>he was about to discover</i>
<i>was members only.</i>

613
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:35,186
- This is a membership place,
huh? -It is,

614
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,812
- yes, members only. -Yeah,
I'm meeting my son up there.

615
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:39,148
Maybe he's already up there.
Could you maybe page him

616
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,401
- up there?<i>-And when</i>
<i>the page proved fruitless...</i>

617
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,444
If you'd like
to have a seat and wait...

618
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:46,197
You're gonna make me look like
a big shot in front of my son.

619
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,448
<i>And when the page</i>
<i>proved fruitless,</i>

620
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,034
<i>Michael decided to head</i>
<i>George Michael off</i>

621
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:53,287
<i>before he could get to the</i>
<i>club's lobby with a small lie.</i>

622
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:54,872
Hey, buddy, it's Dad.

623
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:58,042
Um, I am having real trouble
getting up there.

624
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,545
Uh, this traffic
is unbelievable.

625
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,547
<i>Which led</i>
<i>to a slightly bigger lie...</i>

626
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:05,966
We got a light aircraft right
in the middle of the freeway.

627
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,968
- You know?-<i>... and then some</i>
<i>effort to make it foolproof.</i>

628
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,555
Um, and, uh, the kicker
is that there's no news crew.

629
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,849
I mean, I guess they can't get
in either 'cause of the traffic,

630
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:15,726
so no one's going
to be able to see this.

631
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:16,810
<i>But perhaps,</i>

632
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:18,645
<i>had Michael not have lied,</i>

633
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:21,441
<i>he wouldn't have felt</i>
<i>suspicious when, moments later,</i>

634
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:23,192
<i>- he received a return call</i>
<i>from his son...</i>-You know what?

635
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:25,152
I bet we're sitting
in the exact same traffic.

636
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:28,114
- This is a mess.-<i>... canceling</i>
<i>the get-together entirely.</i>

637
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,908
Oh, God, they're forcing us off.
Oh, they're closing the lanes.

638
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,035
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>in Herbert's hotel room,</i>

639
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:34,619
<i>Lindsay was worried she was</i>

640
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:36,956
<i>too quickly abandoning</i>
<i>her principles.</i>

641
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:39,083
Wait... I can't do this

642
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,420
unless you promise
to be against the wall.

643
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,338
What the hell?

644
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,590
It's better for my back anyway.

645
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,799
Thank you.

646
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,384
<i>Although technically</i>

647
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:50,428
<i>that was one</i>
<i>of Michael's principles.</i>

648
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,471
<i>Well...</i>

649
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:53,306
That was so not quick.

650
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,349
Well, I paid for six hours.

651
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:57,059
I want to get my money's worth.

652
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:58,643
Imagine what would have happened
if you had the room

653
00:22:58,685 --> 00:22:59,979
for the whole night.

654
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,564
Oh, I got it
for the whole month.

655
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:03,608
You crack me up.

656
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,485
God, can you believe
this is happening?

657
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:07,820
I mean, we're such opposites
and yet we're so in synch.

658
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:10,864
- It's like we finish
each other's... -Sandwiches?

659
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:13,367
What's the point of raising
funds if I'm eating sandwiches?

660
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:15,786
I got something for you.

661
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,871
Oh, really?

662
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,960
<i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>the heart that made her wonder</i>

663
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:26,964
<i>if Herbert was the Love the</i>
<i>Four Seasons shaman spoke of.</i>

664
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:30,343
When love is near,
your heart will be happy.

665
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:31,552
<i>This way</i>

666
00:23:31,594 --> 00:23:34,805
you'll always have a little Love
near your heart.

667
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,018
- Aah, Jesus Christ!
- Oh!

668
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,311
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you do that?

669
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:42,021
No, I thought it was cute,
I saw it in a movie.

670
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:43,189
- Okay?
- Okay, okay, great, thank you.

671
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,773
Oh, I feel so special.

672
00:23:44,815 --> 00:23:46,025
You are special.

673
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:47,818
<i>Lindsay wasn't special,</i>

674
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,655
<i>but he'd gotten</i>
<i>the necklaces on special.</i>

675
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,072
<i>So, when can I see you</i>

676
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:53,782
- again?
- The only way

677
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:56,869
we can see each other is
if you work for my campaign.

678
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,498
You are going to be
my key advisor.

679
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,042
<i>She would be enacting</i>
<i>social change after all.</i>

680
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,627
I would like that very much.

681
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:06,920
She's going to need a key
to my room,

682
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:10,007
and I'd advise you to use it
when I call you.

683
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:15,179
<i>Since Herbert couldn't</i>
<i>officially spend money</i>

684
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:16,847
<i>on Lindsay, and Lindsay</i>
<i>hadn't told Herbert</i>

685
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,765
<i>- who she really was...</i>
- Uh, why don't you go

686
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,434
- make the rounds, and, uh,
I'll get us checked in. -Okay.

687
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:21,977
<i>...Lindsay had to pay</i>
<i>for dinner</i>

688
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:23,646
<i>- the way she always had...</i>
- Uh, Bluth.

689
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:25,981
- I made a reservation.
<i>- ...by secretly putting it</i>

690
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:27,525
<i>- on her family tab.</i>
- Hi-lo. Nice to meet you.

691
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,109
Oh, I'm sorry,
the Bluths have been seated.

692
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:30,944
<i>But she wasn't the only Bluth</i>

693
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:32,613
<i>pretending to be something</i>
<i>they weren't that night.</i>

694
00:24:32,655 --> 00:24:35,658
Who's the cheap redhead?

695
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,244
Well, hello.

696
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:39,620
Hello.

697
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:40,829
Indeed.

698
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:43,165
Look at you.
What are you doing here?

699
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,834
I need the membership. I'm
taking my boss out to dinner.

700
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,752
It's too late. I already made
a deal with Dad for it.

701
00:24:47,794 --> 00:24:50,047
This is why I had to ask you
for the in with Herbert Love.

702
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,007
Exactly, and that's why
you are leaving,

703
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,967
and I'm going to stay because
I'm the one who did the favor.

704
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:55,886
I got Love against the wall.
Plus I've got to impress him.

705
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,013
He's making me part
of his campaign.

706
00:24:58,055 --> 00:24:59,764
I'm sorry, there seems
to have been a mix-up.

707
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,475
- A merry one.
- Oh.

708
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:04,103
A merry one. I already paid you
back for the favor when

709
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:06,188
I talked to the warden about
getting Marky out of prison.

710
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,607
Oh, God, not now.

711
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:09,316
- When?
- I don't know, but listen.

712
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:10,901
I haven't been on a date
in a very, very long time,

713
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,403
and she's already going out
with Ron Howard

714
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:13,778
so I need to impress her.

715
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,489
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>it was Ron's daughter,</i>

716
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:17,074
<i>but Michael still didn't</i>
<i>know that.</i>

717
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,452
Great to see you.
And you look so good.

718
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:20,703
So do you.
I do hate the campaign,

719
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:22,955
okay, but I'm changing him.

720
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:24,290
I'm his key advisor.

721
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:25,999
<i>Although without an office,</i>

722
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,461
<i>she was forced to advise him</i>
<i>in the back of his limo.</i>

723
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:30,921
<i>And soon she was advising him</i>
<i>all over town.</i>

724
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,673
<i>And he respect me for it.</i>

725
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:34,258
He respects me for who I am.

726
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,009
So does mine.
Listen, we'll share it, okay?

727
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,720
- Okay.
- Got it? Great.

728
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:39,639
Oh! My name
is Cindy Featherbottom.

729
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,974
Right. Oh, and I-I used to be
a real estate tycoon,

730
00:25:42,015 --> 00:25:43,808
now I'm an impressive producer.
Got it?

731
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,102
- Got it.
- Eat light.

732
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:48,105
This is my date.
This is Rebel Alley.

733
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,856
Oh, and my boss, Herbert Love.

734
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:52,067
- Hi-lo.
- Hi-lo?

735
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:53,986
Just like your plan
to hurt the poor.

736
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:56,739
I thought that was about
neglecting the poor.

737
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:58,907
I guess the special tonight
is red snapper.

738
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:00,951
How do you know this woman?

739
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,499
Uh, she is... um...

740
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,210
I just, I mean...

741
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:12,045
- High school.
- Brother and sister.

742
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,673
We can't be brother-sister--
she knows about the family.

743
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:15,716
- We don't.
- Just met.

744
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:17,510
Yeah, so, but let's eat.

745
00:26:17,551 --> 00:26:19,219
<i>And that's how Lindsay</i>
<i>found herself</i>

746
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:22,640
<i>on a very awkward double date</i>
<i>with her brother.</i>

747
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,643
Is everybody's food as delicious
as my side salad?

748
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,812
<i>And a couple of glasses</i>
<i>of white wine in,</i>

749
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,564
<i>Rebel started to espouse</i>
<i>her liberal agenda.</i>

750
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:32,566
It's just a little hard to sit
two feet away from someone

751
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:35,194
who doesn't believe in paying
for a woman's contraception.

752
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:38,280
Well, to be fair, no,
he does pay for the room.

753
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:41,116
Is there anything better than
the great American scallop?

754
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:43,369
Look how he changes the subject.

755
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,705
Aren't you glad your teenager's
not here to see this?

756
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:47,122
You have a teenager?

757
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:49,291
I'm a movie prod...

758
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,210
Movie producer.

759
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:53,629
Producing a movie right now--
Rebel's in it

760
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:55,964
- for Imagine Entertainment.
- Oh!

761
00:26:56,006 --> 00:26:57,882
Is that Ron Howard's company?

762
00:26:57,924 --> 00:26:59,677
- Uh, yeah.
- Yes.

763
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:02,012
I don't want to be the one
to say it, but I hate that guy.

764
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,889
He's just another Hollywood
liberal big shot.

765
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:07,267
Oh. There are a lot of those
Ron Howards out there

766
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:08,853
that do abuse their power,

767
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,480
but I will tell you, sir,
that I do not do that.

768
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:15,359
Well, don't you have to have
power to abuse the power?

769
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,070
Um, I am not going to sit here
and defend Ron Howard

770
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:21,866
to someone who's never achieved
half of what he's achieved.

771
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,283
Are you saying that to him
or to me?

772
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:24,535
I forgot how touchy

773
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:26,119
these Hollywood people can be.

774
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:29,206
Oh, I'm not. I'm not.
Are you saying that I am?

775
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,708
Maybe Ron Howard is,
but I-I mean, I don't know.

776
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,917
But I'm not.
And I am also not

777
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,754
one of those Beverly Hills
billionaires

778
00:27:34,795 --> 00:27:36,296
who can't go two minutes without
putting his phone to his...

779
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:39,924
I got to take this.
Hold on one second. Hello?

780
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:42,511
Hey, George Michael.
You stuck in traffic, pal?

781
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:44,764
No, I just feel terrible
that we couldn't get together

782
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:46,682
the other night and, uh,
I miss you, you know.

783
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:48,726
But I'm free all night
if you wanted...

784
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,436
- Well... listen, I-I...<i>-But</i>
<i>Michael was still stinging...</i>

785
00:27:50,477 --> 00:27:52,312
I'm in the middle
of a film meeting...

786
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:54,022
<i>...over his son not making it</i>
<i>to the Ealing Club...</i>

787
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:57,025
I've got these people in
politics involved and I just...

788
00:27:57,067 --> 00:28:00,320
You know, I can't get away
this time, you know. Maybe...

789
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:03,532
<i>...even though Michael</i>
<i>had lied to him about it first.</i>

790
00:28:03,574 --> 00:28:04,949
You know, just,
I'm a super busy guy.

791
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:06,619
<i>- And back at the table...</i>
- So...

792
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,621
I can't believe that a woman
would support this guy.

793
00:28:08,662 --> 00:28:10,456
<i>...Lindsay found herself</i>
<i>torn...</i>

794
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:13,793
And I assume by being with him,
you just parrot his values.

795
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:16,128
<i>- ...between who she was</i>
<i>with...</i>-I don't appreciate you

796
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:17,421
saying that, okay?

797
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,256
I have my own values, Rebel,

798
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,592
and believe it or not, they're
closer to yours than you think.

799
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:23,260
<i>...and who she wanted to be.</i>

800
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,638
'Cause I do appreciate
you saying that.

801
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,390
But what do I know? I'm just
some shallow Hollywood...

802
00:28:28,432 --> 00:28:30,726
Oh, God, I've got to get this.

803
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:32,977
It could be my agent.
Hello?

804
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:35,355
Now that is one redhead

805
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,566
I do not want to have
sexual relations with.

806
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,779
- Well...
- So... are we having dessert?

807
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,572
- No.
- No. Uh-uh.

808
00:28:43,614 --> 00:28:45,157
Well, I don't want to be the one
to say it,

809
00:28:45,198 --> 00:28:47,033
but if we are not going
to have dessert,

810
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:50,036
- then I think I am going
to leave. -Oh, no.

811
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:52,665
But-but we're going to discuss
those new positions tonight.

812
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:54,750
Wasn't that the plan?

813
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:56,919
I think the best position for me
to be in tonight

814
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:58,671
is with my wife,

815
00:28:58,712 --> 00:29:01,089
and tomorrow I'm taking my wife
and children

816
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:04,176
to see the beautiful
American ocean.

817
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,643
<i>Lindsay started rethinking</i>
<i>her new life and that's when</i>

818
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:14,770
<i>she ran into the man</i>
<i>from her old one.</i>

819
00:29:14,812 --> 00:29:17,356
- Marky?
- Lindsay?

820
00:29:17,397 --> 00:29:18,941
- Oh, Lindsay.
- Marky.

821
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:21,902
I did it.
I beat the system.

822
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:23,278
I got out my way.

823
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,405
I thought my brother asked
Warden Gentles

824
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:27,658
- to get you out.
- No, I mean from the Dumpster.

825
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,368
You wouldn't believe the
scallops they're throwing

826
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:31,829
away here, but I got out
of that Dumpster my way.

827
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,747
I've really missed you.

828
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:36,458
Yeah, I missed you, too.

829
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,961
I feel like I really lost my way
for a while.

830
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:40,629
Me, too.
It's almost like

831
00:29:40,671 --> 00:29:43,883
maybe we shouldn't skip town
after this next one.

832
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:46,301
Next one? Another paint bomb?

833
00:29:46,343 --> 00:29:48,012
No, a real one.

834
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,973
On the Cinco de Cuatro,
Love's boat is going to...

835
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:53,684
- Sink-o.
- ...go into the... Yes, sink-o.

836
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,101
See, the coast guard is going
to be busy that night,

837
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:56,770
so after it's done, we slip away

838
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,940
and make our way down to Mexico
and reunite with Mom.

839
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:01,567
I just have to find a boat
that won't get chorizo

840
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:04,028
- caught in the propeller.
<i>- Lindsay was torn.</i>

841
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,071
<i>Her head was with Marky...</i>

842
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:08,824
<i>but it was Love who was close</i>
<i>to her heart.</i>

843
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:12,828
<i>So the next night at Cinco,</i>
<i>she felt she had no choice</i>

844
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,997
<i>- but to betray one</i>
- Herbert.

845
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,874
<i>- to protect the other.</i>
- Hi. Um, listen.

846
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:20,210
I'm here undercover because
I have some inside information

847
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:22,462
that you really need
to know about.

848
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,006
<i>But as it turned out,</i>
<i>Herbert had</i>

849
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:26,633
<i>some undercover information</i>
<i>for her, too.</i>

850
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:29,177
I cannot be under the covers
with you anymore.

851
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:30,930
It's over between us.

852
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:34,140
My wife found out and I told her
there was nothing emotional,

853
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:35,392
that you were just a prostitute.

854
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:38,186
- I'm not a prostitute.
- Oh, I know, I know.

855
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:39,772
The point is, we are through.

856
00:30:39,813 --> 00:30:41,023
Here's a little
severance package

857
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:42,733
for servicing my package.

858
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:45,569
<i>Lindsay tried to throw</i>
<i>the money in his face,</i>

859
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:48,488
<i>but she didn't have</i>
<i>the muscle memory for it.</i>

860
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:51,241
- She's keeping it.
- Oh, good.

861
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,910
And don't forget to vote.

862
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,411
This isn't over.

863
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:56,747
I'm not some taco
you can throw into the bay.

864
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:01,585
<i>- Lindsay wanted to get back</i>
- I can't do this.

865
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,087
<i>at Love...</i>

866
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,881
<i>but not by blowing him up</i>

867
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:09,426
<i>and heading to Mexico to be</i>
<i>with Marky's awful mother.</i>

868
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:14,014
<i>And that's when she ran into</i>
<i>her own awful mother.</i>

869
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:16,349
Mom. What are you doing here?

870
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:18,393
Lindsay.
I thought you were a hooker.

871
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,479
- Again.
- It's a wig.

872
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,022
No one recognizes me in it.

873
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:23,607
Oh, I recognized you.

874
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,317
Let me rephrase that
more kindly.

875
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:29,154
I hear you're hooking now
with Herbert Love.

876
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:30,823
- It's called hooking up.
- Oh.

877
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:32,950
And, yeah,
I got a little sidetracked,

878
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35,494
but I know who I am now.

879
00:31:35,535 --> 00:31:37,329
I'm back to being
severely liberal.

880
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,872
Well, like I said,

881
00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:40,624
the one time you were nice
enough to visit me,

882
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,459
you are who you are--

883
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,628
a blonde, waspy
Orange County princess

884
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,755
who doesn't care about anything
but herself

885
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:48,674
and that's okay.

886
00:31:48,715 --> 00:31:50,759
Ah, sarcasm.

887
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:55,180
No, I'm a Bluth
and so are you.

888
00:31:55,221 --> 00:31:57,933
You really know
how to twist the knife.

889
00:31:57,975 --> 00:32:00,226
But you are right about
one thing.

890
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:01,854
<i>Lindsay was done</i>
<i>pretending to be red.</i>

891
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:04,523
I don't need this anymore.

892
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:05,983
<i>And she decided the best way</i>
<i>to get back</i>

893
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:08,443
<i>at her mother</i>
<i>and Herbert Love</i>

894
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:11,237
<i>was by working</i>
<i>for their mutual rival.</i>

895
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,074
Lucille 2.
I've got great news.

896
00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:17,369
I'm finally available to become
your campaign manager.

897
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,038
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

898
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,415
But I found someone
more qualified than you.

899
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:23,917
Hello, Lindsay.

900
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,294
Sally.

901
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:27,713
<i>It was Sally Sitwell, a woman</i>

902
00:32:27,754 --> 00:32:28,964
<i>who'd long been</i>
<i>Lindsay's rival.</i>

903
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:31,299
- It's been a while.
- Mm.

904
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:33,593
How is she more qualified
than me?

905
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:35,137
She has integrity.

906
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:36,346
And look at this hair.

907
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,140
Look at this beautiful,
long hair.

908
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:41,560
I made you a banner.

909
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,353
Look, I can really help
this campaign.

910
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,731
You already have,
more than you know.

911
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:49,401
- Now, give her a little
show-and-tell. -Mm.

912
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:50,652
Show-and-tell?

913
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:52,779
Oh, she just means
these photos

914
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:55,824
of Herbert Love
with a mystery redhead

915
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:57,492
he's cheating on his wife with.

916
00:32:57,534 --> 00:32:59,078
Who took these?

917
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,829
The first two were taken
by the security camera

918
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:02,998
in the Albertsons parking lot.

919
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,085
And the third was left in the
photo booth at the Ealing Club.

920
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:08,962
- God, that was a photo booth?
- Mm-hmm.

921
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:11,339
No one can know about this.

922
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:13,299
Oh, I'm afraid
they're going to.

923
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:16,678
Lucille has copies-- she wants
to go viral with this.

924
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,097
Herbert Love with his hooker?

925
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:20,099
She'll win for sure.

926
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,600
I can't let her do that.

927
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:24,770
I don't think you can stop her.

928
00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:26,855
Anyway, it was so great
running into you again.

929
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:28,690
- Mwah!
<i>- Lindsay was horrified</i>

930
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:30,817
<i>that the world would view her</i>

931
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,485
<i>- as Love's prostitute.</i>
- Vote for Love. Vote for Love.

932
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:34,320
<i>And then Lindsay ran into</i>
<i>someone else</i>

933
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:35,989
<i>- who was looking for Love.</i>
- David. -Who are you?

934
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:37,199
I'm Cindy Featherbottom.

935
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:38,825
I've been looking for you.

936
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:40,827
Love's gone missing
and I've got to find someone

937
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:43,496
to jump onto that stage
and to show everyone here

938
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:46,917
that we are the party
that has complete con-con...

939
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,752
Complete con-con-con...

940
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:50,295
- con-con... Complete...
- ...trol?

941
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,880
Giant. ...trol.

942
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:54,049
<i>And that's when Lindsay</i>
<i>found an opportunity...</i>

943
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:56,468
- I'll do it.
<i>- to put a spin on the looming</i>

944
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:58,137
<i>- photos scandal.</i>-Oh, my God,
thank you, thank you.

945
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,264
And I'm so sorry about
that giant crack earlier.

946
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:04,601
Okay, raise the mics, everybody!
New speaker!

947
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,103
<i>So, like many before her,</i>

948
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:09,022
<i>Lindsay would accuse</i>
<i>Herbert Love...</i>

949
00:34:09,064 --> 00:34:10,690
Can I have everyone's attention?

950
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:13,318
<i>...of sexual harassment.</i>

951
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,113
I am Herbert Love's
"key advisor."

952
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,866
Uh, thank you, but...

953
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:21,493
<i>But first she had to turn</i>
<i>his supporters against him.</i>

954
00:34:21,534 --> 00:34:23,578
Listen, I have a few things
I'd like to tell you

955
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,289
about Herbert Love.

956
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,083
Love wants to put up a wall.

957
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,751
No, no.

958
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:32,254
I mean, not just any wall.

959
00:34:32,296 --> 00:34:35,799
A wall to keep out the Mexicans.

960
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:40,179
Oh, wow,
what a great crowd, uh...

961
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,429
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>the blowback began.</i>

962
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:44,016
Checkmate!

963
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:46,268
But no, you don't understand.

964
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,312
He wants to separate...

965
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,063
Oh!

966
00:34:50,105 --> 00:34:52,649
<i>- Viva Méjico.</i>
- That's my necklace.

967
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,697
What-what's going on?

968
00:34:58,738 --> 00:35:01,033
The marauders, lady,
a bunch of young Mexicans--

969
00:35:01,074 --> 00:35:02,242
they're taking over
Cinco de Cuatro.

970
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:04,036
They don't find it funny
anymore.

971
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:07,372
But that was my necklace.
I mean... God.

972
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:10,416
They don't belong here,
we belong here.

973
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:17,382
I mean,
someone should put up a wall.

974
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:19,009
<i>But that's when Lindsay</i>
<i>found herself</i>

975
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:20,552
<i>- saying this...</i>
- Yeah.

976
00:35:20,593 --> 00:35:22,679
We should put up a wall.

977
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:26,308
Put up this wall.

978
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,602
Put... up... this wall.

979
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:33,398
Put up this wall!

980
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,608
<i>...which was originally</i>
<i>her mother's idea.</i>

981
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,904
<i>Although it was horrible news</i>
<i>for her father.</i>

982
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:41,073
- Put up this wall!
<i>- And that's when Lindsay</i>

983
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:43,116
<i>found out who she really was.</i>

984
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:48,247
My name is Lindsay Bluth,
and this is who I am.

985
00:35:48,288 --> 00:35:50,665
<i>A Bluth, just like her mother.</i>

986
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:53,418
She's a game changer.

987
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,051
<i>Herbert Love is discovered</i>
<i>in a coma.</i>

988
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:03,011
They think it happened
during the blowback.

989
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:04,930
They found him behind
the Kick a Goat.

990
00:36:04,971 --> 00:36:08,100
The doctors say he may come out
of it in a week to ten years.

991
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:09,684
So I have one question for you.

992
00:36:09,726 --> 00:36:11,477
- Would you consider...
- Yes.

993
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,521
- Would you consider... -Yes.

994
00:36:13,563 --> 00:36:15,315
- Would you consider...
- Yes.

995
00:36:15,357 --> 00:36:17,442
Would you consider running
in his place?

996
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:20,320
- Yes.
- Fantastic.

997
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:22,114
Sweetheart,
could you work his thumb?

998
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:24,574
<i>And she even gets</i>
<i>Herbert's endorsement.</i>

999
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,243
<i>And Annyong tries to stick</i>

1000
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:28,494
<i>the Bluth family</i>
<i>for a tomato juice</i>

1001
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:30,663
<i>that costs him $700</i>

1002
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:33,250
<i>and ultimately his freedom.</i>

1003
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,085
<i>Good-bye, Annyong.</i>

1004
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:41,948
