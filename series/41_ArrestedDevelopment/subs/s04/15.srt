1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,049
George Michael was
playing a game of lie tag

2
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,051
- with his father.
- Wait, I bet we're sitting

3
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:15,886
in the exact same traffic.

4
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:18,388
God, I just hope there
are no kids on that plane.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,016
500 bucks they find a dead kid...

6
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:22,392
Currently each claimed
to be stuck in traffic

7
00:00:22,434 --> 00:00:25,313
behind a light aircraft
that had landed on the 605.

8
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:27,731
Loving that kid too much and
letting him fly the plane.

9
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:29,358
And... and you know what? One more thing.

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,443
I think I accidentally had
the phone flipped around.

11
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:34,197
I recorded my face the
whole time, you know?

12
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:35,781
Smartphone, stupid man.

13
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:37,658
Pal, why don't you loop
around and film this thing.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,118
Someone's got to tell the story.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,369
Michael hung up feeling confident

16
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:42,872
he'd had the last word.

17
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:45,333
Kidding me?

18
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:47,084
Missed you again, damn.

19
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:49,086
But, you know, I got out of my car here,

20
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:51,172
and I'm, uh, standing
here now with a paramedic

21
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:52,422
named Tim Ridge... Ridgley...

22
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:53,966
Can I record some video over there?

23
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,718
- No cameras allowed.
- No camera...

24
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,511
They're being real tight-assed
about this camera thing.

25
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,222
But George Michael was
proving more adept at lying

26
00:00:59,263 --> 00:01:00,681
than anyone suspected.

27
00:01:00,723 --> 00:01:02,183
Getting back in my car now.

28
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:03,893
You know, thank God we
weren't on that plane.

29
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:06,354
Which would come in handy with a woman

30
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:09,732
who only knew him as George Maharis.

31
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:12,860
- Hey.
- Hey.

32
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:15,404
Hey, sorry, that was my dad.

33
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:17,365
He can be kind of hard to
get off the phone sometimes.

34
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:19,408
Tell me about it. At least he wasn't drunk

35
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:23,120
and bitching about Don Ameche
not knowing his lines inCocoon.

36
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:24,747
He... he's actually great.

37
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:27,083
If anything, I've been
kind of a lousy son lately,

38
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:29,293
but, you know, it's just...
I mean, at some point,

39
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,087
I've got to start living my life.

40
00:01:31,128 --> 00:01:33,421
No, I know. I mean, my dad is
the nicest guy in the world,

41
00:01:33,463 --> 00:01:35,216
but he just doesn't get it.

42
00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:36,717
I have to live my life my way.

43
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,426
It's like he's always checking up on me.

44
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:39,970
- Does yours do that?
- Yeah, no, once in a while.

45
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,429
You want to go in here?

46
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:43,724
Yeah, okay.

47
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:46,894
- Ron.
- Hey.

48
00:01:46,936 --> 00:01:49,230
No, no, it's Michael. Michael Bluth...

49
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:51,565
doing the film about my family and...

50
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:53,567
Yeah, when are we gonna get
your kid's signature though?

51
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:54,944
- I'm working on it.
- Oh.

52
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:56,320
- And I... I got a hold of him.
- Oh, oh.

53
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:57,738
And we're gonna meet here tonight,

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,240
but I think that he's blowing me off.

55
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:01,284
Well, yeah, kids will be kids, right?

56
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,993
Well, you know, a month ago,

57
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,912
I would've told you that he
and I were exactly the same,

58
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:06,080
that we were twins, you know?

59
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:08,124
But now, I wouldn't even think of

60
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:09,875
my son as my brother.

61
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,752
Although, in fairness,

62
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:15,798
this is something a Bluth brother would do.

63
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,466
Now the story of a family

64
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:20,010
whose future was abruptly cancelled

65
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:22,346
and the one son who had no choice

66
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:24,640
but to keep himself together.

67
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:31,521
It's George Michael's Arrested Development.

68
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:36,485
George Michael was a new man.

69
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,362
He had finally cast off the shackles

70
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:41,073
of his cautious persona,
Come on, man, throw it.

71
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:44,868
And he was ready to play with the big boys.

72
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,120
- Okay, I'm good!
- You all right?

73
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:47,163
That's it for me.

74
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:48,247
You guys keep playing.

75
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:52,251
Oh, too funny.

76
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:53,794
Oh!

77
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:55,921
But later, at the student health center,

78
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:59,383
he was reminded of the man
who'd always supported him...

79
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,509
Who would you like us to
call in case of an emergency?

80
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:04,388
And who he'd now twice hurt.

81
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,140
My dad.

82
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:09,226
And that night, Michael,
trying to impress Rebel

83
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,687
by being a down-to-earth rich guy...

84
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,814
although by doing so, he was neither...

85
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:15,899
Beverly Hills billionaires
who can't go two minutes

86
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,818
- without putting his phone...
- Got this call.

87
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,403
I got to take this. Hold
on one second. Hello.

88
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:20,779
Hey, George Michael.

89
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,614
You stuck in traffic, pal?

90
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,783
You know, I just feel terrible
that we couldn't get together

91
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,618
the other night, and,
uh, I miss you, you know.

92
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,329
But I'm free all night if...

93
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:31,374
But Michael hadn't forgiven George Michael.

94
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:33,334
People in politics involved and I just...

95
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,294
You know, I can't get away this time.

96
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:40,383
It seemed the two men were
growing less alike every day.

97
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:42,926
And although George Michael felt guilty,

98
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,761
- George Maharis was already
- Oh, God, I've got to get this.

99
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:47,473
Planning his evening
with, as it turned out,

100
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:51,935
someone who had also just
been put off by his father.

101
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,063
Hi, Rebel, it's George Mi... haris.

102
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:56,773
My night just freed up, and I
was wondering if you wanted...

103
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:58,734
I thought you were having
dinner with your dad.

104
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:01,487
Well, you know older guys...
the night ends for them at 8:00.

105
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:03,739
I think I could use a
break from the old guys.

106
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,491
And I've already got
some birth control in me

107
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:06,742
that I paid for myself,

108
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:08,869
and I'd hate to let it go to waste.

109
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:10,454
Well, that's perfect,

110
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:13,332
because I'm not quite
ready to have children.

111
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,044
So, as he straightened up his room,

112
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,295
he got this call.

113
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:20,130
- Hey, Dad.
- George Michael, hey.

114
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,465
Got out of it.

115
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:23,842
I just... I made a ton of people angry,

116
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:25,802
but you know what I always say: family...

117
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:28,805
Well, aw, gosh, you know, I
really wanted to, uh, do that,

118
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:31,641
but I just had this work thing come up.

119
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:33,143
And, uh, it's like you always say:

120
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,312
family first, unless there's a work thing,

121
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:37,314
and then work first.

122
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:39,316
I have said that, too.

123
00:04:39,358 --> 00:04:41,818
- Uh, so another time.
- Okay.

124
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,488
But he had another problem
he had to deal with.

125
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,574
- P-Hound.
- Hey, George Michael.

126
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:48,158
- Hey.
- Look, I got us a peace pizza.

127
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,368
Oh, that's great... hey, you've got to go.

128
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,911
What did you do with my stuff?

129
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:52,662
- I've just got a girl coming over and...
- Maeby?

130
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:54,457
It's not Maeby, no. But,
um, could you please leave?

131
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:56,208
Okay, first you "F" me with Fakeblock,

132
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,834
and then you're gonna kick me out

133
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:59,336
when you have a hottie coming over?

134
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:00,712
- I have roommate rights.
- Well, you know what?

135
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:02,756
You voided your rights when you took

136
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:04,425
this picture of Maeby brushing her teeth.

137
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,343
- Not against the rules.
- Still a little weird,

138
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:07,511
- don't you think?
- But not against the rules.

139
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:08,554
- Well...
- You know what?

140
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:10,306
This is no longer a peace pizza.

141
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,848
- That is a war pizza.
- Okay, that's fine.

142
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,725
Do you want to take it back or... ?

143
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,103
No, I already ate. Th... that's for you.

144
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:17,687
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

145
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:19,482
Enjoy your war pizza!

146
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:22,943
The pizza hadn't even
cooled before Rebel arrived.

147
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:25,195
- Hi.
- Hey.

148
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:26,863
Oh, so this is a dorm.

149
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:28,073
This is a dorm.

150
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:31,243
Well, I suppose anything goes in a dorm.

151
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:34,204
You got that right.

152
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,624
Although, we should probably go inside,

153
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:38,000
because they don't like us

154
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,376
hanging out in the hallways, actually.

155
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,587
- Oh.
- Yeah.

156
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:47,551
George Michael had just
officially gotten over Maeby.

157
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:50,095
Thanks for, uh, keeping it down for my R.A.

158
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:51,805
You were keeping it down, right?

159
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:54,141
You know what really
impresses me about you?

160
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:56,018
How little you try to impress me.

161
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:59,062
Well, I aim to not please.

162
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:02,608
I just came from a dinner
with this right-wing politician

163
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,568
and his date, who was an actual hooker.

164
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,987
Oh, my God, they sound
like terrible people.

165
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:08,822
- Oh, they were.
- Huh.

166
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:11,116
So, wait, is this where
you conceived Fakeblock?

167
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:13,243
It was George Michael's first chance

168
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,704
to truly be unpretentious
and undo the big lie.

169
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,748
On the other hand, she thought

170
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,293
he was an unpretentious software genius.

171
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:25,464
If she were to learn that he
was merely a wood block player

172
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:28,133
with a heightened ability
to track the passage of time,

173
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:29,677
perhaps she would rightly feel

174
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:32,513
lack of pretention should be a given.

175
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:36,684
It was after second 23 that he said...

176
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:39,687
24. Yes, it was, uh, right in here.

177
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:41,313
- Wow.
- Yeah.

178
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:43,399
This is like making love
with the Wright brothers

179
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,108
in their bicycle shop.

180
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,027
I'm sure she just meant one of them.

181
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:49,112
Hey, how about her knowing
they had a bicycle shop?

182
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,864
Just a little token...

183
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:53,283
The next morning, he walked her to her car.

184
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:56,579
Listen, I got to go shoot a PSA.

185
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,996
I'll text you from the car.

186
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:59,915
Oh, no, don't... don't do...

187
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:01,458
- Action.
- Tweet and drive.

188
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,835
Yeah, that was good, but it's "text."

189
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:05,588
And we need the word "don't."

190
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,590
And upon returning to his dorm,

191
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:11,134
he discovered that P-Hound had
officially filed a grievance

192
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:12,678
with the student housing office.

193
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,055
So P-Hound claims that George Michael...

194
00:07:15,097 --> 00:07:17,140
Make a note of that; that's one person.

195
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:18,225
Oh, I know, I know.

196
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:19,809
Messed with his stuff

197
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:21,770
and stole some software thing?

198
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:23,772
Yeah, and, uh, George Michael claims

199
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,649
that nobody can live with P-Hound.

200
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:27,443
Somebody's got to go.

201
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:28,777
O... okay, it's time for a vote.

202
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:30,446
We'll each get one vote.

203
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,322
Oh, well, that doesn't really seem fair,

204
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,116
because you guys are obviously
gonna vote for the same person.

205
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,702
Oh, right, yeah, 'cause, uh, we're twins,

206
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:39,079
and, uh, we have no sense
of ourselves as individuals.

207
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:40,080
That's right.

208
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:41,248
Fine.

209
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,125
We'll each get a half vote.

210
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,210
And the four men cast their three votes.

211
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:47,045
It's a tie.

212
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:49,506
Uh, one and a half to one and a half.

213
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:51,425
The twins were proud to show that they

214
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:52,926
voted differently from one another.

215
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:56,012
Eh, we're gonna need a tiebreaker, ugly.

216
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:58,181
Fortunately, they were able to bring in

217
00:07:58,223 --> 00:07:59,642
two more half voters...

218
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:01,769
- It's a tie. Two to two.
- ... who also proved

219
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,520
they were capable of
having opposite opinions.

220
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:05,230
Double tie!

221
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:06,898
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah! Whoo!

222
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,942
To break the tie, more members of twin club

223
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:10,235
joined the electorate...

224
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:12,237
a quadruple tie!

225
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,947
Which also jammed up the works.

226
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:16,366
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Go, yeah.

227
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:19,035
Maybe we should just bring
in a single person now.

228
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:21,913
Uh, you mean like n... not a twin?

229
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:23,332
Yeah, just to speed things along a little.

230
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:25,083
And perhaps it was that comment...

231
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,752
I guess one head's better
than two, huh? Twin hater.

232
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,462
We've been dealing with
"twincists" like you

233
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:30,714
all our lives.

234
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:33,592
That united the voting body
into a greater cause than

235
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:34,926
expressing their individuality.

236
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:37,095
And with the exception

237
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:38,514
of George Michael's vote...

238
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:39,973
P-Hound.

239
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:43,352
George Michael. George
Michael. George Michael.

240
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:44,520
George Michael. George Michael.

241
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,896
- ... and one other curiosity...
- George Michael.

242
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:49,191
Bender fromFuturama.

243
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:50,776
I almost wrote that.

244
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:52,068
It was a George Michael blitz.

245
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,862
George Michael and...

246
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:56,948
oh, a half vote for "George
Michael the twincist."

247
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,992
See you later, twin hater.

248
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,369
- No, I'm not...
- Uh, uh.

249
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,663
Shh. Go.

250
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:05,081
And now wishing he'd
actually packed the bag

251
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:07,543
- I... Shh.
- George Michael aimlessly

252
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:09,586
headed out onto the campus
where, as fate would have it,

253
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:12,047
- Oh!
- He ran into his beeping uncle.

254
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:13,423
What are you doing here?

255
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,175
I was in the neighborhood.

256
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,636
I happened to remember
how much you love bologna.

257
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:19,596
- Huh?
- So, yeah, I just...
I found this great shop-rite

258
00:09:19,638 --> 00:09:21,348
and I just thought, you
know who's got to have

259
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,517
a taste of this, is young George Michael.

260
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,352
He didn't think George
Michael liked bologna.

261
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:27,187
I know how you love bologna.

262
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:29,981
He was trying to correct
a bad impression he felt

263
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:32,651
he might have made with his
nephew a few nights earlier.

264
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:33,736
We're good.

265
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:35,404
My God, Uncle Gob, what is this?

266
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:36,613
Can't lie to you, George Michael,

267
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:37,906
it's a forget-me-now.

268
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:40,868
I wanted you to forget what happened

269
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:43,370
at that magic club; I was embarrassed.

270
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:47,165
If you don't want me to tell
anyone about it, I won't.

271
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,333
I'm such a fool.

272
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,502
I go to those things too quickly.

273
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:52,337
Really, it's just the
age we live in, isn't it?

274
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,840
Take a pill to forget your problems.

275
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:56,633
Take a pill to go to sleep.

276
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:58,844
And take a pill to forget your problems.

277
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:00,429
Need an erection, take a pill.

278
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,097
Need to forget your problems, take a pill.

279
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:04,307
Take a pill and your
problems are forgotten.

280
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:05,392
Just take a pill.

281
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:06,518
What an age we live in.

282
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,728
It's great, isn't it?

283
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,272
What's with the suitcase?

284
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:12,274
I got kicked out of my dorm.

285
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:15,068
That was a freebie.

286
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,695
You in the market to buy a house?

287
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:18,196
It's a great time to buy.

288
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:19,615
Oh, I don't want to buy a house.

289
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,032
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Money?

290
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:22,325
Ninja please.

291
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:23,702
You don't need money.

292
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:25,078
With that Fakeblock thing you got going

293
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,329
and your great credit rating,

294
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:27,956
we can put you in a Bluth in no time.

295
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:30,375
Frankly, it wasn't the kind of risk

296
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,210
George Michael would take.

297
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:35,046
But then Gob said something
that changed his mind.

298
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:36,840
Plus, it would make your dad proud.

299
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:39,468
I know that he's still
really disappointed about

300
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:40,844
you, uh...

301
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:42,137
What, that I blew him off?

302
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:43,931
Blew him off.

303
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:45,974
Boy, is he disappointed about that.

304
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:47,225
I would love to say yes...

305
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,184
Yes! There it is!

306
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,353
I got my much vaunted yes!

307
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:51,688
Gob felt good.

308
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,482
He would be able to prove

309
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:56,777
to his brother that he
could actually sell a house.

310
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:59,070
George Michael felt good
because he could prove

311
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:01,448
to his father that he
did indeed support him.

312
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,534
And the residents of
Sudden Valley felt good,

313
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,245
because it turns out,
the very young-looking man

314
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:09,122
- who drove down their street
- Hi.

315
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:11,249
- That afternoon...
- Oh, hello, young man.
- Hi.

316
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,793
How young are you?

317
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:14,169
I'm good. How you doing?

318
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,504
No, how young are you?

319
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:17,631
Oh, I... I'm 22. 22 years...

320
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:19,132
- ... was over 21,
- 22? You look 16.

321
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:20,634
And they wouldn't have to search

322
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:22,344
for a home that was even more remote.

323
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:26,306
He's 22! He's 22, but looks 16.

324
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,935
Sudden Valley residents

325
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:31,979
wasted no time in welcoming George Michael

326
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:33,396
- Just wanted to welcome you
- To the community

327
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:35,148
- to the neighborhood.
- Every chance they got.

328
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,776
Thank you. Uh... Hi.
Hello again. Welcome back.

329
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:39,695
Hi. Hi.

330
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,488
Oh, it's so nice. Wow.

331
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,948
Like it's my birthday.

332
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,700
It's like it's everyone's birthday.

333
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:46,075
Oh, this is...

334
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:48,578
I wonder who this is from.

335
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,747
- We said no clothes, Carlos.
- Hat is not clothes.

336
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,165
- A hat is clothes.
- Gosh, I wish

337
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:53,792
I had something to offer you guys.

338
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,377
You know, here you are, guests in my home,

339
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:57,086
and you've gotten me these beautiful gifts.

340
00:11:57,128 --> 00:12:00,047
You know, feels like it
should be the other way around.

341
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:02,885
Football!

342
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,469
Hut, hut.

343
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:05,804
Carlos...

344
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:06,889
Carlos, you're on my team.

345
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,181
You're on my team.

346
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:10,017
The play is dead. The play is dead.

347
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,977
The ball touched the ground.

348
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,812
Come on. The play is dead.

349
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:15,772
Carlos, man, we're on the same team.

350
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:18,149
Guys, maybe... maybe we
can't play skins versus skins.

351
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,609
Tops versus bottoms?

352
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,319
I got to bring my girlfriend up here.

353
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:22,821
- She's gonna love it.
- Let's throw her a party,

354
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:24,948
Sudden Valley style.

355
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:28,827
That actually sounds... Yeah, fun.

356
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:31,955
And so George Michael
was proud to invite Rebel

357
00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:36,001
to see how successful
George Maharis had become

358
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:38,294
and how many people were
eager to be in his company.

359
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:41,214
No, I'm fine, I'm fine. He
was tickling me in there.

360
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:43,592
- Hey, um, what... what is all this?
- Hey. Just a little surprise.

361
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:45,010
- You did this for me?
- Yes.
- But Rebel had

362
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:47,012
- other concerns.
- We need to talk.

363
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:49,973
Ooh.

364
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:51,182
This is it.

365
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,851
This is the place.

366
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:55,478
Hope you don't find it too pretentious.

367
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,899
Well, what happened to the
old anything goes in the dorm?

368
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:00,191
Well, I got this place instead.

369
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,777
You know, I guess I wanted to impress you.

370
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:03,737
I'm gonna get some furniture, obviously.

371
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,655
- Right.
- The guys from home fill are coming this week.

372
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,114
That's not the problem.

373
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,992
No, that's not the problem.

374
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:11,118
Wrong house, buddy.

375
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,287
No, this is my son,

376
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:13,747
Lem Depardieu.

377
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:15,248
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

378
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,750
Jacqueline still in the car?

379
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,251
Oh, you have a son?

380
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:19,878
Yeah.

381
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,671
- Hey, Lem. How you doing?
- Hi.

382
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,048
I love kids. I'm great...
You want a Twister?

383
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,173
I was just given, like, four Twisters.

384
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:25,759
- You should take one.
- Wow.

385
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:27,719
- Go on, take a Twister.
- Oh. You know what, honey?

386
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,513
Do you want to give Mommy some
alone time with her friend?

387
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:33,058
Maybe he could go play in the pool.

388
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,060
- Yeah.
- He'll be totally safe. There's
like 100 guys out there.

389
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:36,227
- Yay!
- Make sure you wear your sunblock.

390
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:37,604
In fact, it was the folks

391
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:39,146
in the pool who were more at risk

392
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:41,858
of being near Lem than he was of them.

393
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:50,075
And perhaps that's what led Gob

394
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:52,702
to having to take out another ad.

395
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:55,914
Wow, what a great kid.

396
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:57,332
You know, when I said I was

397
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:58,959
not eager to have kids,

398
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,086
but I think it's great that you have a son.

399
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:02,838
You know, I have a spare room here

400
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,255
that the two of you could stay in.

401
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:05,674
Or maybe you could just stay in it.

402
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:07,134
He doesn't live with me.

403
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:09,136
He lives in France with his father.

404
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:11,763
He just visits March and April
during French pilot season,

405
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,598
but that's what I'm talking about.

406
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,642
I just don't want to get that serious.

407
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:17,560
Because you're seeing someone else?

408
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:19,228
No. I mean, yes.

409
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,856
I'm seeing someone else, but I don't want

410
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:22,107
to get serious with him, either,

411
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:23,692
and you're out telling people

412
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:24,776
in the neighborhood

413
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:26,111
that we're seeing each other.

414
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:27,195
What happened to the guy

415
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:28,571
who founded Fakeblock?

416
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:29,948
The guy who keeps things anonymous?

417
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,324
I can do anonymous.

418
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:32,784
You know, I'm all about staying anonymous.

419
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:34,703
That's Fakeblock's mission statement.

420
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:37,039
And then you're asking Lem
and me to move into this house,

421
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,124
and it just, it seems all backwards.

422
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,127
Sorry.

423
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:46,297
Maybe it is backwards.

424
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,134
George Michael shared
his relationship problem

425
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:51,469
with the one other woman

426
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:53,388
he'd had a relationship problem with.

427
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,015
Well, she's not really my girlfriend.

428
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,100
I mean, I'm crazy about her,

429
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:58,977
but she wants to keep things anonymous,

430
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,937
- and I don't know how to do that.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

431
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:02,689
- Right.
- You haven't told her your
real name yet, have you?

432
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:04,107
What? No, no.

433
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:05,984
No, she still thinks I'm George Maharis,

434
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:08,695
but she's dating another
guy, which is probably

435
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:11,614
the whole reason she's always
saying I'm moving too fast.

436
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:13,533
I take things too seriously.

437
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:16,161
I take things too serious.

438
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:17,537
I take things too seriously.

439
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:18,872
I need to note which
one of those is correct,

440
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,749
because I sound like a horse's ass

441
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,667
when I alternate between the two of them.

442
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,293
I need to get my together.

443
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:26,504
- Yeah.
- But the point is that I take things

444
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:29,007
easily-breezily.

445
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:30,926
Well, a real "serioush" woman

446
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,595
knows what she wants and moves quickly.

447
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:35,805
"Serioush" is nothing. That's not a word.

448
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,265
Are you ready to see your office?

449
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:38,433
I have been; it's great.

450
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,684
I like it a lot. It...

451
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:41,644
I wonder if she's gonna think

452
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:43,146
we've been a little lavish with money.

453
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:44,439
You know, is it too much?

454
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,481
But then to contradict myself,

455
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:46,733
I do think at some point,

456
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:48,568
it would be good to get a second chair

457
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,112
just in case we have a guest,
but I'm thinking big picture.

458
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:51,320
Of course, that wasn't his office.

459
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:53,281
This isn't your office.

460
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:55,033
She's over here.

461
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:57,911
And it was at his actual desk

462
00:15:57,953 --> 00:16:00,622
where he made his first
major decision as CEO.

463
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:04,167
Maeby, you're fired!

464
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:05,460
And although Mort was prepared

465
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:07,378
to be handed his walking papers,

466
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,422
there was nothing that could
have prepared George Michael

467
00:16:09,464 --> 00:16:13,093
for what Mort would leave on his desk.

468
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:14,928
And so, later that day, Hey. Hey.

469
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,139
It was a disgruntled Maeby
that ran into Michael-Hey.

470
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,682
As he was seeking a
signature for his movie.

471
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:22,351
I think movies are dead.
Maybe it's a TV show.

472
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:24,020
What? No. This girl that I'm dating, Rebel,

473
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:26,397
she's gonna be in it,
and she would never do TV.

474
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,483
You're dating Rebel Alley?

475
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:32,070
Yeah. I have a picture of us
to prove it; I can't find it,

476
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:33,696
- but yeah.
- So...

477
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:35,031
you're the other guy.

478
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:36,532
You know her personally?

479
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:37,993
Yes. I mean,

480
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,911
that's how I know that you were dating her.

481
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:41,955
Do you know the other
guy that she's dating?

482
00:16:41,997 --> 00:16:44,624
And that's when she saw an opportunity

483
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,168
to get back at George Michael.

484
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,170
No, no, but, um,

485
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:49,462
I know it's over.

486
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:50,797
She is dumping him.

487
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,090
She dumping him?

488
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:53,842
Apparently, he was coming on too strong,

489
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,468
taking it too seriously.

490
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,678
She hates that.

491
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,054
- Is that what she said?
- Yeah,

492
00:16:58,096 --> 00:16:59,181
that's what she told me.

493
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:00,389
Just kills it for her.

494
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,766
She wants it easily-breezily.

495
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:05,270
Well, that's... informative.

496
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:07,189
I owe you. Thank you.

497
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,397
No, you don't.

498
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:09,816
Okay, wait,

499
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,400
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't knock, just...

500
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:13,195
- Okay.
- One second.

501
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,071
Mm-hmm.

502
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,658
And so fortified

503
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,827
with Maeby's information that Rebel

504
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,704
- was breaking up with her other beau...
- Hello.

505
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:24,039
- Michael.
- Michael decided

506
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,165
- to move things along.
- I want you

507
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:26,582
to know that I think that

508
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:27,917
I've been coming on a
little bit too strong.

509
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,211
I got a lot going on; I got the movie.

510
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:30,920
You know, a bunch of stuff

511
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,797
with the housing complex, and I'm just...

512
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,049
I'm not gonna be pressuring you anymore.

513
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,884
I want to just keep it easy-peasy.

514
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:37,093
- Yeah.
- Cool, totally.

515
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:38,636
- Keep it loose.
- Yeah.

516
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:40,347
And we'll have some fun with, you know...

517
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:42,515
If the fun, you know...

518
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:44,684
Someday, one day, it gets more serious,

519
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:47,187
you know, then, uh, then it does,

520
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:48,646
and we, uh,

521
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:51,233
we're walking down the
aisle, you know, and...

522
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:53,318
I'm saying it wrong, saying
it wrong, 'cause I get,

523
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,195
uh, I get tongue-tied, um...

524
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:57,572
uh, because I think that you

525
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:00,575
are coming on too strong.

526
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:03,036
- You know? Bugging me.
- Oh, uh,

527
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:04,495
you want to come in?

528
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:06,956
No.

529
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:09,834
- Ooh.
- Yeah? Yeah.

530
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,295
It was the best sex Michael had ever had.

531
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:13,922
That was great.

532
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:15,965
Was that fun for you?

533
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,092
No.

534
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:20,095
Are you gonna take a photo of me?

535
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:22,222
Uh, no.

536
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:24,974
No, no, I've been trying to get a signal.

537
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,851
But he did want a picture of them together,

538
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:29,312
which I why he grabbed the one

539
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:31,022
he saw from the photo booth.

540
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:32,232
Are you gonna call me?

541
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:33,775
If I'm in traffic.

542
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,777
Although he was growing concerned

543
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:38,280
about how he was going to keep this up.

544
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:40,740
Hey.

545
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:42,909
♪ I just stole this fair young miss ♪

546
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:44,744
♪ From a big shot, George Mahar... ♪

547
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:58,216
Michael had just found out

548
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:00,051
That the woman he loved

549
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:02,637
was also dating his son.

550
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:04,472
So, after placing a call

551
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:06,308
- to the niece who sent him there...
- Hello?

552
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:07,600
You're out of the movie.

553
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:11,896
And at an emotional impasse,

554
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:13,606
he decided it was time

555
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:15,191
to deal with Gob

556
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,818
and the Sudden Valley problem.

557
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,861
Pervert.

558
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:21,197
Excuse me?

559
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:24,200
And that's when Michael
ran into a son-Dad, hey.

560
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:26,535
George Michael, what are you doing here?

561
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:28,037
Who was eager to make him proud.

562
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,705
I... I'm home.

563
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:33,209
But George Michael had
suddenly found himself

564
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:34,919
- with enormous debt
- You bought this house?

565
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:37,839
- And tried to hide his panic.
- Why would you buy

566
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,341
one of these pieces of sh...

567
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:42,218
short-term investments?

568
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,220
Well, you know, Gob told me that you wanted

569
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:46,222
to start selling these
things, not just renting them,

570
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:48,433
and I knew it was important to you.

571
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:49,934
He said all that, huh? Oh, boy, that was...

572
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:51,478
That's... nice of him.

573
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,229
How... how could you afford
one of these houses, buddy.

574
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:54,814
Well, I have a lot of money coming in

575
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:56,691
- from investors for my software thing...
- Okay.

576
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:59,152
And I don't know what's gonna
happen with that, so I thought

577
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:01,154
I'd do what everyone around
here says: put it into Bluth.

578
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:03,490
- Yeah, who else is saying that?
- You know, it's an expression.

579
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:05,283
- Neighbors.
- I don't like it.

580
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:06,493
- Can I offer you anything?
- No.

581
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:07,576
I just got two more boxes

582
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:08,995
of Twister from the neighbors.

583
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:10,913
- Oh, boy, return them.
- Feel like I have one

584
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:13,333
for every day of the week now.
Anyway, you know, I figure that

585
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,293
worse case scenario is I
sell this place, and I get

586
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:16,794
my money back. It's not like

587
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:18,254
- they're going down in value, right?
- Well...

588
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:19,881
It's a great community.

589
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:21,508
- Nobody locks their doors around here.
- You should.

590
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:23,968
Plus, I... I wanted to make it up to you.

591
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,636
You know, I felt terrible

592
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:27,972
about what happened with the dorm and...

593
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:29,598
- Wow.
- And things between us.

594
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,394
And I... I've screwed up a lot of things

595
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:34,270
in the past few weeks,

596
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:36,564
and, you know, this is the one thing

597
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:38,816
that I know I did right.

598
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:41,361
I mean, who would not want
to raise their kids here?

599
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:44,280
And perhaps this is why he
didn't give him the bad news

600
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:45,781
about the neighborhood.

601
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:47,450
Thank you.

602
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:51,371
Thanks, but you didn't
need to do it for me, pal.

603
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:53,748
Now he just needed to get
out of the house before...

604
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,251
You know, to be totally honest,
I didn't just do it for you.

605
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,211
- Yeah?
- I also did it for my girlfriend.

606
00:20:58,253 --> 00:20:59,628
Kind of wanted to impress her.

607
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,424
That came up.

608
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,384
Wow.

609
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:05,552
You got a girlfriend.

610
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:07,429
Good for you. That's great.

611
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,180
Congratulations.

612
00:21:09,222 --> 00:21:10,473
Your dad's got one, too.

613
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:11,599
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

614
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,142
How is yours going?

615
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:16,479
Not great.

616
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:18,689
I haven't been completely honest with her

617
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:21,025
about who I am.

618
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,694
You know, I haven't even
told her my real name,

619
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:24,946
and I don't think

620
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:27,574
I can keep that lie going, so...

621
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:29,534
I think it might be over.

622
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:31,453
Oh, great...

623
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:36,040
pain fades slowly.

624
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,543
Quickly.

625
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:41,045
- But now it was as simple as getting out...
- Thanks.

626
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:42,713
- Before George Michael asked...
- But what about you?

627
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:44,382
You're doing great, huh?
Tell me about your girlfriend,

628
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:46,468
and you're producing this movie now.

629
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:47,635
That.

630
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:49,220
I think they're both over.

631
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:51,306
Yeah, it wasn't meant to be.

632
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:53,433
I'm sorry.

633
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:56,311
And that's when Michael finally
treated his son like an adult.

634
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,563
Hey, you know what I miss on you?

635
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:00,689
The mustache.

636
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:03,318
And so, discouraged, Michael returned

637
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,489
to his apartment, only to find worse news.

638
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,616
And when he saw that Lucille 2

639
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:12,285
was having a campaign event at Cinco,

640
00:22:12,327 --> 00:22:15,079
he knew there was only
one thing he could give her

641
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:16,539
instead of the money.

642
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:19,417
And he knew what he had to do first

643
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,794
to give it to her.

644
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:25,214
George Michael, meanwhile,
had a keynote speech to give,

645
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:28,510
and hadn't totally decided
whether he should come clean.

646
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:30,386
And that's when he ran into his uncle.

647
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:31,471
We'll take care of.

648
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,055
My father's got the money.

649
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:34,849
- You guys are one heck of a horde.
- Uncle Gob!

650
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,559
- No, you're mistaken, friend.
- No, it's George Michael.

651
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:38,603
- Hi. Exactly.
- Yes.

652
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:40,396
Hey, I'm actually really
glad I ran into you.

653
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:41,523
I could use some advice.

654
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:43,149
Oh. Love each other.

655
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:45,067
Oh, no, that's great, but I actually need

656
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:47,694
a specific piece of advice
for a certain situation.

657
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:49,572
I'll give it to you fast.

658
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:53,535
Basically, for the past few
weeks, I've been living a lie.

659
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:55,911
I've been... in this
relationship with a woman

660
00:22:55,953 --> 00:22:57,788
who doesn't even know.

661
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,706
It's probably over with the girl.

662
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:06,548
... gone way too far...

663
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:08,049
So, basically now I can either tell her...

664
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:11,260
that there is no George Maharis

665
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:13,346
and never was... or...

666
00:23:13,388 --> 00:23:15,056
we keep things anonymous

667
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:18,893
and I continue the lie
that Fakeblock exists.

668
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,063
From my perspective...

669
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:23,606
something about "there's a girl... "

670
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,650
Did you... Does she like you?

671
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:27,318
I mean, you're not the
world's most handsome guy.

672
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,611
Yeah, no, she likes...

673
00:23:28,653 --> 00:23:29,862
I would say what I did take away was that

674
00:23:29,904 --> 00:23:32,073
I would rather have sex with someone

675
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:33,991
because they thought I was someone else

676
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:37,620
than not have sex with someone
because they thought I was me.

677
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:40,998
So I should probably do
the opposite of that and...

678
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,503
be true to who I am and
not compromise my integrity

679
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:48,423
just for some fleeting sexual experience.

680
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,593
- So, "love each other."
- There it is.

681
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:53,052
It wasn't much help,

682
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:55,430
and as George Michael headed off

683
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:58,974
unsure of what to do, Gob
went off to find his father,

684
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:01,436
who was having his own relationship crisis.

685
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:03,062
We're getting a real divorce.

686
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:04,689
You're out of the marriage.

687
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:08,775
So I am fat.

688
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:10,403
Boy, am I glad you're here.

689
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:11,987
I need money and it's
not for what you think...

690
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:13,906
for a magic show or a bee colony...

691
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:16,618
it's to pay the builders I hired
to start building the fake wall

692
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:17,868
between Mexico and America.

693
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,328
Shh! Are you crazy?

694
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,747
Lucille 2 is around here.

695
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:22,498
Well, don't worry about Lucille 2.

696
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,958
I'll handle her.

697
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:25,876
It's just that I need to pay the Chinese.

698
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:29,004
Wait, wait, you... you hired Chinese?!

699
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:31,716
Well, I figured who better than
the Chinese to build a wall.

700
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:34,677
But, no, I couldn't afford them,

701
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:37,722
so I... I hired, um, they're
technically Mongols, I guess.

702
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:40,182
They're, well, they're the
people that they built the wall

703
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:41,392
to try to keep out...

704
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:42,602
How many did you hire?

705
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:44,228
A horde. That's the minimum.

706
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,230
They don't come in
anything less than a horde.

707
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:48,857
So you hired a Mongol horde.

708
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:52,236
Look, Dad, just, if they
don't get their money soon,

709
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:54,447
they're gonna be really mad
and then they're gonna have

710
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:55,864
a major Mongolian beef
with us... there they are.

711
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:59,118
Okay, uh, we don't have any m... money.

712
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,872
Well, he says that we don't have any money.

713
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:11,673
And at that moment, another
Bluth who had no money

714
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:14,342
was finding a way to pay up.

715
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,510
What are you doing?

716
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:16,678
I'm gonna have sex with you.

717
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:17,679
For money.

718
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,347
Oh!

719
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:21,182
- Oh, I didn't realize
- Yeah.

720
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:23,142
How heavy these rings are.

721
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:25,060
- Yeah.
- But I thought you were gonna kiss me

722
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:26,270
and I panicked.

723
00:25:27,605 --> 00:25:28,815
I... I was gonna kiss you.

724
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:33,152
I didn't even try to do it that time.

725
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:35,613
So, it's, uh, let's take a tumble

726
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:37,490
with Old Moneybags, right?

727
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:41,910
And she'll be so grateful that
she'll walk away from $700,000.

728
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:43,329
No, no, no, it would
absolutely not be a gift.

729
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:44,955
This would still be a loan, okay?

730
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:47,958
However, my lovemaking
would be, you know...

731
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,460
What?

732
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:51,796
What, Michael? What were you gonna say?

733
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:55,174
Something that I would never
be able to take back, but...

734
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,760
I didn't want that to happen.

735
00:25:57,802 --> 00:25:58,885
Now, listen, you have been the one

736
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:00,221
that has been flirting with me.

737
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:02,348
- Those were pity flirts.
- No, they were not.

738
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,517
You want this as much as I do.

739
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,143
As much as I want this extension.

740
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:07,687
Two different "this" es.

741
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:10,939
Now, you own a company
that I helped to build.

742
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:12,650
It was all of my hard work.

743
00:26:12,692 --> 00:26:14,901
This is something you have
to do because, if you don't,

744
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:17,613
I can't be held responsible
for what I might do.

745
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:19,782
As it turns out,

746
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:22,660
George Michael was the only Bluth

747
00:26:22,702 --> 00:26:25,371
who could be responsible for what he did,

748
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,540
and as he headed to the microphone,

749
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:30,793
Mongols, not paid what they were promised,

750
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:32,002
did what they do best.

751
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:34,630
Um... Oh! Ah!

752
00:26:34,672 --> 00:26:36,090
Viva Méjico.

753
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:37,592
Which lead to this.

754
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:40,052
Put up this wall!

755
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:42,430
And it's hard to know
whether it was the chanting

756
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,930
- of "Put up this wall... "
- Ladies and gentlemen,

757
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:46,225
if I could have your
attention for a moment...

758
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:48,728
or the note that promised
him a sexual resumption

759
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,814
of his anonymous relationship with Rebel...

760
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:53,357
that made him say this:

761
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:57,570
Yeah, so, I'm George Maharis, and, uh...

762
00:26:57,612 --> 00:27:00,573
and Fakeblock is real...

763
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:05,494
- Let's put up this wall. 
- Put up this wall!

764
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:08,163
But not everyone wants to
put up a wall on the Internet.

765
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:10,040
Let's put up, put up this
wall. Have a good night.

766
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:15,212
And the Anonymous who
left the note wasn't Rebel.

767
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:21,719
A discouraged Michael
returned to the model home,

768
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:26,098
where he ran into a brother
who also had something to hide.

769
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,017
As an emboldened George
Maharis gave Rebel a note

770
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:32,688
that she now believed he'd written for her.

771
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,900
And for the son, it
was a night to remember,

772
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:38,820
and for the father, a night to forget.

773
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:43,115
- * So easy to forget. *
- Shh.

774
00:27:43,157 --> 00:27:44,408
It was May 5, Rebel, it's Michael.

775
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,702
And while Rebel was on the phone,

776
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:49,079
George Michael was realizing
that taking things casually

777
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:51,165
was not going to be an option for him.

778
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:52,959
You can come over later, okay?

779
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:54,376
- Good-bye.
- I'll see you soon.

780
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:56,170
Who was that?

781
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:57,839
No one.

782
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,716
Look, I... I don't care.

783
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:03,511
I... I don't care that
you're seeing someone else.

784
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:06,555
I... I just, I want to continue this.

785
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:08,683
I'm ready to try and make this work.

786
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:11,268
I'll fight anyone I have to for you.

787
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,646
I'm not going to pretend
I don't care about you.

788
00:28:13,688 --> 00:28:15,648
I'm a grown-up man and...

789
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,900
I want to get serious.

790
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,112
Wow. Serious.

791
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:23,781
Things are getting serious.

792
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:25,825
And the girl who was never capable

793
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:27,201
of making a commitment...

794
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:28,744
Okay.

795
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:31,497
Suddenly found herself making too many.

796
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,123
Okay.

797
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,459
Okay.

798
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:41,966
George Michael felt good.

799
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:45,970
And, at least for that day,

800
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:49,724
he wouldn't encounter his
father in Rebel's bedroom...

801
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:52,018
He'd run into him leaving the building.

802
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,352
Hey.

803
00:28:53,394 --> 00:28:54,395
What are you doing here?

804
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:55,813
I'm vi... I'm on a visit.

805
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:57,064
I'm visiting.

806
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:58,983
My girlfriend lives here... Rebel.

807
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:02,570
Wow. So you're gonna work
it out with your girlfriend.

808
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:04,196
Good for you. That's great news.

809
00:29:04,238 --> 00:29:06,323
- Great to see you again.
- That says "Rebel," huh?

810
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:10,202
Is that a... is that
a little gift for Rebel?

811
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:18,085
I'm dating Rebel Alley.

812
00:29:20,046 --> 00:29:22,590
So there better be two
Rebels in here, am I right?

813
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:23,716
I'm dating Rebel Alley.

814
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,927
That'd be weird.

815
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,887
No, ironically, she did say

816
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:28,930
that there was another guy,

817
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:30,138
but that his name was George...

818
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,807
- ... Maharis.
- Maharis. That's me.

819
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:34,435
You're George Michael.

820
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:37,229
No, but, uh, yeah, but I
use the name George Maharis

821
00:29:37,271 --> 00:29:40,315
when... with women, because
I hate the name George Michael.

822
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:41,275
I told you that.

823
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:43,235
This is, uh, this is weird.

824
00:29:43,277 --> 00:29:44,779
Are you not kidding me?

825
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,155
It's insane... no...
so, you're the other guy.

826
00:29:47,197 --> 00:29:49,116
I'm the oth... well, you're the other guy.

827
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:50,492
Yeah, well, one of us.

828
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:53,412
Did I not tell you that we were alike?

829
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:54,997
Exactly alike.

830
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,374
- This is just...
- So horrifying.

831
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:58,709
Too funny.

832
00:29:58,751 --> 00:29:59,919
This is what I was talking about.

833
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:00,920
I told you.

834
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:02,379
I mean, we're like twins.

835
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:03,589
Are we not like twins?

836
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:05,173
All the way down to the photo booth.

837
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:06,801
You name me one way in
which we're different.

838
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:09,720
Well, Dad, you know, I
never, in a million years,

839
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:11,513
would have gone out
with her, if I knew that

840
00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:12,932
you were, you know, the other guy.

841
00:30:12,974 --> 00:30:15,267
Me, neither.

842
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:16,644
I wouldn't have, either.

843
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:18,562
Damn it. You know?

844
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:19,688
You gotta believe me.

845
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,107
This is just...

846
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:22,817
- This is, uh...
- Yeah...

847
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:28,114
How'd you know about the photo booth?

848
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:37,915
How... you... 'cause you said,
"Right down to the photo... "

849
00:30:37,957 --> 00:30:40,375
I said, "Right down to the photo booth."

850
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:48,509
Ironically, he could've
told the truth and said

851
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,218
he'd taken a forget-me-now.

852
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,429
But like the victim of a roofie circle,

853
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:55,766
having taken one was the
only memory he had lost.

854
00:30:55,808 --> 00:30:57,768
So, instead, he doubled-down on this.

855
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,729
It's like we're identical twi...

856
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:58,871
Gob gets an important call

857
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:00,956
- from his mother.
- Hello. She's gone.

858
00:32:00,998 --> 00:32:04,710
Lucille 2 has disappeared and
it's time for you to step up

859
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:06,962
and be president of the Bluth Company.

860
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:08,505
Keep your nose clean. No scandals!

861
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:10,424
Okay.

862
00:32:10,465 --> 00:32:12,760
And even though Gob hadn't
taken a forget-me-now

863
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:14,636
the night before...

864
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:15,971
it seems Tony Wonder had.

865
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:19,808
Hey, Gobie. It's Tony.

866
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,644
We still on for our sex date tonight?

867
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:36,825
And this happens...

868
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:37,910
Oh! Okay.

869
00:32:37,952 --> 00:32:39,745
Are you Buster Bluth?

870
00:32:39,787 --> 00:32:41,038
I am.

871
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,039
- Okay, this...
- Can we come in?

872
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,457
This isn't my house.

873
00:32:43,498 --> 00:32:45,667
- What is this regarding?
- That's all right.

874
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:49,671
You're under arrest for the
murder of Lucille Austero.

875
00:32:49,713 --> 00:32:51,215
Read him his rights.

876
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:52,967
Okay, I think there's
been some kind of mistake.

877
00:32:53,008 --> 00:32:55,010
That left hand might be difficult to cuff.

878
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:57,304
- Trouble cuffing him.
- I'm not a monster!

879
00:32:57,345 --> 00:32:59,807
I got it.

880
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:01,809
Uh... all right, great.

881
00:33:04,352 --> 00:33:06,354
Well, the infamous Bluth
family is at it again,

882
00:33:06,396 --> 00:33:08,899
this time facing murder charges,

883
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:11,902
and our Imagine cameras
were there to capture it all.

884
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:13,195
Hey, did you see this?

885
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:14,696
Yeah, I saw it just now in the elevator.

886
00:33:14,738 --> 00:33:16,031
Is this the family
you've been talking about?

887
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:17,074
It sure is.

888
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:18,533
Wow! You got the rights to this?

889
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:19,910
Well, only for the
killer... but that's enough

890
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:21,245
for us to get a green light, right?

891
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:23,080
Absolutely! It's our next Da Vinci Code!

892
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:26,000
Yay! That's great!

893
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,710
Plus, it's gonna put
Imagine News on the map.

894
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:31,797
- This is John Beard.
- Love each other.
