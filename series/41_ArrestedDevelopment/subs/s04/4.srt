00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,881
Michael Bluth
was starting a new job

3
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,837
when he received a call
from attorney Barry Zuckerkorn.

4
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:17,584
Hello. Michael Bluth,
residential complexes.

5
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:18,945
Take a picture of this!

6
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:19,742
Hey, Michael.

7
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,797
- You're in real estate again?
- Sort of.

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,258
Michael had tried
to leave real estate behind

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,801
and get a job
in the high-tech sector.

10
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:27,094
However...

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,180
I will tell you
that in my last position,

12
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:31,140
I had a company car provision.

13
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:33,643
I think we may have something
that can get you a car.

14
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,227
- Hey, Gare-Bear?
- Yeah?

15
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,979
I think we got an ostrich.

16
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,606
- Oh, God, grab him.
- What is it?

17
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:41,984
Now, with this car,
you may get some stares.

18
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:43,944
I'm used to a car
with some stairs.

19
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:45,696
Albeit one that had trouble

20
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:49,617
negotiating
low-hanging obstacles.

21
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:56,374
Which is why
he'd parted with it.

22
00:00:56,415 --> 00:00:57,958
I'm actually working
in high tech,

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,627
but it does collide
with real estate.

24
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:02,630
This is going to be low.

25
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:03,964
Ah, I hooked it.

26
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,007
Michael was driving a car

27
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,342
from a company that shows

28
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,678
every private residence
in the country.

29
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,889
But it's also a company
that won't let us

30
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:14,016
show the car
that takes those pictures.

31
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,686
In fairness to them,
it is their property.

32
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,865
If you want to know
what the company is...

33
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:21,617
Save it. We're just
going to blur it anyway.

34
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:22,817
...all you have to do is...

35
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:23,563
"something" it.

36
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:24,920
Barry, you still there?

37
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:27,381
So I got a really
interesting call

38
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:29,550
from Ron Howard, of all people.

39
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:31,260
He's directing now, apparently,

40
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:32,928
and wants to meet you
at his office

41
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,389
in-- get this-- Beverly Hills.

42
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:36,766
Why does Ron How...

43
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:38,809
Why does Ron Howard want
to meet with me?

44
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,686
Oh, I didn't know. His office
didn't say, and if you

45
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:42,646
don't mind, I'm a little busy
with a case of my own.

46
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:44,607
Did you get
any other information?

47
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:46,901
Apparently, he directed
a movie called Cocoon.

48
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,486
Sorry. I was unclear

49
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:50,363
about why he wants
to meet with me.

50
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:52,031
I don't know. You want me to
tell him to go  himself?

51
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:54,033
I can tell Ron Howard
to go  himself.

52
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:55,785
Tell him to shove it
up his.

53
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:57,078
I just can't do it now

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,913
because I'm in front of a jury.

55
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:00,414
Barry, I will meet with him.

56
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:01,874
You're in front of a jury
right now?

57
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,751
Oh, and the looks I'm getting.
Got to go.

58
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,628
Sorry, everybody.
I'm an attorney, too.

59
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:07,755
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

60
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:10,508
I'd like the defendant
to reach over the school gate,

61
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,926
open it from the inside

62
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,886
and enter the school
property, please.

63
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:17,014
I can't reach it.
I can't reach the knob.

64
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:18,766
Why is that,
Mr. Zuckerkorn?

65
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,726
- I'm not tall enough.
- You're not tall enough.

66
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:22,686
I can't reach the chotchie.

67
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:24,397
Hey, should I try tippy-toe?

68
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:25,940
Look, I'm on tippy-toes.

69
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,900
If he can't reach,
this trial's a breach.

70
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:30,486
Ooh, and that's what
we call a Law Bomb.

71
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,862
That's a low blow, Loblaw.

72
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:33,114
A Bob Loblaw Law Bomb.

73
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:37,785
Now the story

74
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,578
of a wealthy family
who lost everything

75
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,747
and the one son
who had no choice

76
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,874
but to keep them all together.

77
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:51,006
It's...

78
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:55,927
Michael drove to the
North American headquarters

79
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,596
of Imagine Entertainment,

80
00:02:57,638 --> 00:03:00,391
the modest television
and streaming colossus

81
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,768
of Brian Grazer and Ron Howard.

82
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,397
And got his first taste
of how cruel Hollywood can be.

83
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,315
That's not very nice.

84
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:10,651
"Ankles" means "leaves"
in Variety, Michael.

85
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:13,779
Kitty Sanchez.
What are you doing here?

86
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:15,489
I work here. I'm a "D" girl.

87
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:17,116
No, I don't want to see them.

88
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:19,994
I'm not going to show you
my , you pig.

89
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:21,662
It means "development."

90
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:24,415
I'm a movie executive.
I work for Ron Howard now.

91
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:27,418
And she'd proven
as loyal to him as she was

92
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,961
to her former boss,
Michael's father.

93
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:32,882
But without the
quote, unquote "benefits."

94
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:35,634
Also, Imagine provided
no health benefits.

95
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:37,553
Great for you.
How'd you get this job?

96
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:40,556
Women can be movie executives,
you pig. I knew people.

97
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:42,892
You're probably going to call me
a pig for this, too,

98
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,519
but are you sure that
you meant to say "knew"?

99
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,979
She did.

100
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,701
The only thing at Imagine
that Kitty blew

101
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:51,567
was smoke up the skirt
of the young woman

102
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:54,445
who hired her,
Michael's niece, Maeby,

103
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,780
who was then working
as a film executive.

104
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,699
My first project
is about my family.

105
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:00,034
Ooh!

106
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:01,076
Yeah, which is why I thought
you'd be a perfect assistant--

107
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:02,995
because you know where
all the bodies are buried.

108
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,747
And I even helped
bury some of them.

109
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:06,999
Maeby was only 17 at the time.

110
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,709
Also, um, can you buy me booze?

111
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:09,960
Totally.

112
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,005
Whatever else, too.

113
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,716
'Cause I can get you smack
or hash or Special K...

114
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,594
Unfortunately,
when Maeby was shooting

115
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:23,432
out of town on a picture,
Kitty saw to it...

116
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:25,476
She didn't even get releases
from her family.

117
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:27,019
that Maeby's was one
of the bodies that was buried.

118
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:28,812
And I begged her to.

119
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,940
And the project got thrown
on the back burner.

120
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:33,734
Do you have any idea
why Ron Howard wants to see me?

121
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:36,070
Believe me, if I could
think like Ron Howard,

122
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:38,781
I'd own the second largest
building in Beverly Hills.

123
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:40,741
Only Jerry Bruckheimer's
building

124
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:42,493
was technically taller.

125
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:44,036
But who wants to be
south of Wilshire?

126
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:45,871
Mr. Howard will see you now.

127
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:48,165
- Oh, great.
- I'll take you to the private elevator.

128
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:51,085
- Thanks.
- Ooh! Going to meet the big man himself.

129
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:54,213
But first, Michael would have
to pass a few little Rons.

130
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:55,506
Michael Bluth.

131
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:57,841
- Hey.
- Hey, nice try, mister.

132
00:04:57,883 --> 00:04:59,843
We're never going
to beat the original.

133
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,428
- Well, that's what I've been saying.
- Hi. Hey.

134
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,055
- Oh, Michael. Hey, thanks
for coming down. - How are you?

135
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,598
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I'm just finishing up

136
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,891
casting this
Andy Griffith Show thing.

137
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,101
Okay. Yeah.

138
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:08,519
Hang on a second.

139
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,922
You guys finally
making that movie?

140
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:11,778
I've been reading about it
for, like, 40 years.

141
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:13,649
Well, it's not a done deal yet,

142
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,211
- but I want to talk about you.
- Yeah.

143
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:16,902
Hey, let's go inside the LEM.

144
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:18,904
- You want to?
- Wow. Is this the one

145
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:20,114
that landed on the moon?

146
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,490
On a soundstage.

147
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:22,992
Oh, right, from Apollo 13.

148
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,702
No, no, 1969.

149
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:26,620
I'll tell you about it
inside the LEM.

150
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:28,163
It's soundproof in there.

151
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:30,082
And it's a national secret.

152
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:32,793
So, NASA did go to the moon
in '71.

153
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:34,587
That one was real.

154
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:36,880
But in '69, they weren't ready,

155
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:40,759
so they faked the whole thing
on the soundstage of Gentle Ben.

156
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:41,885
- Boy.
- Me and my brother,

157
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:43,596
we hid up in the rafters.

158
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,014
- We seen the whole thing.
- Ah.

159
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,807
But I want to talk to
you about something.

160
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,517
Okay.

161
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,978
For the last year, I've
been going to Phoenix.

162
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,147
Whoa, whoa. Hang on, now.

163
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,648
Are you kidding me?

164
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,317
I'm a... I'm a Phoenix.

165
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,736
I've-I've never... I've never
met anyone else in person

166
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,057
that, uh...
that also goes there.

167
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,697
That's amazing.

168
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:03,949
I guess that's the downside
of going to college online, huh?

169
00:06:03,991 --> 00:06:06,035
Well, I... I just got
a sick aunt down there.

170
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:08,203
- Oh, I see.
- But on the last flight,

171
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,997
I was flipping
through the magazine,

172
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,790
- and I... I saw something.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

173
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,626
Not-not...
not the begging photo.

174
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,252
Now, I don't think
you know this about me,

175
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:18,088
but most of my movies are based

176
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,174
on still photographs
that I find truly inspiring.

177
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:21,717
It was true.

178
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,677
Splash was based
on what turned out

179
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:25,763
to be a counterfeit Hockney

180
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:28,139
that Brian talked Ron
into buying.

181
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:31,602
The Da Vinci Code
was from this photo.

182
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:33,312
You know Willow?

183
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:36,565
That was from a Soft 'n Snuggly
coupon I got in the mail.

184
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:38,609
But a man who is
passionate enough

185
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:41,028
to beg, well, that's a character

186
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,280
whose story we really want
to see.

187
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:45,115
- Really?
- Plus I've been dying to figure out

188
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,158
a way to do something
about the market crash

189
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:49,201
ever since my partner,
Brian Grazer, was tipped off

190
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:50,913
that it was three months
away from happening.

191
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,163
What's that?

192
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:53,999
But I never had a face
to put on it.

193
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,959
Until now. You.

194
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,003
Your wife is dying.

195
00:06:58,045 --> 00:06:59,755
You're trying to hold
your family together.

196
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:01,590
Oh, gosh, no, no, no.

197
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:04,760
My wife died years before
any... any of this.

198
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:06,845
Oh, gee.

199
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:11,016
I think it's a lot more fun
if we see her die.

200
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:12,726
- That is fun.
- And by the way,

201
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:15,979
then it's a fantastic part
for a leading lady.

202
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,732
In fact, my girl Rebel
would be great in that part.

203
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:19,983
Your girl?

204
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,193
Rebel Alley.

205
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:22,319
She's an actress.
You know her.

206
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:23,696
He didn't.

207
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,030
I do.
Yes, of course I do.

208
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:26,573
Your girl, huh?

209
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,867
Well, we kind of like
to keep that quiet.

210
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,244
Michael assumed
that by "my girl,"

211
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:31,870
Ron was referring
to his mistress...

212
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:34,039
I can see why you're
telling me in the LEM, huh?

213
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:37,793
...but Ron was actually
talking about his daughter.

214
00:07:37,835 --> 00:07:40,963
You probably think I'm terrible
for even mentioning her to you.

215
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,881
Oh, no, no,
I'm-I'm not one to judge.

216
00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:45,134
I'm sure you've all got girls
up here in Hollywood, huh?

217
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:47,302
Brian's got two boys.

218
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:52,141
I think you're a natural
and it could be a great movie.

219
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:53,726
You know, and-and
it's a real chance

220
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:55,018
to show you guys off, too.

221
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,270
Us guys?

222
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:58,731
Well, it's about
the whole family.

223
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:00,232
Them?

224
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:01,775
We're going to need
everybody's signature

225
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:04,653
on these releases in order
to make this story.

226
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:06,155
Although the real
heartbeat of this thing

227
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:07,656
is the father-son dynamic.

228
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:08,991
Yeah. You know, Ron,

229
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:10,909
I-I don't know if I can do this.

230
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,953
We're not in a great way
right now,

231
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:14,830
and-and it might not
be worth...

232
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:17,291
Michael, take a few of these
cards and really think about it.

233
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:19,293
- All right.
- Yeah, man, I got a tough meeting coming up now.

234
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:23,213
How do you tell Ed Harris
that he's simply not a Barney?

235
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:26,258
And while Ed was
getting some bad news,

236
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,093
Michael got some good news.

237
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:29,720
Excuse me.
Uh, is this a mistake?

238
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:31,013
Am I a producer?

239
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,264
It's one of the perks

240
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:33,891
of having a movie
made about you.

241
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:35,809
Huh.

242
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:38,103
Health plan is not
another one, by the way.

243
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:40,147
There's no health plan.

244
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,610
Michael had been given
an opportunity

245
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:47,738
to turn his life around,
and all he had to do

246
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,698
to make it happen was to get

247
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,575
- his family's signatures.
- ...the family signatures,

248
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:54,244
especially my father's.

249
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:55,662
Wow, sounds like your thing

250
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:56,997
went a lot better
than my thing.

251
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,792
Except I haven't spoken
to them for a long time.

252
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,003
I mean, since I...
well, since-since my mom...

253
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:04,630
Left?

254
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,256
Yeah, for prison, yeah.

255
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:07,758
You want to know what?

256
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,218
Frankly, I think Ron Howard

257
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,637
just wants to get a movie
for his girlfriend.

258
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,847
Oh, it sounds like Ron Howard
is casting with his.

259
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:15,682
Well...

260
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,644
it is hard to believe,
but I guess they've all got

261
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:20,979
their mistresses up here
in showbiz, you know.

262
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:22,773
It's like it's
their God-given...

263
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,900
Front?
No, right.

264
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:26,693
- No, right.
- Calm down, everybody, all right?

265
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:28,296
- I got it. I got it.
- You think my dad

266
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,030
would ever even go
for something like this?

267
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:32,324
You know, it's very hard
to get a signature out of him.

268
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:34,159
It's... it's like somebody
a long time ago said...

269
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,994
Hey, what if you never
signed anything

270
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,871
because you said you didn't
have a signature?

271
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:40,123
- Just like you, Pop.
- You... you don't have a signature?

272
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,750
No, and he's never
given me one card.

273
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,168
Not one birthday
card, which is why

274
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,586
his presents are
always money orders.

275
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:45,796
Right, Pop?

276
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,923
- I don't have a signature.
- Oh!

277
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,758
If you don't sign,
you will be fine.

278
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,134
Hey.

279
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:52,678
He's very smart.

280
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,388
He's very good.

281
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,014
Can you feel your hands?

282
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:58,016
I can't feel my pinky
or this one.

283
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:59,768
You know what, Barry?
I hear what you're saying.

284
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,687
I... My dad would never do
something like this for me.

285
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,230
I'm going to head back in,
and I'm going to...

286
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,065
I'm going to tell Ron Howard
to forget about it.

287
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:06,233
- Yeah, you're screwed.
Hey, do me a favor. - Yeah.

288
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:07,276
- Tell Ron Howard to go
- Okay.

289
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,878
- shove his...
- Bye-bye, Barry.

290
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:11,196
- Oh!
- Sorry. Whoops.

291
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:12,281
Whoa. Sorry.
That was my fault.

292
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:13,907
- No.
- I was looking at my phone.

293
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:15,158
It's not too embarrassing
walking around

294
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,785
with a bunch of photographs
of yourself.

295
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:18,662
Oh, well, looks like
it's part of your job, huh?

296
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:21,707
- You're an actress?
- No, I'm a narcissist.

297
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:24,167
Yeah, actually, "actress"
is an overstatement because...

298
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,752
Ugh. Thank you.

299
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:27,880
I was just sucking at
this audition I went on.

300
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:30,883
It was one of these ridiculous
meet-cute clichés,

301
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:33,010
where a guy and a girl
just, you know...

302
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:35,220
they bump into each
other, and they...

303
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:37,180
they fall in love.

304
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:39,808
God, you're handsome.

305
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,060
I got a...
maybe a lucky hair day.

306
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:43,395
You're the beautiful one.

307
00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:46,231
You have beautiful eyes.

308
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:49,276
My deceased wife had red hair.

309
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:51,194
Yep, garbage like that.

310
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,196
And it's so unbelievable.

311
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:54,799
Like, they never get
each other's names.

312
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,825
Pretty stupid. Whoops. Gosh.

313
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,785
- Oh... oh! Ow!
- Oh! Are you okay?

314
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,227
- That really hurt.
- Ooh. You okay?

315
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:01,914
I wish I had done that
well in the audition.

316
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:05,334
Where's a movie producer
when you need one, right?

317
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,960
Well, it was really
nice to meet you.

318
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:08,462
Yes, you, too.

319
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:10,964
I'm a "moobie" producer.

320
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:12,341
Sorry. I'm a movie...

321
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:13,800
Here, I've got...

322
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:15,802
I've got proof here, huh?

323
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,179
- Oh, you are a movie producer.
- Yeah.

324
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,097
Yeah, there's a part
for a wife,

325
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,099
and you'd be perfect
for the movie.

326
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,187
Do you like Scottish music?

327
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,898
Uh, with the screeching horns
and the silly...

328
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,900
Yeah. I'm in a band.

329
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,735
I love it. It's great.

330
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:33,403
We're playing at the Ealing
Club tomorrow night, and...

331
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,446
maybe you could come and...
and just check it out.

332
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:37,448
Oh, yeah?
I don't even know what that is.

333
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,118
I should've... Sorry.

334
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,370
That's funny.
I should have said "where."

335
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,955
Of course, I know what it is.

336
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:44,539
No, it's on the top
of that building.

337
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,959
- Okay.
- But can you imagine driving that car?

338
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,252
No, I can't. No.

339
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:52,005
It wasn't until
Michael had walked

340
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:54,549
two blocks past the
California Pizza Kitchen

341
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:56,051
when this happened.

342
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:57,928
♪ Hey, I met a girl today ♪

343
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,137
♪ And her name is... ♪

344
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:03,474
So Michael went back
to find her

345
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:05,557
or, at the very least,
try looking for a head shot

346
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,021
- with her name on it.
- Nothing, huh?

347
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,939
She was super-pretty,
red hair...

348
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,107
But even without her name,

349
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:12,150
he knew his only chance
with her

350
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,986
was to be a real producer,
and that meant

351
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:16,446
getting a signature
from a father whose face

352
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:17,447
he hadn't seen in ages.

353
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:18,782
Oh, you're making me dizzy!

354
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,450
And that's when he
suddenly did.

355
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,452
We have
to keep this quiet!

356
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,246
Dad?

357
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:27,249
No, no.

358
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,292
- Hi.
- Don't say I'm down here.

359
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,378
- Right here.
- Hey.

360
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,296
What's going on?

361
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:34,923
I just came back to get, uh...

362
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:36,174
Don't acknowledge me.

363
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:37,968
...get some suits, you know,

364
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,220
so I can look like the uptight,

365
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:43,056
dishonest, cheating boob
that I am.

366
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:45,350
Well, I never said "boob."

367
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:47,436
Although you are in
the wrong Lucille's apartment,

368
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,855
so unless you're looking
for a Bob Mackie original,

369
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:51,398
could be some truth
to the cheating part.

370
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,066
Yeah, well, I was
in the desert,

371
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:54,443
and I've lost my
sense of direction.

372
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:56,085
Hey. Where you going?

373
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:57,320
Dad.

374
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,948
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

375
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,158
Listen.

376
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,909
You're getting divorced.

377
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,078
I am not one to judge.

378
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,998
Great to see you again.

379
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,000
The past is the past, and
things have worked out,

380
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,044
and I've met a
wonderful woman named...

381
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:15,464
Don't worry about that,
but I'm a movie producer now.

382
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:17,340
Unbelievable.

383
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:20,010
They're making a movie
out of my life.

384
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:22,054
The girl I met is perfect
to play my wife.

385
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:23,847
And it's... I don't know.

386
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:25,974
Can you believe it?
And I know what you're thinking:

387
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:28,268
- "Can you put me in it?"
- I don't care.

388
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,519
Do I have what I hope I've got?

389
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,979
Anybody who's getting
in the movie

390
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:32,522
needs to sign this.

391
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,357
It's a simple signature.

392
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,942
I think that everybody
needs to see

393
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,319
who the real George
Sr. is, don't you?

394
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,865
I think it would all depend
on how George Sr. was portrayed.

395
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:43,366
Well...

396
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:48,413
he is not the most
positive character, but...

397
00:13:48,455 --> 00:13:51,374
you sign this, and I
don't see any reason

398
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,544
why we can't make him
seem very, very, uh...

399
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,338
uh, you know...

400
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,924
uh...

401
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:00,926
uh...

402
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,886
uh...

403
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:10,477
...nice.

404
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,354
- Go to hell.
- Huh?

405
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:14,397
Michael was actually relieved.

406
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:15,565
You go to hell.

407
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,484
He had no idea how he was

408
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:19,528
going to make
his father seem nice.

409
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:23,824
Michael Bluth
was starting his new life

410
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,868
as a producer in-- get this--
Beverly Hills

411
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,330
without the signature
he needed to make it happen.

412
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:32,958
Your office is only
one floor below Ron Howard's.

413
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,709
Oh, yeah?

414
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,712
Must be a pretty important
project to him, then, huh?

415
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:40,257
That's one possibility.

416
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:42,300
Watch your head.

417
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:44,219
Are these ceilings
a little lower?

418
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,012
Brian and Ron
wanted the ceiling

419
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,765
in their office to be
a few inches taller,

420
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,725
but, apparently, Bruckheimer
knows someone on city council

421
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,727
and they wouldn't let them
make the building taller.

422
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,312
So Ron said,
" you, Jerry,"

423
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:56,731
and he went lower
with his floor.

424
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:58,441
Everybody wins, huh?

425
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,902
- Here we are.
- Oh. That's me, huh?

426
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:03,280
Oh. Ceilings
are even lower in here.

427
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:06,199
Yeah, your office
is right below Brian's.

428
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,826
He wanted his ceiling

429
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:09,369
just a few inches
taller than Ron's.

430
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,413
- Okay.
- Some internal competition.

431
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,456
- Kind of like between us.
- Yeah.

432
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:16,877
- Wait, what?
- Well, you have a family to track down.

433
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,962
Yeah, I do.
Hey, speaking of that...

434
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:22,048
Kitty, is there... is there
a directory of actresses,

435
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,050
- with pictures in it, that I could...
- Wow.

436
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:26,011
Starting with the
casting couch already.

437
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,304
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

438
00:15:27,345 --> 00:15:28,889
I met... I met this
unbelievable woman

439
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,765
that would be perfect
for the part of my wife.

440
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,350
And even if she isn't, I'd love

441
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:33,894
to track her down, so...

442
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,729
an actual couch could
be useful, please.

443
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,938
Okay, you're funny.

444
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,180
This is Imagine Entertainment,

445
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,192
not the hot tub
at Bruckheimer Tower.

446
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:41,985
We make family movies,

447
00:15:42,027 --> 00:15:43,486
you
pig.

448
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,739
- Okay.
- So, why don't you not worry

449
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,866
about casting your movie,
and instead just get

450
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:49,451
the rights to your family,
and, of course,

451
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:52,245
if you need any help at all,
I would love to help you.

452
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:54,080
- We like to pull together around here.
- Watch your back.

453
00:15:54,122 --> 00:15:56,082
No, you watch your back, mister!

454
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:57,792
If you screw up
this project for me,

455
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,753
I will bury you
farther underground

456
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:01,963
than I did your illiterate
little niece!

457
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:03,798
Hi, guys.

458
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,009
With Michael's movie
in jeopardy

459
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:09,429
over the rights,
he decided to call in a favor.

460
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,181
You know, we're making a movie

461
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:12,807
about the family, and I thought,

462
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:14,100
"I wonder if Carl Weathers

463
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:15,727
would be willing
to help me out."

464
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,896
- Let me ask you this right up front.
- Okay.

465
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:20,357
Do you think
anybody would be upset

466
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:22,776
if one of these Crinch
dolls took a walk?

467
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,320
No, no, no, no, help yourself.

468
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:26,863
I know what you're thinking.

469
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:28,990
"What part
would I play in this?"

470
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:31,034
I figured you'd
want me to play me.

471
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:33,536
Well, I... I didn't want
to waste you on you.

472
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,413
In fact, I wasn't even going
to talk to you about acting,

473
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:37,540
but if you are game,
boy, that would be great.

474
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:38,917
Let's circle back to that.

475
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,877
There's a television show,
was it,

476
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,380
that you made about my family.

477
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:46,383
Michael was referring
to the George Bluth Sr. episode

478
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:49,594
of a horribly narrated
crime reenactment series

479
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,263
called Scandalmakers

480
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,348
that Carl had directed
years earlier.

481
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,767
Did you retain the rights
to my father's story?

482
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:57,394
Nah, man, rights cost money.

483
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:58,853
I never bothered
with that stuff.

484
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:00,063
I figure you go ahead,
you shoot it.

485
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:03,024
Better to ask for forgiveness
than beg for permission.

486
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,943
As it turned out, Carl

487
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:07,112
had never bothered
to get either,

488
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:08,905
which is why he made himself
the subject

489
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:11,366
of the final episode
of the series.

490
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:14,369
Lee Nails, only pressed on once.

491
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:16,371
Carl, we're at a swap meet.

492
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:18,164
Okay.
There he is.

493
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,000
- Carl Weathers.
- Mr. Weathers-- Carl Weathers.

494
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,252
You've been accused
of producing a television show

495
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:24,296
based on real-life events
for which you've done

496
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:28,466
none of the due diligence
in securing the rights thereto.

497
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:30,176
I only have one question.

498
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,511
Can I have your rights?

499
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:33,013
- Of course.
- Of course, Carl Weathers.

500
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:34,389
Cut!

501
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:36,224
Now we'll move on,
do a little voice-over.

502
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:37,350
How much are these belts?

503
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:39,185
- Oh, oh, oh, God.
- DeBrie!

504
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,937
Her heart stopped.
She's  dying.

505
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:43,148
Oh, hey, Dave,
you shaved, I like it.

506
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:44,607
Please get the paddles!

507
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:46,401
Oh, hey, Mike.
How was Ojai?

508
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:47,861
But, Carl, the whole point

509
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,529
of the movie is that
it's a true story,

510
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:50,613
so I need the rights.

511
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:52,157
Don't I?

512
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:55,535
Man, you're as green
as old lady Crinch.

513
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:58,830
Come on, people don't go
to movies to see rights.

514
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,915
People go to movies
to see actors.

515
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:02,959
Now, who you got
as scriptwriter?

516
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,044
And that's
when Michael remembered

517
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:06,087
that he did know one member

518
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,173
- of the Writers Guild.
- The eye is falling off this one.

519
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:10,884
You mind if I swap it out,
you know, for the restaurant?

520
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:12,010
Swap it.

521
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,261
And I thought, who's going

522
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:15,138
to get it right the first time?

523
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,598
Because I don't want
to give a lot of notes.

524
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:18,224
And then it came to me.

525
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,935
Who knows my father better
than Warden Gentles?

526
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:24,314
Hold on one second.

527
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:26,316
"The first time."

528
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:27,442
Yeah.

529
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:28,484
My grandson gave me this,

530
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:30,362
but I guarantee you,
give me an old Royal

531
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:31,988
and a glass of Scotch,
and I'll give you

532
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,241
250 pages where
the lightning hits the tree.

533
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:37,202
- That's not what we do here.
- I mean,

534
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:38,411
where the drop hits the pond.

535
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:39,913
- That's it.
- I apologize.

536
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:41,164
I've had a few meetings today.

537
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:42,165
Then...

538
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:43,541
the yellow robot gets mad

539
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,959
at the pink robot--

540
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,544
- That does...
- correction...

541
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:48,088
the purple robot.

542
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:50,965
Sorry, I'm,
I'm back to back today.

543
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,050
I bet.

544
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:53,176
I'm gonna be honest with you.

545
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:54,344
You're not charring my tree,

546
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:56,888
and... yeah,

547
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,850
Jerry's not gonna come
off the boat for this one.

548
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,392
This is basically
a story about

549
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,310
- Mm-hmm.
- a fellow like myself

550
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:03,561
- and his father
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:05,021
and their friend Carl Weathers.

552
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:06,648
I'm not entirely sure

553
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:10,110
how to organically work him
into the, to the story.

554
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:11,361
Uh, you know,
maybe he's teaching them

555
00:19:11,403 --> 00:19:13,196
lessons or something.

556
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:15,532
Anyway, I'm gonna leave that
up to your capable hands.

557
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:18,368
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

558
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,494
I've turned it off again.

559
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,496
Yeah, those are tricky.

560
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:22,914
Might I suggest

561
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:24,999
bringing in someone younger
to play the father--

562
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,668
a Philip Seymour Hoffman type?

563
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,628
A Philip Seymour Hoffman type.

564
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,629
And so, naturally,

565
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:31,005
I-I thought of you.

566
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,632
Well, you know,
I'm a married man,

567
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:34,259
so I don't really
keep a directory

568
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,136
of attractive young
actresses around.

569
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:38,096
- Okay.
- I mean, are you really planning

570
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:40,932
on using her, or is it like
Conan with the girl writers?

571
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:42,308
It doesn't matter, it...

572
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,977
I-I'm here to talk
to you about a movie

573
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,353
that we're gonna make
about the family,

574
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:46,646
and I thought
that it might be really fun

575
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:48,231
for us to work together again.

576
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:50,483
Help me remember.
What did we do together?

577
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,986
You came over for a chicken
and ham-water dinner

578
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:55,067
that my family threw to raise
some funds for itself.

579
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:56,531
And they're finally
getting around

580
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:58,241
to making a movie of that, huh?

581
00:19:58,283 --> 00:19:59,534
There's more to it than that.

582
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,077
It's, it's about
a young man trying

583
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,580
to get out from under
his domineering father

584
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:05,422
while dealing
with the slow death of his wife.

585
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:07,167
That just saved me 12 bucks.

586
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,294
I'm not going to see it.

587
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,254
I'm not asking you to see it;
I'd like for you to be in it.

588
00:20:11,296 --> 00:20:13,631
No offense, I have a job.
I mean, I have a good thing.

589
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:15,091
- Oh, hey, Mr. O'Brien.
- Hey, how's it going?

590
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,010
- Real good.
- Andy, quick note.

591
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:19,512
Uh, just 'cause I look at you
when we're doing the show

592
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,764
and ask you a question doesn't
mean you have to respond.

593
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:23,683
Sometimes it's funny
when you don't say anything,

594
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:26,144
and the audience gets
to think, "Hey,

595
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:27,645
Andy really is stupid."

596
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,482
Gets a big laugh.

597
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:32,317
- Hey, you're new.
- I've been here a year.

598
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:34,486
And you're funny, too.

599
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:35,778
Let's get you set up
in a writer's office.

600
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,655
Oh, you can have Andy's
if you don't mind

601
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:39,449
the smell of bologna.

602
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:41,284
I'm in.

603
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:44,829
♪ You're simply the best... ♪

604
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:47,582
Michael had assembled
his dream team,

605
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:50,293
and now it was time
to wow his boss.

606
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:51,896
Excuse me, sir,
could you turn that off,

607
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,879
please?

608
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,340
Oh, I thought
that was playing in here.

609
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:57,800
Sorry, it was a slide show
of my granddaughter's--

610
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:59,677
daughter's graduation
from college.

611
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:01,054
- Sure. - Michael.
- High school.

612
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:03,097
- Hi.
- Did you get the signatures?

613
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:05,642
Better-- I put together
the core team: acting

614
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:07,560
- and writing.
- You guys do remember

615
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:10,230
I have to be back in Burbank
by 1:00 every day, right?

616
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,648
- We've got that, uh-huh.
- I'm looking forward to this.

617
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,441
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is happening.

618
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,235
- It is happening.
- It's happening.

619
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:16,277
Dude, you are moving
way too fast.

620
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,529
Maybe by Hollywood standards,

621
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,822
you know, but, Kitty, I come
from the business community,

622
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:22,867
where sometimes you have to
show it to him already built.

623
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,744
Still think
you're going to bury me?

624
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:27,872
Well, Michael, you may not
have your father's signature,

625
00:21:27,914 --> 00:21:30,416
but you sure have
his signature style.

626
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,793
Cue the music.

627
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:35,672
I think I just deleted my pitch.

628
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:37,799
As it turns out,
it wouldn't matter.

629
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:41,678
Uh-oh.

630
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,846
Hello, think there's a problem
with the elevator.

631
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:45,390
Do you have
a scheduled appointment?

632
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,792
N-No, we're here
to see Ron Howard.

633
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,851
This is the untitled
Michael B. project.

634
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:50,645
I'm actually a producer here.
How are you?

635
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:51,854
I've got the office
just below the sunken

636
00:21:51,896 --> 00:21:53,273
living room there in Brian's.

637
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:54,774
We're here to pitch
Ron the movie.

638
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,317
I'm sorry, sir, this is
a restricted floor.

639
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,860
Louisa, it's all right.

640
00:21:57,902 --> 00:22:00,280
For crying out loud,
I'm not the king of England.

641
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:02,448
- Ah, there he is, hey, Ron.
- Oh, did you get that signature?

642
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,242
You know, I've got
something better--

643
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:05,577
take a look.

644
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:07,328
Andy Richter?

645
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,455
I'm out,  it, I'm out.

646
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:11,165
Not married to Andy,

647
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,543
- but what I do have is the writer.
- Stephan Gentles,

648
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:15,795
Warden, East Orange County
Department of Corrections

649
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:19,716
and writer of multiple episodes
of Rocko's Modern Life.

650
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:21,384
Well, everybody's got
to start somewhere.

651
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:24,262
As long as I don't end up there.

652
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:26,764
I'll have 25 pages on your desk
by tomorrow morning.

653
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:28,391
Gosh, that's

654
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:29,809
- putting the cart before the horse.
- Oh, yeah.

655
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:32,312
Loo-Look who I've got
to play Carl Weathers.

656
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:33,396
Oh, is that Cuba?

657
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:34,814
No, no, n-n-no,
that's not Cuba.

658
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:37,483
I did not want to
waste Cuba on Carl.

659
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:38,776
This is Carl Weathers.

660
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:40,695
Oh, sure, Carl.

661
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:42,530
You know, I thought it was Cuba

662
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:44,324
with the perfect
Carl Weathers makeup.

663
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:47,493
No, no, no, no, Cuba doesn't
have that kind of range.

664
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:48,911
The thing is,
I really do insist

665
00:22:48,953 --> 00:22:51,205
- on controlling the casting myself.
- I get it. - I'm out.

666
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:53,448
I thought maybe if you just saw
the whole team together.

667
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,917
Team, what team?

668
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,461
I should be informed
of all meetings.

669
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:57,837
Hey, Cuba, how you doing?

670
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,881
Oh, Brian, you know Carl
Weathers, Stephan Gentles,

671
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,674
Andy Richter,
and Michael Booth.

672
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,348
I'm gonna skip this one.

673
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:09,807
Good to see you, Brian.

674
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:11,893
You know, Ron, I think
it might be easier to talk

675
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,728
if we just come up
just the rest of the way.

676
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,979
Oh, thanks.

677
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:17,815
Yeah, the elevator's been kooky
since we lowered that floor...

678
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:19,651
but maybe
once you get that signature.

679
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:21,235
It might be kind of tricky.

680
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:22,612
They're all down
in Orange County.

681
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,572
- Tough to get down there.
- Oh, hey, B.

682
00:23:24,614 --> 00:23:26,240
- Yeah. - We must have an office
down there somewhere.

683
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:27,283
Yeah, we'll stick you someplace.

684
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:28,368
Yeah.

685
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:29,535
We'll stick you someplace.

686
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:36,000
Michael was starting work

687
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,168
at his new show business office

688
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:40,588
- at Orange County Imagine.
- Charles Dawkins.

689
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,591
And his office was already
receiving a lot of visitors.

690
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:45,927
Don't get comfortable.
Sir, thank you, no.

691
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,261
But mostly because
of the sign's similarity

692
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:48,971
to that of this institution,

693
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:51,432
which also received
some confused visitors.

694
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:52,892
An embolism?

695
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:54,352
I-I was just here
to pitch a game show.

696
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:56,771
Go right out this way,
sir, thank you.

697
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:57,939
- But can I leave a sample?
- It's generous

698
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,982
of you, but they're gonna be
much better

699
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:02,235
with it down there at Imaging.

700
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,557
And that's when Michael got
his most unexpected visitor.

701
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:10,326
Dad, what are you doing here?

702
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:14,288
I wanted to speak
to you in person.

703
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,290
I think that you're
a little late, okay?

704
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:19,919
Because I went to you
for a simple signature,

705
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:22,588
not so I could just make
a movie about the family,

706
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,257
but so that I can move on
with my life,

707
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,175
and you told me to go to hell.

708
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,094
Yeah, you know, sometimes,
when I'm caught off guard,

709
00:24:28,136 --> 00:24:30,430
I say things I don't mean.

710
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:32,140
This is a horrible
little office.

711
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,861
So you're here to apologize,
is that right?

712
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,853
Yes, and I, uh, brought
you a peace offering.

713
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:39,021
Tetas Gigantes?

714
00:24:39,063 --> 00:24:40,189
You hate it, right?

715
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,649
Well, it's, it's Mexican porn.

716
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:44,193
You know, you are
impossible to buy for.

717
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,445
Just, uh, give it to me.

718
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:46,529
- No, no, oh.
- No, no, no, give...

719
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:48,406
- No, no, no.
- See, this is the  kayak

720
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:50,116
- all over again.
- Dad, I apologize.

721
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:52,076
I was saying it was
a very original gift.

722
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:53,243
No, no, no.
You'll never use it.

723
00:24:53,286 --> 00:24:56,246
I will use it, except
for maybe Señor Señoritas.

724
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:58,124
I live in Mexico now

725
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,334
and I, I don't always
know how to ask

726
00:25:00,376 --> 00:25:01,961
- exactly for what I want.
- Understandable.

727
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:03,588
And that's almost over now,

728
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:07,508
which is what I came
to talk to you about.

729
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,135
Do you know a guy
named Herbert Love?

730
00:25:09,177 --> 00:25:10,386
I know a lot of people, sure,

731
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:12,262
'cause I'm a big producer now.

732
00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:13,890
- Yeah?
- He ate a mouse.

733
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,309
Let's grab a coffee.

734
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,060
Okay, so I guess things
haven't been going

735
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:19,520
that well for me.

736
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:21,981
And you didn't feel
you could tell me that?

737
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:23,273
That's why I haven't
heard from you?

738
00:25:23,316 --> 00:25:25,193
I guess I was afraid
that if I admitted

739
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,569
Sudden Valley was a failure...

740
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:29,238
- Told you so.
- ...you might say, "I told you so."

741
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,492
Well, then, you don't
know me at all.

742
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,410
It's all right, it's my fault. I
bit off more than I could chew.

743
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:36,162
I mean, I lied
about being a big shot

744
00:25:36,204 --> 00:25:39,332
to impress this girl
whose name I don't even know.

745
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:42,460
I've got this crazy idea
that I'm gonna turn into a star

746
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:45,087
with a film that I can't
get made 'cause I can't get

747
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,506
my own father's signature
on, on, on a release.

748
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,174
- It's like, you know...
- Shh, shh, shh...

749
00:25:48,216 --> 00:25:52,553
I didn't know it was
about lying to a girl.

750
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:55,556
Give me the release.

751
00:25:55,598 --> 00:25:56,974
You'd do this for me?

752
00:25:57,016 --> 00:25:58,976
Of course I will.

753
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:00,978
And so, with his
father's rights in hand,

754
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,022
Michael the producer headed up

755
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:05,483
to find his lady
"Cinderella Man"

756
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:07,109
at the Ealing Club,

757
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:08,945
an exclusive show business
hangout.

758
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,112
Ron Howard.

759
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:11,656
Oh, thank you.

760
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:14,242
No, it's Michael Bluth. Hi.

761
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:15,660
Oh, I remember.

762
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,411
I did it.

763
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:18,454
I got my father's signature.

764
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,081
You know, you said
you wanted to focus

765
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,415
on the father-son relationship,
and I love it.

766
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:23,125
Who's not going to
be able to relate

767
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,418
to a son standing up to
his self-centered father?

768
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,003
Sure.

769
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:27,505
But the father-son relationship
I was interested in

770
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:31,341
was not you and your father,
it was you and your son.

771
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:33,511
You're the father.

772
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:36,346
But that would make
my son the son.

773
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:37,598
Bingo.

774
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,308
Michael had to decide

775
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,477
whether being a producer
was worth invading

776
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,690
the privacy of a son who had
kicked him out for that reason.

777
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,233
I don't think I can do it.
I don't think I can go...

778
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:48,985
I can't go to my son.

779
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:51,361
That's, uh-- I just--
I don't even think

780
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:53,614
that it's worth it just to say
that I'm a producer, like...

781
00:26:53,656 --> 00:26:54,991
- It's your call.
- Yeah.

782
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:58,953
Maybe the real estate business
will come around soon.

783
00:26:58,995 --> 00:27:01,080
Will it?

784
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:04,959
I could never reveal that
information to a non-producer.

785
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:06,210
And then he heard something

786
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:08,378
that made him change his mind.

787
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:09,755
Michael?

788
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:12,174
Mr. Moobie Producer.

789
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,426
That's me.

790
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:19,098
And like all bagpipe music,

791
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,517
it was hard to tell if it was
good music played horribly

792
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,353
or horrible music played well,

793
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,063
but Michael was eager
to find out

794
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:28,274
her name
when she was introduced

795
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,109
at the end of the set.

796
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,570
And tonight on bagpipes...

797
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:39,785
But he got to know her anyway.

798
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:41,746
Fantastic.

799
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,539
I'm only doing this
in between movies,

800
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:46,292
which, given how badly I bombed
at that audition yesterday,

801
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:48,044
it's going to be a while.

802
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:49,419
Yeah, you shouldn't worry
about that, you're gonna get

803
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:51,047
something.
You know, sometimes

804
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,757
even students make films.

805
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,010
Yeah, that's really funny.

806
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:58,054
I just could put
your name in for something.

807
00:27:58,095 --> 00:27:59,180
I do know Ron Howard.

808
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,225
Love that I make you laugh.

809
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,394
You seriously would be
great for this part.

810
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,271
You remind me of the person
that, that it's based on.

811
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:09,690
Uh, she, she actually
dies on camera.

812
00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:10,691
Wow.

813
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,276
Make her mentally challenged

814
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:13,611
and I'll thank you
in my Oscar speech.

815
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:14,820
There's a part like that, too,

816
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,781
only she-she comes in later

817
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:19,659
and she's British,
so she doesn't seem...

818
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,494
No one could ever tell
that she's disabled.

819
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,496
I haven't been in work mode
for a while to be honest.

820
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:26,165
I've been, I've been
raising my son.

821
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:27,541
Oh, you have a son?
I have a son.

822
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,210
- You do?
- Oh, yeah, we've got a little issue,

823
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,211
though, right now.

824
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:31,379
Let me guess.

825
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,755
He's pushing you away?

826
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:34,715
- Yes.
- My son practically

827
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:36,759
kicked me out of his school
the other day.

828
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:39,261
That is literally
what my son did to me.

829
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,721
Then I said to him,

830
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,473
"You have no privacy from me."

831
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:44,183
That's what I should do.

832
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,476
Lem's six in August.

833
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:46,477
Yours?

834
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,354
- Seven in July.
- Aw...

835
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:49,647
Michael regretted the lie,

836
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:51,649
so he sort of split
the difference.

837
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:54,193
Teen-- 17

838
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:55,403
- in July.
- Oh.

839
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:56,779
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

840
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:59,156
Oh, wow.

841
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,784
Well, I guess you got to move
on with your life sometime.

842
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:05,204
Yes.

843
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:08,582
Yes, you do.

844
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,584
Oh, n-no, you know what?

845
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:13,504
I don't think that this
is-- it's not a good idea.

846
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:15,297
This is a great idea.
Why don't you think this is

847
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:16,841
- a great idea?
- 'Cause people can see.

848
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,718
- Nobody can see.
- Oh, God.

849
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,720
Wow, you weren't kidding

850
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:23,139
when you said you had
a part for me.

851
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,724
- That was absolutely insane.
- Thanks.

852
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:27,101
I've never done anything
that crazy before.

853
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:28,269
- Perfect.
- I want to do a lot more of that.

854
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,395
I want to see you again.

855
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:31,230
I want to take you out
to a nice dinner.

856
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:32,565
- Oh.
- So, then, uh...

857
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:35,484
Well, this will have
to tide you over until then.

858
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,278
Oh, look at those.

859
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,654
Boy, without this, I wouldn't
know you had a tattoo.

860
00:29:38,696 --> 00:29:39,905
Oh, anyone that gets
that much clothing

861
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:41,824
off me better know my name.

862
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:45,244
- Good night.
- Good night.

863
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:50,291
And that's when
Michael finally saw her name.

864
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,876
Oh, my God.

865
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:56,255
I'm dating
Ron Howard's girlfriend.

866
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,424
Actually she's his daughter.

867
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:01,969
But that's kind of worse,
don't you think?

868
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:07,767
Michael starts
to really learn the business.

869
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,477
We can keep going around
another 20 minutes, if you want,

870
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:10,853
but I know what
I'm talking about.

871
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:13,481
I just went through this
last week with a guy.

872
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,357
That is a hernia.

873
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:16,942
I'm gonna send you to my guy
over at Hoag Hospital.

874
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,360
They call him the
Bulge Whisperer.

875
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:20,738
He does 20 of these a week.

876
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,782
And after failing to
get back to Burbank on time,

877
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,617
Andy calls in a favor

878
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:26,243
from his identical
quintuplet brother Rocky.

879
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:28,287
All right, my next guest
is a famous pilot

880
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:31,707
who safely crashed his plane
into the Hudson River.

881
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:33,292
That's kind of a
coincidence, Andy.

882
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,795
We've got a pilot
who crashes planes,

883
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:38,798
and you're an actor
who crashes pilots.

884
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,717
And Rocky hurts two nice
red-haired guys' feelings...

885
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,511
Yeah, that's really funny.

886
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:45,346
You know what else
would be funny?

887
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,264
If I ripped that red rug
right off your head

888
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,892
and turned you into Ron Howard.

889
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:53,302
...while getting the biggest
laugh of Andy's career.

890
00:30:53,767 --> 00:31:03,391
