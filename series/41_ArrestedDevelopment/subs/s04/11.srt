00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:09,150
NARRATOR: <i>Gob Bluth had just</i>
<i>been told by his father</i>

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,653
<i>to go to work</i>
<i>for his younger brother.</i>

4
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:13,447
And then thanks
for the birthday card

5
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:16,574
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,410
NARRATOR:
<i>In fact,</i>

7
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,454
<i>- it was a brother with whom Gob...</i>
- What the hell?

8
00:00:20,496 --> 00:00:21,663
- (horns honking)
<i>- ...was secretly competitive.</i>

9
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:22,956
MICHAEL:
I got the right of way.

10
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:25,375
- GOB: N-No.
- MICHAEL: Okay. (laughs)

11
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:29,004
NARRATOR: <i>And perhaps it was</i>
<i>that sense of competition...</i>

12
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:31,631
(tires screeching, horn honking)

13
00:00:31,673 --> 00:00:33,758
<i>...that led</i>
<i>to this tinkling match.</i>

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,593
GOB:
<i>I've met someone.</i>

15
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,305
Can't really give you any
information-- kind of famousy.

16
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:39,973
- I also met someone.
- Have you?

17
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:42,184
Also famousy.
Can't give <i>you</i> any information.

18
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:44,686
- Is it Julie Bowen?
- No, it's not.

19
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:46,355
- Is yours Julie Bowen?
- Is yours Julie...?

20
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:49,107
Oh, my God, Michael,
you're seeing Julie Bowen?

21
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,359
I am not seeing Julie Bowen,

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,569
but if you are,
you tell me right now.

23
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,322
I want to hear you say the words
"I'm not seeing Julie Bowen."

24
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:57,491
I have not seen Julie Bowen.

25
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,950
Well, that's a funny way
to phrase it.

26
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,785
NARRATOR:
<i>This went on for some time,</i>

27
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,497
<i>but eventually</i>
<i>they started talking business.</i>

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,541
If it wasn't for the movie
thing, I would do it myself.

29
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:06,749
They practically sell
themselves; you just got

30
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,418
- to bring the people in.
- (squawk)

31
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,795
- Lindsay.
<i>- But soon the hard lemonade softened</i>

32
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,548
<i>- their competitive edge.</i>
- No, no, this-- maybe Tobias.

33
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:14,090
<i>And Michael confessed</i>

34
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:18,136
<i>that he had grown estranged</i>
<i>from his son.</i>

35
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,471
I'll call him for you.

36
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,557
You've given me
a new sense of purpose.

37
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,392
I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

38
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:26,019
You know, when I said that, that
these places sell themselves,

39
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:29,856
I should have gone on to say,
you know, that, that, uh...

40
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:31,441
No, they don't.

41
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:33,776
No, I'm not talking
about selling these mausoleums.

42
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:36,029
I mean destroying Tony Wonder.

43
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:38,407
I'm gonna destroy his career the
same way that he destroyed mine.

44
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,867
NARRATOR: <i>Gob was referring</i>
<i>to an escape act</i>

45
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,744
<i>he'd performed that had failed</i>

46
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:44,496
<i>when the hidden compartment</i>
<i>that held</i>

47
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,998
<i>the keys to his escape</i>
<i>hadn't opened...</i>

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,166
- It's not going to work.
<i>- ...humiliating him</i>

49
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,585
<i>in front of his bride...</i>

50
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:51,920
<i>- uh, her...</i>
- He's not coming back.

51
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:54,005
<i>...and all of Christendom.</i>

52
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,508
Destroying Tony Wonder is
your sense of purpose?

53
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,051
I thought you said,
thanks to me...

54
00:01:58,093 --> 00:01:59,344
Because he's performing
at a gay club tonight,

55
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,762
and I need you to act as
my boyfriend

56
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:01,804
to help me get in.

57
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm gonna say no, thank you.

58
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:05,308
And don't you think
it's a little inappropriate?

59
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,768
I am your brother.

60
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:08,562
You sound like my son.

61
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:11,648
NARRATOR: <i>Whom Gob had spoken to</i>
<i>earlier that day.</i>

62
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,025
<i>- And in a van, by the way.</i>
- Hey, you remembered.

63
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:18,363
(chuckles) How about you and I
go to a magic show together?

64
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,615
(laughing):
I love magic, of course.

65
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,617
I mean, my dad's a magician.

66
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:25,370
- Well, you're my dad, I mean,
so, so you should know. - Right.

67
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:29,124
Well, it'd be sort of a, a
father-son thing at a gay club.

68
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:30,959
Well, technically gay night
at a magic club.

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,502
Hey, you know what'd be funny?

70
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,254
If you pretended
to be my boyfriend

71
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:35,422
so I could lock
this guy Tony Wonder...

72
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,257
You know, I-I don't know,

73
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:39,884
I-I don't think this whole thing
is sounding like a good idea.

74
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,220
Besides, last time we tried
to do something together,

75
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,805
- you didn't even show up.
- You know what?

76
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:46,141
You're mad at me--
I get it, I totally get it,

77
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:48,977
- and guess what--I'm mad at you.
- You know, Dad,

78
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:51,480
that attitude might be
why you're alone all the time.

79
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:53,565
- The way you treat people...
- What about you?

80
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,192
I didn't hear from you
for your entire childhood,

81
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:57,944
and then thanks
for the birthday card

82
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:02,282
that I never got from you
for the last 40 years.

83
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:03,866
NARRATOR:
<i>This was extra hard for Steve</i>

84
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:06,035
<i>to hear on his actual birthday.</i>

85
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:07,370
And didn't you already try
locking Tony Wonder in

86
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:09,164
- his trick?
- Oh, yeah, but that

87
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:11,082
wasn't for revenge,
that was just on spec.

88
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,043
- Just like Tony Wonder.
<i>- And it didn't work. Besides,</i>

89
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:16,129
that's before I knew that
he had locked me in my trick.

90
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,423
You still don't know that he
tried to lock you in your trick.

91
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,342
Hey, I do know, I have proof.

92
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:25,054
I went in that cave
and I found this.

93
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:26,640
We both know
what that stands for.

94
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:27,683
Jesus.

95
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:28,808
No, that would be a "J."

96
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,226
This is a "T."

97
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:32,312
Tony Wonder was there
in the cave the night

98
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:34,564
that I did my big illusion,
so when I went yesterday

99
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,566
to the cave and I saw
that this had wedged

100
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:39,486
my compartment door shut,
I knew that I'd been wronged.

101
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:40,808
Okay, the only thing
that we know

102
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,406
is that you tried to
lock Tony Wonder

103
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:44,366
in his trick first.

104
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,659
- Right?
- No,

105
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,951
- no.
- So you're even.

106
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,578
Because mine didn't work.

107
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,539
He got the last laugh,
which, in this case, happened

108
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,998
to be the first laugh.
I don't understand

109
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,375
why you can't seem to follow me

110
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,168
- on any of this.
- Gob, you've got a chance

111
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,671
to build a brand-new life.
Don't run away from it again.

112
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:59,715
- Don't try to escape it.
- I don't do that, Michael.

113
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,550
Listen, if you insist
on speaking to me like you're

114
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:03,885
my wife, then don't be surprised
to find my (bleep) in you

115
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:05,928
and then you never hear
from me again.

116
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,181
(sighs)
I'm offering you a good job

117
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:11,393
selling good homes,
making real good money,

118
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:16,022
and I'm not asking
for anything in return.

119
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:17,899
What is this?

120
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,192
I'm asking for a little
something in return.

121
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:20,569
These-- this is for the movie.

122
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,320
This is for your life rights
in perpetuity,

123
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,322
in the known universe
and beyond.

124
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,115
Blah, blah, blah, look at this.

125
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:27,992
What's that mean--
you're not gonna sign it?

126
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,536
No, I was just thinking

127
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:32,080
that I should have my attorney
Bob Loblaw look at this.

128
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:34,082
Oh, he doesn't need to-- it's
all pretty boilerplate stuff.

129
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:35,204
Yeah, no, I'm fine with it.

130
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,959
I'm gonna be in a movie.

131
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,127
- (laughs)
- No, you're not.

132
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,547
I'm gonna be in a movie. Okay.

133
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:42,257
NARRATOR:
<i>Now the story of a family</i>

134
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:45,927
<i>whose future</i>
<i>was abruptly canceled,</i>

135
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:47,596
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

136
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:49,472
<i>but to keep himself together.</i>

137
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:55,520
<i>It's Gob's</i>
Arrested Development.

138
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,275
<i>Gob was making good</i>
<i>on a promise</i>

139
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,110
<i>- he had made to Michael...</i>
- GEORGE MICHAEL: Hi, Uncle Gob.

140
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:04,070
I need to see you tonight.

141
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,948
<i>- ...to talk to his son.</i>
- It's about your father and you.

142
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:09,284
Really, is... is he upset?

143
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,369
(over phone):
Do I seem like a clown to you?

144
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,746
I got it.

145
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,468
Do I seem like some kind
of a clown to you?

146
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:16,458
Look, I got it, I got it,
Uncle Gob, just tell me where.

147
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:19,294
Meet me tonight
at the Gothic Castle.

148
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:20,712
I will-- the Gothic Castle?

149
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,297
No, the Gothicassle.
Yes, the Gothic Castle.

150
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:23,965
No, I didn't say
the Gothicassle.

151
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:25,842
What, what do you think,
they call it the Gothicassle?

152
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:27,176
No, I said the Gothic Castle.

153
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:28,804
- It's the Gothic Castle.
- Gothic Castle.

154
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,012
Okay.

155
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,641
TAILOR:
I think you look amazing.

156
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:34,183
I'll take it.

157
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:35,518
- Great.
- No, no.

158
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,480
The compliment, not the shirt.

159
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,774
NARRATOR: <i>And so it was</i>
<i>a very worried George Michael</i>

160
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:44,235
<i>that arrived to speak to</i>
<i>his uncle at the Gothic Castle,</i>

161
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,195
<i>which, that night,</i>
<i>did actually kind of resemble</i>

162
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:47,489
<i>the Gothicassle.</i>

163
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,699
- Uncle Gob.
- Don't call me Unc...

164
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:51,200
Actually, no, that's good,
that works here.

165
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:52,910
Is my dad upset?
What's going on?

166
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,704
- No, he's fine.
- But you told me he was really upset

167
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:56,539
- about something.
- I don't know.

168
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,916
I do know that your daddy
wants you to get

169
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,293
your hot, little, tight,
little, hot ass

170
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,128
right up there right away
to see him.

171
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,005
- BOUNCER: You're good.
- You, you had me come all the way here

172
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:05,674
just to tell me
my dad wants me to meet him?

173
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,509
No, no, those two things
are unrelated.

174
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,594
No, I'm, I'm here 'cause
I'm trying to lock this guy Tony

175
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,095
into this gay magic trick,

176
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,515
and I just needed
a believable arm candy bean.

177
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,558
And don't make that face;
you look homophobic.

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,352
- No, I'm not being homophobic.
- Why are you doing this?

179
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,103
- I'm, I'm uncomfortable.
- This is very important for me.

180
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,986
Don't worry, you're blending in
here perfectly.

181
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:21,939
A newbie.

182
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,983
(chuckles)
Except,

183
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,443
even if he does post that
somewhere,

184
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,778
the Fakeblock thing
will scrub it away.

185
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,571
You know about Fakeblock?

186
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:30,532
You know, that's my software.

187
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:32,617
I wonder if my dad thinks
I'm blowing him off

188
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,661
because that's starting
to take off now.

189
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:36,830
Well, you should go find out
'cause I do know that your dad

190
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:38,874
is really, really,
really upset with you.

191
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,709
He is upset?
I asked you that.

192
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,002
That was literally
the first thing I asked you.

193
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:44,880
You're giving me these craz...

194
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,422
- Mad?
- N...

195
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:48,299
- God, what is that inky taste?
- It's my stamp.

196
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,926
- Oh, I'm so sorry about that.
- No, that-that's okay.

197
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:52,178
I probably won't come back in.

198
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,180
I-I'm gonna go see my dad.

199
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:55,932
Yeah, you are
'cause you're a good son.

200
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,560
Ow!

201
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,520
- Bit my tongue, that little bitch.
<i>- Oh, no, he didn't.</i>

202
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:02,856
- They're always doing that.
<i>- I mean, oh, no, he didn't.</i>

203
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:05,149
Thank you, George Michael;
honestly I owe you big-time.

204
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,276
Not a lot of nephews
would do this for their uncles.

205
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:08,528
Now get out of here.

206
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,739
I never want to sleep
with you again.

207
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,407
I mean, I probably will.
(whispers): I don't.

208
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:13,867
But are we good?

209
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,549
- We're good.
<i>- After successfully looking</i>

212
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,376
Knowing that Tony would go
into the closet

213
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:25,336
and pop out of somewhere else,

214
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,256
Gob proceeded to lock
everything he could find.

215
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:33,219
Who's the dumbwaiter now?

by society.

"Don't talk to us," they said.

00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:13,009
"Keep your hands to yourself,"
they also said.

229
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:17,430
Magic is only for straight men.

TONY: I don't want
to look at you, son.

233
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:29,150
Just go to work.

234
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:32,988
Why can't you be
like your brother?

235
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:38,618
There! Stay in there!

- We don't want you out here!

Well, I'm here,
I'm queer, and now...

238
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:47,293
I'm in a chair!

239
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,712
- Did somebody say Wonder?
- (audience cheering)

240
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:51,339
NARRATOR:
<i>Nobody actually did that time,</i>

241
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,174
<i>but I think</i>
<i>he got away with it.</i>

242
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:55,760
Didn't expect to see you here.
Want to get a drink later?

243
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,179
<i>And believe it or not,</i>
<i>it was this trick...</i>

244
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,848
Now everybody's gay!

245
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,266
<i>...that really brought</i>
<i>the crowd to their feet.</i>

246
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,728
<i>Although it was pretty easy</i>
<i>to figure out how he did it.</i>

247
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,188
<i>They started out gay.</i>

248
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,106
You missed your cue!

249
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,275
<i>Gob was having a drink</i>
<i>with a man</i>

250
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,069

Beanbag chair-- I was wondering
what you were gonna pop out of.

252
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,033
Did somebody say Wonder...

253
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:19,701
...ing?

254
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:21,995
I always try to stay one step
ahead of the audience.

255
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:23,038
<i>Vamanos!</i>

256
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,834
Oh, hey, come on, man.

257
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:29,168
Timing, right?

258
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,294
Hey, leave the mask.

259
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,546
Yeah, of course-- mask.

260
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:32,881
Yeah, that makes sense.

261
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:34,549
I use a mask myself, in my act.

262
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,218
But you have to tell me how
you do that bean bag trick.

263
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,261
Well, I guess,
since you're a magician, too.

264
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:40,388
But not a word of this.

265
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,598
(whispering):
I did use a mask.

266
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,808
I put it on another guy,

267
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,250
and then I was
in the bean bag chair

268
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:46,310
the whole time.

269
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,896
Oh, well, that's... that's...

270
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:49,605
(whispering): ...that's why
they put that sign

271
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:51,649
on the bean bag chair that says,
"Do not steal this..."

272
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,526
<i>And the magicians</i>
<i>shared the secrets</i>

273
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:55,361
<i>of their ancient</i>
<i>and mystical craft.</i>

274
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:57,321
TONY (whispering): And also
it's very hard to get out of

00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,198
(normal volume):
at the end, when I appear.

276
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,658
So how have you been?

277
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,411
I haven't seen you
since your "wedding,"

278
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:04,913
when you did the Jesus gag.

279
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,873
See, it's like a quotation mark,
but with a "W."

280
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,374
Oh, yeah, right, I got ya.

281
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,085
That's... I should do that.

282
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:11,210
Hey, don't. Okay?

283
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:13,546
I-I... I won't.

284
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:16,007
Yeah, uh, no, the marriage
was unsuccessful.

285
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,052
I guess you could say
I was a runaway groom.

286
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:20,887
Well, makes sense now,
doesn't it?

287
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,097
What do you mean?

288
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,180
Well, I mean,
you are gay, right?

289
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,058
Oh, yes, right, yeah.

290
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,476
Very... because of
what I'm... dressed...

291
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:28,937
And my boyfriend
was here earlier.

292
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,396
And-and he bit my tongue.

293
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:32,189
<i>And that's when Gob did</i>

294
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,524
<i>a magic trick of his own.</i>

295
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,276
- Want to see?
- No, I believe you.

296
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:36,569
I'm just surprised, though,

297
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,613
because you are
the Christian magician.

298
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:40,990
Although you did look awfully
shredded on that cross.

299
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:42,408
You should have seen me

300
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,952
when they took me
out of the storage locker.

301
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,871
- Hmm.
- But how'd I get in the storage locker?

302
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,289
That's okay;
I know it didn't work.

303
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,916
Made the "Woops" column
in <i>Poof.</i>

304
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,085
<i>It's cool, though, man;</i>
<i>I've been there.</i>

305
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:53,252
<i>Your assistant probably</i>
<i>sabotaged you.</i>

306
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:54,796
I don't even use one anymore.

307
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:55,964
I resorted to using my own legs

308
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,673
in the
"Saw the Lady in Half" gag.

309
00:10:57,715 --> 00:10:58,967
I even shaved them.

310
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,218
Want to feel?

311
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,470
Wow, they are smooth.

312
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:04,305
Like a lady's.

313
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:05,974
I think.

314
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,600
(laughing)

315
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,310
You're funny.

316
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,146
- Too bad we can't do this more.
- Why?

317
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:12,354
I don't know if it'd be

318
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:13,773
great for my reputation
to be seen

319
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,900
with the fundamentalist
Christian magician.

320
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,487
<i>And he was suspicious that Gob</i>
<i>might not actually be gay.</i>

321
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,906
MAN: Valet is closing.
The Cabriolet--

322
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,575
- license plate: "ANUS TART."
- That's me.

323
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,452
Aw, what the hell, let's do it.

324
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:29,497
<i>And that's when Gob came up</i>
<i>with a new revenge plan.</i>

325
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:30,915
Yeah, let's risk it.

326
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,083
Right? Let's risk it!

327
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,584
Come on.

328
00:11:35,252 --> 00:11:39,882
<i>The next day, Gob shared</i>
<i>his new plan with Tobias.</i>

329
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:41,258
Good. Seems like
you're done talking.

330
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,927
I, too, am in a relationship,

331
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,596
but mine is purely
a revenge-based deal.

332
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,974
Plan on making this person
fall in love with me

333
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:50,601
and then destroying them
by breaking their heart.

334
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,353
How do you make someone
fall in love with you?

335
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:54,396
- Can you pass the mustard, please?
- Yeah.

336
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,024
Oh, it's easy when
you've got so much in common.

337
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:57,525
Last night, for instance,

338
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,027
we both got a case
of the munchies,

339
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,987
and then we went out
and we stole these pies...

340
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,033
<i>As it turns out, they did</i>
<i>a lot more than steal pies.</i>

341
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:08,870
<i>They had a raucous good time.</i>

342
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:10,329
And then the candy
bean dish right here,

343
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:11,706
we made those
at "Color Me Mine,"

344
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:13,208
and I know they're
kind of cockeyed,

345
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,168
but they remind us both
of my crooked smile.

346
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,294
Sounds like you're really
into this girl.

347
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,047
Don't call me girl, friend.

348
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,923
No, this is purely
an act of revenge,

349
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,218
filled with white-hot hate.

350
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:26,054
I'd tell you on who, but this
person is sort of a celebrity.

351
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,138
Oh!

352
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,306
Well, turns out my femme fatale

353
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,725
is a bit of a celebrity herself.

354
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,560
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>Gob found a solution</i>

355
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,436
<i>to filling one of the houses.</i>

356
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:36,022
...I've been looking
for a place to live.

357
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:37,565
That's great.
When can you move in?

358
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,275
Uh, duh! Now!

359
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,944
Oh, the other sex offenders
are going to be so jealous.

360
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:44,780
Wait a minute...

361
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:47,867
you know of other people
with similar needs?

362
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,702
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>he filled the rest.</i>

363
00:12:49,744 --> 00:12:51,453
Oh, I have a list of men

364
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:54,040
that could fill
every opening you have.

365
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:56,333
(coughing)

366
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,419
(laughs, coughs)

367
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,838
Let me get a shot of mustard.

368
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,882
That was all cheese,
but no mustard.

369
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:04,633
<i>Not wanting</i>
<i>to appear desperate,</i>

370
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:08,345
<i>Gob waited till late afternoon</i>
<i>to continue his plan</i>

371
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,056
<i>to make Tony</i>
<i>fall in love with him.</i>

372
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,807
TONY (recorded):
It's Tony.

373
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:15,394
I'm not here right now,
because I'm right behind you.

374
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:17,146
Made you look.

375
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,689
But how did I know you looked?

376
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,316
Because I'm right behind you!

377
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:24,195
Made you look again.

378
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,487
Tony, it's Gob.

379
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,865
Man, does anybody
ever fall for that?

380
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,035
Listen, uh, I was just,
I was thinking about you--

381
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,079
what a fun night
we had the other night.

382
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:35,164
So just call me
when you get a chance.

383
00:13:35,206 --> 00:13:37,125
Okay? All right.

384
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,127
(ringtone plays)

385
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:40,211
Wow, that was fast,
you hot little...

386
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,921
- It's your mother.
- Hi.

387
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:43,756
Sorry, I thought you were
somebody else.

388
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:46,092
I can't tell you who, 'cause I'm
dating someone famous.

389
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:48,677
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was given a new job.</i>

390
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,679
You better start
to build this wall, pronto.

391
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:53,308
I tried with your father,
but he can't do it.

392
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,310
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>was told to make it</i>

393
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,145
(with Lucille):
<i>...look like major construction</i>

394
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:58,437
<i>had begun on the wall.</i>

395
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:01,649
<i>So Gob set out to find a crew.</i>

396
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,192
(men shouting)

397
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:06,403
- (feedback screeching)
- Who wants to... (screaming)

398
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,696
Hurt my ears.

399
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:10,325
Who wants
to help me build a wall...

400
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,743
to keep Mexicans out of America?

401
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,536
(bleep)
All right, all right!

402
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:15,621
(men shouting in Spanish)

403
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:17,081
Who wants to help me

404
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,457
build a wall for no reason?

405
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:20,417
It's a different wall.

406
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,460
(men shouting, cursing)

407
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:23,629
- (bleep)
- (men shouting angrily)

408
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:24,964
(bleep)

409
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,090
(Gob shouting,
feedback screeching)

410
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,509
Aah! This thing is loud!

411
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,137
<i>And so he decided to head</i>
<i>to the border ribbon</i>

412
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:32,972
<i>to put in some</i>
<i>manual labor himself.</i>

413
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:34,431
GOB: ...show everyone
that I'm not afraid of

414
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,559
the sweet sting of sweat
in my eyes.

415
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,105
<i>...when he came across</i>
<i>a local maca picker.</i>

416
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,107
You need help to make
your sign stand up?

417
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,733
Yes. No!

418
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:47,278
I need to find some Mexicans
to help build this wall.

419
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,737
Hey, you know what?

420
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:49,947
You should get the Chinese
to build your wall.

421
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:50,948
We make great walls.

422
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,949
That would be great.

423
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,284
How can we make that happen?

424
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,410
I'm Chinese; I know all Chinese.

425
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:55,786
I hook you up.

426
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,163
- Well, that's, uh...
- (ringtone playing)

427
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:58,873
That'd be... great.

428
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:00,457
Would you get off
my (bleep), Mother!

429
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,793
Well, if I wasn't sure
you were gay, I am now.

430
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,087
It's Tony. Hey, Tony.

431
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,672
Sorry I couldn't
talk last night,

432
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:09,217
but, uh, I'd really love
to get together later.

433
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:11,593
This week,
or maybe Saturday, say, 5:00?

434
00:15:11,635 --> 00:15:13,262
- Great.
- I'm thinking Little Ballroom.

435
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:15,556
Little Ballroom good?
Or you sick of Little Ballroom?

436
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:18,226
- I'll see you there.
- Bye.

437
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:19,810
That was Tony.
My friend Tony.

438
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,021
Oh, she sounds wonderful.

439
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:24,606
No... no...
I'm gonna get revenge on him

440
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:26,359
and destroy his life.

441
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:27,776
Her life.

442
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,112
Our... life.

443
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:32,240
Destroy our life.

444
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,616
Destroy our life.

445
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:36,077
That doesn't matter.
Who cares?

446
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:38,413
<i>But Tony Wonder</i>
<i>had a secret, too.</i>

447
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:39,914
We're on.

448
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:41,832
And he definitely thinks
you're gay, right?

449
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,500
Don't worry, the only thing I'm
better at than (bleep)-ing women

450
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,420
is pretending I'm gay.

451
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,255
Trust me, I am all man.

452
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,257
Give me a little leg shave?

453
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,859
All right, well,
you have to be careful.

454
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,884
If Gob finds out
you're straight,

455
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:53,677
he'll use it to ruin you,

456
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,847
and I'll lose the hundred grand
I stole from Lucille Austero

457
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,640
to re-brand you
as the gay magician.

458
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:01,018
<i>It seemed Sally Sitwell</i>
<i>had a secret also.</i>

459
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,686
I know that.

460
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,105
Why are you telling me all this?

461
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:06,399
'Cause if she finds out,
we both go down.

462
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,161
And I don't want
to have to sell that closet

463
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:09,944
as a sweat sauna on Craigslist.

464
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:10,736
- Ow!
- Ooh. Sorry.

465
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:12,321
It's fine.

466
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:13,364
And as long as we're recapping

467
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,199
things that we already know,

468
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,575
an inside source tells me

469
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:19,412
he's my ticket
to Internet billions.

470
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:20,704
Inside source?

471
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,622
Oh, I didn't tell you that?

472
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:22,790
- No.
- That's new?

473
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:25,709
It's "in the bag."

474
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,170
<i>Tony made that sound</i>
<i>a lot cooler than it was.</i>

475
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:29,255
That Fakeblock thing will
scrub it away.

476
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:30,339
You know about Fakeblock?

477
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,174
You know, that's my software.

478
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:33,842
I wonder if my dad thinks...

479
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:36,387

get his boyfriend's information,

486
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,360
hack into his software

How do you not know how
to shave a leg?

489
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:56,365
I've never done it before.

490
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:04,248
Anyway, he's halfway to falling
in love with me already.

491
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,876
I mean, he actually sounded
excited about seeing me tonight.

492
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:10,796
Poor guy doesn't realize
I'm about to destroy our life.

Our life?

494
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:16,093
I mean,
destroy our life with Gob.

495

00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:46,665
Very weird.

507
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:48,667
Caterpillar...

508
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:52,087
and that weird fuzzy moth
in the drain...

509
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:55,383
NARRATOR: <i>It seemed Sally</i>
<i>had two secrets.</i>

510
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:01,430
<i>And days later,</i>
<i>Gob was feeling pretty good.</i>

511
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:04,975
<i>China Garden had come through</i>
<i>with a crew to build the wall,</i>

512
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,562
<i>and with the help of</i>
<i>a well-placed ad,</i>

513
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:11,690
<i>he'd successfully filled all</i>
<i>the homes in Sudden Valley.</i>

514
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:14,693
<i>And he was on his way to</i>
<i>a hot date with Tony Wonder.</i>

515
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:17,488
Siri, where is
the Little Ballroom?

516
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,198
SIRI:
I have three matches.

517
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,368
(mumbles):
I'm going to need the gayest.

518
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,994
Did you say the "grayest"?

519
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,704
(snickering)

520
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:27,498
I need the, uh, gayest one.

521
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,166
SIRI:
Did you say the "grayest"?

522
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,529
I need the gayest
Little Ballroom!

523
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,170
SIRI:
Okay, Gob, try this one.

524
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,966
I've got to tell Michael
that I saw another map car.

525
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,676
He's gonna be blown away.

526
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,512
GOB:
<i>You don't see them a lot.</i>

527
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,180
<i>- Well...</i>
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

528
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,099
...looks like he's turning
into a parking lot.

529
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,726
My Little Ballroom.
Of course, yeah.

530
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,353
<i>She's got a kid,</i>
<i>he's acting like</i>

531
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,146
<i>he's Father of the Year</i>
<i>or something.</i>

532
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:52,689
<i>I bet he's pretending</i>
<i>Steve Holt is, like, nine.</i>

533
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,316
<i>I just saw him, he looks 50.</i>

534
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:55,943
NARRATOR:
<i>But of course Gob was</i>

535
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:58,028
<i>at the wrong Little Ballroom.</i>

536
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,405
I do not get this lifestyle.

537
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,323
- Gob?
- You're mistaken.

538
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:03,451
Hi, there.

539
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,453
- Michael.
- Yeah.

540
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:07,204
Well, look who's here: you.

541
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,664
Where is she?

542
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,165
First of all, that's very dated
of you, Michael.

543
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,167
"He's" don't like
to be called "she's"

544
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,253
and I don't who this he-man is
that you're referring to.

545
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:15,546
No, no, no, it's a "she."
My girlfriend.

546
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,880
That's who I'm talking about.

547
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,424
Rebel. Rebel Alley.
Where is she?

548
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,259
- Never met him.
- It's a she.

549
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:21,885
Nice try.
Now what are you doing here?

550
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,178
You gonna meet her here
with her son, maybe,

551
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,305
so her son can play
in the ball pit?

552
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:25,931
That's disgusting, Michael.

553
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:28,053
- This is no place for a child.
- I know what you do.

554
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:29,560
Mom told me
you were bragging about

555
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,936
seeing somebody in showbiz.

556
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:32,771
Then I see
a frozen dove in a freezer.

557
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:34,523
That could be anything.

558
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,191
It said "Love each other"
on the foot band.

559
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,485
Yeah, that does
sound like one of mine.

560
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:38,735
Whose freezer was it in?

561
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,488
Rebel. Rebel Alley's.
Nice try, Gob.

562
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:41,989
If I want to see bad acting,

563
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,782
I'll go see Tobias in
<i>A Jew Comes to Dinner.</i>

564
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,242
<i>But Gob wasn't acting.</i>

565
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,703
<i>He'd just forgotten</i>
<i>that he had met</i>

566
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:49,413
<i>a still-partying Rebel Alley.</i>

567
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,707
It's a little dove.
He's so cute.

568
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:54,376
<i>And Rebel returned home</i>
<i>to an unfortunate surprise.</i>

569
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:55,670
(dove squawks)

570
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:01,175
<i>She felt bad,</i>
<i>so quickly put it in a bag,</i>

571
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:03,511
<i>wrote down the species</i>
<i>and location</i>

572
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:07,055
<i>from which she'd acquired it</i>
<i>and then one further caution.</i>

573
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,309
<i>It was a merry mix-up.</i>

574
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:12,269
<i>But neither of them</i>
<i>knew any of this.</i>

575
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,313
Honestly, I have no idea what
you're talking about, Michael.

576
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:15,731
Yes, you do.
I got you dead to rights.

577
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,399
Dead to rights!

578
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:19,694
If ever we were gonna
have a fight, Michael,

579
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:21,696
this would be
the safest place to do it.

580
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:23,780
- Right! Let's do it!
- This gay bar would be the best...!

581
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,034
...something that can fillet a
chicken and subdue an intruder.

582
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,202
Let's do it!

583
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:33,582
Back to My Little Ballroom?

584
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:35,167
Yeah, this is the middle
of their workday.

585
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,127
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

586
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,879
You son of a bitch, Gob!

587
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,382
You'll never catch me, Michael!

588
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:44,552
♪ You raped and pushed
and struggled ♪

589
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:45,636
♪ All those balls in the air... ♪

590
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,681
You have to find me, Michael!

591
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:51,099
♪ How hard can it be? ♪

592
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:52,809
Gob?

593
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,936
♪ ...those balls in the air ♪

594
00:20:54,978 --> 00:21:00,192
♪ But keep those
balls in the air ♪

595
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:04,154
♪ Balls in the air. ♪

596
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,989
Are we done?

597
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,282
I'm just surprisingly tired.

598
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:10,202
So tired... and so not hurt.

599
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:12,454
Look, I'm not the guy, Michael.

600
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:14,540
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I did what you said.

601
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:16,958
I filled all your...
your houses.

602
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,126
Hang on-- filled 'em?

603
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:20,087
Every last one of 'em.

604
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:21,171
With who?

605
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,924
With sex offenders.

606
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,301
Hey! Hey!

607
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:28,637
Gob, you're out of the movie!

608
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,431
BOY: Thanks for ruining
my birthday party.

609
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:35,936
NARRATOR:
<i>After fighting with Gob,</i>

610
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:38,105
<i>Michael paid a return visit</i>
<i>to his mother.</i>

611
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:39,546
- What happened to your eye?
- Oh...

612
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,191
Is that from Gob?
Was I right about him?

613
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,277
No, actually.
Want to hear a funny story?

614
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:45,862
You're out of the movie.

615
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,197
Hold on, George.

616
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,365
I beg your pardon?

617
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,033
Did you say George?
Is that Dad?

618
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,702
'Cause he's the one
who told me to hire Gob.

619
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,370
I actually owe him a call.

620
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,663
Hey, Dad, how you doing?

621
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:56,498
Y-Yes, he did.

622
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,750
With sex offenders.

623
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,418
You want
to hear something funny?

624
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,545
You're out of the movie!

625
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,213
Want to hold for Mom? Yeah.

626
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,674
Bye.

627
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:09,720
<i>And later that night,</i>
<i>Gob went to win back the trust</i>

628
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:12,848
<i>of the man he was still</i>
<i>hoping to con.</i>

629
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:14,433
Hey, look...

630
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:16,101
<i>Although he quickly</i>
<i>lost sight of that plan.</i>

631
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:18,854
- You're mad at me.
- You stood me up.

632
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:22,065
Oh, no-- Siri sent me
to the wrong "Ballroom,"

633
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,984
and then I got in this fight
with my brother

634
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:25,820
that didn't hurt,
it was just a whole...

635
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:27,362
Oh, is that it?
Or is it because

636
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:29,615
your boyfriend is 20
and I'm nearly twice that?

637
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:31,659
You think that I care
that you're...

638
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,327
three years older than me?

639
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:35,412
No! I don't--
Check my phone. Check my phone.

640
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,038
I don't need to check
your phone; come on in.

641
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,666
<i>But getting Gob's boyfriend's</i>

642
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,793
<i>contact information</i>
<i>out of that phone</i>

643
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:42,878
<i>was the reason</i>
<i>for Tony's charade.</i>

644
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:44,546
He hates me;
the whole family hates me.

645
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,799
- Damn it!
<i>- Which he remembered too late.</i>

646
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,216
Yeah, damn it!

647
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:50,135
I mean, I even helped
fill his stupid homes

648
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:52,680
with sex offenders,
and yet he still hates me.

649
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:54,682
Sex offenders need
a place to live, too.

650
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:58,435
Yes! Exactly!
That's what I always say.

651
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,937
It's, like, God...
you get me.

652
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,939
Well, you're an easy guy to get.

653
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,733
I can't go home;
he's probably waiting for me.

654
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:06,067
He's gonna be my boss?

655
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:07,361
He's the younger brother.

656
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:09,321
- How old is he?
- 42.

657
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:10,698
Same!

658
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:12,741
My younger brother's 42, also.

659
00:23:12,783 --> 00:23:13,784
Same!

660
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,327
But...

661
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:16,704
- I mean 32.
- Third... two...

662
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:18,121
- 32.
- 32! Same!

663
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,665
- Same! I was gonna say it.
- Same?

664
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:21,792
- I was thinking the same.
- That's so weird!

665
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,669
(both talking at once)

666
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:25,880
- ...same.
- ...same.

667
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,005
- Crazy!
- ...zy!

668
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:28,089
Do you want a glass of wine?

669
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:29,174
I love wine.

670
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:30,676
- Red wine?
- I love red wine!

671
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:31,802
- Same!
- Same!

672
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:32,761
(laughing)

673
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:34,012
It's, like, two same.

674
00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:35,639
- That's in-same.
- Totally in-same.

675
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,683
<i>It turns out the guys</i>
<i>had tons in common.</i>

676
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:39,226
- That's so weird.
- ...weird.

677
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,977
- Like...
- Like...

678
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,897
BOTH:
...the last... time I went...

679
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:46,859
BOTH:
...scuba diving?

680
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:48,861
- Wow.
- Wow.

681
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:53,574
BOTH:
...eating... Captain Crunch.

682
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,534
- Same.
- Same.

683
00:23:55,576 --> 00:23:57,118
<i>The hours melted away...</i>

684
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,662
TONY:
I guess I must have been...

685
00:23:58,704 --> 00:23:59,830
<i>...and perhaps,</i>
<i>pretending to be gay...</i>

686
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,540
...I don't know, 17...

<i>...allowed them the freedom</i>
<i>to speak honestly.</i>

688
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,627
...when I started saying "same."

689
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,380
- Same.
- That's about the same time I got into magic.

690
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:10,382
You know, I think I got into
misdirection 'cause I just...

691
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:13,218
maybe I was trying to hide
my feelings or something.

692
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,263
I was just doing it
to get out of gym.

693
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:18,014
Who's Jim?

694
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,099
No, I... phys ed.

695
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,684
(laughs) Jealous!

696
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,061
- Oh... kidding.
- (laughing): Right.

697
00:24:23,103 --> 00:24:24,521
(singsong):
Kidding.

698
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,647
(both laughing)

699
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:26,815
- Ooh!
- Oh...

700
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:28,609
- Don't stop.
- Oh!

701
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,444
Popcorn fight!

702
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:32,613

703
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:35,031
(gagging)

704
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:42,706
It almost went down my throat.

705
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,833
(Gob sighs)

706
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,921
I'll get some water.

707
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:50,798
- Yeah.
- Yeah, just...

708
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,091
NARRATOR: <i>And Tony had</i>
<i>another opportunity</i>

709
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:56,804
<i>to get at Gob's phone.</i>

710
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:58,847
<i>And chose not to take it.</i>

711
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:03,018
<i>Gob also saw an opportunity to,</i>
<i>in some small way,</i>

712
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,938
<i>sabotage Tony's act.</i>

713
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:09,942
<i>And he also chose not to,</i>

714
00:25:09,984 --> 00:25:12,527
<i>although he did put the mask</i>
<i>down his pants.</i>

715
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:14,696
Ah.

716
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,080
(gulping loudly)

717
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:34,424
BOTH:
Ah.

718
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:41,556
We were really thirsty.

719
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:42,933
Well, I guess I should get go...

720
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,644
Yeah, I'd say stay,
but I just... I feel...

721
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:48,229
I just feel like we should
take it slow, you know.

722
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:49,731
Oh, same.

723
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:52,693
I-I would definitely stay
and have gay sex with...

724
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:54,319
or normal sex with you, but...

725
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:57,781
Yeah, I would totally have
gay sex or whatever, but...

726
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,158
just drank a lot of water,
you know.

727
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,871
I-I just... I just had
a lot of water, too.

728
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:05,539
Yeah, I don't want
to rush things.

729
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,207
- Same.
- Same.

730
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:09,167
You know, maybe we make
a date to do it

731
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:11,003
another time,
and tonight we just...

732
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,713
We can just sit and talk.

733
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:14,798
<i>Gob had never said anything</i>
<i>like that before.</i>

734
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,800
That would be amazing.

735
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:20,971
<i>And then he said something else</i>
<i>he'd never said before.</i>

736
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:25,141
I have... feelings for you.

737
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:29,730
I have feelings...

738
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:32,066
for you.

739
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:33,775
<i>The feeling was friendship,</i>

740
00:26:33,817 --> 00:26:35,861
<i>but neither had ever</i>
<i>experienced it.</i>

741
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:38,947
<i>All they had to do now was</i>
<i>avoid making any specific...</i>

742
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:40,532
Why don't we have normal sex
on Cinco?

743
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:42,283
Let's have normal sex on Cinco.

744
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:44,828
<i>I guess they figured they could</i>
<i>get out of it later.</i>

745
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,538
<i>I'm not sure why</i>
<i>they said that.</i>

746
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,040
- Same!
- Same!

NARRATOR: <i>It was</i>
<i>the Newport Beach celebration</i>

748
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,170
<i>of Cinco de Cuatro,</i>

749
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,631
<i>and after taking care</i>
<i>of some business,</i>

750
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:59,093
<i>- Gob ran into an almost ex-wife.</i>
- No, honey, on Cinco,

751
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,302
we break the stick
and not the piñata. Okay, look.

752
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:03,263
Whoo! Huh?

753
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:04,723
GOB:
Well...

754
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:06,349
- (chuckles)
- How long has it been?

755
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,393
- It's been five years.
- What are you doing here?

756
00:27:08,435 --> 00:27:11,312
I'm taking my five-year-old
to see <i>Fantastic Four.</i>

757
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:12,898
I'm pretty sure
that's an adult...

758
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,315
Wait, you have a five-year-old?

759
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:15,442
<i>Oui.</i>

760
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,903
What? We what?

761
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:19,571
No, <i>oui.</i>
It's French for "yes."

762
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:21,156
As in, "Yes, I have a son,

763
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:23,658
and his father's a magician."

764
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,661
(intro to
"The Sound of Silence" playing)

765
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:31,708
(mariachi band playing
"The Sound of Silence")

766
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,627
Oh. It's not us.

767
00:27:33,668 --> 00:27:35,253
Don't worry. It's not you.

768
00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:36,964
It was a real magician.

769
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:38,715
He took advantage
of how angry I was

770
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,467
when you wouldn't come out
of that cave.

771
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:42,302
He promised me
a life together, and after

772
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:44,846
he had his way with me,
he never wanted to see me again.

773
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:46,723
I don't think
there's anything wonderful

774
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,600
about Tony Wonder.

775
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,268
Are you kidding me?
Are you saying...

776
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,228
- Yes.
- Tony's straight?

777
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,316
<i>Gob felt betrayed by a person</i>
<i>he was starting to trust,</i>

778
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:58,234
<i>and he decided</i>
<i>to do something about it.</i>

779
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:02,030
How would you like to spend
the night making revenge love?

780
00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:04,240
(sighs) Uh, Jacqueline,
could you, uh...?

781
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,953
<i>With a plan to get revenge</i>
<i>on Tony Wonder taking shape,</i>

782
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:10,080
<i>Gob met with Ann</i>
<i>at the model home.</i>

783
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,499
I'm ready, Gob.

784
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,084
Yeah, okay, well,
don't get ready yet.

785
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,670
Uh, Tony's not
going to be here for a bit.

786
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:18,130
Tony?

787
00:28:18,172 --> 00:28:21,008
You're having sex
with Tony Wonder tonight.

788
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:23,593
Well, I-I thought
we were having sex.

789
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,595
Oh. Uh, no, thank you.
(chuckles)

790
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,264
Listen, here's the plan--
this house is wired

791
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,767
with hidden cameras
from <i>Entrap a Local Predator.</i>

792
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,062
There, there, there and there.

793
00:28:34,104 --> 00:28:35,856
We're going to destroy
Tony's career

794
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:38,775
by proving that he's straight
when he has sex with you

795
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,819
while you're wearing...

796
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,737
this Gob mask.

797
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,489
Oh, and this little black
mini-robe.

798
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:47,784
Just to really sell
that you're a man.

799
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,494
Why would I wear a Gob mask?

800
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,777
Because Tony's coming here
expecting to have sex with me.

801
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:54,958
Look, in the act of having
fake gay sex,

802
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,960
you're going to take off
the mask to reveal

803
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,712
that you're having
real straight sex,

804
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,922
destroying his career,
and it's all going to be

805
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:03,050
captured on that camera
right there.

806
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:05,426
I don't want to have sex
with Tony.

807
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:08,096
Aren't you just a little cur...?

808
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:09,430
I have a child with him!

809
00:29:09,472 --> 00:29:11,683
Okay, yes, new plan.

810
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:14,519
I'm going to wear
this Tony Wonder mask,

811
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:17,605
you're going to wear
the Gob mask, and...

812
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,983
I am going to have sex with you.

813
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,693
I'm sorry about all that.

814
00:29:21,735 --> 00:29:24,571
And then, again, you're
going to rip off the Gob mask,

815
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:26,114
and the world will think
that he's straight,

816
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:27,323
and it'll ruin his career.

817
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,408
That's great.

818
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:29,743
Much simpler plan, thank you.

819
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:31,828
But the main event
is us having this...

820
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,957
pretend gay
but actually straight sex.

821
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,084
And you know what it is?

822
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,418
It's a straight bait.

823
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,087
I just realized,
it's a straight bait.

824
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,504
You ever watch those?

825
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,382
Good, and let me
have the room, yeah.

826
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:47,969
I need a little while
to get same.

827
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:51,223
To be the same.

<i>Tony had arrived early...</i>

Hello? Hello?

<i>...and was looking</i>

Hey... you.

834
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:06,238
It's Ann.

835
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,240
Awfully funny time
to run into you.

836
00:30:08,282 --> 00:30:12,493
Yes, it is an awfully funny time
to see you, too...

837
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:14,412
you.

838
00:30:14,454 --> 00:30:16,164
I know I owe you child support.

839
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:17,958
Don't worry, I got
something big in the works.

840
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,168
Actually,
that's why I came here.

841
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,087
- What are you doing here?
- Gob invited me.

842
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:24,380
He's planning
on getting revenge on you.

843
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,591
(laughs)
He would never do that.

844
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:29,970
Then why did he want to have sex
with me with this on?

845
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,222
Wait a minute.

846
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,266
Sex with you?

847
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:36,268
Gob is straight?

848
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,436
Oh, yeah, he is.

849
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,023
- Tony?
- I just... Why would he do that?

850
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,650
I thought he was gay.

851
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,986
- Tony, you're not gay, either.
- That's business.

852
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:48,155
Why do you think David Geffen
pretends to be gay?

853
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,739
You think
the Shubert Organization

854
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,407
would entrust a project
like <i>Dreamgirls</i>

855
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,909
to a straight producer?

856
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,702
How do you know so much
about <i>Dreamgirls?</i>

857
00:30:54,744 --> 00:30:56,624
'Cause it's my business
to know about <i>Dreamgirls.</i>

858
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:58,456
And if you wanted to be
in a film version

859
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:01,584
of a musical called
<i>The Magic Show,</i> done in 1974

860
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,171
by another secretly straight guy
named Doug Henning,

861
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:05,922
you'd make it
your business, too.

862
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,299
I mean,
they can't give everything

863
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:08,549
to Doogie Howser, right?

864
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:10,635
Biggest fake gay there is,
by the way.

865
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:13,305
But if I fund it,
then they can't say no to me.

866
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:15,431
But it's big money--
I mean, 20, 30, 40 mil.

867
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,808
Fakeblock money.

868
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,451
I can't believe
I'm telling you all this.

869
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,436
I... I've been
overexplaining the (bleep)

870
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,646
out of everything lately.

871
00:31:21,688 --> 00:31:23,106
You can't tell a soul.

872
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,649
No one I know will care.

873
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,194
Look, do you want
to out Gob as gay

874
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:29,321
so it'll ruin his career
as the Christian magician?

875
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:31,698
- Yes, of course.
- Are you still your own legs?

876
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:34,117
And do you have toenail polish
on you right now?

877
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,870
Are you asking, am I wearing
any, or do I have any extra?

878
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:38,705
Because the answer
to both questions is yes.

879
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:41,208
Then we're covered.
You and I will have sex.

880
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:43,751
And you wear this Gob mask, and
I'll wear a Tony Wonder mask.

881
00:31:43,793 --> 00:31:45,212
Okay, I have two questions.

882
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,297
One: Are you going to
move this time?

883
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:51,051
And two: Why can't I just be me
and you wear the Gob mask?

884
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:54,637
I just thought that if you
had to have sex with a man,

885
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,556
wouldn't it be more of a turn-on

886
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:59,100
to have sex with someone
that looks like you?

887
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,020
Okay.

888
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:04,105
Put these on,
and then meet me in the bedroom

889
00:32:04,147 --> 00:32:07,150
in five minutes for some serious
secular intercourse.

890
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,526
With myself.

891
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:11,321
Yeah.

892
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:22,999
- Same.
- Same.

893
00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:26,253
- Same.
- Same.

894
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,713
<i>And two men who never loved</i>
<i>anyone but themselves...</i>

895
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:31,507
- Same. Same.
- Become... the same.

896
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,429
<i>...prepared to ruin</i>
<i>each other's reputation.</i>

897
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,847
- Same.
- Same.

898
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:41,101
- Same.
- Same.

899
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,019
GOB:
I should dim the lights.

900
00:32:44,437 --> 00:32:47,231
<i>And that's how Ann</i>
<i>not only performed</i>

901
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:51,236
<i>a real-life version of Tony's</i>
<i>most beloved illusion...</i>

902
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:53,071
Now everybody's gay!

903
00:32:53,113 --> 00:32:56,074
<i>...but was responsible</i>
<i>for the first reported instance</i>

904
00:32:56,116 --> 00:32:59,286
<i>of a Christian</i>
<i>straight-to-gay conversion.</i>

905
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:06,918
<i>Gob went downstairs</i>
<i>to take a forget-me-now...</i>

906
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,836
Is that you, Maria?

907
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:11,839
<i>...when he bumped into a</i>
<i>brother who also had a secret.</i>

908
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:14,050
GOB: We did make quite a mess
in that bedroom.

909
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,885
- Michael.
- Gob?

910
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,929
<i>And relished the opportunity</i>
<i>to rub it in.</i>

911
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:20,640
Besides, you could not make me
feel worse right now.

912
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:22,225
I'd be willing
to let you have your

913
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,018
apology back if you give me
the chance to try.

914
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,938
Bad example. If you were ashamed
of being in love with a man,

915
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,357
suddenly discovered
these new feelings,

916
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:30,775
something that you only
allowed to happen because

917
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:32,527
you thought he was gay
and you were hoping

918
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:35,322
to exact revenge, but then
you found out he was straight,

919
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,740
then you wanted to get even,
so maybe you put a mask

920
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,409
on someone and then tried
to convince yourself

921
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,577
that the sex you were
about to have was with yourself,

922
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,247
but it turned out to be him,
and all you ended up doing

923
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,374
was proving that your feelings
were real...

924
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:48,335
then I might say something like,
"Homo much?"

925
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:50,586
- It's not that.
- I said, "Bad example."

926
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,005
Hey, listen, Michael,
if you want,

927
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:53,340
- we can split this.
- No.

928
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,258
Believe me,
this is the last time I ever

929
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,551
- judge you for anything
- (door opens)

930
00:33:56,592 --> 00:33:57,552
that you ever do.

931
00:33:57,593 --> 00:33:59,471
Oh, (bleep).

932
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:01,973
Is that who you were with?

933
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:04,392
<i>And Gob decided to be generous</i>

934
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:06,853
<i>- with his last forget-me-now...</i>
- (grunting): No!

935
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:09,063
<i>and for the first time,</i>
<i>it was Michael</i>

936
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:12,150
<i>who forgot his shame,</i>
<i>and Gob who remembered.</i>

937
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:14,110
Stupid, forgetful Michael.

938
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:19,866
<i>Michael wakes up and is</i>
<i>reminded of something horrible.</i>

939
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:22,743
FATHER MARSALA (over TV):
700,000. Think about it.

940
00:34:22,785 --> 00:34:24,329
That is a very big number.

941
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:26,289
700,000 abortions every year...

942
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,041
NARRATOR:
<i>The amount of money he owed</i>

943
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:31,378
<i>because Tobias wanted</i>
<i>to mount this abortion.</i>

944
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:33,629
♪ Fantastic Three,
Fantastic... ♪

945
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,840
<i>And he does something that</i>
<i>he never thought he'd do...</i>

946
00:34:35,882 --> 00:34:37,551
LUCILLE 2 (recorded):
Vote for Lucille!

947
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:40,011
- (beep)
- Hey, Lucille 2.

948
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:43,014
I was hoping that
we could get together

949
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:46,059
and talk about how I can
repay you that loan.

950
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,769
<i>...and had already done.</i>

951
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:50,938
<i>And then, with nothing</i>
<i>left to lose,</i>

952
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,566
<i>he makes another call.</i>

953
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,650
Rebel. Yeah, Michael.

954
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,236
I need to come over.

955
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:57,987
I'm... I don't want to act

956
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:01,241
like it doesn't matter
to me anymore, 'cause it does.

957
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:02,658
Well, there's somebody here
right now.

958
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,035
I don't care.

959
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:05,579
The thing with
the other guy, it's...

960
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,372
you know, that's over,
so we don't...

961
00:35:07,414 --> 00:35:09,707
we don't ever have to talk
about that ever again.

962
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:11,084
It's going away.

963
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,045
Okay, well, you can
come over later, okay?

964
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:16,506
- Good-bye.
- I'll see you soon.

965
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:20,552
GEORGE MICHAEL:
Who was that?

966
00:35:20,594 --> 00:35:22,720
No one.
