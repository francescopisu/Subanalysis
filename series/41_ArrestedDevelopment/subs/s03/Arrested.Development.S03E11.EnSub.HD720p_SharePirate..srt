1
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:03,897
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:07,633
<i>Michael Bluth believed
he'd just made a shocking discovery.</i>

3
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:10,211
That might be an older sister
that we've never met.

4
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:13,042
Wow. Look at the beak
on that bird.

5
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:15,912
<i>Michael found the picture
in a secret room...</i>

6
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,452
<i>while looking for incriminating
evidence against his father.</i>

7
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:20,384
I have an older sister?

8
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:23,253
<i>- Don't you kind of remember having
an older sister? - Not at all.</i>

9
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:24,814
What, do you?

10
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:26,293
A little bit. I mean,
"Nellie" does sound familiar.

11
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:27,947
Mom and Dad clearly were trying
to keep this hidden from us.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,523
But this could be anybody.

13
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:31,531
This could be a deformed neighbor or...

14
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:34,864
A child that Mom and Dad
gave up for some reason...

15
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,734
and whose identity they're now using
to pin their crimes on.

16
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,374
The prosecutor said
that there was that

17
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:40,933
account with money in it labeled "N.
Bluth."

18
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:42,874
Her name is Nellie.

19
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:46,778
Do you remember when you thought there
was a mysterious Mr. "F" out to get you?

20
00:00:46,882 --> 00:00:50,283
Yeah, but that was retard... misguided.

21
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:54,253
This is different. This is N. Bluth.

22
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:57,416
Well, why don't you just go to Dad
and ask who Nellie is, point blank?

23
00:00:57,526 --> 00:00:59,426
So he can just cover it up and lie?

24
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:01,962
I can't stand to hear one more lie
out of this family.

25
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,965
Ah, there's the woman
I'm sexually attracted to.

26
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,967
Okay. But that's the last one.

27
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,906
Well, I'm off to the gym
to prepare for our tryst.

28
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,766
Tryst?

29
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:14,171
Yes, Lindsay and I are planning a night
of heterosexual intercourse.

30
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:17,177
- You can just say intercourse.
- We talked about it last night.

31
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:20,009
<i>After a disappointing
attempt at lovemaking.</i>

32
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:23,141
Ah, this isn't going to happen.
I just want you to be satisfied.

33
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,344
Oh, T., you're always thinking of others.

34
00:01:25,454 --> 00:01:27,479
I tried that. It didn't work either.

35
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:32,026
You know, maybe I would be more attracted
to you if you were in better shape.

36
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:34,925
You know, if you were just
more muscular, masculine.

37
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,362
- Does that make me shallow?
- No.

38
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:39,764
I was gonna say the same thing to you.

39
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:42,200
Maybe we should take a little time
to work on ourselves...

40
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:45,671
and then we'll plan a special night
in seven or eight days.

41
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:48,038
- Or a couple of weeks.
- Let's say three weeks.

42
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:50,475
- We're gonna go for it in a month.
- At the start of next month.

43
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,479
And we're gonna call it
a 31-day month.

44
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:54,845
Even though
this particular month has 30 days.

45
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,680
Oh, you know, I've already
prepared a list of "won'ts."

46
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:00,687
Oh, you're not gonna believe this.
My list of "can'ts."

47
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:03,349
Marital love can be so romantic.

48
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,449
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What?

49
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,545
"Marital love." You were
looking right at me,

50
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:09,553
and you said "marital
love." Why would I...

51
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:11,996
<i>George Michael
was interested because earlier that day...</i>

52
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,400
<i>he discovered that the recent mock wedding
he'd acted in with his cousin Maeby...</i>

53
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:19,406
<i>- We're married?
- Was, in fact, as real and binding...</i>

54
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:23,376
<i>as the rice pudding the disoriented
patients had thrown at them.</i>

55
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:26,242
- I was talking to your aunt and uncle.
- Of course.

56
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:29,078
They're married too... Each other.

57
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:32,813
Oh, please. Pity the fool who gives me
a bunch of jibber-jabber about romance.

58
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:36,220
My religious girlfriend just dumped me,
and for a simple little misunderstanding.

59
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,394
If someone was always
asking you to embrace the.

60
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,488
Holy Trinity, what would
you think they meant?

61
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:42,756
<i>Gob thought it meant a three-way.</i>

62
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:46,664
What? I thought that's what
all you guys lived for.

63
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:48,668
What about you? You game?

64
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,466
- Well, maybe she just wasn't for you.
- Which one?

65
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:53,598
I really wasn't paying attention.

66
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:57,337
The real problem is she keeps saying
that God is gonna show me a sign.

67
00:02:57,445 --> 00:03:01,506
The... something of my ways.
"Wisdom"?

68
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:04,244
It's probably "wisdom."
Gob, listen, can I ask you a question?

69
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:07,651
- Do you remember growing up with a sister?
- Sister.

70
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:10,554
Uh, no, I don't.

71
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,025
Not really ringin' any bells.

72
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:16,120
- Other than Lindsay, of course.
- Oh, Lindsay!

73
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,472
Well, you might not be
the most reputable source on this.

74
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,900
<i>- Upstairs...
- What?</i>

75
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:23,698
<i>- George Michael was sharing his news
with his cousin. - You mean we're married?</i>

76
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,460
It's just a piece of paper.
It doesn't mean anything.

77
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,138
We should shred it.

78
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:29,437
- It's creeping me out.
- Yeah, me... It's...

79
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:32,809
But if we just put it over the dresser,
like we think it's a joke...

80
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:35,144
- then we would always know...
- It is a joke.

81
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,616
Unless we get it framed.

82
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,177
<i>And Michael
went to investigate his mystery sister.</i>

83
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:44,918
- Michael! What a surprise.
- Really? Were you expecting somebody else?

84
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,824
<i>Maybe, uh, one of
your two daughters?</i>

85
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:50,727
Oh, Lindsay and Tobias never visit.

86
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,392
We're so bad!

87
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,061
I-I actually meant Lindsay and Nellie.

88
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,605
You call him that too?

89
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:00,578
Oh, it's so nice to be
able to talk like this.

90
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,473
Where's Dad?

91
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,239
- What's all this?
- Computer stuff from the office.

92
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:09,511
Pop, you're not doin' another one
of those Black Fridays? Your mass firings?

93
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:12,143
<i>Before firing his employees, however...</i>

94
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:15,485
<i>George Sr. Had been sure
to clear the office of its valuables.</i>

95
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,683
So, when do we get to see
our new, fancy offices?

96
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:21,091
Soon as you get your new, fancy jobs.
You're all fired.

97
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:23,323
<i>The employees never saw it coming...</i>

98
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:28,767
<i>even though their first task was often
to unload computers from a rental truck.</i>

99
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,839
No, it's not a Black Friday,
although I did enjoy those.

100
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,376
No, the prosecution's gonna want
to have access to the hard drive...

101
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:39,106
so I just want to make sure
everything's nice and clean for them.

102
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:41,182
- What the hell is that thing?
- An electromagnet.

103
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,114
Think of it as a giant delete key.

104
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:45,186
Well, I hate to spoil your fun, Dad...

105
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:48,882
but I got backups on all of that stuff,
and this is illegal.

106
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,322
Oh! Well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold...

107
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:54,122
but I am trying to protect my family.

108
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,227
That's not a real gold necklace, is it?

109
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,234
Well, it wasn't really
your 50th birthday.

110
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:03,827
You know, Dad, you can't have
this stuff in here, all right?

111
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:05,838
And we don't need more trouble.

112
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,535
It's bad enough you got Buster faking a
coma just so he doesn't have to testify.

113
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,908
I've been trying to get him
out of that coma.

114
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,709
It's costing us a fortune.
He's sleeping us dry.

115
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:18,809
Okay, faker, I'm cutting the cord.

116
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,084
I'll see ya at the snack machine.

117
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:25,853
If he knows that you don't want him
in the coma, then why's he still in it?

118
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,360
For some reason, he won't tell me.

119
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,728
<i>- He'd fallen for his day nurse.
- Buster, you're so dear.</i>

120
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,667
<i>She'd found his complete lack of
personality and movement enchanting.</i>

121
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,103
I wish you could say something.

122
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:43,109
Course, if you did, everything would
be ruined 'cause you wouldn't be as pure.

123
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,463
Speaking of living a lie,
I don't suppose either

124
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:47,739
of you have remembered who this N.
Bluth is.

125
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,374
Not a Nick or a Nellie?

126
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:54,012
Just the one who married Lindsay.

127
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,420
Oh, isn't it fun to talk like this?

128
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:02,360
<i>So Michael returned to the office,
where the atmosphere was paranoid.</i>

129
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:03,753
Is it Black Friday?

130
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,065
No one's getting fired.
No one's getting fired.

131
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,067
But we haven't been paid,
and they took our computers.

132
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,204
This looks bad, but it's
just my father trying

133
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,264
to erase the hard drives
to avoid conviction.

134
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,841
The company is fine.
This is... This is fun though, isn't it?

135
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,910
They brought out all the old machines.

136
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,446
They've seen better days,
but I'm sure they're all functional, right?

137
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,209
- Like Tom here.
- I'm 30.

138
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,376
You're kidding me.

139
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:27,751
<i>But Michael found
the equipment frustrating as well.</i>

140
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:32,054
"Gob's Program"? Idiot.

141
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,685
<i>And then he noticed something else.</i>

142
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:39,497
- Nellie.
- Michael, I gotta talk to...

143
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:42,331
Oh, wow. K-Y pro, huh?

144
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,462
Hey, don't get any moisture
on these babes.

145
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,506
Hey! Tobias.

146
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,576
Buddy, I needed that information.

147
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:50,735
This is that sister I've been lookin' for.

148
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:54,178
Just hit "print screen." I'm sure
that whatever's on there will come up.

149
00:06:54,282 --> 00:06:56,682
Oh, look at that.

150
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:00,584
I kind of remember these
being faster, you know?

151
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:04,749
Well, we were probably all so jacked up
on amyl and disco music we didn't notice.

152
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,759
But I'm glad about this printer lag...

153
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:09,955
because I was hoping
to have a jaw session with you.

154
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:12,532
Why don't we just say
as long as that means a talk?

155
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:17,128
I find myself attracted
to someone who's not my wife.

156
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:20,605
- What's her name?
- Michael.

157
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,871
- Can you believe it?
- You're married to my sister.

158
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,878
Don't you think I know that?

159
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,778
- I-I'm not interested in you that way.
- What way?

160
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,817
- Pick one.
- No.

161
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,888
Did you think you were the Michael
I was talking about? No.

162
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:37,219
- What? - No, interesting that
your mind went there though.

163
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:42,285
Okay. Uh, no. I'm afraid the Michael
I'm talking about is all lady.

164
00:07:42,397 --> 00:07:45,127
- She's the trainer at my gym.
- The trainer you started with today?

165
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:46,888
Indeed. Can you believe
she's a bodybuilder?

166
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,566
Indeed.

167
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,002
What am I doing?
What am I doing? What am I doing?

168
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:54,006
- What am I doing? - You're nervous about
becoming intimate with Lindsay again.

169
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:56,508
- I guess.
- You probably should not rush into things.

170
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:59,580
Don't call this girl-Michael.
Stay away from the gym.

171
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:02,377
- Just leave it alone.
- Wise words, boy-Michael.

172
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:05,647
I'll tell you, if I wasn't so dripping
and disgustingly sweaty right now...

173
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:08,916
I'd hop over this desk
and give you such a hug.

174
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:11,548
- Hey, coulda, shoulda, woulda.
- Hey, hey. No, no.

175
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,628
Ooh, look. Number's up.
Look at that.

176
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,924
Ah, it would've been a seven.

177
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:20,159
<i>Later that night,
Lucille visited Buster in the hospital.</i>

178
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:22,236
What the hell is this?

179
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:24,227
My name is Representative
John Van Heusen.

180
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,604
I am here to protect
the dignity of this boy's life.

181
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,768
Dignity? Easy for you to say.

182
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:32,005
I'm the one who has to
loofah his stump.

183
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:35,378
I believe death is wrong in all of
its forms, except lethal injection.

184
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:38,043
But that's just as a deterrent
against more death.

185
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:41,383
And this young man is enjoying life.

186
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,753
Hey! Hey! Huh? Hey, look at us, huh?

187
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,849
We're havin' a blast here, huh?

188
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,451
How the hell did you even find out
about Sleeping Beauty here?

189
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:51,532
It was an anonymous tip from someone
who cares about Buster's life.

190
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,726
It's not ringing any bells.

191
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:55,598
<i>In fact, it was Buster himself.</i>

192
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:58,433
They're trying to kill Baby Buster.

193
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,633
Oh, that's right... from the videos.

194
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:03,870
Well, no one's killin'
Baby Buster on my watch.

195
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:07,311
That is unless, of course, it's as a
penalty in a three-strikes scenario.

196
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:11,408
No one's called him Baby Buster
since high school.

197
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,646
<i>Michael, meanwhile...</i>

198
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:17,213
<i>had called one number after another
until he found Frank...</i>

199
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:18,798
<i>a colleague of the
woman he knew as Nellie.</i>

200
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:20,294
<i>I'm looking for Nellie.</i>

201
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,455
<i>Yeah. Well, she's workin'
a software convention at some hotel.</i>

202
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:26,625
<i>- I can set up a meeting at the bar, man.
- Appreciate it.</i>

203
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:29,032
<i>So Michael arrived at the bar...</i>

204
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:32,937
<i>hoping to spot someone
who could be his sister.</i>

205
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:38,242
She grew into the nose.
Nellie? Hey! Hi.

206
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:40,246
Michael. Frank sent me.

207
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:41,832
I think I might be
interested in your services.

208
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:43,340
You won't be sorry.

209
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:46,079
Yeah? I was hoping that maybe we
could just talk a little bit first, huh?

210
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:49,020
<i>- Yeah, most people want to.
- They did talk.</i>

211
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:53,253
<i>And Michael felt a connection like he'd
never felt with anyone in his family.</i>

212
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:55,795
I had a locker on the first floor
freshman year...

213
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:59,264
right next to the caf with all the junior
lockers, so it was clearly a mistake.

214
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:02,632
- But I didn't say anything, right?
- Ooh, you're bad.

215
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,932
I had that same locker
all throughout sophomore year.

216
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,270
- Junior year they had me on the third
floor with all the frosh. - That is wild.

217
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:11,368
I had the same combo throughout 'cause I
transferred the lock. Let me tell you why.

218
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,676
<i>Hey, let's see what
some of the other folks are up to.</i>

219
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:18,052
<i>Nothing there.</i>

220
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,320
<i>Or there.</i>

221
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:24,789
<i>Oh, my.</i>

222
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,292
<i>Let's get back to Michael.</i>

223
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:30,125
It was Joe Namath's number,
Babe Ruth's number, then my birthday.

224
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:32,461
That is a great story.

225
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,626
<i>It wasn't a great story.</i>

226
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:38,069
<i>Nellie was just a great listener.
Most prostitutes are.</i>

227
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,003
Nellie, the hell with formalities.

228
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:41,279
I think you and I should
do business together.

229
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,474
Me too.

230
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:52,914
<i>Michael had just hired a woman
he'd secretly believed to be his sister.</i>

231
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:55,149
How did you get into this line of work?

232
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:58,489
<i>But, of course, he'd also yet
to figure out she was a prostitute.</i>

233
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:02,155
I was buried in loan debt from business
school, so I started whoring myself out.

234
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:04,165
<i>Not that there weren't clues.</i>

235
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:07,566
What do you say we go up to my room
and seal the deal?

236
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,503
You're stayin' here, huh? I was actually
hoping to get into your business tomorrow.

237
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:13,336
It would give you a chance
to meet everybody in the office.

238
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:15,535
'Cause you're gonna be working
for the whole staff.

239
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:17,486
- You're gonna be filling three openings.
- Oh!

240
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:21,005
I heard there were a couple of girls
like me consulting over at Enron.

241
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:24,848
<i>So the next day, Michael introduced
his new consultant to his staff...</i>

242
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:26,854
<i>who weren't that pleased to meet her.</i>

243
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:30,357
You hired someone else?
We haven't even been paid yet.

244
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,859
That's exactly why I hired her...
to help out with the finances.

245
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:36,523
She's absolutely amazing at that stuff.
Right? You do do finances and stuff, right?

246
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:40,090
- I do all sorts of scenes.
- There you go. Okay, guys.

247
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:42,569
Don't be afraid to put her
in any position that you want, okay?

248
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:46,073
Dave, you give her access
to everything, okay?

249
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:48,973
I want you guys to think
of her as Nellie Bluth, all right?

250
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,377
In fact, we should probably get an I.D.
With that printed on it, okay?

251
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:54,915
<i>But she did have a list of "won'ts."</i>

252
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:58,544
We're gonna have some ground rules
first, okay? No!@%$ ?

253
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:00,884
!@%$ing or!@%ting.

254
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,482
<i>And no!@%$?% unless
you're wearing a!@%$?.</i>

255
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:06,562
Or you!@%$?% before you!@%$ me.

256
00:12:06,662 --> 00:12:10,996
And if this winds up on the Web,
I will!@%$ you in the!@%.

257
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,898
Our computers don't even
work on the Internet.

258
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:16,665
Who's first?

259
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:18,831
<i>Back at the model home,
George Michael was still...</i>

260
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:20,909
<i>trying to make
his accidental marriage work.</i>

261
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,969
I thought maybe tonight we could pop in
an!@%$?%@! In the old DVD player...

262
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,743
and sit and watch it,
maybe just the two of us, husband and wife?

263
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,411
I'm just kidding. I mean, the
State of California isn't, but...

264
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,420
You know, that's what makes it funny.

265
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:34,744
I'm worried you're
taking this too seriously.

266
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:35,990
Are...

267
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,151
Just the opposite.

268
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:44,194
What the hell is that?

269
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,768
I bought you a wedding ring... tone.

270
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:50,270
Opposite of serious.

271
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:53,467
<i>And Michael was getting an update
on how his newest employee, Nellie...</i>

272
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:55,476
<i>was working out.</i>

273
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:58,411
Really? And all the guys like her, huh?
That is... That is great.

274
00:12:58,514 --> 00:13:00,448
Uh, you mean "away" though, right?

275
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:03,109
Because otherwise
it sounds a little different.

276
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:05,687
But, uh, that's, uh...
that's outstanding.

277
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:08,120
Real good.
You forgot to say "away" again.

278
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:11,159
But, uh, listen, let me call you back
in a bit, okay? Bye.

279
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,957
Nellie has blown them all away.

280
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,964
Yeah, well, I think it's crazy.

281
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:20,399
You've given her access to everything...
the banking... and for what?

282
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:22,306
You're basing this on
the fact she shares a

283
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,132
name with someone you
played with as a baby.

284
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,140
Lindsay, I can tell that it's real.

285
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:28,710
It's like that feeling that
you read about twins having.

286
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:31,211
We're twins. You didn't give me
access to the banking.

287
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:34,841
No, you just... you'd go out and you'd
just whore it up, Lindsay, you know?

288
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,077
She's different.
She's a little bit more like me.

289
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:40,121
- It's like we finish each other's...
- Sandwiches?

290
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:42,122
Sentences.

291
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:44,192
- Why would I say...
- Sandwiches?

292
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:47,160
That time I was gonna say sandwiches.

293
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:49,993
- So I guess you haven't told Nellie
what you're thinking. - No, I have not.

294
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,999
I've been waiting for the right time.

295
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:53,739
I want to make sure she
trusts me, especially

296
00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:55,400
since Dad is probably
setting her up.

297
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:57,426
But I might want to hurry
with that operation

298
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,372
because she's charging
us a fortune...

299
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:02,273
and she's got this old boss
that's claiming he wants a percentage.

300
00:14:02,378 --> 00:14:04,539
<i>Yo, man, you owe me money.
I ain't no dummy.</i>

301
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:09,084
<i>And it better be soon, or you're gonna
feel my hand up your!@%$?.</i>

302
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:11,813
So Nellie wants to meet me tonight
for drinks. Maybe I'll tell her then.

303
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:15,186
That's funny. I'm going out tonight
for drinks too... with an exciting new man.

304
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,623
Really trying to make
that marriage work, aren't you?

305
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:20,924
Well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold,
but I'm feeling a little pressure here.

306
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,738
If you had to have sex
with Tobias in four

307
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:24,471
months, you'd be shopping
for a way out too.

308
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:27,696
I stand corrected and disgusted.

309
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:30,033
<i>And Michael arrived
for his meeting with Nellie.</i>

310
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,039
- Are you Michael?
- Yes.

311
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:35,042
- There's a nellie at the end of the bar
wants to see you. - Great. Thank you.

312
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,873
- Oh, it's Tobias.
- Michael.

313
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:39,499
Look, this has got to stop.
I mean, flattered?

314
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,042
Yes. Interested? Not tonight.

315
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:44,051
I-I think I-I see what's happening.

316
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:46,917
- You're meeting girl-Michael at the bar?
- It was her idea.

317
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:49,388
She wanted to get a drink,
and I know it's crazy.

318
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:52,086
I mean, I'm married.
And the carbs.

319
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:55,322
Well, Tobias, sometimes life
is about making difficult...

320
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,399
Sandwiches. I know.

321
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,661
- You read my mind.
- Oh, God. Here she is.

322
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,972
- Next to that guy?
- Uh, what guy?

323
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:06,974
That guy.

324
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:10,273
- No, that's her.
- Him?

325
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,279
That's a girl.

326
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:14,747
I-I think the name Michael
is making you look for a man.

327
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,876
- Think I'm lookin' at a man.
- Michael.

328
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:19,579
- Yes?
- Yes.

329
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:21,815
- No, I meant girl-Michael.
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.

330
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:24,859
So nice to meet you, girl-Michael.

331
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,292
What? Yes? Hi, Nellie.

332
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:29,921
I was thinking that
we could meet down here.

333
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:32,364
Uh, actually,
I think I'm gonna come up.

334
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,698
I really need to see you.

335
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:37,034
I really want to see you too.
There's something we need to talk about.

336
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,438
- I've always been mildly attracted to you.
- What?

337
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,773
Let's face it. There's no denying
that there's a heat between us.

338
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,817
I'd like to deny that.

339
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,780
I know you feel it too...
this burning desire.

340
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:50,409
I-I-I don't feel anything.
I-I feel a burning mutual respect.

341
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,488
I've got an outfit that's gonna turn
that respect into something fun.

342
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:55,614
Respect is fun, Nellie.

343
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:59,057
You're gonna want the respect when
you hear where I... Where is the light?

344
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:01,061
<i>- Don't touch that light!
- What?</i>

345
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:04,963
<i>This is what happens when you steal
from Frank's stable without payin'.</i>

346
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,467
You want to be her pimp,
you gotta settle up with me.

347
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,902
<i>- Pimp? You mean that she's a...
- Lady of the evening.</i>

348
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:13,771
<i>Working girl.
She turns illusions for money.</i>

349
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:16,640
<i>And that's when
Michael recognized the voice.</i>

350
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:18,645
- Tricks.
- Wait a minute.

351
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:21,375
Don't you do it! Ain't nobody gonna
see what Frank look like!

352
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:24,715
Franklin is Frank?

353
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:29,357
<i>Michael had
just discovered that his brother...</i>

354
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,361
<i>was the pimp for the woman
he thought was his sister.</i>

355
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:34,931
What the hell is going on?
Nellie is not a prostitute.

356
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:38,593
Of course she is. Oh, but I can see
what the misunderstanding is.

357
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:41,830
You didn't know. Maybe we can
give him a family discount!

358
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:44,237
Family discount is right. This is
the sister that I've been talking about.

359
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:48,004
Maybe I should've been getting
a family rate. Oh, my God!

360
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:50,546
- How do you know her?
- Met up with her after a show.

361
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,842
<i>- And you did things with her?
- He didn't.</i>

362
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,353
<i>- I did. - Well, if you consider
crying like a girl doing something.</i>

363
00:16:57,454 --> 00:17:01,584
I just want my brother to respect me,
you know. I don't even have a job.

364
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:06,356
Look, I could use a man's voice on the
phone, and I like your little puppet show.

365
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:09,125
Ain't so little when I
take my pants off, lady.

366
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:12,532
I mean, obviously I'd take
some of the cry out of that.

367
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:14,729
But I am not a pimp, Michael.

368
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:18,865
She needed protection,
so I make some threats, I wear this hat...

369
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:21,103
and I collect my 10%.

370
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:24,874
Yeah, that's a pimp,
and our sister is a prostitute.

371
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:27,041
- I'm your sister?
- I think so.

372
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:29,051
I found you in my dad's computer.

373
00:17:29,153 --> 00:17:32,179
I thought that maybe he was embezzling
money and taking advantage of you.

374
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,383
- And that's why I hired you to do
your work at the office. - Oh, my God.

375
00:17:35,492 --> 00:17:37,722
Wait a minute.
What... What kind of work did you do?

376
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:40,058
No wonder they were so happy.

377
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:43,725
- I'm so embarrassed!
- Nellie, hang on a second.

378
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:48,635
You know, Gob, this might be that sign
from God that you should change your ways.

379
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:51,674
No, I think that's gonna be something big.

380
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:55,438
<i>Downstairs, meanwhile,
Lindsay arrived at the bar for her date.</i>

381
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:58,572
- Michael. Oh, my God! My husband!
- Oh, my God! My wife!

382
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:01,308
- Are you two here for each other?
- Is that what you're doing?

383
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:03,852
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

384
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:06,252
- And with another man!
- And with another woman!

385
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:08,324
Wait, wait.
You didn't plan this together?

386
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:11,952
- I just assumed you wanted a Holy Trinity.
- Absolutely not!

387
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:13,962
We're a happily married couple.

388
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:16,999
Yes, who happen to be very much
in love with each other.

389
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:20,502
Well, you're still gonna
have to pay Frank.

390
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:23,573
<i>- And Michael confronted his father.
- I know who N. Bluth is.</i>

391
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:26,108
It is Nellie, and I found her.

392
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,838
That's your sissy cousin Larry.

393
00:18:28,946 --> 00:18:31,437
Even then we knew.
That's why we called him Nellie.

394
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:34,312
Do you not know that expression, Michael?
I thought we were on the same page here.

395
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:36,938
It's a nice try, Pop, but in your
old computer I found a Nellie.

396
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:39,218
You're tryin' to tell me that
that is not my sister?

397
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:42,292
Yes. It's perfectly innocent.
She's my prostitute.

398
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:45,850
I'm a red-blooded man. I have certain needs
that your mom can't satisfy.

399
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:48,261
<i>But sex wasn't one of them.</i>

400
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:52,267
I just want my brother
to hand me my money.

401
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:54,701
But he's got that hair.

402
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:58,673
Why can't I have hair and money,
and him nothing?

403
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:01,335
She's not my sister. I let
her into the company.

404
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:03,618
You didn't give her access
to the cash, did you?

405
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:05,814
She said she liked me.

406
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:10,944
She's a prostitute. That's her job.
Oh, no. The N. Bluth account.

407
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:13,716
What? The N. Bluth account?
That is your account?

408
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:18,022
Maybe. But it's only embezzlement
if you spend it outside the company.

409
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:20,824
It's gone. It's empty.

410
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:23,161
- She got to it.
- There goes the company.

411
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:25,167
Okay. Now, hold on now.

412
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:28,727
Let's not panic because
I-I know someone who can find her.

413
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,932
- His name is Frank.
- That's Gob's puppet.

414
00:19:32,242 --> 00:19:34,836
I'm going to prison.

415
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:37,106
You haven't heard from Oscar
lately, have you?

416
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:38,681
- No.
- Okay.

417
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:41,182
<i>And the next day
Michael returned to the office...</i>

418
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:44,345
<i>to tell the employees
that Black Friday had indeed arrived.</i>

419
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:46,354
Hey, Ted. What's goin' on?

420
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:49,254
Nellie got all of us our checks
and these great new computers.

421
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,884
Excuse me. Nellie, you did this?

422
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:54,225
I took it out of the N. Bluth account.

423
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:56,697
If you spend it within the company,
it gives the prosecutors nothing.

424
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,792
Also, it was the only way to get myself
the 10 grand that you owed me.

425
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:02,371
Ten grand? What... What did you
do with these guys exactly?

426
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:05,703
They mostly just cried.
You've got a real morale problem here.

427
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,972
You cried?

428
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,552
Listen, I thought that
you were going to...

429
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,048
Steal it?

430
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:14,379
- Yes.
- But I might be your sister, remember?

431
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:18,079
The fact that you didn't steal it
might actually be proof that you're not.

432
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:21,487
Even if we're not related,
I think I would like for you to work here.

433
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:23,958
You're very, very good at it...

434
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:27,326
and what you do for a job is not really
a great way to make a living, you know?

435
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:29,991
- I make 300 grand a year.
- Marry me!

436
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,069
It's weird on so many levels.

437
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,570
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

438
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:37,640
<i>Gob has a religious conversion.</i>

439
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:40,232
I've seen a sign,
and I want to make this work.

440
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:43,609
A committed relationship
that actually means something.

441
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:49,584
How about you?
You want to do just the two of us?

442
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:53,315
<i>And Buster's fake coma
is put to its greatest test.</i>

443
00:20:57,194 --> 00:21:00,857
<i>- Don't you die on me. Don't you die on me.
- Oh, my.</i>
