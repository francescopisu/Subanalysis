1
00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:03,801
<i>Tonight, an Arrested Development
you can't miss.</i>

2
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:05,839
<i>A cavalcade of stars.</i>

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:10,173
<i>The shocking final moments
will be presented live.</i>

4
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:12,405
<i>And one of these people...</i>

5
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:16,784
<i>will die.</i>

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,280
<i>- The Bluths were desperate.
- I assume you've seen this.</i>

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,483
<i>The press had them
all but finished.</i>

8
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:25,179
<i>What? What is it?</i>

9
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,832
<i>This isn't gonna work
over the phone, Dad.</i>

10
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,022
Then get Bob Loblaw to hire me
another surrogate.

11
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:31,759
That's kind of the point.
Mr. Loblaw no longer works for us...

12
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:34,131
because someone wanted a boyfriend.

13
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:36,636
- Well, don't blame me.
- I was talking to Lindsay, actually.

14
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,265
But he was clearly turned off
to the both of you.

15
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:42,127
Now, we're gonna need a new lawyer.
And that

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,903
is going to mean about
a $100,000 retainer.

17
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:48,540
If we want a chance of keeping this family
going past the next few weeks...

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,084
we're gonna have to pull out
all the stops.

19
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:55,555
What am I talking about?
I'm talking about all of you getting jobs.

20
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:57,921
The best place to look for a job...

21
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:00,256
Who threw the tomato?

22
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:02,421
<i>How the hell are we gonna
get a hundred grand?</i>

23
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:04,571
I know this isn't exactly
what you're looking for...

24
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,294
but Maeby was just accepted
into private school.

25
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,886
I've sent the
check in already.

26
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:10,394
No, that's not what
I'm lookin' for at all.

27
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:12,632
Michael, it's the most
prestigious private school in town.

28
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,572
Oh, no. Not the Milford Academy.

29
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:17,509
<i>Children were neither
to be seen nor heard...</i>

30
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,671
<i>at the school Buster had attended.</i>

31
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:23,080
It's the exact opposite.
It's called "Openings."

32
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:26,643
Oh, great. That sounds like another one
of those gradeless, structureless...

33
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:28,655
New Age "feel-gooderies."

34
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:32,454
They teach self-expression and getting
in touch with feelings, Michael.

35
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:35,530
- I mean, I know you don't have any.
- The boy who couldn't cry.

36
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,530
He's a robot!

37
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:40,066
Oh, Michael can cry.
He just doesn't wanna rust.

38
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:43,001
<i>Yes, he's like the Steel Man
from The Wizard of Oz.</i>

39
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:45,164
- Tin Man?
- Is that what he's called?

40
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,470
He knows. - Since you sent the check,
this is how you're gonna pay for it.

41
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:51,944
You're gonna be in charge of the house.
Cooking, cleaning, all of it.

42
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:53,753
You're going to put Lindsay
in charge of the cooking?

43
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,483
At least you'll lose weight.

44
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:57,455
You know, Mom, I think
the only time you ever

45
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:59,350
cooked for us was the
morning Rosa's mom died.

46
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,513
You gave us cereal in an ashtray.

47
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,818
Gob, pal? How about you?
Can you find some work?

48
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:05,893
Oh, sure, Michael.

49
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:08,053
As what? A waiter?

50
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:10,188
Can I get you something, madam?

51
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:15,965
- I will have a vodka, though.
- What? Oh.

52
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:18,056
If you'd ever accidentally
worked a day in your

53
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,064
life, you'd know there's
no indignity in it.

54
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,642
Great. She'll have a vodka.

55
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:25,235
<i>Instead of selling out,
becoming housewives and waiters...</i>

56
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,644
<i>why don't we have a big event?</i>

57
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:29,979
"Some sort of â€œSave Our Bluths" type thing.

58
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,655
<i>We'll throw a legal defense fund dinner.
Ask for donations.</i>

59
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:37,657
As long as we don't look desperate.

60
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,421
We want 'em to think we'll take their help,
but don't need it.

61
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:42,429
I should be seen a lot at the club.

62
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:45,398
Yeah, our backs are against the wall,
and it's just hard to accept...

63
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,400
that it's really come to begging.

64
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:50,027
<i>Sometimes it's the only
way to stay in the game.</i>

65
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:52,436
<i>Please tell your friends about this show.</i>

66
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:02,774
<i>Michael had asked Lindsay
to take care of the house.</i>

67
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:04,370
<i>And to his surprise, she
was sort of doing it.</i>

68
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:05,878
<i>You're sort of doing it.</i>

69
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,857
Yeah, check it out. I found that
canned ham that we'd had forever...

70
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,120
and I put it in a pot of boiling water.

71
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:13,923
- And guess what I'm calling it?
- Soup?

72
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,864
Hot ham water. You know,
I'm actually a really good mom.

73
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,026
I think it's 'cause
Maeby's never around.

74
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:22,468
You should send George Michael
to Openings too.

75
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:24,540
Yes, it could help him
express his feelings.

76
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,973
My son expresses himself just fine.

77
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:29,637
- Isn't that right, Son?
- What? Yeah, it's fine.

78
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:31,873
Yeah, I guess.
I don't care. Stop.

79
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:34,643
Yes. He's a regular
Freddy Wilson, that one.

80
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:37,549
- I don't know that reference.
- No, I don't either.

81
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:40,555
Oh, I don't know either.

82
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:43,558
<i>- It's this guy.
- My son's fine where he is.</i>

83
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,220
He's got the S.A.T.'s coming up.
You gotta do well. You studying?

84
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,127
Yeah, I'm taking a three real quick
so I can get a cream soda.

85
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:50,568
Oh, I'll get that for you.

86
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:51,928
No, I will get it. I
have to get it myself.

87
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:54,765
Just relax.

88
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:57,635
Just check the stove real quick.

89
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:00,904
You know, Michael, if I may
take off my acting pants for a moment...

90
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,672
and pull my "analrapist" stocking
over my head...

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,147
George Michael has been
acting strange lately.

92
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:16,921
He may have developed
what we in the soft sciences...

93
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,256
refer to as obsessive-compulsive
disorder...

94
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:22,297
- or the OC Disorder.
- Don't call it that.

95
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:26,095
I think ultimately it's because
he's afraid to express himself.

96
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:30,639
<i>Actually, he was afraid his Aunt Lindsay
was going to burn the house down.</i>

97
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,607
Hi. How are you?

98
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:39,972
Cream soda.

99
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,551
Maybe he does need this school.
Did you see this letter?

100
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,210
You know, it's done wonders for Maeby.

101
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,720
- "Maeby is an exceptional young lady."
- Exceptional.

102
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,950
"We are sure that she is
destined for great things."

103
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:52,619
- Great things.
- "And we wish her luck in all her"...

104
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:57,126
It says "over." I'd probably have
to crack this open to be sure...

105
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:59,133
but this sounds like
an expulsion letter.

106
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,135
"She's never been to class."

107
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:03,398
What boarding school would
lose track of its students?

108
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:06,634
- Openings is not a boarding school.
- I thought it was a boarding school.

109
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:10,736
<i>Actually, Maeby had been on the set of
a film called Snowboarding School 2...</i>

110
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:13,475
<i>in her secret life
as a film executive.</i>

111
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,915
There goes that nonrefundable tuition.

112
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,919
It is the one rule they do have there.

113
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:19,921
She should be punished for this.

114
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:21,843
Tobias, if I can become a
more traditional mother,

115
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,686
then maybe you could
start being more of...

116
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:25,988
Nontraditional mother.
Yes, you're right.

117
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:27,995
After all, I am her father.

118
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:30,565
The cars are still off,
and I rewashed all the clothes.

119
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:32,658
<i>And that's when Michael decided...</i>

120
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:36,500
<i>that perhaps Maeby's tuition
didn't have to go to waste after all.</i>

121
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,836
<i>Meanwhile, Lucille went to work...</i>

122
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:42,173
<i>- soliciting for the Bluth fund-raiser.
- We have plenty of money.</i>

123
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:46,977
Don't get me wrong. But we can't use
our personal assets to defend the company.

124
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,177
<i>Just then,
Gob arrived and decided to have a laugh.</i>

125
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:53,278
Your drink, madam.

126
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,323
- Can I get you anything...
- Get that one out of here.

127
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,325
As you please.

128
00:05:57,427 --> 00:06:00,021
<i>But Lucille had never
made eye contact with a waiter.</i>

129
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:02,927
- Can you drop these off at two?
- Why not?

130
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:05,899
I'm just a waiter.

131
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:09,267
<i>- So he kept it up.
- We're all out of the halibut.</i>

132
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:13,741
<i>The joke was over,
but the lunch rush was just beginning.</i>

133
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:15,963
- Hey, new guy. You wanna seat table four?
- Oh, yeah.

134
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:19,539
<i>Back at the penthouse,
however, lunch was long overdue.</i>

135
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,209
I don't suppose she left
anything for me to eat.

136
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:25,219
No, just a soup and a half sandwich
and a whole sandwich for me.

137
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,982
- Ah.
- Hello. Hey.

138
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,990
So what's going on
with the fund-raiser?

139
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:32,994
Well, uh, I don't think the Home Builder's
Organization is gonna be supporting us.

140
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:35,564
Yeah, the HBO is not gonna want us.
What do we do now?

141
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:39,123
Well, I think it's showtime. I think
we have to have a show during dinner.

142
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,430
Hey, we could have some celebrities in.

143
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:43,937
You know, Oscar winners
like, uh, Nicole Kidman.

144
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't wanna round up
a bunch of famous people...

145
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:48,010
that have nothing to do
with our family as some stunt.

146
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:49,749
What's that got to do with us?

147
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:51,410
Nothing. You're gonna
write a speech about me...

148
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:53,414
so they can see how wonderful I am.

149
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:55,507
I think we got a better
chance at Nicole Kidman.

150
00:06:55,618 --> 00:06:56,920
Oh? Huh?

151
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,246
Actually, I may have
an in with Andy Richter.

152
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:01,755
Well, do you think you can get him?
I'm kidding. Of course not him.

153
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,793
His brother does teach
George Michael at Openings.

154
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:08,193
George Michael is going to
that New Age feel-gooderie?

155
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:11,098
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're gonna poison him against you.

156
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,691
Remember what happened when we sent
Lindsay to that kind of school?

157
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:16,601
All of a sudden I was
the-the bad guy to her.

158
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:20,073
And you don't respect Mom,
and you don't respect women.

159
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:24,275
- Are you married?
- Damn school.

160
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,111
I said to the teacher...
I said, "You poison her, I'll poison you."

161
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:30,617
<i>George Sr. Did more than just say it.</i>

162
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,518
<i>He sent the man a basket
of poison muffins.</i>

163
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:37,525
Do you know the Muffin Man?
There's a reward if you do.

164
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:39,595
Then, would you like some foam
in your coffee?

165
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:43,996
It's called a "cuppuccino,"
and wait till you see what it costs.

166
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,830
You can say what you want
about the Milford Academy.

167
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:50,667
The kids who came out of there,
prepared for life.

168
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:52,468
Does anyone know how
to eat one of these?

169
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,475
You know, George Michael's
gonna be fine, okay?

170
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:57,410
I just want him to know
how to express himself.

171
00:07:57,513 --> 00:08:00,311
<i>He was actually
having trouble expressing himself.</i>

172
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,316
Why don't you tell the group
about yourself?

173
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:05,012
My name is George Michael Bluth.

174
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:07,589
I am a 16-year-old Caucasian male.

175
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,022
My mom died.

176
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:12,856
And I-I guess that's it.

177
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:15,362
Hardly. See, if it were me, I would say...

178
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:17,620
"I'm Donnie Richter. I
have a brother named Andy."

179
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,799
He's an attention hog.

180
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:24,396
"He can't seem to really attract a real
audience, but I love the fat SOB anyway."

181
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:27,340
I thought you looked like Andy Richter.
You guys are identical twins?

182
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:29,343
Identical quintuplets, actually.

183
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,778
<i>There was Andy the show-off,
Donnie the sensitive one...</i>

184
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:37,012
<i>Chareth the flirt, Rocky the
risk-taker and Andy's stunt double...</i>

185
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,214
<i>and Emmett who asked that
we not show his picture...</i>

186
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:44,054
<i>although composite photography tells us
he'd look something like this.</i>

187
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,628
<i>Here's what I want you to do.
I want you to go home tonight...</i>

188
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:49,197
and write something about
how you really feel.

189
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:52,392
Something critical. Bring it in tomorrow
and read it for the group.

190
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:56,563
- Um, will this go toward my grade?
- Oh, we don't have grades here.

191
00:08:56,672 --> 00:09:01,541
A student either learns and gets an "L,"
or they fluctuate in their learning.

192
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:03,942
- And what do we get for that?
- An "F."

193
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:06,038
<i>Maeby, meanwhile...</i>

194
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,140
<i>- was about to have a learning experience.
- Well.</i>

195
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,914
I understand you've been having trouble
with that expensive boarding school.

196
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:13,921
That's right. I can read.

197
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:16,063
<i>Okay, first of all,
Variety got it wrong, all right?</i>

198
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,389
We didn't want this project.
It was a co-finance with Miramax.

199
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:20,621
Poof, Miramax is gone.
We're still on the hook.

200
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,630
It turns out Jamie Kennedy
can't even snowboard.

201
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:25,826
All right, I'll listen to this later.

202
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:30,304
Don't tell me where you've been. It'll
just make me worry more. But guess what.

203
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:33,398
There's a new daddy in town.

204
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,409
A discipline daddy.

205
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:39,838
Oh, it's, uh... It's a parenting tape.

206
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:43,077
If you wanna skip school, that's fine.
You'll just come to work with me.

207
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:45,086
But you don't have a job.

208
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:47,656
All right. Here.
Tell you what we're gonna do.

209
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:51,284
We are going to stuff each one
of these gift bags with...

210
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:56,263
a head shot, some glitter
and a decorative hand soap.

211
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:58,925
And we're gonna send 'em to
every casting director in town.

212
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:02,937
- And don't forget the funny notes.
- "I know where you live. Ha, ha"?

213
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,202
<i>- Casting directors hate this.
- They really do.</i>

214
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,368
The glitter queen struck again.

215
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:11,140
Never hire Tobias FÃ¼nke.

216
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:14,648
<i>And back at the country club,
something unusual had happened.</i>

217
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,968
Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale.
Unless,

218
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:19,210
did you expect me to
follow you to your car?

219
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:21,517
- They're your tips.
- Tips.

220
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:26,891
<i>And Gob realized
he'd accidentally worked a day in his life.</i>

221
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:28,896
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile,
was being a mother...</i>

222
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:31,159
<i>- when someone showed up who needed one.
- Hey, sister.</i>

223
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,260
- How'd you get here?
- I walked.

224
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:36,133
I tried hitchhiking,
but it's hard to do without a thumb.

225
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:40,335
- I'm so hungry.
- Would you like to try some of this?

226
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:42,809
Mmm.

227
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:46,643
So watery, and yet there's
a smack of ham to it.

228
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:48,808
It's hot ham water.

229
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:52,251
<i>Yeah. - Upstairs, George Michael
was struggling with his assignment.</i>

230
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:56,314
Can you think of anything critical
to say about my dad? - Are you serious?

231
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:59,724
I have glitter in my lungs from
making goody bags for casting directors.

232
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:01,869
And he's given me a hundred more
to do for homework.

233
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:05,526
It's, like, " I don't do my homework.
George Michael does my homework."

234
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:08,536
<i>And that's when he decided
it was time to cheat off of her.</i>

235
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:10,538
It might help if
you expressed yourself.

236
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,543
<i>It also gave him an opportunity
to smell her neck.</i>

237
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:17,545
<i>And the next day,
Michael drove to Openings...</i>

238
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:20,673
<i>in the hopes of recruiting
Donnie's brother for the fund-raiser...</i>

239
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:24,275
<i>when he noticed his son
expressing himself rather well.</i>

240
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:26,423
He pretends he's the
great father all of a

241
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,483
sudden and acts like he's
all worried about me.

242
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:32,288
But it turns out he just does it so I
can help him with his joke of a career.

243
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:34,522
No wonder Mom
wanted out so bad.

244
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,565
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

245
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:42,036
<i>Gob, meanwhile, was several days
in to being an accidental waiter.</i>

246
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:45,437
<i>And he discovered that
a little flirting helped bring in the tips.</i>

247
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:49,204
If you didn't have adult-onset diabetes,
I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar.

248
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:54,375
Oh, Gob. You could charm
the black off a telegram boy.

249
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:57,043
<i>Okay, we'll just tell you now.
She's the one who dies.</i>

250
00:11:57,153 --> 00:11:59,883
His name is Andy something.

251
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:03,390
I think he's Ed McMahon's kid.
A song and dance man.

252
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:05,727
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,
was there soliciting for the fund-raiser...</i>

253
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:06,922
<i>Lucille, meanwhile,
was there soliciting for the fund-raiser...</i>

254
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:10,226
<i>- but still hadn't noticed him.
- We'll have the lobster tail.</i>

255
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,665
<i>- Until this happened.
- And maybe later you can...</i>

256
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:15,896
save a little piece of tail for me.

257
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,905
Come on!

258
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:21,943
<i>I hope that isn't the sort of humor
Andy McMahon will be doing.</i>

259
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:24,069
Lobster, Mom?

260
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,239
<i>- And Michael went to confront Donnie.
- Hey!</i>

261
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:29,318
<i>Nice haircut and thanks
for turning my son against me.</i>

262
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:31,511
Oh, oh. No, no. I-I'm Andy.

263
00:12:31,621 --> 00:12:34,021
Oh. Sorry.

264
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:37,251
Oh, hey. How would you feel about
coming to a fund-raiser at our house?

265
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,920
- How much does it pay?
- It's just a free dinner, but...

266
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,929
- I'll be there.
- Great.

267
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:45,432
- I'll be in the cafeteria.
- Oh, he's such a pig.

268
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:47,695
You should know about
bad-mouthing family members.

269
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,703
I heard what you had
my son say out there.

270
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:51,773
He chose what to say.

271
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:54,638
- Maybe we should include him in this.
- No need.

272
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:56,331
You're the one that
poisoned him against me.

273
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:57,941
How would you like
that done to you?

274
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,538
Are you threatening to poison me?

275
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,677
I'm just expressing myself, man.

276
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:09,780
- What did I tell you?
- How dare that Donnie Richter.

277
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:12,486
Yeah, you gotta take care
of that guy, or I will.

278
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:15,120
- Yeah, yeah. Let me.
- This is not your business. No.

279
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:17,131
I'm just gonna pull him
out of that school.

280
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,225
You're damn right, you are.
We can't have this happen. Not now.

281
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:23,032
This family has got to stick together.

282
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,039
I don't want Gob coming to this dinner.

283
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,701
- Good idea.
- Guess where he's been getting his money.

284
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,744
Is he following people
to their cars again?

285
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:32,336
He's a waiter!

286
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:34,643
- He is? Well, that's great.
- No, it's not great.

287
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,843
Am I the only one that
thinks this family...

288
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:38,943
is finally starting to become
sympathetic and relatable?

289
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:42,015
That's what people wanna see, you know.
Lindsay's taking care of the house.

290
00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:44,322
Oh, I forgot about that.

291
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:47,419
Tell the "housewife"
she's not coming either.

292
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,082
If you don't want her, you
don't want me either.

293
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,658
She's taking care of me.

294
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:53,599
She glued my thumb back on.

295
00:13:53,703 --> 00:13:57,161
Sister's my new mother, Mother. And is it
just me, or is she looking hotter too?

296
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:59,503
- Why don't you marry her?
- Maybe I will!

297
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:02,270
We're veering away
from relatability again.

298
00:14:02,378 --> 00:14:05,245
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby was
getting tired of being with her father.</i>

299
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:08,112
Now what we do is we paint our lips
Joan Crawford red...

300
00:14:08,217 --> 00:14:12,176
pop on a little blue eyeliner and then
plant a lipstick kiss on every one of 'em.

301
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:15,883
Why the blue eyeliner? - Well, she felt
that her eyes were too close together.

302
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:18,687
Hello? Uh, yeah, uh...

303
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:22,286
It's a casting director.
Yes, he is available.

304
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:26,459
Uh, let me put my, uh...
our, uh, assistant on the phone with you.

305
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,970
Thank you, yes. I better get changed.

306
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,097
Thanks, Deb. Yeah.

307
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,369
So, he's Torture Victim
Number Four, right?

308
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:36,877
No, that's great.
Yeah, he's really into discipline.

309
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:39,641
<i>And George Michael
was about to get some discipline too.</i>

310
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:41,649
You are no longer
going to that school.

311
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:43,338
I don't wanna get into a
big discussion about it.

312
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:44,948
It's just not right for you.

313
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:47,818
Is this because I cheated off Maeby?
I've never done that before. I swear.

314
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:51,124
I couldn't think of anything about you,
so I asked her to write it about her dad.

315
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:54,492
- You cheated?
- Yeah, it was stupid of me.

316
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:58,727
<i>Now Donnie's met you. He's never gonna
believe you were up for a part in Wicked.</i>

317
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,802
You do what you have to.
You think I want to

318
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:02,793
give that speech about
Dad at the fund-raiser?

319
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:05,112
Sometimes you say you
hate your dad to get a

320
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,342
good grade or you like
him to make some money.

321
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:10,105
Sounds like you're doing a great job there.
We're keeping you in.

322
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:11,298
No...

323
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,407
I don't wanna have a
whole discussion about it.

324
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:17,248
Donnie. Well, I guess
I owe you an apology.

325
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:19,913
No.

326
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:23,253
- It's Andy again, isn't it?
- Rocky. Andy's the pig.

327
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,827
- Well, you're not exactly...
- I'm his stunt double.

328
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:28,419
You think I like this?
I disgust myself.

329
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:30,260
Let go of my dad.
You're gonna hurt him.

330
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:34,427
Oh, no. I'm only making it look like that.
He's totally in charge of the situation.

331
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,941
So what is the problem?

332
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:45,104
Somebody sent my brother Donnie
a basket of poison muffins.

333
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:47,375
It could've been the Muffin Man.
They never caught him.

334
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:49,288
<i>How do you know about that?</i>

335
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,217
<i>I saw it on Why We
Were Scared of the '70s.</i>

336
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,050
And what ever happened to the Muffin Man?
Remember him?

337
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:56,784
I always pictured a giant
six-foot muffin...

338
00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:58,792
trying to eat me while I was eatin' him.

339
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:01,294
It's kind of a fantasy
I go to a lot now.

340
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:04,298
<i>And he says you threatened to poison him.</i>

341
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,300
I was upset.

342
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,205
I'd just heard that my son
thought I was a horrible father.

343
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,031
But, no, I didn't poison him.

344
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,073
Well, if I find out you did...

345
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,877
Oh, uh, Andy wants to know,
at this dinner...

346
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:18,811
- you want him to sing or anything?
- A song would be fantastic.

347
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:23,716
You saw? I thought you didn't know
what I said about you.

348
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,719
Well, that wasn't exactly the truth.

349
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:28,346
But don't worry. I know you don't
have anything bad to say about me.

350
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:30,226
No. You know what? I
think Donnie was right.

351
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,018
I just wasn't digging
deep enough.

352
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:34,527
I think I might've meant what I said.
You never listen to me.

353
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:36,252
You didn't ask me if I
wanted to go to this school.

354
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:37,930
You didn't ask
about what I said.

355
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:41,093
You threatened my teacher.
You don't respect me.

356
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:43,330
How can I respect you, man?

357
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:45,703
<i>It was a complex situation...</i>

358
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,708
<i>without an easy solution.</i>

359
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,482
Hello?

360
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:51,255
The caterers didn't show up.
I used the club.

361
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,181
They said we owe them too much money.
I guess all those lunches.

362
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:57,053
I've got 50 people coming
in three hours and

363
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,846
nothing to feed them,
no one to serve it.

364
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:03,356
We have to make a good impression,
or we're finished.

365
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:06,428
<i>Now that's a clear-cut situation
with the promise of comedy.</i>

366
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:09,020
<i>Tell your friends.</i>

367
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:14,627
<i>The Save Our Bluths party
was starting to heat up.</i>

368
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:23,569
<i>But the same could not be said
for Lindsay's chicken.</i>

369
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,614
What is going on?
They're getting restless.

370
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:27,616
I can't offer to!@%$ them
in front of their husbands.

371
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:29,879
This is what you're making?
Poached salmonella?

372
00:17:29,987 --> 00:17:32,455
It'll be fine.
I'll just put the sauce on them.

373
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:34,456
What kind of sauce is that?

374
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,458
Wait. This is the water
I thawed the chicken in.

375
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,391
Oh. Well, that should go with chicken.

376
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:41,089
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.

377
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,098
<i>And some powerful players showed up.</i>

378
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,259
George, Bill Kincade
from Fostco Industries.

379
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,896
<i>Sort of. - Hope you don't mind.
I sent one of those stupid surrogates.</i>

380
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:51,668
- You got busted too?
- No, I had a prior engagement.

381
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:55,939
- I'm at the Fire and Ice Ball.
- Coming through. Chicken in chicken sauce.

382
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:57,946
Thank you very much for showing up.

383
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:00,278
Maybe you could sing while
they're bringing out dinners.

384
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:02,618
Uh, I'm not Andy. I'm Emmett.

385
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,246
Uh, I'm not Andy. I'm Emmett.

386
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:07,323
Andy sent me over to let you know
he's not gonna make it tonight.

387
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:10,188
<i>Michael was suspicious.
I mean, think about it.</i>

388
00:18:10,294 --> 00:18:12,762
<i>We can't show Emmett
without blurring him.</i>

389
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,629
Yeah, he's singing at
the Fire and Ice Ball tonight.

390
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,531
Andy Richter is singing
at the Fire and Ice Ball?

391
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:24,096
You know, I should send Andy
a little basket of poison muffins too.

392
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,108
Muffins?

393
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,179
Oh, my God. Dad?
You're the Muffin Man?

394
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,146
You poisoned 25 teachers
during the '70s?

395
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:34,183
Just the first two.
The others were copycats.

396
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:37,014
- You poisoned Donnie, didn't you?
- We're losing them. Come on. Come on.

397
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:40,716
Can I have your attention?
My son would like to say...

398
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:42,883
just a couple of words about me.

399
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:46,019
<i>And that's when Michael
noticed his own son.</i>

400
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,223
- You came, huh?
- Yeah, well, it was wrong of me...

401
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:50,823
to say what I did
about how I felt.

402
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:54,461
No, you said what you felt, and maybe
it's about time I did the same thing.

403
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:56,374
So why don't we just let
him express himself?

404
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:58,200
Go ahead, Son.

405
00:18:58,308 --> 00:19:03,405
Um, I was going to say that you don't know
who my father really is.

406
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:07,575
And-And-And that what has happened to us
is a great injustice...

407
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:10,152
that we were never really
given a fair chance.

408
00:19:10,254 --> 00:19:13,553
But that's not the truth.

409
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:15,591
We've been given
plenty of chances.

410
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:18,490
And maybe, the Bluths
just aren't worth saving.

411
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:21,826
Maybe we're not that likable. You know?
We're very self-centered.

412
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:24,594
And my father may be the worst of us.

413
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:26,692
Me too. You know, I-I seem to...

414
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:29,400
I threaten people who I
don't feel support me.

415
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:34,168
He poisons them.
Anyway, here's my advice to you.

416
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:37,042
Go and take a goody bag
and get out while you can.

417
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:42,781
<i>The speech was disturbing,
the food inedible...</i>

418
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:46,117
<i>and the gift bags pretty frightening.</i>

419
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:48,350
<i>And when Gob realized
he wouldn't get tipped...</i>

420
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,517
Wait. No. No.
Where's everyone going?

421
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:52,117
<i>The service got a little worse.</i>

422
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:55,426
No one's leaving until I get my money!
I'll follow you to your cars!

423
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:59,263
<i>Oh, and then that
old racist woman choked on Buster's thumb.</i>

424
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,249
- My thumb! My thumb!
- This lady can't breathe.

425
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:03,933
<i>All in all, it was one
of the Bluths' better dinner parties.</i>

426
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:09,078
- Hey, what'd you think of the speech?
- You'd do great at Openings.

427
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,842
You know, pal,
you do not have to go there.

428
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,270
I've been very worried
about your behavior.

429
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:17,614
You're always turning off
burners and irons...

430
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:21,714
and it may be OCD.

431
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:23,713
OCD? No. I'm just cleaning
up after Aunt Lindsay.

432
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:25,625
She never turns things off.

433
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:27,629
Wow. Hmm.

434
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:29,858
Explains why I saw hedge trimmers
zippin' around the driveway.

435
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,162
I did it again, didn't I?
I'm so self-centered.

436
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,432
From now on, I want you to just tell me
what's on your mind, okay?

437
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:40,306
And I promise, you know,
I won't just hear what I wanna hear, okay?

438
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:45,548
- I love my cousin.
- I love you, too, pal.

439
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:51,113
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

440
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:53,985
<i>The Bluth family gets some good news.</i>

441
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:57,492
They're all sending in donations.
And you know what the key was?

442
00:20:57,594 --> 00:21:00,324
- What?
- Your speech. It didn't sound desperate.

443
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,194
Well, I-I guess it really doesn't pay
to be desperate.

444
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,860
It sure doesn't.

445
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:08,802
<i>And cut.</i>

446
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,805
Good job, man.

447
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:13,548
Let's not celebrate yet.
We've still got the West Coast feed, guys.
