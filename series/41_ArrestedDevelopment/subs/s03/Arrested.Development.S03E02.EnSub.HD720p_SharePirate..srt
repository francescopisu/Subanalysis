1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:02,661
<i>Previously on Arrested Development.</i>

2
00:00:02,771 --> 00:00:05,831
<i>Michael and his son were
camping out at the family cabin...</i>

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:07,880
<i>before it was to be relocated.</i>

4
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:09,843
<i>I'm just in the middle
of a stupid girl problem.</i>

5
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:13,005
I don't even have a girl,
much less a stupid one.

6
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:15,345
No, the problem is stupid.
The girl isn't stupid.

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,918
<i>But if they ever had a
child, it would be...</i>

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,783
<i>because the girl
was his cousin Maeby.</i>

9
00:00:19,888 --> 00:00:22,968
Tomorrow morning, before we tell the cops
that that's not Pop-Pop in prison...

10
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:25,220
we're gonna go down
to the lake, we're gonna discuss...

11
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:27,367
your girl problem man-to-man,
and it's gonna be fun.

12
00:00:27,396 --> 00:00:29,296
Especially the part about the cops.

13
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:31,923
<i>But Pop-Pop had other plans...</i>

14
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:37,561
<i>and Michael awoke to find
his camping trip going south.</i>

15
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:40,197
Well, you better get up now
if you want to see the lake.

16
00:00:42,177 --> 00:00:45,112
<i>And that was when George Sr.
Made a desperate plea.</i>

17
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,704
Promise me you won't
send me back to prison...

18
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:51,252
so I can be with my dear love Lucille...

19
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:53,253
in the twilight of her face.

20
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:56,153
<i>Michael didn't send his
father back to prison...</i>

21
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:59,716
<i>but instead arranged for him
to be placed under house arrest.</i>

22
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:01,887
George, we're never going to be...

23
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:03,897
out of each other's sight.

24
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:06,229
<i>Which made this woman his warden.</i>

25
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:09,997
Oh, dear God.
Send me back to prison.

26
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:12,164
- You gotta send me back to prison.
- More touching.

27
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:18,976
<i>Michael went to
his parents' penthouse to discuss...</i>

28
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:21,572
<i>his father's ever-worsening
legal situation.</i>

29
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:23,683
- Where is everybody?
- How should I know, Michael?

30
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:26,483
As soon as Father came back,
I've been like the Invisible Man.

31
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:29,523
"Hello! Can anyone see me?"

32
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:32,491
- Where's your hand, anyway?
- Why even bother getting dressed up?

33
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:35,586
- I have no one.
- Buster, come on now.

34
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:37,597
If you're really lonely, maybe
it's time you went out there...

35
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:40,327
and you got yourself
a girlf... A pet.

36
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,926
- How about a turtle?
- Great.

37
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:45,939
I've always loved those
leathery little snappy faces.

38
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,941
You certainly have a type.

39
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:50,511
Mother, have you seen
my rubber hand?

40
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:53,532
Oh, it's in the dishwasher. Your father
and I were using it for something.

41
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,448
Oh, for God's sake.

42
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,987
- Can't you keep my hand to yourself?
- Uh, "used it for something"?

43
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:02,128
He's just jealous that I have
a man back in my life.

44
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:05,216
And guess what else is back.

45
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:10,229
- My breakfast?
- My friskiness.

46
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:14,496
- Mama horny, Michael.
- No, it's my breakfast.

47
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:17,572
I'm amazed Dad hasn't strangled
himself with his belt yet.

48
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:21,039
Oh, we're into all kinds of freaky stuff.

49
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:24,203
Why do I eat breakfast before I come here?

50
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,576
What the hell is this?

51
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:29,081
Well, now that Dad's back,
I'm going to perform...

52
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:32,813
one grand illusion for him
before he strangles himself with his belt.

53
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:35,321
- No, no. Turns out they're into that.
- Oh.

54
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,256
Well, check it.
The illusion is called "Free Bird."

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,319
A magical bird... me in a beak...
stands on a platform.

56
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,762
There's a puff of smoke, then I'm gone.

57
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:48,063
Then seconds later, high above
in a once-empty cage...

58
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,695
- Who should appear?
- A guy that kind of looks like you?

59
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:53,330
No. Not how I do the trick.

60
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:56,740
Even if it was, how'd
the look-alike get up there?

61
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,040
- He was hiding behind this mirror here?
- No!

62
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,377
For your information,
Dad asked me to do this...

63
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,383
on the day he pleads not guilty...

64
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:05,612
as a spectacular protest.

65
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,950
A "protest-acular."

66
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:10,354
Maybe even get it
on the local news.

67
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,188
Excuse me. I was just
looking for a marker...

68
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,526
A Magic Marker.

69
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:19,464
I want it out of my living room.
Put it in Buster's room.

70
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:22,162
That's where she keeps things
she has no need for.

71
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,431
Oh, God.

72
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,939
I'm gonna run this through again
on "Pots and Pans."

73
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,879
You know, Gob, instead
of trying to impress a

74
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:30,739
father that couldn't
care less about you...

75
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,745
why don't you try spending
some time with your son...

76
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:35,145
who's dying to reconnect with you?

77
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,582
<i>Gob had discovered
he was the father of this boy.</i>

78
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:41,247
Well, then just tell him that Steve
Holt stopped by, okay? - Okay.

79
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,256
<i>He'd been ducking him ever since.</i>

80
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:46,725
Tom? Come on over here.
I've got a vitamin for you.

81
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:49,319
- He's the one who can't see me.
- Because you were hiding in the trick?

82
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:52,992
Illusion, Michael.

83
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:55,069
I so very much would like to be...

84
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,070
in your "prostate-icular"...

85
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:59,970
- as your look-alike.
- Right.

86
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:02,066
They're gonna see the ink.
It's more of a leading man role.

87
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:04,611
But it's not really done that way.

88
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:09,173
Guess I shouldn't have
used a permanent marker.

89
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:12,479
Starting to see why
you want that divorce.

90
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,919
Yeah, well, actually,
I've been thinking.

91
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:16,923
Instead of spending money
on a divorce...

92
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:20,654
which can be slow...
well, maybe I should get something faster.

93
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,753
Not the car.
I said no to the Volvo.

94
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:25,856
The Lexus. The Volvo didn't have
satellite radio, which is crazy.

95
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,867
I mean, what are we, Amish?

96
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,834
I knew you wouldn't have the guts
to go through with the divorce.

97
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:32,600
You're one to talk. You haven't had
a serious relationship since your wife.

98
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:36,438
And... you guys weren't even
speaking toward the end.

99
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:39,843
- Lot of that was the coma.
- Yeah. I've heard your side of it.

100
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:42,940
You haven't had the guts
to meet someone else.

101
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,851
- Uh...
- Look who finally got his pants on.

102
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:48,855
You've got 10 minutes.

103
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,925
You gotta get me out of here.

104
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:53,119
You're the one that said no to prison.

105
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:56,061
I was wrong. There you just had
to shut your eyes and take it.

106
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:59,224
Here you have to shut your eyes
and give it. Now listen.

107
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,234
We can't just go in there
and plead not guilty.

108
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:04,237
We have to have someone big
behind us. Our own private Matlock.

109
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,204
So I made some calls, and I got him.

110
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,469
- Got who?
- Andy Griffith.

111
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,874
- What, you never saw Matlock?
- Not a real attorney, Dad.

112
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:14,047
Now, for 10 grand, he'll actually...

113
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,709
sit behind us in court
and read the paper.

114
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:19,912
For 15, he'll actually sit
at the defense table.

115
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,649
For $20,000, he'll twice...

116
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:26,989
lean forward
and whisper something in your ear.

117
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,154
Oh. White suit...
That's extra.

118
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:32,700
Well, that's an awful lot of money
for the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

119
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,326
- The juries love him.
- That's just it, Dad.

120
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:38,736
There won't be a jury
because we are pleading guilty.

121
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,207
I am not guilt...
I didn't want to tell you this.

122
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,404
- Ready for the bombshell?
- Andy Griffith wasn't the bombshell?

123
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:49,074
I'm a patsy.
I was set up... by the Brits.

124
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:52,585
A group of British builders
operating outside the OC...

125
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,587
- Don't call it that.
- Contacted me...

126
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,055
for a partnership
to build homes overseas.

127
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:59,854
I did not know they meant Iraq.

128
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,802
We've got a picture of you
with Saddam Hussein.

129
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:04,889
I thought that was the guy
who played the Soup Nazi.

130
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,559
- Come on.
- I told him how much I liked his work.

131
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,365
The Brits used that picture
to blackmail me.

132
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:13,134
A picture like that, Michael,
can end your career.

133
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,801
Not in every case.

134
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,901
These are dangerous people, Michael.
They'll do whatever it takes...

135
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:20,537
to get inside this family
and just bring us down.

136
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,587
British people.

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,550
Oh, they're polite and
the men all sound gay...

138
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:27,212
but they will rip out
your heart and...

139
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:30,291
- Their breath...
- And you want to go after these people?

140
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:32,724
Well, yes, it takes
a little courage, Michael.

141
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,727
I know that's not
your strongest suit.

142
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:38,230
You're... You're even scared
to ask a girl out on a date.

143
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,166
Wh... Why does everybody
think that I'm scared of girls?

144
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,122
Because you're a chicken.
You're a chicken.

145
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:42,998
No, I'm not.

146
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:48,064
What are you doing?

147
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,235
Michael and women?

148
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:52,939
That's what I was just telling him.

149
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,947
Look, I haven't found the right girl.

150
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,949
When I do, I will ask her out.

151
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,781
Has anyone in this family
ever even seen a chicken?

152
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:02,015
Wait, wait. I've got the perfect thing!

153
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:04,751
That's enough.
I will give it one day.

154
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,350
All right? I'll see if there's any
evidence of these nefarious Brits.

155
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:10,488
But I'm warning you...
If I can't, we're pleading guilty.

156
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:13,863
You're either going to jail, of if the
judge shows absolutely no mercy at all...

157
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:16,198
you'll be staying here with my mother.

158
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,864
Lindsay, I didn't want to tell you earlier,
but I did get you a car.

159
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,601
- Is it the Lexus?
- It's more like a Lincoln.

160
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,119
Oh, come on!

161
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,053
There's no satellite radio,
but there's a banjo in the closet.

162
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:37,317
And watch out for live-ins.

163
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:40,019
You will get some live-ins.

164
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:48,332
<i>Michael was investigating
his father's case...</i>

165
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:51,532
<i>in the English section
of Orange County.</i>

166
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:53,541
Lanes reverse!

167
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:56,237
You're driving on the wrong side,
you bloomin' idiot!

168
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:58,177
I need to check the records...

169
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,146
for any British-owned
building businesses...

170
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,809
that would have applied for license
about 10 years ago.

171
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,185
Oh, I'm so sorry. You need
a U.K. Passport to check those files.

172
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,088
They're for British eyes only.

173
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:14,026
Don't I look kind of British?

174
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,155
Perhaps if you're willing
to lose 20 pounds.

175
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,165
<i>The clerk was asking for a bribe...</i>

176
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:22,033
<i>- but this was lost on Michael.
- You guys do go for the jugular.</i>

177
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:24,538
If you find someone with a passport,
we're here till 8:00...

178
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,165
and do stay for the Poppins.

179
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:29,176
<i>So Michael went to the local pub...</i>

180
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:31,542
<i>- Bloody Yank!
- To see if he could find someone...</i>

181
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:34,241
<i>- with a British passport.
- Welcome to the Yellow Fang.</i>

182
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,784
I am Lionel, and the soup of the day is...

183
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:39,081
What's the soup of the day, Mum?

184
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:42,521
- Bread.
- And the soup of the day is bread...

185
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,593
Unless you're just here for the Poppins.

186
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:48,357
<i>And that's when Michael saw
the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.</i>

187
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:50,398
<i>Not her.</i>

188
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,400
<i>Wait for it.</i>

189
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,632
Are you from Wee Britain?

190
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:02,711
Great Britain, actually.

191
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:05,747
I was wondering if you might
be willing to go somewhere with me.

192
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:09,716
- I will pay you.
- You'll pay me?

193
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:13,516
Not... Not for sex. You're gonna think
that I'm Jack the Ripper, right?

194
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:16,990
- Didn't he kill prostitutes or...
- I'm not a prostitute.

195
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:19,960
Then I shall let you live.

196
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:23,226
This is my worst hello.
Let me try again.

197
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:25,732
- My name is Michael.
- Rita.

198
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:27,735
So I need access to these files...

199
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:30,032
that are apparently
for British eyes only.

200
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:34,803
Well, lucky for you,
my whole face is British.

201
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,578
It's just across the street.
I really appreciate... Hello.

202
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:41,820
I thought you said you
were open till 8:00.

203
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,981
Oh, yes... GMT.

204
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:45,987
Everything here is on Greenwich mean time.

205
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,683
What a curious street.

206
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,693
Uh... Wait, wait, Rita. I don't suppose
that you're here tomorrow morning?

207
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:55,787
Oh, no. Not in the morning, no.
I'll be back at Slowbrooke.

208
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:58,799
Slowbrooke... The private school.
You teach kids, huh?

209
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:00,960
I like to think they teach me.

210
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,338
Like what? How to eat
crayons, throw tantrums...

211
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,630
Oh, no.

212
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:06,537
Not when I'm there.
I'm very good.

213
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:10,635
I didn't mean to impugn
your ability or, uh...

214
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:13,146
It's turning into one
of my worst good-byes.

215
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,547
Farewell, and, uh...

216
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:18,279
our paths shan't cross again.

217
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:20,787
As you like it.

218
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,653
<i>Michael would have walked away forever...</i>

219
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,623
<i>but he was struck by
something he remembered...</i>

220
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:27,321
<i>- from his childhood.
- You know...</i>

221
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,228
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it's the flight of the Mary Poppins.</i>

222
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,496
<i>- Mary Poppins will take...
- Well, must be the Poppins.</i>

223
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:36,697
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's wrong to laugh.

224
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:40,207
No, no, it was good. I liked it.
I was just gonna ask you...

225
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,209
Pre-schools just go half day, right?

226
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:45,280
I'm not trying to pick you up, but
is there any way that I can come by...

227
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:48,145
- pick you up, bring you here?
- Yeah, I... I, uh...

228
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:51,812
I suppose I could sneak out at nap time.

229
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,821
- Yes? Perfect. Great.
- Mmm.

230
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:56,153
And I shall drop you
off alive, hooker or no.

231
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:01,261
<i>Tobias, still hoping to
be in Gob's trick...</i>

232
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,719
<i>ventured into a costume
shop he'd stumbled upon...</i>

233
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:06,097
<i>Oh, look who's back.</i>

234
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:07,857
<i>Years earlier.</i>

235
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,535
<i>Are you gonna buy this
time, or you just curious?</i>

236
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,267
I suppose I'm, uh, buy-curious.

237
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,343
I have a big TV opportunity.

238
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:16,570
This is where all the big TVs come.

239
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,445
- Uh, let's start with the Eve Arden.
- All right.

240
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,450
<i>Michael, meanwhile, called his sister.</i>

241
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:25,715
I wanted to tell you that I got myself
a date with a beautiful woman...

242
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:29,257
named Rita, and you're the chicken, not me.

243
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:31,690
Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck...

244
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:35,560
Okay. That's a pretty good chicken.

245
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:48,809
Watch out!

246
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:51,573
Crazy Brit!

247
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:53,774
What's the problem?

248
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,783
I know what you were
doing back there.

249
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,785
And if you've got half
a!@%$? brain...

250
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:01,050
- you'll leave it alone.
- You talking about back in Wee Britain?

251
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:03,057
- I was just asking a few questions.
- Yeah...

252
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,059
A few too many, if you ask me.

253
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,721
How would you like someone going
after some stupid person in your family?

254
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,594
Now, back off, you!@%$? ponce!

255
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:14,963
Wow.

256
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:17,631
Dad was not kidding
about their breath.

257
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,244
<i>Michael had just been threatened...</i>

258
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:23,779
<i>by a foul-mouthed British man.</i>

259
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:25,781
It's Michael. I'm not dressed.

260
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:28,249
Gob, this is Michael.

261
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:30,513
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for your "Free Bird" trick?

262
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:32,589
- I couldn't get the rights to "Free Bird."
- Oh.

263
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,318
I'm thinking about calling it "Free..."
I don't know. "Chicken."

264
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:38,259
I thought you were investigating Dad's
sinister British connection.

265
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:40,262
Yeah. I, uh, tried, but, uh...

266
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:42,264
when I was leaving...

267
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:45,494
one of those British guys
came after me and told me to back off.

268
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:47,696
Can't believe it, but Dad
may have been telling the truth.

269
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:49,192
This might be dangerous.

270
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:50,603
So you came back here
to hide like a child.

271
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,562
What are you doing locked
in my office, exactly?

272
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:54,439
Hiding from a child.

273
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,604
- Big difference.
- Gob, Steve Holt is your son.

274
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:59,274
- He probably just feels a connection.
- He doesn't know what he feels.

275
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,283
I'm tried of being told.

276
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,618
My God.
What is this feeling?

277
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:07,691
You know, the feeling that you're...

278
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:10,852
that you're feeling, it's just
what many of us call a feeling.

279
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:12,861
It's not like envy...

280
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:15,864
- Or even hungry.
- Could it be love?

281
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:17,553
I know what an erection
feels like, Michael.

282
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,163
No. It's the opposite.

283
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,465
It's like my heart is getting hard.

284
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:25,202
Maybe I am ready to be a father.

285
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:27,368
- Hey, Dad?
- Whoa!

286
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:29,469
It's my son, Gob.

287
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,366
You know, and what is
it with the fathers in

288
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,175
this family always trying
to deceive their...

289
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:35,650
<i>And that's when
Michael realized that the man...</i>

290
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:38,278
<i>who threatened him
must have been hired by George Sr.</i>

291
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,357
I'm the patsy.

292
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,626
Well, I gotta go.
George Michael?

293
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:46,594
I'm sorry, but we're gonna talk
about that girl later, okay?

294
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:48,597
Now all I have to do
is find that look-alike, Michael.

295
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,599
Michael?

296
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:54,400
Hey!

297
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:57,669
That's a woman's wig.

298
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:59,675
I was told it was a bob.

299
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:04,774
<i>- And Michael confronted his father.
- Find out anything?</i>

300
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,782
Yeah, I found out no matter
how many times I promise myself...

301
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:08,784
I'm not gonna fall for it,
I always end up...

302
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,911
- getting hustled by you.
- What are you talking about?

303
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:13,785
The guy that you hired to threaten me
after I looked into the British connection.

304
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:15,771
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Somebody threatened you?

305
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,885
It's a wonderful performance.
You're a regular Brad Garrett.

306
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,875
But I don't watch TV
at 3:00 in the afternoon...

307
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:21,724
and you can forget
about pleading not guilty.

308
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:24,359
- Guilty. We gotta plead guilty.
- What?

309
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:26,800
Michael, I didn't hire anyone,
I... I swear.

310
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:29,771
If someone came after you,
they're for real.

311
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:32,775
- Come on. You serious?
- I told you. These are bad guys.

312
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:35,107
They do not want
this information out.

313
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:37,373
He said he was gonna come
after somebody stupid in our family.

314
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,473
- That could be Buster.
- Could be Gob.

315
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,451
- You're not guilty.
- We have to plead guilty.

316
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:44,959
We gotta plead guilty.

317
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,387
We gotta throw ourselves
on the mercy of the court.

318
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,755
- We gotta get Andy Griffith.
- In the suit.

319
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,885
<i>And Michael went to cancel with Rita.</i>

320
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:54,430
Sorry. I just wanted
to let you know...

321
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,965
that I'm not gonna be needing
your passport after all.

322
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:59,427
We're just gonna go to court, plead guilty.
That'll be that.

323
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:03,132
- So it's bye-bye to Rita, then?
- Yes, I'll shake your hand good-bye...

324
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,801
but, actually, I was wondering
if you might want to...

325
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:10,142
I wouldn't. I'll make you blue.

326
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:13,182
<i>Rita was just talking
about the finger paint...</i>

327
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:15,525
<i>- but Michael didn't know that.
- I was just wondering...</i>

328
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:19,453
if you might want to bid me fair morrow.

329
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:23,253
<i>Michael was filled with self-loathing.</i>

330
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,456
<i>Had he been Jack the Ripper,
he would have soothed himself...</i>

331
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:30,032
<i>in a most unsavory way.</i>

332
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:32,193
<i>But instead he just
sat in his car...</i>

333
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:35,500
<i>and ate a whole thing
of candy beans.</i>

334
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:39,235
<i>And back at the penthouse,
Gob had been called to see his father.</i>

335
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:41,243
New plan, right?

336
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:44,337
<i>You put me in the trick.
You make me the guy in the cage.</i>

337
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:46,528
Okay, I just gotta say
I'm really blown away by this.

338
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:49,848
You really want to be part of my world.

339
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:52,189
I do.

340
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,448
God, I feel like my heart is
straining through my shirt.

341
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,719
They take the ankle monitor off
when I get to court.

342
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:59,694
So, you make me disappear,
you put Tobias in the cage...

343
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:02,698
and by the time they realize
that that guy is not me...

344
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,394
I'm running through
the storm drains to freedom.

345
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:07,993
Where every day it rains...

346
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:10,539
pennies from heaven!

347
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:17,375
It was a... bird day...

348
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:20,382
Gob, I know you're looking
for a twin for your illusion...

349
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:23,317
and there's somebody
I'd like to put in a plug for.

350
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,379
Uh... Correction.
Make that 4,000 plugs.

351
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:29,220
- Oh, God!
- Oh, come on.

352
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,725
Mr. Gay, he's bleeding.
Mr. Gay...

353
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:33,388
No, no, no, no...
I was scared too...

354
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:36,489
but I realized it was
of being a leading man.

355
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,195
Oh, I can just taste those meaty
leading-man parts in my mouth.

356
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:43,273
All right, listen to me. The trick
has changed. We want you to play me now.

357
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:46,775
Oh, but that would mean
I'd have to sh...

358
00:16:46,877 --> 00:16:49,573
Shave my very...
tender head. I see.

359
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,376
Okay. Well, perhaps
I jumped the gun...

360
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:54,383
on those new head shots.

361
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:58,844
<i>And later that day,
Michael arrived at the courthouse.</i>

362
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,981
I can't believe you're
just giving up like this.

363
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:03,059
Well, the guy threatened our family.
We have to plead guilty.

364
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,128
No, I'm talking about that girl
you said you have a date with.

365
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:07,197
All right, so I lied.
It wasn't a date.

366
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,197
But you could have
made one with her.

367
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,460
I think that Poppins knocked
the courage out of you.

368
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:13,468
I guess I'm just not in her league.

369
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,561
- How did you hear about the Poppins?
- It was on the news.

370
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:18,698
An unlicensed Mary Poppins
takes down another tourist.

371
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:23,371
Is this the work of the Itsy Bitsy IRA?

372
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,380
I don't want to talk about this.

373
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:27,541
Dad, we're gonna go in there,
Andy Griffith's gonna whisper something.

374
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,551
We're gonna plead guilty.
Nice and simple.

375
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:32,121
- You didn't hear. We lost Andy.
- What are you talking about?

376
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:35,214
- He didn't like his trailer.
- He thought we were making fun of him.

377
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:37,486
<i>No one was making fun of Andy Griffith.</i>

378
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:39,562
<i>I can't emphasize that enough.</i>

379
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:43,632
Oh, God. Don't look now...

380
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,634
but Gob's doing his magic show.

381
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:48,762
Oh, boy, a stupid magic show.
We gotta watch this.

382
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:50,908
A big turnout.

383
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,968
A lot of people are probably
here for the free chicken.

384
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:54,977
Gather round, humans...

385
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,979
and I will show you the plight...

386
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:59,015
of an innocent man
who yearns to be...

387
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:02,313
free as a bird!

388
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:05,820
I've gotta start labeling these suits.

389
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:08,687
Who shall I send on this journey...

390
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,283
to that dangling cage?

391
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:15,331
Oh, pick me. Look, could I be
in this stupid trick?

392
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:17,491
- Please?
- Steve Holt, what are you doing here?

393
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:19,967
I just came to see the magic show.

394
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,970
I didn't know it was you.

395
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:25,200
- Do you like magic?
- No.

396
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,675
<i>- I love it.
- And at that moment...</i>

397
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:31,009
<i>Gob chose to show his own son
what he was capable of.</i>

398
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:33,379
I've decided I will be
performing the feat...

399
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:35,384
myself.

400
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:39,320
<i>- Wait. We're back to hair?
- Fortunately for Tobias, however...</i>

401
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:43,519
<i>he'd found it too painful
to part with his new hair.</i>

402
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:48,030
<i>- Boy. Did I catch a break.
- So he opted to wear a bald cap.</i>

403
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:50,123
This chicken...

404
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:52,862
shall be wrongly cooped.

405
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:59,707
- Is that a chicken?
- Oh, my God.

406
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,007
- Dad, are you all right?
- I fooled his own son.

407
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:06,708
I am a leading man.

408
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:09,012
<i>And Gob himself
was running through the storm drains...</i>

409
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,212
I'm sorry, Steve.

410
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:13,152
<i>- Free as a chicken.
- I need to be a father.</i>

411
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:17,193
<i>And George Sr. Needed to escape too.</i>

412
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:19,694
I got him.

413
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:23,598
Keeps him out of the kitchen.

414
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,601
<i>And Michael,
seeing what a life of cowardice leads to...</i>

415
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:28,830
<i>decided he'd had enough of it.</i>

416
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:31,737
<i>And soon George Sr. Came to,
and it was time...</i>

417
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,742
<i>- to render a plea.
- Oh, no.</i>

418
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:36,074
Prosecution's got that stud from L.A. Law.

419
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,047
- It's Harry Hamlin.
- I love my trailer.

420
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:41,242
In the matter of The People v. Bluth...

421
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:45,754
- how do you plead?
- We plead... not guilty.

422
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,016
Order in the court!

423
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,025
- Who let a flashbulb camera in?
- What are you doing?

424
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:51,645
I'm tired of the cowardice.
You're not guilty.

425
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,187
We're gonna fight this.

426
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:55,561
They don't have a!@%$? prayer.

427
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,033
Send the check to my accountant.

428
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:02,731
- This is where Andy could have helped us.
- I'm proud of you.

429
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,739
It's about time I showed a little courage.

430
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:06,775
I just hope those Brits
aren't as dangerous as Dad said.

431
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,777
Well, they're not gonna
get any closer to us.

432
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:12,110
If they do, we're gonna see them coming.
Oh, my God. That's Rita.

433
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:15,617
I told her I was coming here and she came.

434
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,448
- That's Rita?
- Yeah.

435
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:22,790
Wow. She is way out of his league.

436
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:25,623
I'm glad you're here.

437
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:28,323
I wanna call you sometime
and take you out.

438
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:30,400
Oh.

439
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,491
I'd really like that.

440
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,800
<i>And then, just to prove
to himself he wasn't a coward...</i>

441
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:41,776
<i>he went one step further.</i>

442
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:48,484
<i>And Rita was happy
to be in Michael's life as well.</i>

443
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:54,487
<i>For you see, Rita
had a secret of her own.</i>
