1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:03,401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:14,843
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:20,914
<i>Michael Bluth began his day
with something he'd never seen before.</i>

6
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:23,184
<i>I'm hearing good things
about the Bluth Company.</i>

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,725
<i>Good news about
his family's housing business.</i>

8
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:28,125
<i>Old man Bluth's in jail.
I think his son is running the company.</i>

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,460
<i>Doesn't seem like
a total moron to me.</i>

10
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:34,899
<i>I've had this thing as a triple sell, and
I am upgrading it right here, right now.</i>

11
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:38,404
<i>I think this thing could even
go as high as a "Don't Buy."</i>

12
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:41,874
Don't buy! Huh?
Mom, did you see that?

13
00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:44,514
<i>Don't buy Bluth!</i>

14
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:47,074
<i>You build a house that's good,
people are gonna wanna come...</i>

15
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,815
This sinkhole spread
a little bit more last night?

16
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,721
Anyway, I'm gonna go to the prison.
I'm gonna tell Dad about this news.

17
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:58,360
I thought you said we
shouldn't visit him.

18
00:00:58,373 --> 00:00:59,919
Visit, no. Gloat, yes.

19
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:03,054
I've worked very very hard for this. I
sold the cabin property to keep us afloat.

20
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:05,827
I haven't had any time
to spend with my son.

21
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:10,428
<i>Now you can spend time with my son. I want
your brother Buster to come live with you.</i>

22
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:14,236
And it's not because he has
that horrible hook for a hand now.

23
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:16,537
It's the snoring.
Listen to this.

24
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:18,909
<i>Buster's snoring. Wednesday night.</i>

25
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:22,074
<i>It's driving me cra...</i>

26
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:24,152
You won't even know he's here.

27
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,516
You seem more villainous than usual, Mom.
Are you sober?

28
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:29,454
- Michael, it's 8:00 a.m.
- So, it's not that.

29
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,753
I don't know.

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,091
Maybe it's because I went off
my postpartum medication.

31
00:01:35,197 --> 00:01:37,961
You were still taking that?
You had Buster 32 years ago.

32
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,261
And that's how long
I've been depressed about him.

33
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:42,825
Actually, I did go off
it in the early '90s,

34
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:45,305
but I didn't like
what happened to me.

35
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:47,193
<i>Claiming she could take
it no more, the young</i>

36
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,002
<i>mother released the
emergency brake...</i>

37
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:52,945
<i>allowing her car to roll backwards
into the nearby lake.</i>

38
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:55,039
Good for her.

39
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,710
I must have gained three pounds.

40
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,788
Why did you go off them
this time?

41
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:04,256
Well, apparently, mood-altering medication
leads to street drugs.

42
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,022
That's what this very handsome
young doctor said on the Today Show.

43
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,065
That was Tom Cruise,
the actor.

44
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,135
They said he was
some kind of scientist.

45
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:16,363
Maybe you should get away
from Buster.

46
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,393
Why don't you go up to
the cabin in the woods.

47
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:20,339
I thought you said we sold it.

48
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:23,242
We sold the property. I worked it out
so we could relocate the cabin...

49
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:26,075
but it is gonna be up in Tahoe
for another couple of days.

50
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,945
Maybe you can
take a date up there.

51
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,510
How am I supposed to find someone
willing to go into that musty old claptrap?

52
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:40,394
The cabin. Yes.
That would be difficult too.

53
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:46,658
<i>Please get back on the meds, Mom.
We miss the old old you.</i>

54
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,534
I didn't even know
that we had a cabin.

55
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,769
Ah!@%$. Well, for what it's worth,
I've never actually been there.

56
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,776
<i>Although he'd often been promised.</i>

57
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,869
<i>Hey, pal. Something's come up.</i>

58
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,246
<i>This nice young lady has lost her puppy
and your dad's got to help her find him.</i>

59
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:06,843
<i>Oh, bad news, buddy.
This young lady's dad is sick...</i>

60
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:09,253
<i>and I'm taking her
to the hospital.</i>

61
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,554
<i>Come on. You're old enough
to figure this out. I'm nailing this broad.</i>

62
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:15,630
Pardon me if I don't
burst into tears, Michael...

63
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,426
but at least
he promised to take you.

64
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,434
He just let me blindly
enjoy my childhood.

65
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:24,403
I didn't even know there was a cabin
he wasn't taking me to.

66
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:26,906
Mmm. Mine's sadder.

67
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,101
I don't see you crying, robot!

68
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,304
You taste these tears.
Taste my sad.

69
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:34,382
No. Not gonna
lick your eye, okay.

70
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,246
Well, I will tell you this, Michael.
I don't have a son.

71
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:39,252
<i>- He does.
- But if I ever do...</i>

72
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:41,254
I'm either gonna take him
to the cabin in the woods...

73
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,381
or I'm gonna promise to take him
and then not take him.

74
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,426
But the one thing
that I will never do...

75
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:51,090
is not tell him that I'm taking him to a
cabin in the woods, and then not take him.

76
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,099
<i>Gob was growing up.</i>

77
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:56,398
Well, the cabin in the woods is gonna
be stacked up next to our carport.

78
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:59,871
But maybe we should head up
there tonight, huh?

79
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:03,411
One... first time.

80
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,139
- Taste the happy, Michael.
- Oh, no.

81
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:08,341
- Taste it.
- Tastes kind of like sad.

82
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,114
<i>Michael set off to prison to tell off
his father when he discovered his son.</i>

83
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:15,416
- George Michael?
- Dad, hey.

84
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,161
What are you doing?

85
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,822
I didn't wanna miss you because
you've been leaving so early lately.

86
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,690
You slept out here
to see me?

87
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:24,424
<i>Michael had never been
so touched by something his son had said.</i>

88
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:29,526
<i>But it wasn't true. He was hiding
from his cousin after an awkward incident.</i>

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,874
<i>They'd since been trying
to avoid each other...</i>

90
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:37,604
<i>which was difficult,
considering they shared a bunk bed.</i>

91
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,648
<i>- Oh, hi.
- Hi.</i>

92
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:46,278
- I'm off to the car.
- I'll be in the crawl space.

93
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:48,242
How would you like to
head up to the cabin?

94
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,119
Can you afford to skip work?

95
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:53,786
I think the president of a "Don't Buy"
company can afford to take a day off.

96
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,295
We're up from "Sell"?

97
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:58,662
- It's happening, isn't it?
- It's really happening.

98
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,826
It's time for us to start
creating some memories.

99
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:03,301
There's been enough disappointment
in this family.

100
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:10,742
There's only one sleeping bag, so we're
gonna have to double up. Pigs in a blanket!

101
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:14,508
Sorry, pal.
Something came up.

102
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:17,884
It is worse to know.

103
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:20,386
<i>Gob was getting life lessons
all over the place.</i>

104
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:23,685
<i>And Michael broke a two-month silence
and went to visit his father.</i>

105
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:26,124
You came!
Someone came!

106
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:28,729
Only to tell you that
the company is back on

107
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:31,255
track and it's because
you're behind bars.

108
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,220
And now I get to do with my son
what you never did with me.

109
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,097
I'm taking him to the cabin.

110
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:37,433
Scar!
And every night...

111
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:40,531
I'm scarred too, but my son
is not going to be.

112
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:44,874
And they cover it with soap,
and you're supposed to thank them.

113
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,947
Like they're doing you a favor!

114
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:48,800
Anything you'd like for me
to pass on to the family?

115
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:50,575
I'm your uncle!

116
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:54,621
I'm your dad's twin brother!

117
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:57,920
I'm Oscar!
He switched on me.

118
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:00,187
No one believes me.

119
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:04,322
<i>Unfortunately for Oscar, "you've got the
wrong twin" was a very popular alibi.</i>

120
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,332
You've simply got
the wrong twin.

121
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:08,732
We're quadruplets.
You've got the wrong two.

122
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:11,931
- We're Larry and Dave.
- You want Curtis and Jeff.

123
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,907
I even started a Web site...
imoscar.com.

124
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,739
I'm innocent, Michael.

125
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:20,940
I'm Oscar!
Dot com!

126
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,744
Don't buy it.
I'm taking my son to the cabin...

127
00:06:24,853 --> 00:06:29,722
and there's nothing you can say to make
me believe that you are not my father.

128
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:32,224
I understand.

129
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,989
Your child comes first.

130
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:39,232
- Oh, my God. You're Oscar.
- Dot com.

131
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,676
<i>So Michael returned
to the office to try and free his uncle.</i>

132
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:51,644
Don't buy! Don't buy!
Don't buy!

133
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,943
<i>When he realized how much that freedom
would cost his employees.</i>

134
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:58,280
Don't buy! We did it, Mikey.
We're super rich again.

135
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,911
And I'm gonna buy a car.
The Volvo.

136
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:02,506
<i>Lindsay, you're not gonna
start spending money.</i>

137
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,014
<i>And this is not a Vol-vo.</i>

138
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,045
- That's from sitting on the copier.
- Lindsay...

139
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:10,188
Michael, I've got nothing. My husband
dumped me and ran off to Vegas with Kitty.

140
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:13,324
- That bleached blonde whore.
- He's definitely got a type.

141
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:15,335
I can't believe he left me.

142
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:18,099
I mean, this and these and this!

143
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:20,606
- That's the car.
- Oh.

144
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,438
- This.
- Glad I didn't spring for color.

145
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:25,809
The only reason you want Tobias
is because you can't have him.

146
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:28,712
And the second that you can have something,
all of a sudden you don't want it.

147
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:32,150
- That's not who I am, Michael.
- No? All right, maybe you're right.

148
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:36,280
- Maybe we should get you this car.
- I don't know. It's so boxy.

149
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:41,728
- Gob.
- Oh, Michael.

150
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,798
- How's Dad?
- Uh, I don't know.

151
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:48,130
It's Oscar who's in prison. If I let him
out, people will know Dad is free...

152
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:51,034
and those people out there
will end up paying for it.

153
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,269
Dad hasn't, uh, tried
to contact you, has he?

154
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:59,312
Like I'd ever hear from
that son of a bitch.

155
00:07:59,414 --> 00:08:02,349
<i>Earlier that day,
Gob received a letter from a group...</i>

156
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,387
<i>that reunited abandoned sons
with their fathers, called SAD.</i>

157
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:11,255
Father-son reunion?
But Dad's still in prison.

158
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,259
<i>But now the letter made sense.</i>

159
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:17,422
<i>- That son of a bitch.
- Law offices of Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

160
00:08:17,532 --> 00:08:20,558
<i>- Hi, it's Michael Bluth for Barry.
- Barry went to Reno to see your father.</i>

161
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,402
<i>Reno? He said he's been
visiting my father in prison.</i>

162
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,160
<i>Yeah.</i>

163
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:27,764
Barry says a lot of things
he doesn't mean.

164
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:30,401
Well, I guess I'm going
to Reno to look for Dad.

165
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:33,913
Good luck, favorite son.

166
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:37,041
<i>So once again, Michael
went after the father...</i>

167
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:39,210
<i>who'd once again abandoned him,
only to find...</i>

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,847
<i>he was about to do
the same thing to his own son.</i>

169
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,016
It's not happening, is it?

170
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,855
Something came up.

171
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,933
<i>Michael had just told his son
they wouldn't be going to the cabin.</i>

172
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:57,029
But the cabin's in Lake Tahoe.
That's right near Reno, and we could...

173
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,109
But this is gonna be like an adult trip.
Aunt Lindsay will be here.

174
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:03,235
Hi. Hey, why don't you pop a tent
in front with your cousin Maeby?

175
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:06,747
- What? No!
- I'm not really the outdoorsy type.

176
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:11,718
Well, then this is a good chance
for you to rub off on her.

177
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:15,882
<i>As Michael set out to find his father...</i>

178
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:17,926
<i>Gob thought he was doing
the same.</i>

179
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:20,432
Hey, buddy, come on.

180
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:24,132
Gettin' 'em to track down
your dad too?

181
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:27,468
- My dad actually had them track me down.
- Oh.

182
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:32,477
But... it does look like
he's not gonna show.

183
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,015
<i>Kind of feel like that kid
who found the severed hand.</i>

184
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:40,246
Hey, Dad, look what I found.

185
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:44,050
Anything for his father's approval.

186
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:47,615
- Heartbreaking.
- You look familiar.

187
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,594
I think that's because
we actually kind of look alike.

188
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:53,165
<i>Remember when I said Gob had a son?</i>

189
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:55,598
<i>- I'm Gob.
- I wasn't just saying that.</i>

190
00:09:55,702 --> 00:09:59,001
<i>In high school, Gob became
intimate with these girls.</i>

191
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:02,633
<i>These girls got pregnant.
This one had a baby.</i>

192
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:05,043
<i>And that baby would grow up to be...</i>

193
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:07,345
Steve Holt.

194
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:10,644
All I ever wanted was to spend
a little time with my dad.

195
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,844
Maybe go camping.
But I guess that will never happen.

196
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:16,718
I know this is gonna sound
kind of crazy...

197
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:19,621
but my family has a cabin
in the woods for one more night.

198
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:22,695
Maybe we could go up to Reno,
get the keys and go camping.

199
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:26,664
You know, sort of...
a son-and-son thing.

200
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:29,257
<i>If Steve had had a father,
he would've warned him...</i>

201
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:32,497
<i>not to go into the woods
with strange men, but he didn't.</i>

202
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:35,541
- Sure! Let's go!
- Okay. Great.

203
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:37,542
- This is me right here.
- Okay.

204
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:39,236
- Yeah, baby!
- Emo!

205
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:41,974
<i>Michael, meanwhile, arrived in Reno...</i>

206
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:45,210
<i>a city competing
with Las Vegas's successful...</i>

207
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:48,549
<i>"What Happens in Vegas
Stays in Vegas" campaign...</i>

208
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,850
<i>and set about searching
for Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

209
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:55,553
I'm looking for a man who's probably
in the seedy underbelly of Reno.

210
00:10:55,662 --> 00:11:01,225
Oh, the Christian League had the Seedy
Underbelly shut down. Now it's a Swallows.

211
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:04,326
<i>Swallows was a family-style
restaurant by day...</i>

212
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:07,600
<i>and an anything-goes,
pansexual bazaar by night.</i>

213
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:11,143
<i>Can I interest you in
a smoothie or an amyl... Michael!</i>

214
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:15,544
Tobias, I thought that you were in Vegas
with Kitty and the Blue Man Group?

215
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:18,311
No, as it turns out,
the part that I'd...

216
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:21,080
destroyed my life to get
had already been cast.

217
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:26,125
<i>The role was filled by George Sr.,
who used it to hide in plain sight.</i>

218
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,217
<i>That is until he choked
on a marshmallow...</i>

219
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:31,422
<i>and almost died when
no one noticed he turned blue.</i>

220
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:35,934
So, Kitty suggested we come
up here to try out in Reno, and...

221
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,095
Uh, I'll be honest, Michael...

222
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:42,767
leaving Lindsay was the biggest
little mistake I've ever made.

223
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:45,936
I can't seem to call her though.
Damn this pride of mine!

224
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,879
Tuna melt's up, and you need
to flip the cushions in the grind room.

225
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:51,189
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Great. Now I'm gonna

226
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:53,419
be smelling to high
heaven like a tuna melt.

227
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,488
What would you say if I
told you that Lindsay

228
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:57,479
might be willing to get
back together with you?

229
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,889
Oh, uh, I'll call her right now.

230
00:11:59,993 --> 00:12:02,012
Why don't you let me handle it?
You know Lindsay.

231
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:04,054
She only wants what
she can't have.

232
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:08,191
- What would you do about Kitty?
- I can't lie to you, Michael.

233
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,826
Kitty left me two days ago.

234
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:12,541
There's a blue handprint on
the back of your head, Kitty.

235
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:14,168
Are you seeing someone else?

236
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:18,074
Face it, Tobias.
It's over!

237
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:20,772
- Say good-bye to these!
- Those are blue too!

238
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,745
There were blue handprints on them?

239
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:25,579
Yes. And I swear to you,
they weren't...

240
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:28,176
Yours. No, I know.
It all points to Dad.

241
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:31,348
Dad's in Reno, Kitty's in Reno.
Dad's in Kitty, and he must be a Blue Man.

242
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,394
- I'm gonna go check out the theater.
- Okay, I'll meet you there.

243
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:39,124
I just have to break down the salad bar
and set up the leather pony.

244
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:41,001
What's a leather pony?

245
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:42,793
I don't know. We don't
have that at lunch.

246
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:47,032
<i>So Michael called Lindsay
to say he'd found her husband.</i>

247
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,541
- All right, I'm on my way.
- No, no. I'll just bring him back with me.

248
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:54,546
- He wants to come home?
- I mean, against his will.

249
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,173
Knock him out if you have to.
He's my husband!

250
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,844
Just watch the kids
like you promised, okay?

251
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:02,444
- I'm not...
- Neither am I!

252
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:04,455
Hold it.

253
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:08,357
<i>And the kids found themselves
closer than ever on the bumpy road to Reno.</i>

254
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:10,486
<i>Hello?</i>

255
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:15,000
Lindsay, hey, hi. Michael said not to
call you, but I missed you so much.

256
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:17,001
You miss me?

257
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:19,537
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

258
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,507
I was driving out there, but this is crazy.
We have to be realistic.

259
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,578
But the thing is,
I can't leave Kitty.

260
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,739
What, with all the sexual intercourse
and whatnot.

261
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:31,043
- You bastard!
- What are you doing?

262
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,585
- Nothing!
- I will be backstage...

263
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,814
after the Blue Man show
whether Kitty likes it or not.

264
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:37,822
Sounds good.
One quick question.

265
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:42,725
What if Kitty's not there and I'm less of a
Blue Man and more of a cocktail waitress?

266
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:45,320
- She's turning again.
- Hang up!

267
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:46,922
<i>I'll see you there. Thank you. Bye.</i>

268
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:49,831
<i>Michael was already
at the theater looking for George Sr...</i>

269
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:52,666
<i>when he ran into Barry
doing the same thing.</i>

270
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:56,333
- Hey! Barry.
- Hi, Mikey. So, how much do you know?

271
00:13:56,443 --> 00:13:59,537
I know that Oscar is in prison,
and that my father is a Blue Man...

272
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:01,250
and that you are clearly
in cahoots with him.

273
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:02,877
Ooh, a lot.

274
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:04,882
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

275
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:07,077
I was gonna meet him here,
but he must've seen you and run off.

276
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:11,180
I was gonna give him this...
$250,000 and a passport.

277
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,692
- Just a passport.
- Well, I was up for so long.

278
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:18,594
- Barry, you're fired.
- What?

279
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:20,962
- Yeah.
- Just like that?

280
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,262
No warning?
You're my only client.

281
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,861
What am I supposed to do now,
turn tricks on the street?

282
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:28,052
How much do you think I can get
for that, by the way?

283
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:30,702
- I've got to let Oscar out of prison.
- What about making out?

284
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,439
Fifty dollars, or is that just LA?
Am I just...

285
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:42,053
<i>Soon, Lindsay arrived at the hotel...</i>

286
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:44,555
<i>and the kids finally faced facts.</i>

287
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:48,650
Look, it was just a half kiss. Maybe that's
the reason why we're acting weird.

288
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,822
It was because we didn't finish the kiss?
Is that what you w...

289
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,359
Yeah. Do you think we should
just finish the kiss?

290
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:54,811
Get it out of the way.

291
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:57,098
Let's get it out of the way.

292
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:01,264
Hey, kids, bring the bags.
We're sharing a room.

293
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:02,909
Let's meet back here
tomorrow morning, okay?

294
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:04,468
Yeah.

295
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:08,069
- Go.
- Are you... Yeah, I'm gonna...

296
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:12,481
I'm gonna stay out here
and watch that famous Reno sunset.

297
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:16,751
Isn't it behind you?

298
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:20,451
There's... Yeah, but there's mirrors.
It'll actually look closer.

299
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,619
<i>While George Michael
waited for the sunset...</i>

300
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,822
<i>another set of sons arrived.</i>

301
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:29,129
Michael said he'd meet me here.
I'll get the keys to the cabin, son.

302
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:34,104
I'll go buy some fishing stuff, son.

303
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:36,767
- So, where did you get this kid?
- I guess I can tell you now.

304
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:40,368
We were both waiting for our dads at that
garden where the little boy found the arm.

305
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,110
Kid's amazing, though. It's almost like...
I wish he could be my dad.

306
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:48,585
Okay, um, your dad's not trying
to find you, your son is.

307
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:52,556
That kid's your son.
You're the dad, hmm?

308
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:00,127
I've made a huge tiny mistake.

309
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,896
Gob. You can't just leave your son
in the middle of a parking lot in Reno.

310
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:07,700
<i>And that's when Michael
saw his own son in a parking lot in Reno.</i>

311
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:11,334
He drove all the way up here
to be with me. Wow.

312
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:14,140
Well, I guess I'm, uh...
I'm no better than...

313
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,484
No, I'm better.

314
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:22,714
<i>They were an hour out of Reno
when George Michael woke up.</i>

315
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:25,757
You were out like a light, pal.
Our dreams are about to come true.

316
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,759
- Maeby?
- Definitely!

317
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,329
We are going camping.
It's finally happening.

318
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,599
It's never happening.

319
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:39,302
<i>Michael had just surprised
his sleeping son by taking him camping.</i>

320
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,807
I put this off too long,
and it's too important.

321
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,844
Your Uncle Oscar can stay
in prison one more day, right?

322
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:47,744
<i>Not according to that
day's blog on imoscar.com.</i>

323
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:50,841
This here is way more important
than me trying to find my father.

324
00:16:50,952 --> 00:16:53,853
Although, I was very close.
I almost had Pop-Pop in Reno.

325
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:56,549
Me too.

326
00:16:56,657 --> 00:17:00,252
<i>As Michael was forcibly taking
his son out to the cabin...</i>

327
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:05,196
<i>Lucille was ready to
forcibly throw hers out.</i>

328
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:17,467
Well, that was a freebie.

329
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,309
<i>Lucille didn't trust herself
to be in the house when Buster returned.</i>

330
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,943
<i>So, she headed off to the cabin
Michael said would be unoccupied.</i>

331
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:28,216
<i>Tobias, meanwhile, was looking
for a way to make his wife jealous...</i>

332
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:32,884
<i>by convincing her that he was not only
a Blue Man, but still with Kitty...</i>

333
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,030
<i>when he came across
a makeup woman who,</i>

334
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:37,090
<i>coincidentally, looked a
great deal like Kitty.</i>

335
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:42,659
If this tableau I re-create,
perhaps I can re-snare my mate.

336
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,068
<i>Gee, why wouldn't she want him back?</i>

337
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:49,132
<i>And Michael and his son arrived
at the cabin in the woods.</i>

338
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:53,678
Looks like they have
trucked off the bedrooms.

339
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,649
Maybe we'll just set up some sleeping bags
right here in the living room, huh?

340
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,744
<i>Lucille, meanwhile, heard a familiar sound.</i>

341
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:05,348
- Oh, come on!
- Mother?

342
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,258
What the hell are
you doing back there?

343
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:11,991
I decided to sleep in the car
so my snoring wouldn't bother you...

344
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,036
and I left that recording of my snoring
so you wouldn't know I'm gone.

345
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:20,198
We're halfway to the cabin.
I'm gonna drop you by this light.

346
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,748
Or I could come with you.
That might be the

347
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:25,211
exact shot in the arm
our relationship needs.

348
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:29,647
Well, at least I'll have someone
to talk to on the way up.

349
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,459
This is fun, isn't it? This is just like
when we used to live up in the attic.

350
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,531
Yeah.

351
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,160
Or... Or we could
go back to Reno.

352
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:51,238
Go back to Reno?
You don't wanna be here?

353
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,332
You've been sleeping in the stair car
just so we can spend time together.

354
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,343
That's not totally true though.

355
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,963
I'm just in the middle
of a problem right now.

356
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:00,505
Oh, yeah?

357
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:03,209
- Well, let's talk about it.
- I can't talk about it with you.

358
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:04,938
Why not?

359
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:06,582
It's about a girl, and
you're not gonna like this.

360
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,484
- Is it about Ann?
- No.

361
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:10,989
Oh. Of course I don't like it.

362
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:16,189
- I like Ann.
- No, it's just...

363
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:18,197
It's a problem without an answer.

364
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,199
Well, every problem has an answer.

365
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:24,260
You're probably just confused because
you're going through all of this alone.

366
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,603
And that's exactly why we need
to spend this time together.

367
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,506
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I know so.

368
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:33,375
So here's the plan. Tomorrow morning
we're gonna get up early.

369
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:36,814
Before we tell the cops
that Pop-Pop escaped from prison...

370
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:40,615
we're gonna go down to the lake, discuss
your girl problem, and it's gonna be fun.

371
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,485
Especially the part about the cops.
All right?

372
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:46,890
Whatever your problem is with the girl,
we're gonna figure it out.

373
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:49,224
That's what this place is for.

374
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,457
That, and cheating on Gangy.

375
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:55,263
- I'm really glad you brought me here, Dad.
- Yeah, we needed this.

376
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:58,964
And this time, I'm not gonna
let the family drag me away.

377
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:03,669
<i>The next morning, Michael rose
early to spend the day with his son...</i>

378
00:20:03,778 --> 00:20:07,305
<i>only to find himself, once again,
dragged away by his family.</i>

379
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:11,974
Dad! What the hell
are you doing?

380
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:16,318
Sorry. I can't let you let Oscar out
of prison or they'll come for me.

381
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,052
Hey, how do you like the cabin?

382
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,264
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

383
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,428
<i>Lucille arrives at the cabin.</i>

384
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:33,302
!@%$ me, there's no cabin.

385
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:38,672
- Mother?
- Oh, my God!

386
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,613
You still doing breakfast burritos?

387
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:44,304
<i>Maeby finds someone to
help her forget her cousin.</i>

388
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:45,914
<i>Being stood up.</i>

389
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,750
<i>- Yeah, me too.
- Her cousin.</i>

390
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:51,416
- Wanna make out?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

391
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,857
<i>And Lindsay catches up
with Tobias.</i>

392
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,122
Get your hands off
my husband, Kitty.

393
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:00,129
Did someone say "husband"?

394
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:03,135
I want a divorce.

395
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:06,502
And I would be thrilled to
represent either one of you.

396
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:08,871
That'll be $50.
