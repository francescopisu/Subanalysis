1
00:00:01,937 --> 00:00:03,928
<i>This is Michael Bluth.</i>

2
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:05,939
<i>Right now he's being honored
by his family.</i>

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:09,807
Three years ago I made a choice
to keep this family together.

4
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:14,007
<i>- Today, it looks like I succeeded.
- So why is this man crying?</i>

5
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:19,611
<i>Because now he'll have to stay
with these people for a long, long time.</i>

6
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:22,690
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

7
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>and the one son who had no choice
but to keep them all together.</i>

8
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:34,496
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

9
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:40,866
<i>Days earlier, Michael awoke
to find his son in his bed.</i>

10
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:44,434
- Hey, are you scared of a monster?
- Kind of.

11
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:48,744
<i>It was the monster called lust,
to which he'd recently succumbed.</i>

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,978
And there's a chance
you might not even be related to us.

13
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:54,920
<i>And although he'd only
gotten to second base...</i>

14
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:58,857
<i>he'd gone in head first,
like Pete Rose.</i>

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,860
<i>Then they both got
some distressing news.</i>

16
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:03,522
And there you are, Maeby,
coming out of your mother's third base.

17
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,498
You guys really are related.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,500
<i>- And that night...
- You're not sleeping in here now.</i>

19
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,490
You think that's a bad idea?

20
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,402
What, I mean, so we can
make out every night?

21
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,406
Does that not work
for your schedule?

22
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:16,739
I mean, I'm sure
we can control our...

23
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:19,575
- I'm gonna go sleep with my dad.
- I'm gonna get my job back.

24
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,411
You're probably just a little anxious
because your old man...

25
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:25,953
is about to start running
a successful company for a change.

26
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:27,851
So Pop-Pop is definitely
innocent, huh?

27
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:29,856
No, not by a long shot...

28
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,558
but they have dropped all the charges,
and not just the Iraq ones.

29
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:34,927
The embezzlement,
the pension robbing.

30
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,950
I don't know why they dropped them,
but they did.

31
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:40,126
<i>Let's see if we are on
Mad Money, huh?</i>

32
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:42,203
<i>And they deliver insulin right to my door.</i>

33
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:45,603
It's probably on right after this ad.
This is gonna be great for us.

34
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:48,574
It's gonna give us a chance
to spend some time together, you know?

35
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:52,909
It's, like, I don't even know what's going
on in your life. Are there any girls or...

36
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:56,142
Actually, I've been wrestling
with some pretty taboo...

37
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,048
<i>- The Bluths. I love these guys.
- Shh, here it is.</i>

38
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:01,281
<i>They beat the treason charges.
We had it as a don't buy.</i>

39
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:03,789
<i>Let's bump it up to a risky.</i>

40
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:06,827
Risky! There it is,
we're doing it, huh?

41
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:09,396
- Are you happy?
- I'm really happy.

42
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:12,261
- I wonder if we should move out of town.
- What?

43
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:15,131
I feel like we've heard this whole
out of the woods thing a lot, you know.

44
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:18,729
- And I just wouldn't mind... - What have
I always said is the most important thing?

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,332
- Family.
- I was gonna say breakfast, but...

46
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:24,435
Why don't we go over to Gangy's,
have a little of both?

47
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:27,276
Later, we can talk
all this out, huh?

48
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:31,318
I've heard that
a couple times too.

49
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,956
<i>And so the family gathered
for a celebratory</i>

50
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:36,516
<i>brunch, catered by a
local restaurant.</i>

51
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:42,257
- Hello.
- Risky! Risky! Risky!

52
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:44,298
Look at that, Buster.
You would have lost a hand anyway.

53
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:47,095
I'd like to make an announcement.

54
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:49,932
We need to finish the party
we started three years ago.

55
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:53,599
Finally name Michael CEO
of a thriving company.

56
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:00,111
We'll prove to the world that nothing
can tear apart the Bluth family.

57
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,240
In fact, I've already rented
the same boat.

58
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,978
Oh, I'm not comfortable near the ocean
since the seal attack.

59
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:07,554
- The ocean is my second biggest fear.
- Good, don't come.

60
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:10,284
I need to be rubbing elbows,
not working your fork.

61
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:12,553
- We'll find a new venue.
- Oh, and before I forget.

62
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:14,629
No magic, Gob.

63
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,560
Where is Gob?

64
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:18,565
Oh, who knows?
I don't even know where he lives.

65
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,135
- He doesn't live at Michael's?
- I've always pictured him in a lighthouse.

66
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:24,501
Doesn't matter. Mom, I'm just really
flattered that you're willing to do this.

67
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:28,372
And I was half worried that you'd all
be eager to sell your shares and cash out.

68
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,671
We can do that?

69
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:34,647
Yeah, but Stan Sitwell's always had
a wild hair to buy this business.

70
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:37,081
It's the only hair
he's got. What?

71
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:39,676
- He's an alpaca.
- He has alopecia.

72
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:41,625
Lindsay, you know, if
we did sell, it would

73
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,485
only mean like, what, two
million dollars each.

74
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:46,992
Two million! Two million!

75
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,995
That sounds like a lot more
than it actually is.

76
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:52,692
You've already spent $1,200 on eggs,
and that would be it forever.

77
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:55,770
Keep in mind, we are building something
that is not only for our kids...

78
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,065
it's also for George Michael
and Maeby's kids too.

79
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:00,698
We can't have kids.
What's the matter... What are you say...

80
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:03,403
- It's not even an option really.
- Eventually you'll want to.

81
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,173
Sure, I may want to, you know, now.
It doesn't matter.

82
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,841
Either way, I won't do
anything about it. Come on!

83
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,009
Michael's right.
And I, for one, will not go back...

84
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:14,213
to wondering whether there's going
to be enough food on the table.

85
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,517
Might wanna start worrying about the table.

86
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:20,685
It's fine for you to say, "Don't sell," but
I'm gonna be 40 in three years, you know?

87
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:23,821
You know, being twins, our birthdays
are pretty close to one another.

88
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:26,696
Yeah, but a 40-year-old woman
has as much chance of getting married...

89
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,531
as she does of getting attacked by a shark.

90
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,105
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were going to say seal.

91
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:34,266
- Or a seal.
- Oh, God!

92
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:36,065
You have nothing to worry about.
You're a beautiful woman.

93
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:37,777
Any man would be
lucky to have you.

94
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,905
<i>Michael had given this speech
many times to Lindsay.</i>

95
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:45,452
- I'm a giant fat pig.
- I don't know why you say stuff like that.

96
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,953
Girls just grow faster than boys.

97
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:50,718
Dinner's ready.
We're having Lindsay chops.

98
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:55,888
What? I want her to be prepared in case
some bully at school is as clever as I am.

99
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:57,686
<i>No bully ever would be.</i>

100
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,459
<i>Oh, let's not forget,
you're already married.</i>

101
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,900
- Hey, Mikey.
- Yes.

102
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:02,936
I think I'm gonna
cash out myself...

103
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,005
and maybe go down
to my little place in Cabo.

104
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,926
What little place in Cabo, Dad?
Did you build

105
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,819
yourself a hideout in case
you needed to escape?

106
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:12,313
- Of course not.
- I don't want you to worry, Dad.

107
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:15,042
There's gonna be plenty of money
to be made from a business run honestly.

108
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,483
Oh! Well, your mom's
not gonna allow for that.

109
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,747
She'll do whatever it takes
to get her way.

110
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:24,450
- You think the banana stand was our idea?
- It wasn't?

111
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,460
<i>It wasn't.
Although they marketed the idea better...</i>

112
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:30,190
<i>the Frozen Banana itself
was the brainchild...</i>

113
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:32,823
<i>of a Korean immigrant
who threatened to sue them.</i>

114
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:36,995
Your mother said she'd take care of it.
The guy was deported to Korea the next day.

115
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:39,198
<i>Where his business never recovered.</i>

116
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:42,140
You trying to tell me that all your crimes,
all your dishonesty...

117
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:44,609
- she was behind it all?
- She's the queen, Michael.

118
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,976
I was her king,
and now it's you.

119
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,041
She may appear
all sweet and innocent and light...

120
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,246
but she has a way
of controlling your behavior.

121
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,617
I'm concerned about you.
Because I do not want to see...

122
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,213
- He'll be fine.
- You'll be fine.

123
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,998
<i>Michael went to cancel the reservation...</i>

124
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:05,590
<i>on the party boat
Buster so feared.</i>

125
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:06,872
<i>Gob!</i>

126
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:08,067
<i>When he saw Gob on a
party boat of his own.</i>

127
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:10,071
You might wanna untie
these ropes first.

128
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:13,074
- Don't tell me how to flee, Michael.
- What are you doing here?

129
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:16,942
- I kinda live here.
- Lighthouse wasn't far off.

130
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:19,071
<i>Perhaps you can tell me
how you can afford a boat.</i>

131
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:21,514
You mean on the paltry
1,500 a week you give me?

132
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:23,414
I give you 500 a week.

133
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,399
Yeah, well, somebody's drawing
a little one on those checks. No big deal.

134
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:29,516
I was planning on using
my Bluth Company stock to pay for it.

135
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,684
Sitwell's made me
a pretty nice little offer.

136
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:34,661
- About that, Gob, you cannot sell now.
- I have to.

137
00:06:34,764 --> 00:06:37,289
Gob, you're gonna burn through this money
and have nothing, all right?

138
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,300
You give a man a fish,
he'll eat for a night.

139
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:42,064
- If you teach a man to fish...
- He'll wanna use your yacht.

140
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,867
I don't want this thing smelling like fish.
I'm burning through my future for it.

141
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,408
But you wouldn't understand that
because you're a robot.

142
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,708
Although I don't suppose you'd be willing
to have the company buy it.

143
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:54,544
<i>Well, you can't let Gob sell those shares.</i>

144
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,730
What am I supposed to do?
He won't give up the yacht.

145
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:58,811
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Keep your weight off it.

146
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:01,856
- So lease it to him through the company.
- That just doesn't feel right.

147
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,449
<i>Oh, really?
How would it feel to lose the company...</i>

148
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,052
<i>to a man who has less hair on his!@%$
than I have on my!@%$♪.</i>

149
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:10,462
It can't be worse
than hearing that just was.

150
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:12,796
I couldn't see through the glasses,
and I slid into the ladder.

151
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:15,962
<i>Give Gob the boat. We need
to show the shareholders at this party...</i>

152
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,972
<i>that the family is united.</i>

153
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:22,408
It's a very small concession
to an important cause.

154
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:25,106
<i>And so Michael sold out just a little.</i>

155
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:28,479
Fine, I will give him the yacht.

156
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:30,882
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, pal.

157
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:32,887
Well, you said we could talk later.

158
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:36,652
- Yeah. You excited about the party?
- I actually might skip that.

159
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,695
What are you talking about? This party
is essential for the stockholders to see.

160
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:43,856
I mean, we gotta show them
how close this family really is.

161
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:46,958
This was as good an opening
as George Michael was going to get.

162
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,435
- Maeby and I made out.
- Sorry?

163
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:53,407
- Me too.
- What do you mean, Son? You kissed?

164
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,171
Even a little more than that.

165
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,179
I thought she wasn't
my real cousin.

166
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,909
But then Uncle Tobias showed us
these really rough pictures...

167
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,417
that proved that she was really
Aunt Lindsay's daughter.

168
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,285
I just feel like I can't
be around her or Aunt Lindsay.

169
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,756
They were really rough pictures.

170
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:12,384
No, I remember their birth announcement
like it was yesterday.

171
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:17,530
I mean, I know it's wrong,
you know, but my feelings are real...

172
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,533
even if it was a mistake.

173
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:23,127
Well, obviously,
acting on those feelings is not an option.

174
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,571
She's a blood relative.

175
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:28,803
I know.
I've seen the blood.

176
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:32,813
- How long has this been going on?
- I don't know... 53 weeks?

177
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:35,383
I can't be around her
with these feelings anymore...

178
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:37,384
and that's why I'm not
going to this party.

179
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:40,944
<i>And so Michael
made another compromise of his values...</i>

180
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:43,144
<i>for the sake of the business.</i>

181
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:45,255
<i>Whatever happened to that Ann
we were both so crazy about?</i>

182
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,989
You know, maybe you could
bring her to the party.

183
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:51,555
Yeah, Ann is the girl for us.

184
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:55,569
<i>Michael's sister, meanwhile,
was doing some selling out of her own.</i>

185
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:59,072
I'm not going to sell my five percent,
even though you haven't made an offer.

186
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:02,736
- Which would be how much, by the way?
- Five percent?

187
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:05,609
Lucille actually gave you less
than her natural children.

188
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:09,617
I hope that's not a crack about my hair
color, lips, forehead, nose and teeth.

189
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:12,517
Because at least I'm not wearing
a rayon sweater set on my face.

190
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:16,149
It's alpaca actually. Cruelty-free.
Really narrows your choices.

191
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,218
But that's not what I meant
when I said "natural child."

192
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:23,526
Wait a minute.
You're saying I'm adopted?

193
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:26,261
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
Have I upset you?

194
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:29,998
Are you kidding me? This is the happiest
I've been since the day I got my new nose.

195
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,870
- I'm not a Bluth.
- You were almost a Sitwell.

196
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:36,206
But 37 years ago, the Bluths
adopted you out from under us.

197
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:39,179
So, we said good-bye to you,
our darling, little three-year-old.

198
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:43,480
Uh, wait, three-year-old?
You said it was 37 years ago.

199
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:46,680
Oh, yeah, right. Hey, we should
do something for your 40th next week.

200
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:49,280
<i>This part of the news
Lindsay didn't take that well.</i>

201
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:53,123
!@%$, let me!@%$♪%!@$%♪@!

202
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,129
Get your!@%$♪%!@$%♪@!

203
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,461
Be gentle, she's almost 40!

204
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:00,467
<i>Maeby, meanwhile,
had returned to Tantamount Studios...</i>

205
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:03,800
<i>where the word was
she was to be replaced...</i>

206
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:06,841
<i>when it was discovered
she was not the age she claimed to be.</i>

207
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:09,968
- Please don't fire me.
- Fire you? Are you kidding?

208
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,912
I've already gotten 10 requests
for the TV rights to your story.

209
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:15,540
You gotta get your family
to sign the release papers.

210
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:19,087
This is the biggest thing to happen
since Uniprod hired that wee-brain...

211
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,088
to run drama development.

212
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:25,951
<i>Michael had compromised his morals...</i>

213
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:28,189
<i>and was having trouble sleeping.</i>

214
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:30,663
<i>Of course, some of that
was Lindsay.</i>

215
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:34,893
- Are you drunk?
- A little. We need to talk.

216
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:37,004
Yeah, I'll say.
Are you aware that your daughter...

217
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,006
and my son
have been getting physical?

218
00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:41,008
I mean, can you imagine
anything more inappropriate?

219
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,841
- Hey, I guess you can. What are you doing?
- I'm not your sister.

220
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:47,507
- What? Hey, Lindsay.
- I'm adopted. And I'm three years older.

221
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:49,696
- There must be some mistake.
- No, Mom confirmed it.

222
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:51,810
And I know you've always
found me attractive.

223
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:54,754
You've been telling me that
for the last 40 years.

224
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:56,916
Please, Lindsay, this is crazy.

225
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:59,085
If I don't get divorced
and remarried in the next month...

226
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:01,857
I'm gonna sell those shares
and I'm gonna cash out.

227
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:05,400
<i>- So what do you say? - But even Michael
couldn't sell out that much.</i>

228
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:08,197
I'm just not that into older women.

229
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:12,873
- You bastard!
- Aah!

230
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:17,206
<i>Michael had just found out
his sister was adopted.</i>

231
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:19,714
<i>And the next morning,
he awoke to a worse surprise.</i>

232
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,717
Oh, come on!

233
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:23,912
I can't sleep
in the same room as her.

234
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:26,080
She wants out of
this marriage, fine.

235
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,648
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to sell the Bluth shares and move on.

236
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,593
- You can't do that.
- They're my shares.

237
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:36,962
No, I mean, you can't
spoon me like that.

238
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:42,232
We need a new venue for the shareholders'
party, and it cannot be a boat.

239
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,469
Now, if you can find something,
maybe I can fudge the books.

240
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:50,104
Get you a Bluth Company salary, huh?
Maybe call you an events coordinator.

241
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:53,115
Can we just lay here for a second
while I think about it?

242
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:55,845
<i>Michael was making
compromises all over the place.</i>

243
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:57,853
Sure.

244
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:02,087
- I'll do it.
- Sounds great.

245
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:05,821
<i>Soon, George Michael
went to Ann's to try to win her back.</i>

246
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,832
<i>But her Uncle Paul told him
that Ann had moved in with her boyfriend.</i>

247
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:13,768
<i>He also mentioned that we all only
had three more weeks on Earth...</i>

248
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:17,307
<i>and that fossils were just something
the Jews buried in 1924.</i>

249
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,205
<i>And so, feeling that
he couldn't go home...</i>

250
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,771
<i>George Michael decided to seek out
his own creepy uncle.</i>

251
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,962
<i>And Michael confronted his mother
about the adoption.</i>

252
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:30,010
Look, she was better off with us.
He wanted to call her Nellie.

253
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,680
Of course. Lindsay is the Nellie
from the photo.

254
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,985
Why didn't you just tell people
she was adopted?

255
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:37,856
Adopting a child we didn't want
just to stick it to a competitor?

256
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,862
Oh, that would
make us look great.

257
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:43,127
You're right, Mom. People would have
twisted that story to make you look bad.

258
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:44,996
I don't see what the big deal is.

259
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:49,732
We loved her just as much
as any of you normal kids. More than Gob.

260
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,707
The big deal, Mom,
is that the family is falling apart.

261
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,301
They're trying to sell their stock,
and I can't promise you...

262
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,642
that I can keep everyone
together until the party.

263
00:12:57,748 --> 00:13:00,239
We'll pay them off.

264
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:03,184
We'll call it
an accrued cash dividend.

265
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:06,882
But they won't get their money
until they sign a document at the party...

266
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,221
promising not to sell
for 10 years.

267
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,317
So, it's embezzlement,
bribery and conspiracy?

268
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:13,328
And a whole lot of love.

269
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,421
All right, and perjury.

270
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,601
- Oh, Michael.
- Hey. Oh!

271
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:23,230
I booked a perfect location and some
wonderful performers for the party.

272
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,240
We're having it at the Queen Mary.

273
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:28,140
Queen Mary? That's a ship.

274
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:30,839
Oh, no, no, no.
It's a chain of popular nightclubs.

275
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:32,848
Although I haven't been
to this particular location.

276
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,510
- It's on the Long Beach Harbor.
- That's the ship.

277
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,087
Don't worry about it.
They've actually welded it to the dock.

278
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:40,713
Although, perhaps
I should call the Hot Cops...

279
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:44,123
and tell them to come up
with something more nautically themed.

280
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:47,755
Hot Sailors.
Better yet, Hot Se...

281
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:52,234
- I like Hot Sailors.
- Mm, me too.

282
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:56,272
<i>George Michael was about
to come across a hot seaman of his own.</i>

283
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:57,658
Gob?

284
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,967
What are you doing here?
How'd you find me?

285
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:01,704
My dad said that you were living
down here with your girlfriend.

286
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:04,042
You know about her?

287
00:14:04,148 --> 00:14:06,207
- Who?
- Ann.

288
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:11,721
<i>- Her?
- Gob had been dating Ann...</i>

289
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:15,223
<i>since he awarded her third place
in an inner beauty pageant.</i>

290
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:21,059
<i>Since then, Ann and her friends
tried to teach Gob about the Holy Trinity.</i>

291
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:23,165
What? I thought that's what
all you guys lived for.

292
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,668
<i>While Gob debased everything
they believed in.</i>

293
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,930
What about you, you game?

294
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:30,063
It's really not that big of a deal,
George Michael. I'm 18 now.

295
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:32,108
And besides we really haven't
even done anything.

296
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,473
Practically nothing.

297
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:37,138
But what are you gonna do?
The girl obviously needs a man.

298
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:39,340
<i>And that's when George Michael became one.</i>

299
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:44,414
<i>Ann was upset.</i>

300
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:48,150
<i>As was Buster when he saw
the ship where the party was to be held.</i>

301
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:54,622
<i>And so Michael accepted
his congratulations...</i>

302
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:57,427
<i>all the while looking for his son.</i>

303
00:14:57,534 --> 00:15:00,094
<i>And Buster was approached
by his loving father.</i>

304
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:02,934
Do you think there's any chance this ship
could break away from the dock?

305
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,099
- We're on a ship?
- Ah...

306
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:07,268
<i>Maeby was trying
to get the family to sign away...</i>

307
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:09,504
<i>the TV rights to their life stories.</i>

308
00:15:09,613 --> 00:15:11,945
TV is not as good as it used to be,
huh, Uncle Buster?

309
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:14,984
But you could help me out
by signing my petition to make it better.

310
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:17,383
<i>Oh, I kind of like
Skating with Celebrities.</i>

311
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:19,979
<i>- Excuse me. - Lucille was
trying to get signatures too.</i>

312
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,058
Sign here that you won't sell.

313
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,059
Oh, I don't need to sell, Lucille...

314
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,789
because now I know that we're not related,
I'm going to marry Michael.

315
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:28,797
I always saw him
with a younger girl.

316
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,026
<i>And Gob, angry at Michael...</i>

317
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:34,366
<i>- for sending his son to the docks...
- Not related?</i>

318
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:38,271
<i>Went into a kind of
knee-jerk revenge mode.</i>

319
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,503
Why go for the best
when you can go for the rest...

320
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,339
of your life with a younger man?

321
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:50,150
Kitty likes to scratch.

322
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:54,588
Oh, God! Mom! Mom!

323
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:57,990
Take these forms
to everyone in the family...

324
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:01,064
and promise them a hundred grand
if they sign.

325
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:04,862
<i>That's how Maeby found a way
to get signatures on her release forms.</i>

326
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:07,163
Well, that was a freebie.

327
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:10,729
<i>And soon, the crowd
gathered to hear Michael.</i>

328
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:14,538
I just wanna say how much
this family really means to me.

329
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:17,136
My father has always
been there for me.

330
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:20,182
He's a great man.

331
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:23,151
My brother Gob, who I know
would never do anything...

332
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:25,187
to hurt anyone in this family.

333
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,553
<i>Except for dating his
nephew's girlfriend...</i>

334
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:30,218
<i>and hitting on his adopted sister.</i>

335
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:33,592
Buster, who faced his biggest fear
to be here today...

336
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:36,723
- Second biggest.
- And my sister, Lindsay.

337
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:41,293
Yes, she is my sister,
no matter what any piece of paper says.

338
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:43,896
Lindsay and her husband,
Tobias, you know...

339
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:47,875
deep down, they both love
each other very, very much.

340
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:52,711
Most of all, my mother,
who has always believed in me.

341
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:54,943
Three years ago
I made a choice...

342
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:02,447
I made a choice
to keep this family together...

343
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,995
<i>And that's when Michael finally cried.</i>

344
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:08,564
Today, it looks like I succeeded.

345
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,598
<i>It wasn't exactly a turn-on.</i>

346
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:20,237
Whoo!@%$♪ baby.

347
00:17:20,344 --> 00:17:22,744
Looks like George Michael
got his mom back today, huh?

348
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:24,905
Yeah, well, where is
George Michael, by the way?

349
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:27,245
He came by the yacht.
Gave me this shiner.

350
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,111
- He hit you? What for?
- You know teenagers.

351
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:31,586
Probably lashing out at you
because of who I'm dating.

352
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:33,417
- Who are you dating?
- Ann.

353
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:34,876
Her?

354
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:36,253
Don't worry. I didn't
fight back or anything.

355
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,760
I was, like, " Oh, no, take the yacht.
Please don't hurt me."

356
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,263
Just build up the
little guy's self-esteem.

357
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:41,788
The yacht?

358
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:45,026
Oh, for God's sake, Gob.
I gotta get off this ship.

359
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:46,522
Mom, George Michael took
off in Gob's yacht.

360
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:47,933
I gotta go find him.

361
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:51,269
Well, you can't go now. That's not going
to look good in front of the investors.

362
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,343
- Mom, this is important, okay?
- Michael!

363
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:56,139
This company is important.

364
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:58,214
<i>It was at that moment
that Michael realized...</i>

365
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,806
<i>how much he'd sold out.</i>

366
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:05,411
<i>Never seen a CEO cry like that before,
except at his sentencing.</i>

367
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:07,786
That's who you're putting in charge?

368
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:09,950
I've made a huge mistake.

369
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,756
Will you take the company
for 20% above market?

370
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,161
Ten, and I'll take
the company off your hands right now.

371
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,199
Fifteen and I'll throw in Nellie.

372
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:19,132
- She's 40.
- Twelve.

373
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:22,364
<i>Meanwhile, Michael searched the harbor...</i>

374
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:25,635
<i>and spotted the yacht.</i>

375
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:28,472
<i>And Gob noticed something too.</i>

376
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,846
Are those police boats?

377
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:35,417
- Oh, my God, the SEC.
- They still have boats?

378
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,386
- Prepare to be boarded.
- Did you do this?

379
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:40,143
No. But I can't help but
enjoy the irony that

380
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:41,916
you might be losing three
years of your life.

381
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:46,419
Ah, this is why they dropped
those other charges.

382
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,522
- You gave me up, George.
- George? I'm not George.

383
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:52,158
George invited me.
Oh, stupid.

384
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:55,898
Oscar, when are you going to learn
there's no such thing as free shrimp?

385
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:59,100
Well, I know it was someone
in this family.

386
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:02,667
Or someone who used to be.

387
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,576
- Annyong?
- Annyong.

388
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:07,206
- Annyong?
- Annyong. But my real name is...

389
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:09,842
- Hello.
- Hello?

390
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:12,251
- Annyong.
- What the hell did you do this for?

391
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:15,052
Because my grandfather
vowed one day...

392
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:17,956
he would get even
for banana stand you stole from him.

393
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:21,861
<i>It was true. Hello had gathered
information against Lucille...</i>

394
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:25,025
<i>- Annyong?
- To avenge his grandfather.</i>

395
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,467
Hey, Maeby ever mention
my name?

396
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:29,869
<i>But Lucille was not going peacefully.</i>

397
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:32,134
You boys know how to shovel coal?

398
00:19:32,242 --> 00:19:35,609
<i>I don't even wanna tell you
what these guys thought that meant.</i>

399
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:38,306
<i>And Michael caught up
with his son.</i>

400
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:40,542
George Michael, what are you doing?

401
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,618
- Where are you going?
- I can't stay here.

402
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,019
Ann's moved on. Maeby's my cousin.
We both know that's not an option.

403
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:50,491
Buddy, Maeby is not your cousin.

404
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:53,893
- What?
- Yeah, I found out a couple days ago.

405
00:19:53,997 --> 00:19:56,227
Aunt Lindsay was adopted.

406
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,767
Why didn't you tell me this?

407
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:01,497
Because you can't be
with Maeby. You're 15.

408
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:05,234
Inevitably, the relationship is gonna
fall apart, and then what do you do?

409
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:09,005
She might not be a blood relative,
but she is still family...

410
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:11,580
and that's a bond
that lasts forever.

411
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:14,411
You don't wanna rock that boat.

412
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:17,078
<i>- What the hell was that?
- It was his mother...</i>

413
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:19,849
<i>who moments earlier
had taken control of another queen.</i>

414
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:22,516
Full steam, boys!

415
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:25,424
This is degrading.
I thought we were gonna strip.

416
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,623
Mother!

417
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:34,697
It's moving! Oh, my God!

418
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:37,933
<i>And Buster faced his second biggest fear.</i>

419
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,041
<i>- I can't swim! I can't swim!
- And then his first.</i>

420
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,839
Oh, come on!

421
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:48,315
<i>And the two grand ladies
made their escape together.</i>

422
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:50,818
<i>Lucille Bluth, please pull over...</i>

423
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,821
<i>and step away
from the historic ship.</i>

424
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:55,391
- Gangy's trying to make a break for it.
- I guess we should go back.

425
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:57,392
Family sticks together, huh?

426
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:59,462
Yeah, on the other hand...

427
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:01,963
we do have a full tank of gas,
a house in Cabo...

428
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:03,999
and 500 grand in cashier's checks.

429
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,093
What say we give them
no choice...

430
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:13,006
but to keep themselves
all together for a while?

431
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:17,068
<i>It was Arrested Development.</i>

432
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,740
<i>On the epilogue.</i>

433
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:26,254
<i>Michael wakes up to another strange
bedfellow after his first night at sea.</i>

434
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:28,255
How was the party?

435
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:33,420
<i>And Maeby pitches her TV show to
a Hollywood icon, who says...</i>

436
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,589
No, I, uh...
I don't see it as a series.

437
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,328
Maybe a movie.
