1
00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:03,004
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

2
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:07,575
<i>Michael was preparing his sister...</i>

3
00:00:07,676 --> 00:00:10,304
<i>for her upcoming deposition
in the case against their father.</i>

4
00:00:10,412 --> 00:00:14,280
If they say, "Did you know of any
financial improprieties?” you'll..."

5
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:16,351
Unbutton my shirt a bit
and give 'em this look.

6
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:21,284
- Not really sure what you're goin' for.
- I drank a lot last night.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,029
Why were you drinking?

8
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:26,692
If I look like a man who made
love to his wife last night...

9
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:30,390
- it's because I almost did.
- That's why.

10
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:33,525
<i>But Tobias had
a low tolerance for alcohol.</i>

11
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:36,570
Oh, you look very hands...

12
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,037
So you just finished off the bottle?

13
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:41,141
I had to. It's vodka.
It goes bad once it's opened.

14
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:43,543
I think that's another
one of Mom's little fibs.

15
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:46,375
You know, like,
"I'll sacrifice anything for my children."

16
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:50,008
Speaking of Mom, she really
doesn't want me to do this deposition.

17
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:52,586
You have to, Lindsay.
Sorry. You've been subpoenaed.

18
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,552
I'm afraid I might not be able
to be deposed either.

19
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,750
I got a call out of the blue for a chance
to play a very important part...

20
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:00,794
<i>in... The Prosecution.</i>

21
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:04,127
- The prosecution called you?
- I assume it's a CBS procedural.

22
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:06,234
<i>They didn't send sides,
so I thought I'd trot out</i>

23
00:01:06,247 --> 00:01:08,259
<i>a Vagina Monologue or
something else I know.</i>

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,429
They did ask for old photos
and documents...

25
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,905
so I went and got these
out of the secret room... Oop.

26
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:14,999
"The prosecution" is not a TV show.

27
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,079
It's clearly somebody in the D.A.'s office
trying to get you to flip.

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,741
These guys will bend the law
to enforce the law.

29
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,977
Tell me that's not a CBS franchise.

30
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:26,486
I'm serious. Why else would they
want all these documents?

31
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:28,488
For set dressing, silly.

32
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,252
Those Hollywood shows
are so incredibly detailed.

33
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,712
You're gonna tell them
you're not interested.

34
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,089
We all have to be careful.

35
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,426
The prosecution's gonna be
coming after all of us.

36
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,295
- Including me?
- You don't have any secrets.

37
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:42,302
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I...

38
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:44,429
Um, hey, uh, speaking of that.

39
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,439
It's actually her birthday soon...

40
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,441
so I thought we could all
do something for her.

41
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:51,842
- Whose birthday?
- Maeby's.

42
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:56,145
I was changing the subject. We... No.
Yeah, we weren't talking about Maeby.

43
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:59,118
But she's been feeling kind of
left out of the family lately...

44
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:01,781
and I thought maybe we could
throw her a surprise party.

45
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,188
Actually, he'd already told her about it.

46
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,055
I just poured Mom into bed.

47
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:07,662
Would it kill her to
let some vodka go bad?

48
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:09,187
No. Vodka doesn't...

49
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,777
It's my birthday in a week,
and I bet you they don't even know.

50
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,893
They forget every year.
I should just move out.

51
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:17,733
But they're planning
a surprise party for you.

52
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,171
They wouldn't forget your 16th birthday.

53
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,971
Oh, my gosh.
Our little girl's turning 14.

54
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:24,949
Sixteen actually.

55
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:26,844
Well, I am off to buy
the perfect present.

56
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:30,509
<i>- Maybe she'd like a suit like this.
- That is her suit.</i>

57
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:32,587
<i>They probably don't make
it in a woman's style.</i>

58
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,578
<i>They only make
it in a woman's.</i>

59
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,748
Well, I'm off, my love.

60
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:39,326
- You see? Sometimes, shame can be fun.
- Shame?

61
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:42,089
Secrets. You... You said "shame."

62
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:44,665
He said "shame."

63
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,734
How does he know about her?

64
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,531
Didn't he just say Gob
should be ashamed of himself?

65
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:52,232
No, but give it a while. Somebody will.
What's all that for?

66
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,901
- It's for my out-of-town act.
- Out of town, Gob?

67
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,763
The prosecution is
watching every move we make.

68
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:59,538
I'm just going to Iraq.

69
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:01,616
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

70
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,776
No, you're not. Dad is up on treason
charges for building homes in Iraq.

71
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:07,013
- It's a USO tour.
- You're not going.

72
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:10,082
I'm doing my Christian magic act
my religion girlfriend helped me work out.

73
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,593
I dress up like Jesus, walk on water,
which you've seen.

74
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,889
- I'm gonna do the wine into water.
- It's water into wine.

75
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,658
Then I've just emptied out
all your wine bottles...

76
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:19,927
and filled them
with fake stuff for nothing.

77
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:22,276
Great. How am I supposed
to have sex with my husband now?

78
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:25,637
Gob. We got the depositions.
You're not goin' to Iraq.

79
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,537
You're just jealous
that I am the son...

80
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:31,237
that the father has asked
to do his work in the Holy Land.

81
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:33,200
<i>So Dad is behind this.</i>

82
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,077
<i>And he won't bump me
up to business class.</i>

83
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:39,552
<i>Later that day, Tobias met with
the prosecutor, Wayne Jarvis.</i>

84
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:44,455
A flower in my garden,
a mystery in my panties.

85
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,459
This is not an audition
for a CBS show.

86
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,463
- I was just looking for some feedback.
- It was a little contrived.

87
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,056
Now, we think we can
offer you a good deal...

88
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:56,331
if you provide evidence
that puts George Bluth behind bars.

89
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:59,896
I'll tell you what else is contrived...
the odds I would turn on my family...

90
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:02,067
for somebody who is not
only trying to hurt them...

91
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:05,146
but who wouldn't know good acting
if it marched through that door...

92
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:07,579
and gave them head shots
and decorative soaps.

93
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:10,242
<i>And as Tobias waited for the elevator...</i>

94
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:13,788
<i>he noticed an interesting flyer
promising the perfect gift...</i>

95
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:16,584
<i>for the daughter who didn't
feel part of the family.</i>

96
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,922
- He took the bait.
- He's a classic scrapbooker.

97
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:22,496
Right down to the woman's suit.

98
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:25,930
<i>Michael went to confront
his father about Gob's trip to Iraq.</i>

99
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,655
Everyone knows you built
homes for Saddam Hussein.

100
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,299
Tell me what's going on.

101
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:32,066
For the millionth time,
I was a patsy.

102
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,266
I gotta find a loophole
to get out of this...

103
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:38,813
but Buster took coma
and your mother took rehab.

104
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:40,972
Hey. You goin' to rehab again?

105
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:44,313
I'm bringing Lindsay.
I'm worried about her.

106
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,250
Did you get the corkscrew?

107
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,515
I see there's gonna be wine
at the rehab, huh?

108
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,456
Wine only turns into alcohol
if you let it sit.

109
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:54,027
How do you come up with these?

110
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,290
I'll meet with the prosecutor,
ask for a postponement.

111
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:59,299
But I'm gonna have to go on the record
about why you two aren't there.

112
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:01,335
If you make a liar out of me,
we're gonna be in big trouble.

113
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:05,497
- This constant bickering is gonna
put me in a coma. - Nice try, Dad.

114
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:08,906
<i>Buster was finding his
fake coma hard to sustain.</i>

115
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,309
It takes a lot of courage
to endure what they put you through...

116
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:15,247
especially since your mother
saw that Web site.

117
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,648
<i>Buster was not only providing
medical students...</i>

118
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,481
<i>a live body to learn on...</i>

119
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,249
That's okay. Try again.
No. That's a tendon.

120
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:25,918
He'd be screaming right now.
That's okay. Try again.

121
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:29,929
<i>He'd also served as a human canvas
for aspiring beauticians.</i>

122
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:33,592
That's okay. You put too much collagen
in there. No, no. Try it again.

123
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:37,160
<i>And a much-needed set of teeth
for a dental program...</i>

124
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:39,240
<i>Designed to encourage at-risk youth.</i>

125
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:42,572
That's okay, Turf.
No. Try again.

126
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:46,272
You've got your forearm
on this windpipe, Dog Bone.

127
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:47,933
<i>It really was amazing
for their self-esteem.</i>

128
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:49,509
<i>I did it.</i>

129
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,381
<i>Even Buster was moved.</i>

130
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:55,012
<i>But he endured it all for Adelaide.</i>

131
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:57,023
I love you, Buster.

132
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,026
What I would give to hear you say
you love me too...

133
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:03,097
even if it meant you'd been
faking this whole time.

134
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:06,395
Speak to me.
Say anything, my love.

135
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,765
Anything?

136
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,599
Faker!

137
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:14,402
I wasn't faking my love for you.
I didn't want to testify at my dad's trial.

138
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,943
- Well, you're a coward.
- No!

139
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:19,275
Adelaide, how could you
let this happen again?

140
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:22,817
I wish you'd come to,
or don't you care about me?

141
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:26,409
- Of course I care about you.
- You faker!

142
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:28,989
How could I let this
happen to me again?

143
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,082
Take a single step
to show me your love, Gary.

144
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,995
Aw! Faker!

145
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,996
<i>She was wrong on that one.</i>

146
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,066
<i>It was love
that made Gary take that step.</i>

147
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,227
Who ever said vegetables
were good for your heart?

148
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:44,999
No, no. No, please.

149
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:48,735
<i>Of course, he hadn't used
his legs in three weeks.</i>

150
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,743
<i>And Michael met with Wayne Jarvis.</i>

151
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,245
I apologize for the rest of my family
not being here.

152
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:56,579
They wanted to testify,
but they all have perfectly legal excuses.

153
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:59,619
And I can assure you
that no one is hiding.

154
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:02,781
Michael, your mother and your sister
are not in a rehab center.

155
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,756
- Where are they really?
- We don't know.

156
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,259
But we do know the two people
who checked into Shady Pines...

157
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:11,594
under the names Lucille Bluth
and Lindsay Fünke are not your relatives.

158
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,428
Also, for someone in a coma...

159
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:17,631
your brother Buster has made an impressive
15 phone calls to radio stations...

160
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,257
alternately requesting
"I Will Survive” and..."

161
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,799
What was the other one?

162
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:23,878
- "She's Out of My Life."
- "She's Out of My Life."

163
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:26,412
As for your brother Gob
in the USO...

164
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,846
- Don't tell me he's not in Iraq?
- No, he's there.

165
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,885
In fact, Michael,
he's on the news... right now.

166
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,880
Are bees better
at sniffing out drugs than dogs?

167
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:39,471
I'm sure it's coming right up.
They've been playing it all day.

168
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,155
<i>And they deliver
insulin right to my door.</i>

169
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,026
I'm sure it's right after
this series of ads.

170
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,828
It's, like, every time
you turn on the TV, it's there.

171
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:49,597
- Why don't we just go online?
- Cool your Japanese jets.

172
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:52,639
<i>- An insurgent in Iraq from
Orange County, California? - It's on.</i>

173
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,074
<i>Why he's being held in jail and why
he won't be coming home anytime soon.</i>

174
00:07:57,178 --> 00:08:01,137
And imagine the impact if that had come on
right when we turned on the TV.

175
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:09,455
<i>Michael had been called
to sign his brother out of the hospital.</i>

176
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,460
You can stop pretending to be in a coma.
We heard your requests on the way over.

177
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:15,827
I'm not faking it, Michael.
I really am this expressionless.

178
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:17,832
My love thinks I'm a coward...

179
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:21,802
just because I was using precious hospital
resources to avoid my legal obligation.

180
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:24,566
That does say coward.
We've got bigger problems.

181
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:27,006
- Gob is locked in a prison in Iraq.
- What?

182
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,136
- So he's actually in an Iraqi prison?
- No. It's US run.

183
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:32,476
- Oh.
- God knows what they're doing to him.

184
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:34,607
Mom and Lindsay
are pretending to be in rehab.

185
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:39,552
I can't get ahold of Dad, and I have
to fly to Iraq myself to get Gob.

186
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:42,351
- Do you have to go by yourself?
- Let me go with you.

187
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,224
I was trained by army.
I speak the language.

188
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,422
You speak Arabic?

189
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:50,829
- What's that mean?
- I was just clearing my throat.

190
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:53,094
But I think it actually
does mean "laundry."

191
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:55,762
Like a child's laundry.
We don't really have a word for it.

192
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:59,069
But this is exactly what I need
to prove to my love...

193
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:01,541
that I am a hero,
not a coward.

194
00:09:01,644 --> 00:09:04,084
I have my uniform here.
Mother brought it for the photo shoot.

195
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:08,180
Would you be back in time
for Maeby's surprise party?

196
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:10,684
Probably not.
We'll do something when I get back.

197
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:13,779
Why don't you drive the stair car home.
Buster and I will leave from here.

198
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,348
- Be careful.
- Hey. Who's tougher than us?

199
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:23,197
Close one.

200
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,996
<i>The depositions had been delayed...</i>

201
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:31,096
<i>but the prosecution was about to get
a Lord & Taylor bag full of evidence.</i>

202
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:33,801
We supply the glitter,
the glue, the crepe paper...

203
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,244
and the ready-made template pages
for you to decorate and fill out with...

204
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:42,716
My Favorite Birthday,
Foreign Bank Statements...

205
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:45,879
and, of course... shh...
Family Secrets.

206
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:48,718
<i>The scrapbooking sting
had helped the DA gather evidence...</i>

207
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:52,022
<i>against people as diverse
as Ken Lay...</i>

208
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:55,797
<i>Oliver North...</i>

209
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:59,892
<i>but, ironically, not Martha Stewart.</i>

210
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:02,835
So dig up whatever you can,
and remember...

211
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:05,806
photocopies are not
admissible as memories.

212
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:09,469
Sir, I'm gonna have to go to
our old family storage unit in Reseda.

213
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:12,605
No problem. We can arrange for a helicopter
to take you there right now.

214
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:16,845
Wow! This is the best free
scrapbooking class I've ever taken.

215
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:19,820
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay and Lucille
were at a spa in the desert...</i>

216
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:22,982
<i>avoiding both rehab
and their depositions.</i>

217
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:26,493
Four saunas, three steam baths,
Olympic-sized pool...

218
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:29,190
and you're telling me
there's no alcohol?

219
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:32,199
What the hell are we
supposed to do for two days?

220
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:34,633
I could take the top off this grape juice,
and maybe by morning...

221
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:39,470
- Oh, for God's sake, Lindsay! Grow up!
- You're 40 years old. - Thirty-five.

222
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:41,839
Well, maybe this will be nice. Hmm?

223
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:45,277
We can talk and...
connect a little.

224
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:51,647
- I must have a Xanax.
- I'll go score some weed from the staff.

225
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:54,314
<i>And Michael and Buster
checked out of the hospital.</i>

226
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,414
I can't believe they wouldn't
give me a wheelchair ride.

227
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:59,723
You're gonna be sitting on a plane
for 18 hours to Iraq.

228
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:01,797
Yeah, I should definitely
get one for the airport.

229
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:03,798
You're going to Iraq?

230
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,061
Yes. I'm going to save my brother.

231
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,399
So you are brave after all.

232
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:13,965
Fighting for your brother. Oh, Buster,
you're such a!@%$?.

233
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:16,476
- That means she likes you.
- It's more than "like."

234
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,877
I'd give anything
to have you stay here.

235
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:21,211
Then I will stay here.
I was scared to go anyway.

236
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:23,012
- Faker!
- Oh!

237
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:26,748
- I knew you were no good.
- Than I shall go... to forget you.

238
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:30,314
- Oh, Buster, don't go.
- I don't wanna go.

239
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:33,987
I'm gonna save everybody a lot of trouble
and say that we are going. Come on.

240
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:38,089
When I miss your lips, I'll put a fig
in my mouth and think of you.

241
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:43,569
- They have figs over there, right?
- I'll wait for you.

242
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:46,369
- What's this?
- Cab driver said he went into a coma...

243
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:48,841
as soon as they
pulled up to the hospital.

244
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:51,209
What a brave man.

245
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:53,077
<i>And soon the Bluth boys...</i>

246
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:55,844
<i>found themselves in a strange land.</i>

247
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,519
What did he say?
Where are we?

248
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:06,458
He said he was taking
surface streets to LAX.

249
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,530
The freeway's backed up all the way
to Knott's Berry Farm.

250
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:11,862
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
got ahold of Maeby's address book...</i>

251
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:15,529
<i>to invite all her friends
to her sweet 16.</i>

252
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:19,039
<i>He did, however, decide against
some guests he found threatening.</i>

253
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:21,336
I don't think Steve Holt
has to come to this.

254
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:24,208
<i>And yet he did invite Mickey Rourke.</i>

255
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:27,305
<i>And the guys finally did get to Iraq...</i>

256
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,384
<i>but Buster's Arabic
was a little rusty.</i>

257
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:34,252
<i>And instead of a cab, he hired them
the only rickshaw in Baghdad.</i>

258
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:36,450
Are you ready
for Operation Hot Brother?

259
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,459
I'm not ready to call it that.

260
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:42,122
<i>They arrived at the prison the Americans
were training Iraqis to run.</i>

261
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:44,222
No. What'd you forget?

262
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,393
Walk them through the...
The what?

263
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:50,267
- The metal detector.
- That's okay. Try again.

264
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:51,897
<i>My God! You came!</i>

265
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:54,499
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, I missed you, Michael!

266
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,068
- All right.
- Or should I say "robot"?

267
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,741
- What, 'cause I'm not crying? - Maybe you
don't have enough RAM to understand this...

268
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:04,786
but there's such a thing
as brotherly love.

269
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:06,616
What's he doing here?
I thought he was in a coma.

270
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:08,747
I was trying to prove
to this nurse that I'm brave.

271
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,126
I need to get a picture
of me with the insurgent.

272
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,418
I can send it on my phone.

273
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,757
Why were you arrested
by the Americans?

274
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:17,026
I was doing a little off-mission street
magic, trying to make a few dinars.

275
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:21,001
<i>And that is why Jesus
was often referred to as...</i>

276
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:24,937
"the king... of kings."

277
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,942
Queens. The king of queens.

278
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:31,844
Now I would like you to behold one of the
late, great Jesus's biggest illusions...

279
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:33,380
The burning bush!

280
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:35,541
Bush? Burn Bush?

281
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,312
- Burn Bush!
- Burning Bush!

282
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,115
Burn Bush!

283
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:41,052
<i>The security forces arrived to suppress...</i>

284
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:44,786
<i>what appeared to be
an anti-American demonstration.</i>

285
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,786
That's okay. Use your foot.
The thigh bruises.

286
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,999
What doesn't? Try again.

287
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:54,797
So you weren't doing
anything for Dad?

288
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:57,634
He had said, if I happened to be in the
neighborhood of Sadr City and Mamoon...

289
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,640
would I mind torching
a couple model homes?

290
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:03,303
Dad's just trying to keep information
out of the hands of the Iraqis.

291
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:04,947
I have a feeling he was
trying to keep information

292
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,561
out of the hands of
the federal marshals.

293
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,742
I'm gonna go collect my things
and say my good-byes.

294
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:11,513
- You guys check me outta here.
- You're an enemy combatant.

295
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,680
It's not gonna be that easy.
I'll talk to them...

296
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,985
but you might wanna prepare
for a long stay.

297
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:26,060
Oh, shoot. I forgot
to say good-bye to Yusef.

298
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:29,604
That was a lot easier than I expected.
Almost too easy.

299
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:31,673
Why aren't we going to the airport?

300
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:34,607
I wanna check out this house Dad asked
you to burn down, see what he's hiding.

301
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,612
I think that's it, sir.

302
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:42,115
- Buster, this guy speaks English.
- No. I swallowed a moth.

303
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:44,118
I'm sorry it took so long...

304
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,850
but the Cheney Expressway was backed up
all the way to Halliburton Drive.

305
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,256
Let's see what all the mystery's about.

306
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,850
<i>That's when Michael found someone...</i>

307
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:56,193
<i>the U.S. Government
had been able to depose.</i>

308
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:59,563
- Hello?
- Take my picture!

309
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:02,398
Take my picture!

310
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:08,868
<i>Michael was in Iraq
when he came across a familiar face.</i>

311
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:12,142
- Are you, uh...
- I am Saddam Hussein...

312
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:14,308
look-alike.

313
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,579
- Who are you?
- I'm Michael Bluth.

314
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:19,121
These are my brothers
Buster and Gob Bluth.

315
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:22,624
Bluth? Is he here to fix
the air conditioning?

316
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:27,322
- Are you both Saddam Hussein look-alikes?
- Hardly. Invite them in.

317
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:30,491
I am behaving
like an Uday look-alike.

318
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:33,001
Come on in.
Come on in, guys.

319
00:15:33,103 --> 00:15:35,594
I'd always heard that there
were Saddam Hussein look-alikes.

320
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:39,665
I'm just a little surprised to see you all
living here in... in one house...

321
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,745
that looks so similar to ours.

322
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:44,725
- Scar on that one dude's forehead's
gotta be a problem. - That's Achmed.

323
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:49,719
Never stop watching the trial.
We are all following it pretty closely.

324
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,152
They put this guy away,
you guys are out of a job, huh?

325
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:55,123
Yes. We wanted to keep the house
for just one more season.

326
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:59,662
- I have a baby on the way.
- I do a better Saddam than this guy.

327
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:02,664
- My Saddam would show his teeth.
- Yes, to chew the scenery.

328
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:05,599
<i>So Michael decided the least he could do...</i>

329
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,603
<i>was take a look
at the air conditioning.</i>

330
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,605
<i>But before he did,
he decided to see...</i>

331
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:13,666
<i>if there was a secret room
in this model home as well.</i>

332
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:17,941
<i>And that's when Michael
discovered the bombshell.</i>

333
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:19,845
Buster.

334
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,975
<i>Back at the American model home...</i>

335
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:24,850
<i>none of the invitees
had shown up for Maeby's party.</i>

336
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:28,220
- Surprise.
- That's what I figured.

337
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:31,385
So, did you send one of these
to everyone in my address book?

338
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,463
Yeah. I'm really sorry
they didn't come.

339
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:36,692
- I don't know what happened.
- I do. They found out I was 16.

340
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,735
<i>And a lot of us just didn't
want to drive down to Orange County.</i>

341
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:42,772
- What are you talking about?
- This cost me my job, George Michael.

342
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:46,104
I was a studio executive.
I made movies.

343
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,111
- Is that why you've been so stressed out
all the time? - Have I been?

344
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:52,114
You know what? I'm a kid.
I'm gonna start acting like one.

345
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:55,117
- What, you're gonna drink?
- Do you wanna join me?

346
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:57,278
I guess if you can run a studio...

347
00:16:57,388 --> 00:17:00,755
<i>But they didn't know
it was the fake wine from Gob's magic show.</i>

348
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:02,758
<i>- It's good.
- And back in Iraq.</i>

349
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,058
- What is this?
- Looks like a mid-range nuclear warhead.

350
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:10,429
It has a range capacity
of 4,000 to 5,000 nautical miles.

351
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:13,014
You've got a pretty sophisticated
knowledge of this technology.

352
00:17:13,037 --> 00:17:15,528
My God. It makes me wanna
have an ice cream cone.

353
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:18,574
- Doesn't this make you wanna
have an ice cream cone? - It does.

354
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:21,405
You'll have plenty of time
for ice cream in prison.

355
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:23,503
Ice cream sandwiches.

356
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:26,014
- CIA, undercover.
- CIA. Of course.

357
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:28,846
This explains why it was so easy
to get you out of prison.

358
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:30,920
I knew that, if he got out,
he would lead us...

359
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:32,989
right to whatever
your dad was hidin'.

360
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,082
<i>They'd even
created opportunities for this to happen.</i>

361
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:38,661
- Get in the cell, stupid.
- You're... You're...

362
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:42,926
You're the one who didn't
even shut the door. Come on!

363
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:45,593
Yeah. You guys can run
this place without us.

364
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:50,503
As... As soon as you stop
dropping your keys! Come on!

365
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:53,701
<i>They'd even staged something
called an "honor marathon"...</i>

366
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,614
<i>they thought he was sure
to take advantage of.</i>

367
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:57,440
<i>Come on.</i>

368
00:17:57,548 --> 00:17:59,982
<i>We've been lookin' for WMD's for years.</i>

369
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:04,121
WMD's? This thing is as fake
as Achmed's mustache. See?

370
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:06,317
Yeah, look. It's a HomeFill.

371
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:09,519
It's the company that makes the fake stuff
we fill the model homes with.

372
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:12,324
- What the hell?
- What is that, a recording device?

373
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:15,127
This is our stuff.
I gotta call this in.

374
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,167
Buster? Please?

375
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:18,964
Baker.

376
00:18:19,071 --> 00:18:22,165
It doesn't sound like CIA East.
I'll check with CIA West.

377
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:24,572
Did we bug a house in Mamoon?

378
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:27,745
Yeah. We got some guy
named George Bluth...

379
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:30,041
to build houses there
so we could wire them.

380
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,211
Oh, look. I'm Uncle Buster.

381
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,310
I'm sorry no one
from the family came.

382
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:38,719
Sometimes I wish I wasn't
even part of the family.

383
00:18:38,824 --> 00:18:40,018
- No, don't...
- Yes.

384
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,492
I've never wanted
to say this, but...

385
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:45,586
you might not even
be related to us.

386
00:18:45,697 --> 00:18:47,824
- No?
- 'Cause Gangy once said to me...

387
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:50,731
your mom might not have
ever even been pregnant with you.

388
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:53,304
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

389
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:55,532
No. I'm, uh... I wouldn't.

390
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:58,075
Everyone still loves you.

391
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:01,270
Some more than others.

392
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,110
<i>And perhaps it was the fake wine...</i>

393
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:07,344
<i>but that was the night George Michael
and Maeby went to second base.</i>

394
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:12,513
<i>So my dad was a patsy?</i>

395
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:15,752
We call them "unintentional
operations victims," but yes.

396
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,694
We ran the whole operation
through a British building company.

397
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:20,355
They contacted my dad
for the plans.

398
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:22,695
I can't believe it.
After all of that, he wasn't lying.

399
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:26,737
Look, we feel terrible.
Because this is really our mistake.

400
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:29,739
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to take you guys out.

401
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:31,968
- Take us out?
- What?

402
00:19:32,077 --> 00:19:33,567
I could really go
for some Italian.

403
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,374
There is an Olive Garden
in Mamoon.

404
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,244
I think he means
to shoot you in the head.

405
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,148
But please, at least let him
look at the air conditioning.

406
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:44,017
If you're worried about us talking,
we will not say a word.

407
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:47,455
Don't be mad, but I have been sending the
pictures from my cell phone to my friend.

408
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,550
- Not now, Buster.
- He does not know what he's saying.

409
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:52,289
- You have?
- Uh...

410
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:55,958
<i>Well, who knows
who she sent them to?</i>

411
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,899
- Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
- Hmm?

412
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:06,410
- Looks like you are a hero, Buster.
- We both are.

413
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:09,002
- Well...
- Okay. Looks like you got us.

414
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:11,275
What can the US government
do for you?

415
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:15,683
We're gonna need some business class
tickets home... and direct flights.

416
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:18,585
None of this
stopping in Phoenix!@%$-!@%$.

417
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,681
And more importantly,
maybe we can drop...

418
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,760
some of these treason charges
against my father.

419
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:26,820
And I do believe there was
some mention of some ice cream.

420
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:30,493
<i>And so, with Operation
Hot Brother a success...</i>

421
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:33,196
<i>our American heroes left Iraq.</i>

422
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:36,433
Take Condoleezza Rice Lane. It's quicker.

423
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,271
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

424
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:42,005
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

425
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:46,210
<i>Tobias gives his daughter the gift
he'd stayed up all night making.</i>

426
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:48,809
And here's a picture
of your mother pregnant.

427
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,787
And here's a whole series
of your head starting to crown.

428
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,291
Look at you...
so full of wonder and shock.

429
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:57,918
You still do it.
And so does he!

430
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:01,226
Boy, you guys really are related.

431
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,893
<i>And Michael and Gob
make an interesting discovery.</i>

432
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:06,527
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy.

433
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:09,106
The real Saddam
has a scar on his head.

434
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:12,301
- I'm no scar. I'm no scar.
- Oh, my God.

435
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,037
Dot com.
