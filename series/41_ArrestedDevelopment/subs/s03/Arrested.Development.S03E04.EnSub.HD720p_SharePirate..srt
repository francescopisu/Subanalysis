1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:03,401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:14,843
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:21,019
<i>Michael was heading to work when he saw
something he had never seen before lunch...</i>

6
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:23,023
<i>his twin sister Lindsay.</i>

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,117
- You're up?
- Yeah. I work for our attorney now.

8
00:00:26,228 --> 00:00:29,527
Bob Loblaw. Of course.
What is he thinking?

9
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:31,690
- I mean, how's it going?
- Lousy.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,065
You know, I only took this nanny job
so he'd give me a free divorce...

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,468
and then marry me so
I'd never have to work again.

12
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:39,904
But all he seems to care about
is that daughter of his.

13
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,101
I got my horse to canter today.
First time.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,474
I've always wanted
to make love on a horse.

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,479
And tomorrow, we're gonna
work without a lunge line.

16
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:49,812
That's so funny, because
I can put my leg behind my head.

17
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:52,216
I mean, come on.
I'm the nanny.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,311
Of course. Who wouldn't wanna
snog the nanny?

19
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:56,543
"Snog." Is that another
one of your new "Britishisms"?

20
00:00:56,591 --> 00:01:00,857
<i>It was. Michael had recently
fallen bum over noggin...</i>

21
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:03,226
<i>for a beautiful English woman
called Rita.</i>

22
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,231
Did I say snog again? Bloody hell.

23
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:09,429
You wanna win over Bob, you gotta
win over the kid. Here's what you do.

24
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:12,098
You find something that you're
good at and you share it with her.

25
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:15,335
While you're at it, share it with us too,
huh? And try not to act so desperate.

26
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:17,344
Oh, my God.
Did I miss a call?

27
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:19,437
This is Rita.
Just wanted to say hi.

28
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:22,073
I'm on my way to the train station.
Bye-bye.

29
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:24,175
She's leaving.
I gotta get over there.

30
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:28,655
<i>- Michael raced to the station...
- God, is that how I look?</i>

31
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:30,952
<i>Where Rita was being given her ticket.</i>

32
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:35,257
Here's your ticket and your instructions.
Call me if you get in over your head.

33
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,824
Hey, hi there, Rita.
Hey! Michael.

34
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:43,132
Hi. Where are you going,
and how long you going for?

35
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,430
You're right. You-You...
Do not answer that.

36
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,032
- You know, I'm not getting clingy.
- Why are you breathing like that?

37
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:51,044
I wasn't hurrying to come stop you.

38
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:53,944
I was out on... for my daily, uh...
Do you run at all?

39
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,813
Oh, yes.
I was in the Olympics once.

40
00:01:56,918 --> 00:02:02,049
<i>- I won a silver medal.
- You're that Rita Leeds? Oh, my goodness!</i>

41
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:04,785
And a silver medal, yes.
And you came in second.

42
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:07,760
Now I'm very embarrassed
to be out of breath in front of you.

43
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:11,299
But you take my breath away.

44
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,493
Oh, Michael.

45
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:16,230
You're such a!@%$?.

46
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:20,273
<i>Michael was stunned.</i>

47
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,833
<i>He assumed Rita was using the word
!@%$? in the American sense...</i>

48
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:26,106
<i>meaning "weak" or "cowardly."</i>

49
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:28,648
<i>In fact, Rita meant it
in the British sense...</i>

50
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,548
<i>meaning "sweet‚Äù or "gentle,"
as in "pussycat."</i>

51
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:34,781
The Jerries aren't so bad.
They're just being led by a rotten apple.

52
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,827
Oh, Reggie. Fighting for your country,
you're such a pussy.

53
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:44,558
When I miss your lips, I'll put a
@%$ in my mouth and think of you.

54
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,157
<i>That also had
a different meaning over there.</i>

55
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,998
<i>Michael returned home...</i>

56
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:53,904
<i>hoping to take solace
in his son's company.</i>

57
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,409
I was thinking you and I should
maybe go play a little catch.

58
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,674
Maybe go for a run.
Do some guy stuff.

59
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,716
- But we're not good at that stuff.
- Yes, I am. We... both are.

60
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:05,047
<i>Michael and his son had never been...</i>

61
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:07,678
<i>a very successful athletic team.</i>

62
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:10,349
<i>In fact, the only thing
George Michael really liked...</i>

63
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,256
<i>was hanging motionless
from the monkey bars...</i>

64
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,852
<i>which the president's counsel
on fitness ranks as...</i>

65
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:18,228
<i>"slightly easier than the slide."</i>

66
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,962
Anyway, I was just thinking that
maybe we should emphasize athletics...

67
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,470
a little bit more in this family.

68
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:26,700
I'm gonna start us off
with a protein drink, okay?

69
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:29,709
Still doing that, huh?

70
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:33,269
Well, I-I do think we should go
for a run, huh? Some real guy stuff.

71
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,474
I'm supposed to go fabric shopping
with Ann today.

72
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:38,712
I think we can go butcher.

73
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,788
Uh, uh, no.
We're-We're making a gown.

74
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,824
- She's gonna be in a beauty pageant.
- Yeah. Who's Ann?

75
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:48,885
My-My girlfriend. She's... You've met her
so many times. You've met her and met her.

76
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:51,898
I know who Annabelle is. Who's
the Ann that's in the beauty pageant?

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,661
That's her. Her name isn't Annabelle.
That's Ann.

78
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:56,032
No, I know that her name
is not Annabelle. I just...

79
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:59,231
That's how I remember her name,
'cause her body's kind of shaped like a...

80
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:03,004
She's the belle of the ball.
What is she doin' in the beauty pageant?

81
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:05,409
She's... Is she running
the lights or something?

82
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,913
She's in it.
She's a-a contestant.

83
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:11,076
- Sort of like an inner beauty pageant.
- Ah! There it is.

84
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:14,121
- Is it like a Christian thing?
- Well, it's half.

85
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:17,453
It's at the state fair, which this year's
gonna be a church and state fair.

86
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,153
<i>It seems the state had run out of money...</i>

87
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,628
<i>and was going to cancel the fair...</i>

88
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:25,564
<i>until it was resurrected by this man...</i>

89
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,760
<i>who agreed to cover the fair's costs...</i>

90
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:29,837
<i>if it included a church presence.</i>

91
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:33,339
I got some news for you. There's
no such thing as an inner beauty pageant.

92
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,137
They're just gonna pick the chick
with the best T and A.

93
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,212
<i>As a child, Maeby had been entered...</i>

94
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:40,406
<i>into a number of progressive pageants...</i>

95
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:44,815
<i>that claimed to celebrate
beauty in all its forms.</i>

96
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,945
<i>But the winners still tended to have it
going on in the conventional sense.</i>

97
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:50,456
Remember how badly
you used to want to win?

98
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:53,026
<i>No, I remember how badly you used
to want me to win. - We should have...</i>

99
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:55,318
I don't know where that
hair of yours came from.

100
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,531
Shameless Plugs on Placentia.

101
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:01,500
Looks pretty good, huh? And they're
not licensed, which means big savings.

102
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:05,869
That's been happening a lot lately.

103
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,544
You know what? This is
the perfect thing to do.

104
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,137
No, Mom, I'm not gonna do it.

105
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:12,145
No, no, not you.
Bob's daughter Hope.

106
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:15,045
If I can get Hope this crown...

107
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,642
maybe her father might just wanna
crown me, if you know what I mean.

108
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:21,745
I'm guessing have sex,
but that's meeting you more than halfway.

109
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:26,850
Tobias, wanna clean up that mirror?
And the vase?

110
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:30,260
Perhaps if I could coach a certain
young lady to victory in this pageant...

111
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:33,232
I can gain back
the respect of my wife.

112
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,935
- I'll show them a little T and A.
- You can't make me do it, Dad.

113
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:39,337
- Tobias and Ann.
- My Ann?

114
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:42,001
No, I don't... I don't think
we need any help.

115
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,010
Oh, George Michael, she's a girl.

116
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:46,945
I need to teach her how to be a woman.
Within her lies a queen.

117
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:50,347
Let me out that queen.

118
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:52,044
I think you just did.

119
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:53,620
- Michael.
- Gob.

120
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:56,748
Let me get that for you.
Um...

121
00:05:56,858 --> 00:06:01,454
So a young neighborhood tough by the name
of Steve Holt's gonna be here any minute.

122
00:06:01,563 --> 00:06:03,690
- Your son.
- According to him.

123
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:07,894
- And a DNA test.
- I heard the jury's still out on science.

124
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:10,027
Anyway, he wants to go to the fair.

125
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:14,370
But I don't wanna hurt his feelings,
so I need you to do it.

126
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:17,240
Just tell him that I'm
out of town on one of my trips.

127
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:21,076
- I'm not gonna lie to your son.
- Come on. I lie to yours all the time.

128
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,082
Michael, I'm not ready to be a dad.

129
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:26,085
Plus, I'm gonna be very busy this week
being a judge for the pageant.

130
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:29,452
<i>Gob had been a pageant judge for years.</i>

131
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,092
You can't believe what
it does for your sex life.

132
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:32,651
I don't wanna hear it.

133
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:35,594
I don't wanna say it. First place chick
is hot but has an attitude.

134
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:39,326
Doesn't date magicians.
Second place is someone weird usually...

135
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:42,164
like a Chinese girl or a geologist.

136
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,536
But third place, although a little bit
plain, has super low self-esteem.

137
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:51,408
So I step in and, uh,
lay her crown upon my sweet head.

138
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:54,607
Have I missed this euphemism?

139
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:56,684
<i>- Steve Holt!
- I should go.</i>

140
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,987
He's hiding from me, isn't he?

141
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,650
You know, you gotta stop
saying your name all the time.

142
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,579
It's just they have this
father-son triathlon,

143
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,422
and I just wanted him
to do it with me.

144
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,327
- Mmm.
- Stupid, huh?

145
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:14,596
- That's a pretty tough race.
- Only for a wimp, a wuss.

146
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:18,103
<i>- A!@%$?.
- And Steve didn't mean pussycat.</i>

147
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:22,609
Uh, Steve, how'd you like
to do that triathlon with me?

148
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,109
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

149
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:26,772
- Uncle Mike!
- Steve Holt!

150
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:29,543
<i>Both men felt good about themselves.</i>

151
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:31,551
- Uncle Mike!
- Steve Holt!

152
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:35,180
<i>But Gob didn't share their enthusiasm.</i>

153
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,817
So this is how Michael
gets rid of my son... by stealing him.

154
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:41,293
Well, I'll just have
to steal something of his...

155
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:47,062
like, say, his bicycle,
as a... placeholder.

156
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:55,303
<i>Michael was trying to prove
his manliness with Steve Holt.</i>

157
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:58,039
Rita. Hey, it's Michael.
Just wanted to let you know...

158
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:03,312
that I'm running a triathlon at the fair,
and if you're back in town...

159
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,319
Oh, I can't believe I chose
this moment to call you.

160
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:08,413
<i>Meanwhile, at the Church and State Fair...</i>

161
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:11,755
<i>Maeby was trying to enroll
in the pageant... sort of.</i>

162
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:16,161
Your situation poses a problem.
Let me talk to our chairman.

163
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:20,095
- Hey, what are you doing, Maeby?
- It's Surely.

164
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:23,730
I'm just here to prove that
all these pageants care about is looks.

165
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,832
Just watch. Surely's inner beauty
will get trumped by her outer icky.

166
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:29,343
- What happened to your nose?
- It's part of the disguise.

167
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,778
<i>Isn't it cool? The same one
Nicole Kidman wore in The Hours.</i>

168
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:34,719
<i>It had been purchased
for her at a charity</i>

169
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,579
<i>auction she'd attended
as a studio executive...</i>

170
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,677
<i>- $10,000.
- By Jamie Kennedy.</i>

171
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,688
You're such a dear.

172
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,431
<i>But I'm not putting you in my remake
of A Thoroughly Polite Dustup.</i>

173
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:46,852
Miss Wolf beak...

174
00:08:46,963 --> 00:08:51,195
although it costs quite a bit
to put in a ramp for you, we got approval.

175
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,063
You're in.

176
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,364
<i>As Maeby found herself
stuck in a beauty pageant...</i>

177
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:59,032
<i>Lucille was meeting
with attorney Bob Loblaw...</i>

178
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:01,576
<i>about getting her son
out of the army.</i>

179
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:04,373
I mean, my God. He's already lost a hand.
If he loses a leg...

180
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,471
how will we ever
get him out of the apartment?

181
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:09,608
"Well, the army does have
a ‚Äúone in, one out" program...

182
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:13,621
where the inductee is relieved of duty
once he enlists someone to take his place.

183
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:16,886
So I'm supposed to find some poor,
innocent soul and hook him?

184
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:19,894
Well, that's not going to help
sign anyone. Where's your hand?

185
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,964
It got stuck in the prize hole again.

186
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:25,398
I told you not to play
that stupid game anymore.

187
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:30,666
<i>- Ow. There goes number three.
- I wasn't playing it.</i>

188
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:32,707
I was just trying
to get my other one back.

189
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,471
Hi. Sorry, sorry.
I totally forgot about this... meeting.

190
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:37,478
What's going on?

191
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,242
Your father's gotten a lot of bad press
because of the escape attempts.

192
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:42,038
Volunteer for something.

193
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:43,750
I'll do anything to get out
of this!@%$?% apartment.

194
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:47,186
You'll do anything to get out of
!@%$?% in this apartment.

195
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,451
- Ah, you're drunk.
- Yeah, Mom, can you just...

196
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,756
And, Dad... You know,
why do we even need the surrogate?

197
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:55,592
- Dad's in the apartment...
- Don't come in here. Don't come in here.

198
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:57,962
Don't come in here.
I said not to come in.

199
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,669
<i>- Would you get out here please?
- I'm watching the game. - I said not to come in!</i>

200
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,605
- I did not spend money on a surrogate so you can just...
- I lost him.

201
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,006
I think you've got your hands full
trying to make this guy look good.

202
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:10,705
There's a "Startled Straight"
program at the fair...

203
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:13,475
which involves you speaking
with at-risk male youth...

204
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,744
to scare them away
from criminal behavior.

205
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:19,618
Okay. I can do that. I'm gonna need
some big, blown-up photos of your mother.

206
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:22,657
I think they're talking about
your time in prison, Dad.

207
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,726
Oh. Okay.
Why not?

208
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:27,455
I mean, uh, if I don't win this thing,
I'm gonna be back there anyway.

209
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:31,090
"At risk male youth."
That spells "army."

210
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,998
<i>And that's when Buster
discovered a recruiting pool...</i>

211
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:36,230
<i>the government had been
fishing for years.</i>

212
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,933
- I may head down there too.
- Yeah, I don't know, Dad.

213
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,066
"Startled Straight."
I'm not so sure you're the guy for that.

214
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:44,510
But I'll look into it while I'm down
at the fair signing up for a triathlon.

215
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:46,878
Triathlon?
Do you know how hard a triathlon is?

216
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,269
People lose control of
every bodily function.

217
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,579
Didn't you ever see that video?

218
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:54,986
It's like your mother
on New Year's Eve.

219
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:58,026
<i>Actually, Lucille went down faster.</i>

220
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:03,664
You're not even in shape. You're gonna
fall apart in front of everybody.

221
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,064
- You're kind of scaring me, Dad.
- You see?

222
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:09,536
Perfect for this "Startled Straight" thing.

223
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,732
<i>Tobias was getting Ann ready...</i>

224
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:14,332
<i>for the talent portion of the pageant.</i>

225
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:17,173
I think we need something
with a little more spectacle in the act.

226
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,113
Something that will make you
look small and pretty in comparison.

227
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:22,104
A camel.

228
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:24,016
You know, she has a really
lovely singing voice.

229
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,088
I'll sing to the camel.

230
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:28,885
Yes. We can Google some disco songs
with the word "hump" in them.

231
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:31,118
- Cute.
- No, that sounds a bit racy.

232
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:34,560
Okay. He may be afraid of sex,
but you're not going to win without it.

233
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,689
- No, I'm not afraid of sex.
- Oh, good.

234
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,791
Go have sex with this girl right now.
Do it. Go.

235
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:43,633
Get in there, have some
sex with her right now.

236
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:46,572
I didn't think so.
Ann, you need to decide...

237
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:50,134
whether you want
a man or a boy.

238
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:53,704
- I know how I'd answer.
- Give us some room, George Michael.

239
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:56,006
I can't breathe.

240
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,219
Okay, now you're
upsetting the talent. Out!

241
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:07,128
<i>Michael, meanwhile, had begun
training for the triathlon...</i>

242
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,664
<i>to keep from humiliating himself
in front of Rita.</i>

243
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:12,791
Don't ask, "Can I?"
Ask, "I can!"

244
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:14,802
You can control your bladder
when you're dead.

245
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:18,533
No blood, no oil.
There's no "I" in win!

246
00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:30,451
<i>Michael returned confident
in his manliness...</i>

247
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:33,886
<i>when he ran into his son,
who was questioning his own.</i>

248
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,049
How is that pageant going?

249
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:40,026
It turns out Ann doesn't want
me around during it. - Really?

250
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,850
Well, now you and me can go to
that fair together tomorrow after all.

251
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:45,924
Yeah? - Yeah, and maybe
do some man stuff like you said.

252
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:49,198
Actually, I've already signed up
for the father-son triathlon.

253
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:51,603
Oh. Okay, great. Yeah.
I did wanna do that with you.

254
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:54,699
I mean, I've already promised Steve Holt.

255
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,211
- You know, he's older. It's more manly.
- You don't think I'm manly?

256
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:01,010
No, no, it's just, uh...

257
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:03,779
Darn that Annabelle!
She ruins everything.

258
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:06,286
<i>But the next morning, Michael awoke...</i>

259
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:11,520
<i>to discover every muscle in his body
was exacting revenge.</i>

260
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:14,152
<i>- Oil?
- And so was his brother Gob.</i>

261
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,129
Hey, does anyone know
why my handlebars are in my bed?

262
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:26,872
<i>The Church and State Fair
was in full swing.</i>

263
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:36,820
<i>And Lindsay watched with
pride as Hope Loblaw...</i>

264
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:39,981
<i>Did an original number
that Lindsay herself had written.</i>

265
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:48,825
And now, please welcome
Annabelle Veal...

266
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:53,165
performing "We Three Kings"
with a camel tow.

267
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:02,612
<i>Michael arrived at the fair
sore from overtraining.</i>

268
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:04,874
Can't really go that high.
I'm in a lot of pain here.

269
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:07,143
Yeah, you know, I figured
you'd be that way.

270
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:10,049
So, uh, Coach gave me these.
They're, uh, pills filled with oxygen.

271
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:12,154
- Yeah?
- And they keep you from being incontinent.

272
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:14,056
Have one.
They're called oxy-incontinent.

273
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:16,558
<i>Steve didn't have that quite right.</i>

274
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,426
<i>But Michael thought Rita might be coming,
and he was desperate to impress her.</i>

275
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:23,898
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby was trying
to get knocked out of the pageant.</i>

276
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:28,233
Pope impersonator, Church.
How has God influenced your life?

277
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:31,638
About just as much as Big Bird
and the Keebler elves.

278
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:37,078
Well, my faith would have been shaken
if he had taken my legs too.

279
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:40,582
Uh, Gob Bluth, State.

280
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:43,949
I was betrayed
by my brother Michael.

281
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:46,284
Who's your favorite
family member and why?

282
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,383
Definitely not my shallow, materialistic
mother, who only cares about looks.

283
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:54,555
I think we all feel that way about
our mothers. And we all have legs.

284
00:15:00,037 --> 00:15:03,700
<i>Meanwhile, George Sr. Arrived
at the Startled Straight tent.</i>

285
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:05,832
I'll be waiting out here
with my enlistment forms.

286
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:09,743
So go in there and scare them
right into my open arm!

287
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:14,841
<i>But as it turns out, the fair
had two Startled Straight tents...</i>

288
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:18,080
<i>and George Sr. Had wandered
into the church-sponsored one...</i>

289
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:19,917
You wanna be some guy's girlfriend?

290
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:24,461
<i>Intended to scare gay young men
into a heterosexual lifestyle.</i>

291
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:27,322
You wanna have some guy reach around you
in the middle of the night...

292
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:28,990
- start messing with your junk?
- Is he ugly?

293
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:32,466
No, it's pitch-black.
You don't... You don't see him.

294
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:35,163
It never stops, guys...

295
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:37,365
and everybody acts like
it's no big deal.

296
00:15:37,474 --> 00:15:40,102
Is there a cover charge?

297
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,838
<i>And the inner beauty pageant
was down to the final three.</i>

298
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:46,144
Will it be
the beautiful Hope Loblaw...

299
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,276
the stalwart Annabelle Veal...

300
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:53,379
or the justifiably bitter
Surely Wolf beak?

301
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,984
<i>It became clear that
Surely was going to win.</i>

302
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:00,461
I'm sorry.
This is wrong.

303
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:04,022
<i>And that's when Maeby
displayed some real inner beauty.</i>

304
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:06,364
One of these girls deserves to win.

305
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,062
<i>She can stand!</i>

306
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:12,370
- Maeby?
- That's how I know her.

307
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:15,639
- Let us pray.
- Oh, for God's sake.

308
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:17,839
Praise the Lord!

309
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:20,542
<i>And Michael, now feeling a little woozy...</i>

310
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,710
<i>arrived to see the triathlon course...</i>

311
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,984
<i>which consisted of several tricycles,
five inflatable pools...</i>

312
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:30,390
<i>What the hell is this? - And fathers
and sons being manacled together.</i>

313
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:33,657
Don't let it psyche you out.
Did that oxy-incontinent set in yet?

314
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:35,994
You knew this is what
the race was?

315
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,934
Kind of. I mean, they change it every year
so you can't replicate it on your lawn.

316
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:42,164
Why did you let me
train so hard?

317
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:45,605
I just thought you wanted to hang out
and do guy stuff. - This isn't guy stuff.

318
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:50,043
I don't know why I thought that
you'd wanna do this. This is stupid, huh?

319
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:53,014
No, Steve, Steve.
You're not going anywhere.

320
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:55,551
- You'll do it with me?
- We're chained together.

321
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:58,883
But, you know, Rita's not here yet,
and what the hell. Let's go win this thing.

322
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:01,549
- Let's win this thing!
- What the hell.

323
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:03,176
What the hell!

324
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,718
Let's win this thing. Let's
go ahead and start up.

325
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:08,229
<i>And after the pageant,
George Michael went to congratulate Ann.</i>

326
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:11,028
Congratulations on coming in third.
That's amazing.

327
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:13,399
And I heard you're the first camel act
to ever crack the top 10 too...

328
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:15,404
so that's, like, a record.

329
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:19,340
And I'm a bit relieved,
because, um, I was...

330
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:21,877
I thought maybe if you came in first,
you would have outgrown me.

331
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:24,573
- Outgrown you.
- Mm-hmm.

332
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:26,205
That is the term
I've been looking for.

333
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:28,216
<i>It seems Gob was right...</i>

334
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,116
<i>about what happens
to third place contestants.</i>

335
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,711
I met a man.

336
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:34,916
<i>George Michael was devastated.</i>

337
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:39,792
<i>It seemed he'd lost his girl and
his father because he wasn't man enough.</i>

338
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:42,627
<i>And he was faced with a choice.</i>

339
00:17:57,881 --> 00:18:02,909
<i>Michael and Steve Holt
finished their triathlon in first place.</i>

340
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,920
<i>Of course, they were way older.</i>

341
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:07,320
Believe it or not,
that took about everything I got.

342
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:09,449
I don't know what was in that pill,
but I do not feel so great.

343
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,687
It's gonna get a little worse
before it gets any better. - Really?

344
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:13,092
- We won!
- Okay.

345
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:14,596
- Hey, possible nephew.
- Oh, hey.

346
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:16,598
Michael, your son's
signing up for the army.

347
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,600
What? You signed him up
for the army?

348
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:20,636
Oh, my God, you're right.
If he goes in, I can get out.

349
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:22,817
- I've gotta get my name on his form.
- Hang on! Hey!

350
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:25,341
I gotta get there.
I gotta stop this.

351
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:27,637
Hey, you gotta do this with me.
Come on.

352
00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:30,508
<i>And that's when Rita noticed Michael.</i>

353
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:33,105
Wait for me. Wait for me.

354
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:35,117
- Michael?
- Hey.

355
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:38,211
- Could you not finish?
- No, no. First place.

356
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:40,483
First place, I swear.
But I'm sorry, I gotta go do something.

357
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:42,616
- Wait, I'm dizzy.
- Uncle Mike, come on.

358
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:45,024
- I'll-I'll take you.
- No, no, no, no. Steve, Steve...

359
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:47,063
Let's go. Come on.
Come on.

360
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:49,564
<i>And meanwhile, George Sr...</i>

361
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,329
<i>hadn't succeeded in
startling anyone but himself.</i>

362
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:57,965
I mean, there's nothing to do all day
except lift weights and fold laundry...

363
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:01,306
get thrown into a cage
with a bunch of sweaty men.

364
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:05,040
Excuse me.
I can't go back.

365
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:08,175
- I can't go back.
- I'm glad he won't be there. He's ugly.

366
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:12,415
<i>George Sr. Came across
a U.S. Army combat Humvee...</i>

367
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:14,423
<i>and the pope mobile...</i>

368
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:17,426
<i>and he decided to escape
in the bulletproof one.</i>

369
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:22,565
Come on.
I can't go back!

370
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,253
<i>And Michael caught up
with George Michael...</i>

371
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:25,863
<i>What are you doing?</i>

372
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:28,494
<i>Who was three rungs away
from being in the army.</i>

373
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:30,698
I'm becoming a man, Dad.
Isn't that what everybody wants?

374
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:33,571
Of course not. Gob, can you get us
out of these chains, please?

375
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:36,737
Oh, so you steal my son,
and now you need me to save yours.

376
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:40,010
- All right, one key coming up.
- He's a magician.

377
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,880
Yeah. We-We need you
to sign this form.

378
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:43,850
No, it's good, Dad.

379
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,388
There's all sorts of benefits,
and it's like a family.

380
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,551
But it's also an army of one,
and it's no place for wimps.

381
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:54,688
You have a family, okay?
And I'm the wimp, not you.

382
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,427
Because I could not take
you being away in the army, all right?

383
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:01,197
I love you.

384
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:05,969
- That did it.
- He's not signing up.

385
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:08,772
That's too bad.
I was this close to gettin' out.

386
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:11,404
Hey, I think I'm gonna go get
one of those corn dog crosses.

387
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:14,712
- With all the "crucifixins"? All right.
- Thanks, Dad.

388
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:24,289
- Was that your son?
- Yes, Rita.

389
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:26,954
Yeah. The most important person
in the world to me.

390
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:30,761
You really are quite a man, Michael.

391
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,835
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, yes.

392
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:36,235
You're a complete and utter!@%$?.

393
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:43,012
<i>I can't believe we had to bleep that.</i>

394
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:45,013
<i>It would have been
such a nice moment.</i>

395
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,318
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

396
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:51,444
<i>Buster signs Steve Holt up
for the army.</i>

397
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:55,491
No, no, you can't. You can't.
I'm finally ready to be a father to you.

398
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:58,755
- I know that now.
- I don't go in for another two years.

399
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:01,956
Well, as your father,
can I sign something?

400
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:03,965
<i>And George Sr. Finds out...</i>

401
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,107
<i>- that a fake pope mobile...
- I'll see you in hell!</i>

402
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:11,299
<i>Can't stop real bullets.</i>

403
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:14,172
Thank God I wasn't in the Humvee.
