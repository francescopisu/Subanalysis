1
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,600
The very centre of Africa.

2
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,680
And the centre of two million square
miles of dense tropical rain forest.

3
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,640
At first glance it seems
deserted and eerily still,

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,840
not an easy place to live.

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,600
But, in fact, there is a greater
concentration of animals here,

6
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,840
than anywhere else in Africa.

7
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
And in this world they must
grab every opportunity.

8
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,520
Competition is intense and unrelenting.

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,800
Even the forest itself fights its corner
with spines and poisonous sap.

10
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,160
Here, every living thing
must fight for its space.

11
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,280
Such beauty.

12
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,720
But the flower is self-serving, enticing
animals into an unwitting alliance.

13
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,360
Stingless bees.

14
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,440
They have to work hard.
The forest flowers make them do so

15
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,440
by rationing their nectar, forcing
each bee to visit, and so pollinate,

16
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,120
at least a thousand blooms each day.

17
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,000

18
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,760
For the bees, it's worth the effort.

19
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,200
They need the nectar to make honey
which they store in pots.

20
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,440
It's so precious, they keep it hidden
beneath the bark of a tree.

21
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,480
But their secret is out.

22
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,880

23
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,120
Nothing is safe in this forest.

24
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Chimpanzees love honey.

25
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,320
She seems oblivious to danger.

26
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,920
A fall from up here could be fatal.

27
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,840
But she does need a bigger stick.

28
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,760
Only a chimp has the ability to
break into a stingless bees' nest,

29
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,560
as well hidden as this.

30
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
Chimps are extremely intelligent,

31
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,680
but none is born with
the skill to use a tool.

32
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,000
Youngsters, like this one,
must learn by watching.

33
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
She uses special tools,
one after another,

34
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,480
to get all the honey she can,

35
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,720
and in a few minutes she destroys
what took the bees years to build.

36
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,760
In the rain forest, nothing is safe.

37
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,640
Here in the Congo, there can be
as many as 500 trees

38
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,680
crammed into every acre.

39
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,600
In the battle for space, some will
rise to over 60 metres high,

40
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,520
in just a few decades.

41
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,760
In a valley like this,
there could be close

42
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,400
on 1,000 different species of tree.

43
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,480
Up here, the crowns barely touch.

44
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,720
Each tree seems to respect
its neighbour's space.

45
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,560
When they germinate
down on the forest floor,

46
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,960
young trees and plants
are less restrained.

47
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,280
But every new generation fights it out,

48
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,040
in battles we can see
by accelerating time.

49
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
They must get light
if they are to survive,

50
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,640
and they squeeze, crush and even slash
one another in order to reach it.

51
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,080
Despite the thick canopy above,

52
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,440
some sunlight does filter through,

53
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,400
and allows a few low-light specialists
to bloom near the forest floor.

54
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,240
Down here there are animals too
that seek out the sunlight.

55
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,880
The forest's largest predator.

56
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,560
A female rock python.

57
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,160
Her body is five metres long,
weighs 100 kilos,

58
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
and has 4,000 muscles

59
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,440
that she uses to crush the
life out of her victims.

60
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
But right now, her need
is not for food.

61
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,760
It's for warmth.

62
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,560
She finds a rare patch where a
shaft of sunlight strikes the ground,

63
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,760
and she begins to bask.

64
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,360
She's cold-blooded.

65
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,360
So this is the only way she can raise
the temperature of her body.

66
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,720
But now she's becoming very warm indeed,
more than 10 degrees hotter than usual.

67
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,960
At 40 degrees centigrade
she's in danger of killing herself.

68
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,280
Just in time, she moves off.

69
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,960
She disappears below ground.

70
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,480

71
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
This is her nest,

72
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,440
and it's full of giant eggs.

73
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,760
It's critical for the eggs' development
that they stay above 30 degrees.

74
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,600
Here in this special filming burrow,

75
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,480
she gently wraps her super-heated
body around the eggs,

76
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,240
passing on to them
the warmth of the sun.

77
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,520
She has done this every day
for three months.

78
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,320
The repeated heat stress on her body
is so great it could be lethal.

79
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,280
And at the very least,
it will take three years for her

80
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,120
to recover from incubating
this one clutch of eggs.

81
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,960
Her parchment-shelled eggs carry
the pressed imprint of her scales.

82
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,240
An indication of the strength
of her embrace.

83
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,600
At last, her efforts are rewarded.

84
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,080
But the babies can't stay here.

85
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,200
They must leave their sanctuary
and find food

86
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,040
in the tangled world above.

87
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,760
They're over 60 centimetres long,
already big enough to be a threat

88
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,240
to the smaller inhabitants
of the forest.

89
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,800
But they are themselves vulnerable.

90
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,440
Particularly to other snakes.

91
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,600
But this one is their mother.

92
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,280
Unusually for snakes,

93
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,480
her maternal instincts continue
for days after her eggs hatch.

94
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,000
Even so, the forest
is such a dangerous place,

95
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,720
that only one in a hundred
of her youngsters

96
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,680
is likely to reach adulthood.

97
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,800
Just occasionally,
the competition eases.

98
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,360
A tree suddenly produces fruit.

99
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,400

100
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,200
It's a magnet for
the creatures of the canopy,

101
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,080
and they, in turn, as they feed,

102
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,080
create a bonanza for those
on the ground below.

103
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,360
A mob of red river hogs.

104
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,560
They have travelled over two miles
through the thick undergrowth,

105
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,600
to get to this fall of fruit.

106
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,800
But in the African forest,
little comes for free.

107
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,280
This feast is a bribe.

108
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,240
The hogs will carry the seeds
in their stomachs

109
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,120
and deposit them far from
the parent tree.

110
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,200
Night falls.

111
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,960
But one living community,
which is neither animal nor plant,

112
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,440
continues its never-ending
work in the darkness.

113
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,480
This ground is alive with fungi,

114
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,720
that digest all the litter
discarded by the forest.

115
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,760
Some rare fungi do so with enzymes
that are luminous.

116
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
The local people call them
"Chimpanzee fire".

117
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,200
Without the fungi, the dead vegetation
would pile so high

118
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,720
the living trees would be submerged.

119
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,240
Dawn.

120
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,920
And a new day reveals
just how much control

121
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,160
the jungle has over its own environment.

122
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,320
The forests of the Congo
are the lungs of Africa.

123
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,600
As they use the sunlight
to build their tissues,

124
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,280
so they release oxygen
and water vapour into the air.

125
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,200
Each hectare of forest produces

126
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,320
as vapour almost 190,000
litres of water a year.

127
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,720
So much that it creates
its own weather.

128
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,360
Clouds blanket the forest,

129
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,800
driving up the humidity
and temperature.

130
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,800
A storm is brewing.

131
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,920
The Congo might be
the richest part of Africa,

132
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,200
but it's also the most violent.

133
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,920

134
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,240

135
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,640
Each year, as many as a hundred million
lightning bolts strike the forest.

136
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,280
That's more than anywhere
else in the world.

137
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,600
And with the lightning comes the rain.

138
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,640
Up to 95% of the rain that falls here
is generated by the forest itself.

139
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,720
With the deluge will come change
to the animals and to the forest.

140
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,080
It's certainly perfect
weather for frogs.

141
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,640
The big storm is the cue for the most
important climb of this frog's life.

142
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,400
It's a male in search of a mate.

143
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
But if he is to find one,
he has to get to the top.

144
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,240
He needs to keep his wits about him,

145
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,040
for the rain also brings out hunters.

146
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,720
Easy does it.

147
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,400
The top at last,

148
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,960

149
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,480
but he's late to the party.

150
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,720

151
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,840
The higher a male sits,
the further his voice will carry.

152
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,320
So the top slots are worth fighting for.

153
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,120
And he's won.
He has the top place.

154
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,600
So now it's time to sing.

155
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960

156
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,480
And a white-bellied female responds.

157
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,800
They join together to mate.

158
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,440
The loser will have to wait for
the next storm, before he sings again.

159
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,600
She lays her eggs
on a blade of a long leaf.

160
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,080
And he, using his back legs,
folds it over,

161
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,360
and glues its two edges together,
shutting the eggs inside.

162
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,160
This sealed nest is the safest place
these leaf-folding frogs can find

163
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,280
to protect their precious brood.

164
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,040
Within days, the eggs are developing.

165
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,560
The timing is perfect.

166
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,960
The rain washes away the glue and
the tadpoles slip out of the leaves

167
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,080
into the growing puddles below.

168
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,040
The rainy season reaches its peak
and the ground has been transformed.

169
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,680
The forest is flooded.

170
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,080
It's a new world.

171
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,440
Fish swim in from the swollen streams,
exploiting this newly-created space,

172
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,840
snapping up the drowning insects.

173
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,480
This is a butterflyfish.

174
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,920
A Congo bichir.

175
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,520
The hunter becomes the hunted.

176
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,280
The butterflyfish is too quick
and leaps out of danger.

177
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,200
The floods gradually drain back
into the established waterways

178
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,200
that run through the forest
like blood vessels.

179
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,280
These is so much water
flowing through the forest

180
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,240
that even little rivulets can carve out
the soil around an ancient boulder.

181
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,800
This is the home of one
forest creature,

182
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,440
that has lived here in the Congo
for 44 million years.

183
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,760
Picathartes.

184
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,080
These birds mate for life,

185
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,440
and the male reaffirms the bond
by displaying to the female.

186
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,520
They're building a mud nest on the
underside of the boulder's overhang,

187
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,720
where it'll be protected from the rain.

188
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,840
The female takes the lead.

189
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,880
The male doesn't seem quite so skilful.

190
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,600
Oh dear.

191
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,040
Luckily she can put things right.

192
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,160
Now she's collecting
the soft furnishings.

193
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,000
He's brought some too,
but he still can't get it right.

194
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,160
In the end, the female seems satisfied
with the finish and just in time.

195
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,280
It might look as if he has
been banished into the rain,

196
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,880
but in fact they're a great team.

197
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,040
They share the incubation.

198
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,880
Twelve hours on, twelve hours off,
for the next three weeks.

199
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,920
In due course, there are mouths to feed,
and now the male must prove his worth.

200
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,560
Worms are a good start
and he's doing well.

201
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,080
But the chicks are insatiable.

202
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,760
Fortunately, other things
are on the menu.

203
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,080
He might be a poor nest builder,

204
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,360
but he is redeeming himself now.

205
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,240
Domestic bliss!

206
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,720
Rocky overhangs are the only place
where picathartes will build their nest.

207
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,320
So they owe their home to the stream,

208
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,600
that revealed the flank
of the giant boulder.

209
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,280
This stream
and countless others like it

210
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,640
merge to form the great rivers

211
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,640
of Central Africa.

212
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,560

213
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,080
More than 450 billion litres
of rainwater,

214
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,760
travelling down thousands of rivers,

215
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,480
are heading west.

216
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,040
The waters pick up speed

217
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,080
as the rivers spill over the edge
of the central plateau

218
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,880
and create giant cascades
of white water.

219
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,400
The Kongou forces its way
through the wildest,

220
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,600
most untouched forest
in the whole of Africa.

221
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,760
The Congo River system
drains an area the size of India,

222
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,520
carrying the waters westwards
towards the Atlantic.

223
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,280
But before it reaches the coast,

224
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,760
the rivers broaden,

225
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
forcing back the forest.

226
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,920
And here, for the first time,
there is space.

227
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,640
Wide, flat and safe.

228
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,240

229
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,240
These stretches of sand
attract visitors from the coast.

230
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,480
Skimmers, searching
for somewhere safe to settle.

231
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,920

232
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,200
The lower mandible of their beaks
is greatly elongated.

233
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,840
They slice it through the surface
of the water at 10 metres a second.

234
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,680
If and when it hits a tiny fish,
it'll snap shut.

235
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,680
But why come up river
to these open sand flats?

236
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,280
This is the answer.

237
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,040
But this nursery
will not exist for long.

238
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,280
Four weeks from now
it'll be under 10 metres of water.

239
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,520
If by then these chicks can't fly,

240
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,360
they will drown.


241
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,120
The problem for young skimmers
is that when they hatch

242
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,960
the lower part of their
beaks is the same size as the upper.

243
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,440
While they wait for it to grow,
they do their best

244
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,840
to learn the skimming technique.

245
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,280

246
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,560
Open spaces may be safe,

247
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,440
but they give no protection
against the driving rain.

248
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,800
These storms are a warning
that the skimmers must soon leave.

249
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,400
The river is already rising.

250
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,560
This year, the chicks get away in time.

251
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,640
It's not just water that has the power
to clear a way through the forest.

252
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,600
There are animals
that could do that too.

253
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,240
They have created a network of pathways

254
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
that criss-cross the lowland forest

255
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,800
and run for thousands of miles
in all directions.

256
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,640
These path-makers
are surprisingly stealthy.

257
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,200
But as night falls, there's a chance
of catching a glimpse of them.

258
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,600

259
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,800

260
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,440
Forest elephants
are very social creatures,

261
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,760
but in dense jungle it's hard for them
to find one another.

262
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,480
These elephants are lucky.

263
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,480
Here in the Congo,
there is one special place

264
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,840
where they can meet and mingle.

265
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,640
A place that the elephants
have created for themselves.

266
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,600
And this is it.

267
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,560

268
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,640
Dzanga Bai,

269
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,960
the legendary "village of elephants".

270
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,360
As well as being a place

271
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,680
where they can enjoy
one another's company,

272
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,200
this great clearing
satisfies another craving.

273
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,080
For salts.

274
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,400

275
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,600
The salts lie deep under the mud.

276
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,560
So the elephants
have got to mine for them,

277
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,480
which they do with high pressure
water jets from their trunks.

278
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,120

279
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,600

280
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,560
The precious salts
and the chance to socialise

281
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,320
bring in elephants from far and wide.

282
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,320
If an elephant is in the mood to mate,
this is the place to be.

283
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,120

284
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,480
This young bull is in a state of musth,

285
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,520
a kind of sexual fury.

286
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:00,840

287
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,830

288
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,120
He is so pumped up by hormones
and the excitements of the crowd

289
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,320
that he seems to have
taken leave of his senses.

290
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:41,200

291
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,190

292
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,120
But will throwing his weight about
impress the females?

293
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,640

294
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,280
The cows only become fertile
once every two years.

295
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,760
So opportunities to encounter one
at the right time are not common.

296
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,680
This could well be the first chance
this young male has had.

297
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,440
He's lucky.

298
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,800
And there are no older bulls around
to put him in his place.

299
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,480
Just for a moment,
he is king of the Bai.

300
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,040

301
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,280
But his rule doesn't last for long.

302
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,880
Enter another lusty bull.

303
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,560
And a much bigger one.

304
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,320

305
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,760
But the young bull
is still charged up with testosterone.

306
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,800
Bold or foolish, he's going into battle.

307
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,120
He never really had a chance.

308
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,320

309
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,320

310
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,640
Dzanga Bai is a huge clearing,

311
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,160
but it's still just a speck
in this vast expanse of green.

312
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,480
Elephants might fell trees
and carve pathways,

313
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,760
but nothing natural
can hold back this forest forever.

314
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,880
Nothing but the Atlantic Ocean.

315
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,880
Loango beach, on Africa's west coast,

316
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,240
one of the last truly wild places

317
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,920
where the Congo jungle meets the sea.

318
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,160
Here the forest gives way
to sand, surf,

319
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,400
and fresh sea air.

320
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,040
The cool breezes and warm sunlight

321
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,240
entice creatures out of the dark forest.

322
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,280

323
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,480
Forest buffalo appear first.

324
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,680
And here in the surf, there are hippos.

325
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,240

326
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,640
Spray blows in from the sea,

327
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,960
making the grass salty.

328
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,400
So, here elephants can get
their tasty salt

329
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,000
without having to dig for it.

330
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,400
This mother with her tiny baby
can feel the sun on her back.

331
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,720
Here it's safe for her little one.

332
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,600
They are free to eat in peace.

333
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,840
The bulls have all the room they need,
so there is less risk of a fight.

334
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,360

335
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,160
Everyone, from gorillas to forest hogs,

336
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,120
ventures out to relax on the beach.

337
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,360

338
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,040
But the forest creatures
can't stay out here forever.

339
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,160
Despite everything,

340
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,160
the intense competition,
the threats, the darkness,

341
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,560
they need their forest,

342
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,760
just as their forest needs them.

343
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,000

344
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,560
The Congo rainforest,

345
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,520
a four-day journey
to the heart of Africa.

346
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,320
Once the plane leaves,
you're on your own.

347
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,920
This expedition planned to film
two of the Congo's best-kept secrets.

348
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,440
But to even find them

349
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,480
the crew would have to work
very hard indeed.

350
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,560
You might as well be
on a different planet

351
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,440
coming to a place like this.
Planet Congo.

352
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,680
Mysterious.

353
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,520
Difficult.

354
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,240
Complex.

355
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,080
Challenging.

356
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,200
You know, everything's
trying to bite you.

357
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,160
Suck your blood.

358
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,320
It's like being tickled by a million
feathers at the same time.

359
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,680

360
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,800
The insects might be torture,

361
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,520
but that's the least of their worries.

362
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,960
The only way to get
deep into the jungle

363
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,080
is to follow these trails.

364
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,240
Trails made by dangerous
forest elephants.

365
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,320
Well, the first thing you need
to know about the forest elephants

366
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,880
is you don't want to meet one.

367
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,360
'Cause running away can elicit a charge

368
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,440
and it could be exactly
the wrong thing to do.

369
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,240
Our team are completely dependent

370
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,760
on their B'aka guides for safety.

371
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,840
It's moved off now.
It's gone? Yes

372
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,960
But it's these same forest elephants

373
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,840
that James has come to film

374
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,720
and just to make the challenge harder

375
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,280
he's here to film them in the dark.

376
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,120
Nobody knows exactly what
they get up to at night.

377
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,000
They haven't been filmed
like this before.

378
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,600

379
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,600
I couldn't rig this place
if the B'aka weren't here.

380
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,720
Watching my back, really.

381
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,400
James needs to operate
the remote cameras

382
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,320
from somewhere
out of the elephants' reach.

383
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,520

384
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,720
A tree platform
seems like the best option.

385
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,520
It's not high enough.
Uh huh.

386
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,800
Apparently, they have
very big elephants round here.

387
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,680
They want us to put it a bit higher,
so I think I'll do what they say.

388
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,760
But no one wants to stay out at night
and help James with the filming.

389
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:59,280
Usually B'aka stay up in the
trees only if they are very lost.

390
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,270
Very dangerous!

391
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,360
So James will be alone until morning.

392
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,320
If anything goes wrong,
he's on his own.

393
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,920
If they really wanted to,
they could push these trees over.

394
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,880
I can't imagine
that's going to be an issue.

395
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,160
As James settled down for the night,

396
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,680
he's got no idea of the trouble
that's coming his way.

397
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,200

398
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,920
What's going on?

399
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Twenty miles away Mark MacEwan
is also up in the middle of the night.

400
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,760
The animal he's after
is proving impossible to find.

401
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,800
Oh!

402
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,400
So, we get up in the darkness

403
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,240
and we walk through the jungle at night,

404
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,480
hoping to hear the sound
of cracking branches

405
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,960
or leaves moving up in the trees.

406
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,560
That means chimpanzees
are stirring in the treetops

407
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,840
and Mark is here to
film chimps hunting for honey.

408
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,640
There's one chimp in particular
he needs to find,

409
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,200
a teenager with a very sweet tooth,

410
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,400
known to go further in the pursuit
of the bees' nest than any other.

411
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,520
I've spent six days

412
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,800
walking probably the equivalent
of a half marathon every day

413
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,360
in 100 percent humidity
and about 95 degrees in the shade.

414
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,440
And we just can't find our chimpanzee.

415
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,000

416
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,560
Time is ticking away

417
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,440
and Mark is running out of filming days.

418
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,960
At the moment I just need some good luck.

419
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,600
We've come an awfully long way
to get this sequence.

420
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,200
We've got probably 10 to 12 days left.

421
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,800
But it's hard work
at the moment.

422
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,960
All Mark can do is persevere

423
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,840
and hope for a break.

424
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,320
But not all the forest creatures
are so shy.

425
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,480
Perched high in his tree,

426
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,480
James Aldred is waiting patiently
for the elephants to come in.

427
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,080

428
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,720
At last the elephants are here.

429
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,160
But they're behaving strangely.

430
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,720

431
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,800
He knows something's not quite right.

432
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,160

433
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,000
The elephants seem agitated.

434
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,840

435
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,920

436
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,640
They just want to get rid of you.

437
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,600
One begins to thump the tree with its head.

438
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,320
James has no option
but to weather the attack.

439
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,680

440
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,360
Let's lean forward

441
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,200
and keep head-butting,
keep head-butting, keep head-butting.

442
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,960

443
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,840
Suddenly the cameras cut out.

444
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,440
And James is left in complete darkness.

445
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,480
After three weeks searching,

446
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,200
Mark has lost
nearly two stone in weight

447
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,200
but he hasn't given up.

448
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,520
He can't afford to put down
his camera for a second.

449
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,920
Suddenly, the guide
spots the honey hunter.

450
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,320
This is it.

451
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,320
- Where is she?
- She's inside the tree.

452
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,960
Just for some honey,
she's risking her life. It's amazing.

453
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,440
Well, I think,
I just couldn't stop smiling

454
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,800
for several days after filming that.
The relief was just unbelievable.

455
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,920
Back at the camera platform,
James has had a long night.

456
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,520
For over four hours

457
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,720
the elephant tried to shake him
out of the tree.

458
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,200
Got down this morning
when the B'aka came to collect me.

459
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,560
Went to look at the camera
and he'd pulled it out of the tree

460
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,320
and he'd chewed
through the power cable.

461
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,120
He must have gotten a bit of a shock.
I mean only 12 volts.

462
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,200
But serves him right, quite honestly.

463
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,000
But at least we got a shot of him
before he trashed the camera.

464
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,760
Silver lining.

465
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,480
Despite this bumpy start,

466
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,840
the elephants soon got used to James

467
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,520
and James got used to the elephants.

468
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,960
Filming here
was never going to be easy.

469
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,680
But we were soon able to reveal
the night life of forest elephants

470
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,440
like never before.

471
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,920
