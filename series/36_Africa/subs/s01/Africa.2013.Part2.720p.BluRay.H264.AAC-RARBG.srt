1
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,640

2
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,160

3
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm flying over the Great Rift Valley
in East Africa.

4
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,720
And below me is a landscape in turmoil,

5
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,440
torn apart by the twisting
and buckling of the Earth's crust.

6
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,840
It's also a landscape
of huge and unpredictable change

7
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,640
that forces animals day by day,
season by season,

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,040
to gamble with their lives.

9
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,360
But for those who win,

10
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,840
this is one of the most fertile
landscapes on Earth.

11
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,760

12
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,440

13
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,880
Nyiragongo, the largest lava 
lake in the world.

14
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,760
Bubbling up from nearly 10 miles
beneath the surface.

15
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Nowhere takes you closer
to the fiery heart of the planet.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,360
Mount Nyiragongo is one
of the most active volcanoes in Africa.

17
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,080
Its eruptions can be seen from space.

18
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,960
As magma churns below the Earth's crust,

19
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,360
the land to the east of here
is being torn apart.

20
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,800

21
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,120
Volcanoes like this are continually
changing the face of Eastern Africa.

22
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,000
The volcanoes here
may have a violent side,

23
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,640
but life flows from these infernos.

24
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,120
Fertile ash from countless eruptions
carpets the land,

25
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
creating the ideal conditions
for grasses to flourish

26
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
on an immense scale.

27
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,400
And with the grasses,
come animals in numbers

28
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,000
found nowhere else on Earth.

29
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
Wildebeest.

30
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
Nothing stands in their way.

31
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,240

32
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,280
All this just to reach fresh grass.

33
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,400

34
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,320
The ever-travelling herds
are only one element of life here.

35
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,480
Look closer and there
are new stories to tell.

36
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,480
Living on the savannah
is about making the most of the hand

37
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,560
the landscape deals you.

38
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,720
But here it's always a gamble.

39
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,280
Everything may change tomorrow.

40
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,680
From their vantage point,
agama lizards wait

41
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,600
for the arrival of the herds,

42
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
ready to seize their moment.

43
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,240
It's pay day.

44
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,200
Over a million wildebeest
on their doorstep.

45
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,000
And with the wildebeest
come flying insects.

46
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,480
Billions of them.

47
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,960
Food,

48
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,480
if only they could catch them.

49
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,560
Time for a rethink.

50
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,960
This agama lizard
has spotted an opportunity.

51
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,760
Only one thing attracts more flies
than the wildebeest.

52
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,040
Lions that have eaten wildebeest.

53
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,720
Lions are famously-bad tempered.

54
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,760
They could swat the lizard
like the flies he's hoping to ambush.

55
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,360
He will need to pick
his target carefully.

56
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
Not her.

57
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,640
Or her.

58
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,760
Maybe.

59
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,600
But no.

60
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360

61
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,040
To be within striking distance,
he's got to hold his nerve.

62
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,960
Got one.

63
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,360
Now, he's getting his eye in.

64
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,880
But this might be a bit ambitious.

65
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,800

66
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,960
It may take courage to hunt
on the back of a lion.

67
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200

68
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,840
But it takes sense
to know when to run away.

69
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,000
The wildebeest won't stay for long.

70
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,600
And when they leave,
most of the flies will follow.

71
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,240
Change is everywhere in East Africa.

72
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,720
This grassland was once
covered by a forest

73
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,040
that ran unbroken
from west coast to east coast.

74
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,240
Today, high above the plains,
swirling clouds

75
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
hide mountains that tower
three miles into the sky.

76
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,600
These frozen summits now form
part of a mountainous barrier

77
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,240
separating the ancient jungles
in the west

78
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,600
from the savannahs of the east.

79
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,680
Up here lies the largest
glacier in Africa,

80
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,480
just a few miles north of the equator.

81
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,560
These are the legendary
Mountains of the Moon.

82
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,640
The height of these peaks
means they create their own weather.

83
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,560
The local name for these mountains
is Ruwenzori, "the rainmaker. "

84
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,640

85
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,600
Meltwater flows down from the glaciers.

86
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,240
And on the lower slopes,
all this water supports thick jungle.

87
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,880

88
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,600
Remnants of the dense, steamy forests

89
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,080
that once dominated
the whole of East Africa.

90
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,880
But driven by a drying climate
beyond the mountains,

91
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,640
the forests began to wither away.

92
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,320
Today, only small pockets
of upland jungle remain,

93
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,720
home to animals who once roamed
the ancient forests.

94
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,600
The largest living primates on Earth.

95
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960

96
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,720
Mountain gorillas.

97
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,600

98
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,360

99
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680

100
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,280
This little one's ancestors

101
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,120
have lived in forests like these
for millions of years.

102
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,840
But all around, the world has changed

103
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,880
to swamp and savannah.

104
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,520
This is the furthest
these mighty giants now venture

105
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,360
into Eastern Africa.

106
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,240
They're marooned on their islands
in the African sky.

107
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,080

108
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,320
Below the highlands,

109
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,680
vast wetlands cut swathes
through the open savannah.

110
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,720
Bangweulu Swamp is huge.

111
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,200
Its name means
"where the water meets the sky. "

112
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,760
Hidden amongst this maze of waterways

113
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,840
is a creature like no other.

114
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,480
A giant prehistoric-looking bird.

115
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,920
A shoebill.

116
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Standing well over a metre tall,

117
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,360
she roams these swamps

118
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,520
trying to catch catfish.

119
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,640
Not exactly what she was after.

120
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,520
Deeper into the swamp

121
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,240
lies the reason for all this fishing.

122
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,120
This chick is just three weeks old,

123
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,840
and a little bit wobbly on its feet.

124
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Its vast bill
means it has trouble balancing.

125
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,160
It won't be able to fly
or even walk properly for several weeks.

126
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,960
It's entirely reliant on its parents
for food and water.

127
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,080
There is also a smaller chick,

128
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,560
who isn't doing so well.

129
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,840
The larger chick
pesters its mother for a drink.

130
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,640
While she goes off to fetch water,

131
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,560
it reveals a dark side
to the relationship with its nest mate.

132
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,120
It's three days older
than the other chick

133
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,800
and has always won the race
for food and attention.

134
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,520
This is more than just a scrap
between two siblings.

135
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,200
As the mother returns,
she sees what the larger chick has done.

136
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,120
The smaller chick
seeks its mother's comfort.

137
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,360
But she has already made her choice.

138
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,760
Only her first born will get to drink.

139
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,760
Shoebills very rarely raise
more than one chick.

140
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,360
The younger chick
was only ever an insurance,

141
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,840
in case the elder didn't make it.

142
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,320
Now it's old enough,

143
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,520
the adults know that they're better off
putting all their efforts

144
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,960
into bringing up just one
fit and healthy youngster.

145
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,360
The swamps changing water levels
mean fishing is too unpredictable

146
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,000
for them to gamble
on trying to raise two chicks.

147
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,560
Nothing here stays the same for long.

148
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,880
This is the time of year
when Eastern Africa is beginning to dry.

149
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,240
The rivers and waterholes are shrinking.

150
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,960

151
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,800
The land continues to dry out.

152
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,760
Tensions rise.

153
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,240

154
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,320
Hippos seek what relief they can.

155
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,160

156
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,320
This time of relentless drying

157
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,920
is also when another force
of change ravages the land.

158
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,240

159
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,120
Without warning, fires rip through
these tinder-dry plains.

160
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,040
The flames sweep across the savannah
at 50 miles an hour,

161
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,200
reaching temperatures
of nearly 1,000 degrees,

162
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,760
consuming everything in their path.

163
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,960
Each year, an area larger than Britain
goes up in smoke.

164
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,800
But this destruction
can bring opportunity,

165
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,000
if you're prepared to take a risk.

166
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,520

167
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,240
Drongos, bee-eaters and rollers

168
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,320
bravely pluck fleeing insects
from amongst the flames.

169
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,440
There's little better
than a char-grilled grasshopper.

170
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,320
These fires may appear devastating

171
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,680
but they are, in fact,
part of a natural cycle

172
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,760
that is essential for the regeneration
of East Africa's grasslands.

173
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,680
But sometimes the cycle is broken,

174
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,200
just when a change is most needed.

175
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,120
Here, on the plains of Amboseli,
in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro,

176
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,360
the seasonal rains have failed
for the last two years.

177
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,680
And this year,
they are already long overdue.

178
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,200
It's the hardest drought
for half a century.

179
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,560

180
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,720
Amboseli is usually
a haven for elephants.

181
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,520
These plains should be green
and covered with grass.

182
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,840
Now, there is nothing but dust.

183
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,880
This family is forced
to travel constantly,

184
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,040
searching for anything they can eat.

185
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,400
The young must keep up.

186
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,960
Sometimes, there's not even
time to suckle.

187
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,480

188
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,840
With the grass gone, all the elephants
can scratch from the dust

189
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,600
is withered twigs.

190
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,640
The adults might just survive on this,

191
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,080
but it will not support a calf for long.

192
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Every mother in the herd is struggling
to provide milk for her calf.

193
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,400
The search for food
is increasingly urgent.

194
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,280
As the herd moves on,
this female faces a terrible choice.

195
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,600
To carry on with her family
or stay behind with her calf,

196
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,840
who's becoming too weak to even stand.

197
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,520
They will soon be out of sight.

198
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,520
But her instinct is to stay.

199
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,520
She won't abandon her baby.

200
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,000

201
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,320

202
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,520

203
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,040

204
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,160
With the calf's last breath,

205
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,320
she knows that her battle is lost.

206
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,640

207
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,360

208
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,840
There are places

209
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,880
even more hostile
than the dust-choked plains.

210
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,600
These alien landscapes are actually
the sun-baked salt crusts

211
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,480
of a chain of lakes
that run through East Africa.

212
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,200
The face of these soda lakes
changes day by day

213
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,360
as the sun evaporates the water,
leaving the salts behind.

214
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,640
The waters here are toxic,

215
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,160
poisoned by volcanic springs.

216
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,560
But life does exist, even here.

217
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,520
The strange colours are created by algae

218
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,960
specially adapted
to live in this corrosive liquid.

219
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,160
And it is these algae that attract

220
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,360
one of the most astonishing animals
found in East Africa.

221
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,560

222
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,000

223
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,640
Among the steaming geysers
of Lake Bogoria,

224
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,040
over a million lesser flamingos
bathe and feed in the caustic water.

225
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,680
They gather whenever the algae bloom.

226
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,680
These huge numbers create one of the
greatest wildlife spectacles on Earth.

227
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,160
Almost all the world's lesser flamingos
live on this chain of lakes,

228
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,960
moving from one lake to another
as the amount of algae in each changes.

229
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,960
All along the lake shore,
volcanic vents are a reminder

230
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,440
of the forces
that continue to change this land.

231
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,880
And a streak of colour on the horizon

232
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,160
signals that relief
for the parched plains is on its way.

233
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,840

234
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,560
At last, countless storms
drench the thirsty ground.

235
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,000
Rain changes everything yet again.

236
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120

237
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,600
A crowned eagle
has been desperately waiting

238
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,080
for what she hopes the rain will bring.

239
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680

240
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,160
Food for her hungry chick.

241
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,360
Nesting here has been her biggest gamble.

242
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,680
A chick's life depends
on the arrival of creatures

243
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,760
from the far rainforests of the Congo.

244
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,960

245
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,000
Her wait will soon be over.

246
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,760
The largest mammal migration in Africa
is on the move.

247
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,280

248
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,400
10 million fruit bats
are drawn to this tiny forest

249
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,000
on the edge of the eastern savannah.

250
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,480
The bats flock here
to gorge themselves on fruit.

251
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,200

252
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,240
It's what the crowned eagle
and her chick have been waiting for.

253
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,720
But they're not alone.

254
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,880
Other eagles
have flown in from miles around.

255
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,240
Fish eagles,

256
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,440
martial eagles,

257
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,280
and they're all after the bats.

258
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,160

259
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,880
The gamble the crowned eagle
took months ago by nesting here

260
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,840
has paid off.

261
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,640
She is the only eagle
to actually nest in this forest.

262
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,360
The only one
who took the risk to breed here

263
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,760
well before the trees came into fruit
and the bats flooded in.

264
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,800

265
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,720
She only breeds once every two years,

266
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,040
so her timing must be perfect.

267
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,440
In a few months, the bats will leave,

268
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,240
but her gamble means her chick will have
the best possible start in life.

269
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,840
These grasslands
have been grazed and burned

270
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,400
and have endured
the harshest drought in generations.

271
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,240
But with the rains,
they're beginning to recover.

272
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:49,280

273
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,270

274
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,240

275
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,400
And on the once dust-choked
plains of Amboseli

276
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,360
there is a return to the good times.

277
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,680
The drought here
killed hundreds of elephants,

278
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,280
but the survivors
are now returning home.

279
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,720
And with them, there's a surprise.

280
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600

281
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,840
A newborn.

282
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,800

283
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160

284
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,040
Surrounded by food,

285
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,040
the youngster can concentrate
on more important things.

286
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,360
Like chasing egrets.

287
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440

288
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,640

289
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,960

290
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,080
The bulls also return.

291
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,000

292
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,080

293
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,160
This bull has waited many years for his
chance to father the next generation.

294
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Now, he must fight his way to the top.

295
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,200
But his rival is massive.

296
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,760
Each of their heads
weighs as much as a car.

297
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,880

298
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,640
They have been duelling for days.

299
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280

300
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,120
Now, in its third day,
the contest is reaching a climax.

301
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,600

302
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,760
Soon, one will be forced to concede.

303
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,200
The power of these clashes
can even shatter tusks.

304
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,480

305
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,120

306
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,720
Three days of battle is at an end.

307
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,760

308
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,520
The victor has won the right
to the females.

309
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,840
The process to replace
what the drought took away has begun.

310
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,880

311
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,720
Soon, the elephants
will be at full strength again.

312
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,080

313
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,520
Every day the animals of Eastern Africa
gamble with their lives.

314
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,200
But despite
the continual changes they face,

315
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,680
their extraordinary adaptability

316
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,440
just tips the odds of survival
in their favour.

317
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,400
East Africa may seem very cruel,

318
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,440
but there's nowhere else
that provides such rich opportunities

319
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,560
for those that are prepared
to take them.

320
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,400
And in the end, it was these
ever-changing savannahs

321
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,880
that produced
the most adaptable species of all,

322
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,840
ourselves.

323
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,480

324
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,280
Filming in East Africa

325
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,160
would take the team on both
a physical and emotional journey

326
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,000
through the extremes of this landscape.

327
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,040

328
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,840
These are the legendary
Mountains of the Moon,

329
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,200
towering over 5,000 metres
into the African sky.

330
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,680
Just miles from the equator,

331
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,400
they're the highest mountain range
on the continent

332
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,600
and home to the
largest glacier in Africa.

333
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,240
To reach the summits,
the team had to travel on foot,

334
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,000
the same way as climbers did

335
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,160
when they first reached the top
just over 100 years ago.

336
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,800
It would take more than two weeks,

337
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,440
climbing over 3,000 metres
from the valleys below.

338
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,200
Six days into their trek,
still well below the summits,

339
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,440
the team come to realise why Ruwenzori,
the mountains' other name,

340
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,160
means "the rainmakers".

341
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,680
Just after we set off it started
raining, then it started hailing,

342
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,320
um, and the idea had been
that we'd stop here for an hour or two

343
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,000
and do some shots,
but as you can probably see,

344
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,560
there's not a great deal of view.

345
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,760
Brilliant shots
of rain and hail and fog.

346
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,920
Beyond that, we're pretty stuffed.

347
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,080
So, it's becoming a bit of a theme.

348
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,000
For the crew and over 75 guides and helpers,

349
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:17,040
it's hard going carrying nearly a ton
of kit through the marshy valleys.

350
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,200
Mud. Mud. There's a little bit more mud.

351
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,080
But it's not just the bogs
they have to deal with.

352
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,840
There was a fairly small

353
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,360
but slightly disconcerting
earthquake last night,

354
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,000
so, let's hope we don't get
any of those below any rocks.

355
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,680
The team continue to climb

356
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,320
and before long, the rain turns to snow.

357
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,280
They eventually arrive
at the highest hut,

358
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,720
surrounded by ice
and nearly three miles up.

359
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,320
This will be base camp for the crew.

360
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,400
We've got a kitchen over there.

361
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,400
Um, over there down a 
really treacherous precipice

362
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,880
is the toilet,

363
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,280
which is just a shack
with a big hole in the floor.

364
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,640

365
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,840
From here, they'll make
the hardest part of the ascent

366
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,960
right up to the glaciers.

367
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,480
Well, this is, believe it or not,
one of the better viewpoints.

368
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,160
So we're gonna hang around here
for a little while,

369
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,280
to wait till the fog clears.

370
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,320
But the weather isn't on their side.

371
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,040
So much for hoping the weather
was going to get better.

372
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,040
All that optimism
now seems completely ill-founded.

373
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,920
With the storm clouds closing in,

374
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,920
the team are forced to retreat.

375
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,080

376
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,240
This enormous weather front's come in,
as isn't entirely unusual.

377
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,440
So we're just coming down
as the thunder bursts around us.

378
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,440
So just trying to get back

379
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,680
and go and get inside the hut
and hopefully weather it out.

380
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,040
After days of climbing
and finding the peaks hidden by fog,

381
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,600
filming the summits
is looking increasingly impossible.

382
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,440
It can be pretty
frustrating at times.

383
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,320
The group of, maybe, 70 people that
we've involved with doing this directly

384
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,080
and you get all the way
up here and then,

385
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,800
and then we can't film anything
because of the weather.

386
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,480
So, it is just a matter
of sitting it out and waiting.

387
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,960
And you have to sort of
hope that things come right in the end.

388
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,360
The rainmakers are certainly 
living up to their name.

389
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,560
But by complete contrast, other parts
of East Africa were gripped by drought.

390
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,440
At the beginning of the production,
Mark Deeble travelled to Amboseli,

391
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,120
just a few hundred miles
from the Ruwenzoris,

392
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,000
to film the plight of the animals there.

393
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,760
Well, I've never seen
anything quite as bad as that drought.

394
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,280
When we talked to some
of the Maasai elders,

395
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,080
they said it was the worst drought
they'd seen in 50 years.

396
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,280
Amboseli is famous
for its huge herds of elephant,

397
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,480
but the drought had dispersed them
far and wide.

398
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,280
Those that remained were struggling
to find what little food was left.

399
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,880
When we first saw the group,
we could tell instantly that they...

400
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,920
They were in a really serious condition.

401
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,400
They were thin and obviously starving.

402
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,080

403
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,440
Mark knew that many of the calves 
would not survive.

404
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,560
Although desperately painful to witness,

405
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,040
nothing would convey
the cruel power of the drought

406
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,760
more than this mother's struggle
to keep her baby alive.

407
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,480
The thing about filming
a situation like that,

408
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,360
you know, when an elephant calf dies,

409
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,040
is that when you're actually filming it
you're so caught up in the moment.

410
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,520

411
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,920
But it was only after filming,
when I put the camera away

412
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,600
and I looked there
and there was this dead calf

413
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,760
and the mother sort of standing there,
grieving,

414
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,040
that the full impact
of what I'd just filmed hit me.

415
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,640
People often say to me, you know,

416
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,560
"Could you not have intervened
in a situation like that?"

417
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,800
There are times when you can help.

418
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,280
But in that time in Kenya
there was no food available.

419
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,200
Now, you have to also
consider the mother.

420
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,880
If we'd gone in there
and tried to take the calf away,

421
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,040
it would've been absolute mayhem.
She'd have got incredibly stressed

422
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,520
and that would probably
have jeopardised her survival.

423
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,680

424
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,160
In that particular situation,
when everything around us was dying,

425
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,520
there was absolutely nothing
we could do to help that young elephant.

426
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,320
Although too late to save the calf,

427
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,320
a few months later,
the rains did finally return.

428
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,920
When we returned, it was amazing.

429
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,880
It was lush and green again.

430
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,800
And the elephants, in the rains,
they all tend to come together.

431
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,760
So it was like all of these groups
which had been dispersed,

432
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,080
which had been just somehow
coping on their own,

433
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,320
all got back together again.

434
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,720
It was almost a sort of
festival type atmosphere.

435
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,080

436
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,960
That was when, essentially,
they come together,

437
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,120
they mate, and then after that
lots of young calves being born.

438
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,040
Since the end of the drought,

439
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,560
over 220 calves
have been born in Amboseli,

440
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,440
and that number is still rising.

441
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,160
It's the biggest
elephant baby boom on record.

442
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,760
I think what's lovely to see
in that situation is that, having...

443
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,080
Having been through
such a terrible drought,

444
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,120
to see the way in which, you know,
if you let things alone

445
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,880
they, you know, they do have incredible
capacity to bounce back.

446
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,120
Back in the mountains, and 
several failed ascents later,

447
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,360
the team were still battling
through the white-out.

448
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,040
They try one last time.

449
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,800
There's cloud below us
and cloud above us.

450
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,440
It somehow seems slightly,
like we're heading nowhere, slowly.

451
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,880
Then, as they reach the top,

452
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,120
finally the clouds begin to part.

453
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,240
It's absolute magic here.

454
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,560
We've just come through
the densest, densest cloud,

455
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,600
having absolutely no idea
what's surrounding us.

456
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,120
The past few days have just been
rain and cloud and rain and cloud.

457
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,280
And, as if by magic,
there's the most spectacular view

458
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,960
of ice and glaciers and mountains

459
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,960
that you just wouldn't think
was on the equator.

460
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,560
It's just amazing.

461
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,040
It's the most spectacular 
mountain scenery I've seen.

462
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,400
And to think it's in Africa
is just mind-boggling.

463
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,800
These mysterious mountains
have finally unveiled their secrets.

464
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,720
And on the plains beyond,

465
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,680
the elephants have returned to their home.

466
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,320
Despite having been explored
by filmmakers for over a century,

467
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,680
East Africa still has the power
to enchant and surprise us all.
