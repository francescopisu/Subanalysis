1
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:37,242
These seas, thousands of miles
from nearest land,

2
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:39,637
are the most sterile on our planet.

3
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,196
These are marine deserts.

4
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:48,802
But here live the swiftest
and most powerful of all ocean hunters.

5
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:58,596
Simply finding them
is an immense challenge...

6
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:02,038
but we are about to follow them

7
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:04,198
as they search for their food

8
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,881
in this little known part
of the seas...

9
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:10,285
the open ocean.

10
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:28,199
Striped marlin -

11
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,880
voracious predators

12
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,720
that can grow to three metres long.

13
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:38,198
They hunt mainly in daylight,

14
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,403
searching the tropical oceans

15
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,558
from close to the surface

16
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,877
down to depths of 100 metres or so.

17
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:49,157
Normally, the fish they feed on
are widely dispersed,

18
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:52,637
but sometimes their prey
gathers in dense shoals,

19
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:54,763
like these sardines.

20
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,244
This feast may last
for over an hour...

21
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:39,078
time enough for other hunters
to reach the scene.

22
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,243
juvenile tuna join in
the feeding frenzy.

23
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:02,638
The noise attracts a giant -

24
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,923
a sei whale.

25
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:15,439
it's 14 metres long
and 20 tonnes in weight,

26
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,598
and has an appetite to match.

27
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:24,124
Soon, the only sign
that the sardines ever existed

28
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:27,836
are scales sinking
down into the abyss.

29
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:32,038
Such feasts don't last long.

30
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,198
Within a few short days,

31
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,597
waters that once swarmed with food

32
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,758
will have been cleaned out.

33
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:40,997
The hunters must move elsewhere

34
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:45,080
and once again search the seemingly
featureless open ocean.

35
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,518
A manta ray - immense,

36
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:52,486
five metres across

37
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:56,242
from the tip of one wing-like fin
to the tip of the other.

38
00:05:56,407 --> 00:06:00,480
it's travelling Economy,
wasting as little energy as possible

39
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:03,639
as it glides through the waters
of the tropics.

40
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:11,001
The remora fish that accompany it

41
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:14,682
travel more economically still
by hitching a lift.

42
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:19,076
Their host is searching for food -
plankton,

43
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:23,320
the minute fish and invertebrates
that float near the surface.

44
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,000
it needs lots of them

45
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:29,080
and may cruise for days before
it finds a good feeding ground.

46
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,443
Dusk, at the edge
of a Pacific island,

47
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,201
3,000 miles
from the nearest continent.

48
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:40,439
Here, surgeon fish
have assembled to spawn.

49
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:45,041
As they perform
their nuptial dances,

50
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:48,756
they discharge clouds of eggs
and sperm into the water.

51
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:52,558
The manta must have known
this was about to happen,

52
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:55,764
for it arrived at exactly
this critical moment,

53
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,997
and it is not the only one
to do so.

54
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,158
0thers are here, too.

55
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:08,325
Now, they just need to sweep
the water into their mouths

56
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,284
and sieve out the eggs.

57
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:38,559
Within an hour,
the whole event will be over.

58
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:42,361
Any surviving eggs
will be so dispersed

59
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,836
that they are not worth collecting.

60
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:54,118
But other perils await them

61
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,245
as they join the clouds of eggs
and larvae and tiny fish

62
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:59,921
that drift through
the surface waters of the open ocean.

63
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,605
These are the eggs
of yellow-fin tuna.

64
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,758
if the hatchlings survive,

65
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,760
it will take them two years
to become adults.

66
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:16,726
in three years,

67
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:20,800
they could be nearly two metres long
and weigh 200 kilograms.

68
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:27,197
Perhaps only one in a million
will live as long as that.

69
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:30,238
They and the other animals

70
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:32,921
and microscopic plants
of the plankton

71
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:36,557
constitute the basis of all life
out on the open ocean.

72
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,876
A storm petrel
dancing on the water.

73
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:46,038
But this is no amiable waltz.

74
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:47,686
it's a hunt.

75
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:54,081
As they hover facing into the wind,

76
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:58,160
they pick out morsels from near
the surface, including eggs.

77
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:09,079
0nly a tiny percentage
of the developing eggs

78
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:11,477
will survive long enough to hatch.

79
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:15,526
These newly emerged tuna
are only three millimetres long,

80
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,678
and although they CAN swim,

81
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:19,917
they're still very vulnerable.

82
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:24,642
it will be many weeks before
they can swim strongly enough

83
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:27,196
to make any real headway
in the ocean.

84
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,485
After the sun goes down,

85
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:41,036
other predators
rise from the depths

86
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,516
to attack the floating multitudes.

87
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,718
Darkness shrouds the arrival

88
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:07,118
of battalions of dangerous,
drifting predators.

89
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,523
These shimmering comb jellies -
sea gooseberries -

90
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:27,520
trap their prey
with sticky, net-like webs.

91
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,485
0ne ill-timed fin stroke

92
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:32,684
could bring certain death
to a hatchling fish.

93
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:37,160
There are many kinds
of these comb jellies -

94
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:40,000
all of them very effective hunters.

95
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:52,646
By dawn,

96
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:56,880
most of the nocturnal feeders
will have returned to the depths.

97
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,202
The surviving hatchlings, however,

98
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,006
have already started
on their travels.

99
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:19,759
Vast current systems
like immense rivers

100
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,236
carry them around the ocean basins.

101
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:27,683
The boundaries between
these masses of moving water

102
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:31,840
form invisible barriers that
can trap plankton and nutrients

103
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,804
carried up from the depths.

104
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:41,524
So, parts of the ocean
become rich with food

105
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:43,962
for days or even weeks at a time.

106
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:49,676
This attracts vast schools
of plankton-feeding fish,

107
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:51,560
like these sardine.

108
00:11:57,487 --> 00:12:00,001
They take in water
through their mouths

109
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:02,283
and expel it through their gills,

110
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:06,440
sieving out the plankton which is
then funnelled down their throats.

111
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:16,279
The immense schools travel
along the boundaries of the currents,

112
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:19,678
seeking the spots
where the plankton is thickest.

113
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:26,560
As the position of the current
boundaries changes constantly,

114
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:30,481
so does both the supply of plankton
and the numbers of fish.

115
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:47,878
A small pod
of Pacific spotted dolphin,

116
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:50,197
20 miles from the coast of Panama.

117
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:53,439
Like all predators,
they seek parts of the ocean

118
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,598
where their food is thickest.

119
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,435
They cover as much
as 100 miles in a day,

120
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:09,598
and while they travel,

121
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,246
they play.

122
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,999
They have detected
the sound of schooling fish

123
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,158
from hundreds of metres away,

124
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:35,319
and start to track down the shoals
using sonar,

125
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:37,557
leaving their toys behind them.

126
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:44,560
For the hunted,
there are few places to hide.

127
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,404
Schooling mackerel.

128
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:56,799
They have already sensed the sonar
beams of approaching dolphin.

129
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:03,480
Their only defence
is to gather into a ball.

130
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:07,799
Any fish that stayed out of the
shoal would be quickly picked off.

131
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:11,357
Within it, there is
at least S0ME chance of survival.

132
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:23,644
The noise of the attack
alerts another predator -

133
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,879
a sailfish, one of the fastest fish
in the ocean.

134
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:34,922
it has detected rapid vibrations
in the water,

135
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:37,078
and is searching for the cause.

136
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:53,677
Sailfish rely on eyesight
for their final approach,

137
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,917
so they hunt mainly in daylight.

138
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,917
When sailfish become excited,
they change colour,

139
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:06,203
lighting up with blue stripes.

140
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:10,997
Since mackerel eyes are especially
sensitive to blue and ultraviolet,

141
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,842
these colours confuse them,
making them easier to catch.

142
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:58,642
Far below, a blue shark
returns from a squid-hunting trip

143
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,479
in the cold darkness

144
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:02,399
300 metres down.

145
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:06,321
it's heading for the surface
to reheat in the warmer water.

146
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,004
As it ascends, it detects the smell

147
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,600
of oils and proteins

148
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:15,679
shed into the water
by the panicked mackerel.

149
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:22,801
The trail leads both the shark
and its attendant pilot fish

150
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:24,685
towards an easy meal.

151
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,285
Scraps and casualties

152
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:34,598
float in the wake
of the passing mackerel school.

153
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:41,280
Throughout the ocean,
predators and prey

154
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:44,837
are locked in a deadly
three-dimensional contest

155
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:48,363
of hide and seek, played out
over immense distances.

156
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,518
To survive, they must travel.

157
00:16:57,127 --> 00:17:01,279
The huge four-metre-long
blue-fin tuna has special blood vessels

158
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:04,917
that enable it to keep
its body temperature warmer

159
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,078
than the surrounding water.

160
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:14,563
As a result, they can survive
in much colder conditions

161
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:18,276
than any other tuna,
and they travel thousands of miles

162
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:22,918
away from their spawning grounds
in the tropics to hunt in cold seas

163
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:25,396
where the food supply is richest.

164
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:29,081
0cean travellers
come in many guises -

165
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:31,841
and few are stranger than this...

166
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:40,485
a crab that spends
much of its life afloat.

167
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,323
it's a worrying passer-by

168
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:52,285
for booby birds with delicate toes.

169
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:14,560
Many floaters are little more
than jelly enclosed in membranes

170
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,321
but they may drift
for vast distances.

171
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:21,366
And turtles,
like these olive Ridleys,

172
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:24,758
migrate thousands of miles
every year.

173
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,922
The ocean is full of such wanderers

174
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:33,762
riding the currents and doing
their best to avoid enemies

175
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:35,918
while they search for food

176
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:38,078
and a safe place to breed...

177
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:43,000
which is exactly
what these rays are doing -

178
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,237
forming the two-mile high club,

179
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:48,399
gathering together
for courtship on the wing,

180
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,558
far above the ocean floor.

181
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,723
More nomads - flying fish.
They seem to be

182
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:20,957
on every large predator's menu,

183
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,676
so their whole life is spent
on the run in the open ocean.

184
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:29,638
They don't scatter their eggs

185
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:33,277
but lay them on pieces of flotsam
like this palm frond.

186
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,637
if the quality of water is right,

187
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:40,275
they will attach their eggs
to the frond

188
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:44,599
which will then serve as a kind
of life-raft for their offspring.

189
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:49,358
But it's not only flying fish
that seek nurseries.

190
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,282
Any piece of floating debris

191
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,917
can serve as a shelter
under which baby fish can hide.

192
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,766
The only drawback

193
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:08,077
is that predators like this wahoo

194
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:11,239
check up on who's hanging about
in the shadows.

195
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,400
The wahoo may trail the flotsam
for weeks.

196
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:24,442
Few bits of flotsam
are without their quota of lodgers,

197
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,802
even man-made junk attracts them,

198
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,561
and some,
like this oceanic trigger fish,

199
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,560
defend their squatters' rights
with vigour.

200
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:44,720
The triggers, in fact, tend
to claim all the prime residences.

201
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:53,759
0ut here, even discarded netting
can provide valuable shelter,

202
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,686
so, in a bizarre twist,

203
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:57,838
a wrecked trawl net like this

204
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,077
can end up as a sanctuary for fish

205
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:02,078
until it finally sinks.

206
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:09,718
A single large piece of flotsam

207
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:13,277
can be the reason why several
square miles of open ocean,

208
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:14,846
instead of being empty,

209
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,477
will support a fish population
of hundreds of tonnes.

210
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,798
This huge clump of seaweed
is doing exactly that.

211
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,285
it's a giant kelp plant,

212
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:31,439
ripped from rocks
off the coast of California.

213
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:39,036
Now, it's floating
above thousands of metres of water,

214
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:41,675
held up by its gas-filled floats.

215
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:49,725
Young rockfish are growing up in
the safety of its shadow.

216
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:59,166
Giants also seek out
this algal flotsam.

217
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:02,926
This is a sunfish.

218
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:07,000
it can measure as much as four
metres from fin tip to fin tip.

219
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,805
Rather surprisingly,

220
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:12,357
it has the record as
the heaviest bony fish in the sea.

221
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:18,878
Sunfish spend much of their time
at depth, where they feed on jellyfish,

222
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,083
but it's cold and dark down there

223
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:25,001
so from time to time, they seek
a little rest and recuperation

224
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,158
and warm up near the surface.

225
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:30,842
They too are looking
for floating kelp plants...

226
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:33,806
not for shelter,

227
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:37,562
but because here they can find
a particular kind of fish

228
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:39,718
that only lives in such places.

229
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:45,240
Half-moon fish.

230
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:48,640
The sunfish form up

231
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:50,525
in an orderly queue.

232
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:52,518
They have a problem.

233
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,996
Their skin is covered in parasites.

234
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,676
The hungry half-moons will help.

235
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:10,238
The sunfish turn their heads

236
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:14,161
as a clear invitation
to their personal hygienists.

237
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:18,161
The half-moons nip off and eat
every parasite they can find.

238
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:38,157
if the half-moons don't do the job,

239
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:42,161
there is another rather
drastic treatment available here.

240
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,561
Gulls rest on the floating kelp...

241
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:51,120
and if the sunfish
send the right signals,

242
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:54,040
the gulls will investigate.

243
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:03,917
Their beaks can dig out
the most stubborn parasites.

244
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:27,685
But even the very best
of health clinics

245
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:30,441
can only trade
on a temporary basis.

246
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:32,723
The seaweed rafts are rotting

247
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:35,560
and will eventually lose
their buoyancy.

248
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:45,959
Then their lodgers
will have to find a new home.

249
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:48,402
if they can't, they will be eaten

250
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:49,966
or die

251
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:52,004
and sink down into the abyss.

252
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:08,005
But the open ocean is not entirely
devoid of permanent shelter.

253
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,761
A volcano is erupting
from the sea floor

254
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:17,918
and it's still growing.

255
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:54,038
it has formed an island

256
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:56,960
some 70 miles
from the coast of New Zealand.

257
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:03,639
Some juvenile
reef fish have already arrived,

258
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:05,877
carried here by a lucky current.

259
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:09,198
Now they are growing up
in the shelter of the weeds

260
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,358
around the island's fringes.

261
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:21,681
More plankton and juvenile fish
are being swept by currents

262
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,838
straight towards the island,

263
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:26,521
but now there's
a welcoming committee.

264
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:34,038
Schools of trevally and blue maomao
are patrolling the surface water.

265
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:43,718
All are in search of a meal.

266
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:51,604
These one-kilo fish

267
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,520
snap up every morsel
of plankton they find.

268
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:07,566
At times, the currents
sweeping in from the open ocean

269
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:12,357
bring with them all kinds of small
creatures in dense concentrations.

270
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:14,563
These are mysid shrimps.

271
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:51,757
Very little that is edible
is left after such feasts.

272
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:55,317
islands are far from being
safe havens for plankton.

273
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:03,238
The Pacific 0cean, however,

274
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:05,875
is peppered
with over 23,000 islands,

275
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:09,960
as well as countless other
submerged mountains - sea mounts -

276
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:12,641
whose summits do not break
the surface.

277
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:17,641
juvenile fish
for their first few months

278
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,037
would do well to avoid such places.

279
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:25,880
These yellow-fin tuna, however,
are now more than six months old

280
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,038
and 40 centimetres long -

281
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,243
big enough to be able to eat fry,

282
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:34,797
so sea mounts for them
are promising feeding grounds

283
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:37,481
where they may hunt
for several months.

284
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:45,725
The base of a sea mount.

285
00:28:45,887 --> 00:28:47,878
As currents sweep towards it,

286
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:50,720
they're deflected
up its towering walls.

287
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:59,677
The water coming from the depths

288
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:03,237
carries both nutrients
and plankton to the surface.

289
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,398
Numerous reef fish
take up permanent residence,

290
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:14,604
feeding where the currents
are strongest

291
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:16,758
and the plankton most dense.

292
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:30,040
Where the cold water mixes
with warmer water at the surface,

293
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:32,721
there's a strange,
shimmering effect -

294
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:36,277
a clear sign that the currents
are running strongly.

295
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,796
But these currents attract
more than just coastal fish.

296
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:02,966
Giants come here
from the open ocean -

297
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:08,040
hammerhead sharks,
and in great numbers.

298
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:15,760
During the day,

299
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:20,284
they circle the sea mount looking
for small fish at the reef edges...

300
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:23,166
but not in order to eat them.

301
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,085
They, like the sunfish,

302
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:29,842
are looking for cleaners
to rid them of their parasites.

303
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:37,437
White-tip reef sharks
gather here, too.

304
00:30:37,607 --> 00:30:39,757
They D0 eat reef fish...

305
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,807
but they prefer to hunt at night,

306
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:55,118
when the reef fish are sleepy
and easier to catch.

307
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:57,318
Far better to rest by day

308
00:30:57,487 --> 00:31:00,160
and allow the cleaners
to do their work.

309
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:11,638
Even swarms of breeding trigger
aren't a serious temptation.

310
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:24,200
These triggers spend
much of their time in open water,

311
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:27,080
but they've come to the sea mount
to spawn.

312
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:37,678
Trigger eggs are good food,

313
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:40,680
and the planton feeders
gather what they can

314
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:43,122
before the current
sweeps them away.

315
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:47,200
This community is here because
of the nutrients and plankton

316
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:50,404
the sea mount deflected
into the surface waters.

317
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,965
But ocean-going hunters

318
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:56,606
are never far away.

319
00:31:59,527 --> 00:32:02,246
Silky sharks specialise
in picking off injured fish

320
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:05,683
and constantly check over
the residents around the sea mount.

321
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:11,485
At some times of the year,

322
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:15,879
seasonal changes make the currents
especially rich in nutrients,

323
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:20,006
and the ocean around the sea mount
becomes a virtual soup of plankton.

324
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:32,276
At such times, hunters gather
in astonishing numbers.

325
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:44,886
Bonito, smaller relatives
of the tuna.

326
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:48,596
They are searching
for still smaller plankton feeders

327
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,201
that have been attracted
by the bloom.

328
00:32:53,247 --> 00:32:54,760
So are these jacks,

329
00:32:54,927 --> 00:32:57,282
and their prey is nearby.

330
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:05,436
A school of anchovetta
has strayed up near the surface,

331
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:09,520
even though it's broad daylight
and hunters are on the prowl.

332
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:14,446
These small fish

333
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:18,680
can already feel the vibrations
of the approaching predators.

334
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:21,919
Swimming at speed,
they have formed into a ball,

335
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,760
and now they must wait
for whatever comes.

336
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:35,245
They've been detected.

337
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:53,286
At first, the sheer scale
of the bait ball

338
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:55,438
seems to daunt the predators...

339
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:12,879
but now the bonito arrive
and launch the first attack.

340
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,676
Still the bait ball holds together.

341
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:32,877
The young yellow-fin tuna move in.

342
00:34:33,047 --> 00:34:35,277
The speed of this attack
is so great

343
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:39,679
that groups of anchovetta are
splintered from the main fish ball.

344
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:44,047
Before long,
the currents will shift,

345
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:46,516
and the ocean will become once more

346
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,360
a blue tropical desert,
plankton-free,

347
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,995
and the hunters
will have to move on.

348
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:04,399
Spinner dolphins,
still searching for food.

349
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:15,679
Their twisting leaps are,
apparently, purely social displays.

350
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:20,318
Since the hunting has been good,
many hundred have gathered together

351
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:22,478
in this exuberant super-pod.

352
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:29,920
But now the spinners
are starting to hunt once more.

353
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:38,119
Their skill in tracking food
is not a secret.

354
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:40,437
Yellow-fin tuna must be aware of it,

355
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:42,677
for they regularly follow them,

356
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:46,283
but only adult tuna in their
second or third year of life

357
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:50,759
have sufficient stamina to keep up
with the fast-moving spinners.

358
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:10,846
These are another kind -
common dolphin.

359
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:13,123
They too are on the move.

360
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:18,922
As they travel - ever inquisitive -
they pay a call

361
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:22,159
on one of their larger relations,
a pilot whale.

362
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,878
The whale is not hunting.

363
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:29,960
it's on its way to its breeding
grounds in the Mediterranean.

364
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:33,437
Pilot whales normally hunt
in small family groups,

365
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:38,317
but in mid-summer they head
for traditional socialising grounds,

366
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:42,275
where they will assemble in
super-herds several hundred strong.

367
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:45,959
Already, two families
have joined together.

368
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:49,597
The males are competing
for the favours of the females.

369
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:22,046
As the weeks pass by,

370
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:26,246
these group rubbing sessions
will become more overtly sexual,

371
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,841
but now
it's just flirting in the sun.

372
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:52,877
Timing in the ocean can be crucial.

373
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:57,120
in summer, the northern Atlantic
waters are beginning to warm.

374
00:39:57,287 --> 00:39:59,278
The hunting is good here,

375
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:00,960
and by june,

376
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:05,279
predators from southern waters
are heading towards the Azores.

377
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:16,675
These are more common dolphin.

378
00:40:23,527 --> 00:40:27,759
Like most oceanic dolphins,
they too often travel in huge herds

379
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,441
containing many different families.

380
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:39,919
There is seldom enough prey in any
one place to feed such numbers...

381
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:47,601
so small groups leave the super-pod

382
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:50,076
and set off on hunting expeditions.

383
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:56,237
This group will be away
from the main herd for many hours.

384
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:10,242
By midday, they're nearing
the islands of the Azores,

385
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:13,717
900 miles west
of the Portuguese coast.

386
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:21,040
0ther hunters are already here -
Cory's shearwaters.

387
00:41:27,647 --> 00:41:31,401
Half a million of these birds
breed on the Azores every year

388
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:33,876
and scour the nearby ocean
for food.

389
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:37,437
There's insufficient wind
to support gliding flight,

390
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:41,282
and since flapping is a waste
of energy, they sit out the calm,

391
00:41:41,447 --> 00:41:44,598
clustered in rafts
and riding the gentle swells.

392
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:05,766
By mid-afternoon, the dolphin
are starting to hunt in earnest.

393
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:14,765
As the sea breeze picks up,

394
00:42:14,927 --> 00:42:17,600
the shearwaters
take to the air once more.

395
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:30,879
0ut to sea,
the dolphin have found prey.

396
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:40,119
They are driving a shoal of small
mackerel up towards the surface.

397
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:50,362
The shearwaters crowd the skies,

398
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:53,087
following the dolphins' every turn.

399
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:03,885
The mackerel
are still some metres down...

400
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,443
but when the baitfish
come sufficiently close,

401
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:12,041
the airborne division
makes its move.

402
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:15,404
Far from being mere bystanders,

403
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:19,196
the shearwaters become
underwater predators themselves.

404
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:26,881
incredibly, they can dive
down to depths of several metres.

405
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:33,038
The hunting dolphin prevent the
mackerel from escaping downwards,

406
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:36,085
and both predators
gorge themselves.

407
00:44:01,247 --> 00:44:04,717
Soon, the diving birds
outnumber the dolphin

408
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:07,640
and even drive them away
from their meal...

409
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:12,835
but another squadron of predators
arrives to replace the dolphin -

410
00:44:13,807 --> 00:44:15,957
adult yellow-fin tuna.

411
00:44:18,327 --> 00:44:20,682
These are giants, two metres long.

412
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:30,078
They are heading
directly for the bait ball.

413
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:30,841
Despite the arrival
of the giant fish,

414
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:35,000
the shearwater continue
to press home their attack unfazed.

415
00:45:51,807 --> 00:45:53,684
Eventually, the tuna move on,

416
00:45:53,847 --> 00:45:57,283
leaving the shearwaters
to battle among themselves.

417
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:09,081
As long as a predatory fish
or a dolphin remains at the scene,

418
00:46:09,247 --> 00:46:11,636
the mackerel can't escape to safety,

419
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:15,197
but when the little skipjack tuna
start to move away,

420
00:46:15,367 --> 00:46:19,440
gradually the bait ball sinks
into the depths towards safety.

421
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:32,077
The shearwaters follow it down

422
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:35,557
to the very limit
of their breath-holding ability,

423
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:37,718
perhaps as deep as 15 metres.

424
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:48,075
At last, even they are forced
to leave their quarry.

425
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:02,324
However good or bad
this summer's feeding may be,

426
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,285
within three months,
winter will be on its way

427
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:09,440
and the temperature of these waters
will drop by a few degrees.

428
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:13,361
Then the ocean hunters
will abandon the Azores once more.

429
00:47:13,527 --> 00:47:15,518
As ever, they will move on,

430
00:47:15,687 --> 00:47:18,599
searching for another
feeding opportunity -

431
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:23,079
the next pulse of life in the distant
reaches of the open ocean.
