1
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:37,757
Dwarfed by the vast expanse
of the open ocean,

2
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:41,476
the biggest animal
that has ever lived on our planet.

3
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:53,077
A blue whale, 30 metres long
and weighing over 200 tonnes.

4
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:56,796
it's far bigger
than even the biggest dinosaur.

5
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:01,598
its tongue weighs
as much as an elephant.

6
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,758
its heart is the size of a car,

7
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:07,124
and some of its blood vessels
are so wide

8
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:09,278
that you could swim down them.

9
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,605
its tail alone

10
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:16,077
is the width
of a small aircraft's wings.

11
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:36,558
its streamlining,
close to perfection,

12
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:38,843
enables it to cruise at 20 knots.

13
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:42,204
it's one of the fastest animals
in the sea.

14
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:48,442
The ocean's largest inhabitant

15
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:51,997
feeds almost exclusively
on one of the smallest -

16
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:55,603
krill, a crustacean
just a few centimetres long.

17
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,198
Gathered in a shoal,

18
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:03,438
krill stain the sea red,

19
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:07,600
and a single blue whale in a day
can consume 40 million of them.

20
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:19,239
Despite the enormous size
of blue whales,

21
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,398
we know very little about them.

22
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,559
Their migration routes
are still a mystery,

23
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,844
and we have absolutely no idea
where they go to breed.

24
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,518
They are a dramatic reminder

25
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,678
of how much we still have to learn

26
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:39,237
about the ocean and the creatures
that live there.

27
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,562
0ur planet is a blue planet.

28
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,958
0ver 70 per cent of it
is covered by the sea.

29
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:53,802
The Pacific 0cean alone
covers half the globe.

30
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:57,164
You can fly across it non-stop
for 12 hours

31
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:00,478
and still see nothing more
than a speck of land.

32
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,279
This series will reveal

33
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:06,644
the complete natural history
of our ocean planet

34
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:11,039
from its familiar shores to
the mysteries of its deepest seas.

35
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:24,278
By volume, the ocean makes up

36
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:27,519
97 per cent of the earth's
inhabitable space,

37
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:30,326
and the sheer quantity
of its marine life

38
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:33,160
far exceeds that
which inhabits the land.

39
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:59,884
But life in the ocean is not
evenly spread. it's regulated

40
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:03,039
by the path of currents
carrying nutrients,

41
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:05,277
and the varying power of the sun.

42
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:11,156
in this first programme, we will
see how these two forces interact

43
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:13,318
to control the distribution of life

44
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,877
from the coral seas
to the polar wastes.

45
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:14,285
The sheer physical power
of the ocean

46
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,244
dominates our planet.

47
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:35,676
it profoundly influences
the weather of all the world.

48
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:40,477
Water vapour rising from it forms
the clouds and generates the storms

49
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:43,115
that ultimately
will drench the land.

50
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:05,279
The great waves that roar in
towards the shores

51
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:08,439
are dramatic demonstrations
of its power.

52
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,966
Waves originate far out at sea.

53
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:29,563
There, even gentle breezes
can cause ripples,

54
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:32,002
and ripples grow into swells.

55
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:44,521
0ut in the open ocean,
unimpeded by land,

56
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,406
such swells can become gigantic.

57
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:13,480
it's only when an ocean swell
eventually reaches shallow water

58
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,638
that it starts to break.

59
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:26,640
As it approaches the coast,
the water at the bottom of the swell

60
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:29,367
is slowed by contact
with the seabed.

61
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:32,519
The top of the swell,
still travelling fast,

62
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,485
starts to roll over
and so the wave breaks.

63
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:11,200
The ocean never rests. Huge currents,
such as the Gulf Stream,

64
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:15,121
keep its waters constantly
on the move all round the globe.

65
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,279
it's these currents
more than any other factor

66
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:22,599
that control the distribution
of nutrients and life in the seas.

67
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,602
A tiny island lost
in the midst of the Pacific.

68
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,758
it's the tip of a huge mountain

69
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,602
that rises from the sea floor
thousands of metres below.

70
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:43,044
The nearest land is 300 miles away.

71
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:49,760
isolated sea mounts like this one

72
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,566
create oases
where life can flourish

73
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:56,276
in the comparatively empty expanses
of the open ocean.

74
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:08,675
But all the creatures that swim
beside it would not be here

75
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,997
were it not for one key factor -

76
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,964
the deep ocean currents.

77
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:23,080
Far below the surface,
they collide with the island's flanks

78
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:25,397
and are deflected upwards,

79
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:29,526
bringing with them from the depths
a rich soup of nutrients.

80
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:35,599
Such up-wellings attract
great concentrations of life.

81
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:46,519
Most of the fish here
are permanent residents

82
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:50,475
feeding on plankton -
tiny floating plants and animals

83
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:54,117
nourished by the richness
brought up from the depths,

84
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:57,165
and they attract visitors
from the open ocean.

85
00:09:58,447 --> 00:09:59,766
Tuna.

86
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,599
The plankton feeders
are easy targets.

87
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:42,962
All this action attracts
even larger predators.

88
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,080
Sharks.

89
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:53,484
Hundreds of sharks.

90
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:59,642
These silky sharks
are normally ocean-going species,

91
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:02,605
but the sea mounts
in the eastern Pacific

92
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:05,201
like Cocos, Mapelo
and the Galapagos,

93
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:09,519
attract silkies in huge groups
up to 500 strong.

94
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:16,883
Silkies seem to specialise
in taking injured fish

95
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,197
and constantly circle sea mounts

96
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:22,086
on the look out for the chance
to do so.

97
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,475
But silkies are not
the only visitors.

98
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:37,326
Hammerheads gather
in some of the largest shark shoals

99
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:39,637
to be found anywhere in the ocean.

100
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:43,641
Sometimes, thousands will circle
over a single sea mount.

101
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:51,086
But these sharks are not here
for food.

102
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:53,397
They have come for another reason.

103
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,326
Some of the locals
provide a cleaning service.

104
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:05,962
Following the last El Nino year,

105
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:10,678
when a rise in water temperatures
gave many sharks fungal infections,

106
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:13,884
the number of hammerheads
visiting the sea mounts

107
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,844
reached record levels.

108
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,040
Nutrients also well up
to the surface

109
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,516
along the coasts of the continents.

110
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:36,921
This is Natal
on South Africa's eastern seaboard.

111
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,566
it's june,

112
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:42,402
and just off-shore,
strange black patches have appeared.

113
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:49,363
They look like immense oil slicks
up to a mile long.

114
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,081
But this is a living slick:

115
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:58,399
millions and millions of sardines
on a marine migration

116
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,558
that in terms of sheer biomass,

117
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:04,481
rivals that of the wildebeest
on the grasslands of Africa.

118
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,755
These fish live mostly
in the cold waters south of the Cape,

119
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:14,999
but each year
the coastal currents reverse.

120
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:19,126
The warm Agulhas current
that flows down from the north

121
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:22,359
has been displaced
by cold water from the south,

122
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,995
and that has brought up
rich nutrients.

123
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:28,477
They in turn have created
a bloom of plankton,

124
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,926
and the sardines
are now feasting on it.

125
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:42,918
As the sardines travel north,

126
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:45,920
a whole caravan of predators
follow them.

127
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,404
Thousands of Cape gannets
track the sardines.

128
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,639
They nested off the Cape
and timed their breeding

129
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:58,082
so that their newly-fledged chicks

130
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:00,715
can join them
in pursuing the shoals.

131
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:11,838
Below water, hundreds of sharks
have also joined the caravan.

132
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,520
These are bronze whaler sharks,

133
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:21,600
a cold water species that
normally lives much further south.

134
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,922
These three-metre sharks

135
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:32,318
cut such great swathes
through the sardine shoals

136
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:35,160
that their tracks
are visible from the air.

137
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:37,318
Harried by packs of predators

138
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:40,479
and swept in
by the action of the waves,

139
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,798
the sardine shoals are penned
close to the shore.

140
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:05,801
Common dolphin are coming in
from the open ocean to join the feast.

141
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:22,318
There are over a thousand of them

142
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,478
in this one school.

143
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:36,642
When they catch up with the sardines,
the action really begins.

144
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:44,646
Working together, they drive
the shoal towards the surface.

145
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:56,805
it's easier for the dolphins
to snatch fish up here.

146
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:13,600
Now the sardines have no escape.

147
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,638
Thanks to the dolphins,

148
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:30,880
the sardines have come within
the diving range of the gannets.

149
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:44,885
Hundreds of white arrows
shoot into the sea,

150
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,517
leaving long trails of bubbles
behind each dive.

151
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,321
Next to join the frenzy
are the sharks.

152
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:19,076
Sharks get very excited
when dolphins are around.

153
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,317
They can feed particularly well

154
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:24,240
once the dolphins
have driven the sardines

155
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:27,160
into more compact groups
near the surface.

156
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:34,475
As the frenzy continues,
walls of bubbles drift upwards.

157
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:39,767
They are being released
by the dolphins

158
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:41,918
working together in teams.

159
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:46,005
They use the bubbles

160
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:49,284
to corral the sardines
into ever tighter groups.

161
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:55,519
The sardines seldom cross
the wall of bubbles

162
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,678
and crowd closer together.

163
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,844
Bubble netting in this way,

164
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:07,046
enables the dolphins to grab
every last trapped sardine.

165
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:21,479
just when the feasting
seems to be almost over,

166
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,444
a Bryde's whale.

167
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:30,076
The survivors head on northwards,

168
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:33,045
and the caravan of predators
follows them.

169
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:44,836
Nutrients can also be brought up,
though less predictably,

170
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,998
by rough weather.

171
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:55,316
Particularly near the poles,
huge storms stir the depths

172
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,796
and enrich the surface waters,

173
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:59,958
and here, in the South Atlantic,

174
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:02,766
the seas are the roughest
on the planet.

175
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:08,318
And very rich seas they are, too,

176
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:11,797
for here, the cold Falklands
current from the south

177
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:14,879
meets the warm Brazil current
from the north,

178
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:17,720
and at their junction
is food in abundance.

179
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:23,116
These black-browed albatross
are duck-diving for krill

180
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,960
that has been driven up
to the surface.

181
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,844
Like all albatross,

182
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:34,920
black-brows are wanderers
across the face of the open ocean.

183
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:53,124
A feeding assembly on this scale
is a rare sight.

184
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:57,360
Most of the time, the birds
of the open sea are widely dispersed,

185
00:19:57,527 --> 00:20:01,998
but these feeding grounds are close
to an albatross breeding colony,

186
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,998
and a very special one.

187
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,078
This is Steeple jason,

188
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,319
a remote island
in the far west of the Falklands.

189
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:21,559
it has the largest albatross colony
in the world.

190
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:33,204
There are almost
half a million albatross here,

191
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:37,360
an astonishing demonstration
of how fertile the ocean can be

192
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,518
and how much food it can give

193
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:42,838
even to creatures
that do not actually live in it.

194
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,358
Nutrients by themselves

195
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,758
are not enough to generate
these vast assemblies.

196
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:16,999
The heat and light from the sun
is also essential

197
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:20,477
for the growth of the microscopic
floating plants -

198
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,797
the phytoplankton.

199
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:31,282
And it's the phytoplankton that is
the basis of all life in the ocean.

200
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:41,680
Every evening, the disappearance
of the sun below the horizon

201
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:44,645
triggers the largest
migration of life

202
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,798
that takes place on our planet.

203
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:57,277
0ne thousand million tonnes
of sea creatures

204
00:21:57,447 --> 00:22:01,440
ascend from the deep ocean to
search for food near the surface.

205
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:12,400
They graze on the phytoplankton
under cover of darkness.

206
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,161
Even so, they are far from safe.

207
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:17,557
0ther marine hunters follow them,

208
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:20,958
some travelling up
from hundreds of metres below.

209
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:21,320
At dawn,

210
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:25,526
the whole procession returns
to the safety of the dark depths.

211
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:36,317
The moon, too, has a great
influence on life in the oceans.

212
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:39,882
its gravitational pull

213
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:43,483
creates the daily advances
and retreats of the tide.

214
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,159
But the moon has more
than a daily cycle.

215
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:02,559
Each month, it waxes and wanes
as it travels round the earth,

216
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:06,561
and this monthly cycle
also triggers events in the ocean.

217
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:12,321
The Pacific coast of Costa Rica

218
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,478
on a very special night.

219
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:18,845
it's just after midnight
and the tide is coming in.

220
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:25,561
The moon is in its last quarter,

221
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:28,799
exactly half way
between full and new.

222
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:33,880
For weeks,
the beach has been empty,

223
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:36,038
but that is about to change.

224
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:40,280
At high tide, turtles
start to emerge from the surf.

225
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:48,479
At first, they come
in ones and twos,

226
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:50,558
but within an hour,

227
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:53,719
they are appearing
all along the beach.

228
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:01,965
They are all female
Ridley's turtles,

229
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,118
and over the next six days or so,

230
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:07,643
400,000 will visit this one beach

231
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:09,798
to lay their eggs in the sand.

232
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:22,163
At the peak time, 5,000
are coming and going every hour.

233
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:25,080
The top of the beach
gets so crowded

234
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:28,842
that they have to clamber
over one another to find a patch

235
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:30,998
where they can dig a nest hole.

236
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:39,762
A quarter of the world's population
of Ridley's turtles

237
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:43,476
come to this one beach
on a few key nights each year.

238
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:45,638
The rest of the time,

239
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:48,879
they are widely distributed
through the ocean,

240
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:51,478
most, hundreds of miles away.

241
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:56,323
This mass nesting is called
an arribada. How it's co-ordinated

242
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:58,478
is a mystery,

243
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:00,877
but we do know that arribadas start

244
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:04,437
when the moon is either
in its first or last quarter.

245
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:15,720
Forty million eggs are laid
in just a few days.

246
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:19,516
By synchronising their nesting,
the females ensure

247
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:22,884
that six weeks later,
their hatchlings will emerge

248
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:25,038
in such enormous numbers

249
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:27,596
that predators are overwhelmed,

250
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:32,682
and a significant proportion of baby
turtles will make it to the water.

251
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,436
But why do the females
use a cue from the moon

252
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:40,916
to help synchronise their nesting?

253
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:43,078
Part of the answer to that

254
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:46,444
becomes clear at dawn
on the following morning.

255
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:11,319
The day shift of predators
are arriving for their first meals.

256
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:18,478
Vultures have learnt

257
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:22,879
that the returning tide can wash
freshly laid eggs out of the sand.

258
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:28,324
The risk of eggs being exposed
by the surf

259
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:31,559
may be partly why
turtle arribadas tend to occur

260
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:34,719
around the last or first quarter
of the moon.

261
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:43,042
it's on such days as this when
the moon is neither full nor new,

262
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:47,041
that the tides are weakest
and the sea is likely to be calmer.

263
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:06,636
So it's easier for the female turtles
to make their way through the surf,

264
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:09,799
and harder for eggs
to be washed out of the sand

265
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:11,798
and taken by vultures.

266
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:27,320
The moon's monthly cycle
and its influence on the tides

267
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:29,717
triggers many events in the ocean,

268
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:33,482
from the spawning of the corals
on the Great Barrier reef

269
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:35,638
to the breeding cycles of fish,

270
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:37,957
but there's an even longer rhythm

271
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:40,721
that has the most profound effect
of all -

272
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,878
the annual cycle of the sun.

273
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:47,601
The sun's position
relative to the earth

274
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,758
changes through the year,

275
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:52,521
and it's this
that produces the seasons.

276
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,484
in the north, spring comes

277
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:57,480
as the sun begins to rise
higher in the sky.

278
00:28:58,287 --> 00:29:00,721
0ff the coast
of north west America,

279
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:05,165
the seas are transformed by
the increasing strength of the sun.

280
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:13,443
Here in Alaska,
the coastal waters turn green

281
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:16,075
with a sudden bloom
of phytoplankton.

282
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:22,159
Herring that have spent the winter
far out to sea

283
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:26,878
time their return to the shallow
waters to coincide with this bloom.

284
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:29,083
They come in vast numbers

285
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:33,365
and initiate one of the most productive
food chains in all the oceans.

286
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,836
Humpback whales
are at the top of that food chain.

287
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:53,998
They have spent the winter

288
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,477
breeding in the warmer
tropical waters off Hawaii,

289
00:29:57,647 --> 00:29:59,638
but there was little food there.

290
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:01,798
This herring bonanza

291
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,243
provides the majority of their food
for the year.

292
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:27,476
Stellar and Californian sea lions

293
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:32,163
also return from the open ocean
each year to feast off the herring.

294
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:46,281
The herring, however,
have not come here for food.

295
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:49,484
They are about to breed.
Nothing deters them

296
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,798
as they head
for even shallower waters.

297
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:56,438
Now the waters are so shallow

298
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,484
that glaucous-winged gulls

299
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:01,684
can snatch live fish
from just below the surface.

300
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:16,085
in spite of these attacks,
the herring swim on

301
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:18,363
until they reach the vegetation

302
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:21,166
that the females need
if they are to lay.

303
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:30,438
Each female produces
around 20,000 eggs,

304
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:32,916
and they're very sticky.

305
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:40,880
After the females have spawned,
the males release their sperm

306
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:43,038
in vast, milky clouds.

307
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:52,006
Soon, the excesses
of the herrings' sexual spree

308
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:55,637
creates a thick white scum
on the surface.

309
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:59,038
Through the season,

310
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:02,597
curds of sperm clog the shores
for hundreds of miles

311
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:06,442
from British Columbia in the south
to Alaska in the north.

312
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:16,885
After a few days, this gigantic
spawning comes to an end,

313
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:20,039
and the herring
head back out to deeper waters,

314
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,596
leaving behind them fertilised eggs

315
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:25,998
plastered on every rock
and strand of vegetation.

316
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:41,806
They time the spawning so that two
weeks later, when the eggs hatch,

317
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:46,085
the annual plankton bloom will be
at its height, and the fish fry

318
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:48,238
will have plenty to eat.

319
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:50,716
in the meantime,
these eggs provide food

320
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:54,197
for armies of different animals
below and above the surface.

321
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:06,518
Millions of birds arrive to collect
a share of the herrings' bounty.

322
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:08,678
Some of it is easily gathered,

323
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:12,396
for millions of eggs have been
washed up onto the shore.

324
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:15,278
This encapsulated energy

325
00:33:15,447 --> 00:33:19,076
is particularly valuable
to migrating birds.

326
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,317
These surfbirds are on their way

327
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:25,958
to their breeding grounds in
the Arctic and come down to refuel.

328
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:29,199
Stranded herring eggs
are just what they need.

329
00:33:31,247 --> 00:33:33,283
Bonaparte gulls collect the eggs

330
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:35,642
just below the surface
of the water.

331
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:42,155
Further out in the bay,
huge flocks of ducks have gathered.

332
00:33:42,327 --> 00:33:44,283
They're mostly surf scoters -

333
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:48,440
diving ducks that can feed
off the bottom several metres down.

334
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:55,279
There are such huge quantities
of eggs,

335
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,438
that even a big animal like a bear

336
00:33:57,607 --> 00:33:59,962
finds it worthwhile
to collect them.

337
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:06,597
The spawning of the herring
is a crucial event

338
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:09,839
in the lives of many animals
all along the coast.

339
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,317
The whole event coincides
with the plankton bloom,

340
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:16,240
and within three short weeks,
it's all over.

341
00:34:21,287 --> 00:34:25,565
The migratory birds leave
to continue their journey north.

342
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:37,080
They will not come back until
the herring also return next year.

343
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:45,517
As the herring spawning finishes,

344
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:48,884
other migrants
are starting to arrive offshore.

345
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:53,084
Grey whales.

346
00:34:57,807 --> 00:34:59,957
They have followed the sun north,

347
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:02,357
and they too are seeking the food

348
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:05,519
generated by the bloom
of the phytoplankton.

349
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:12,519
Krill are feeding off it, and these
whales are feeding on the krill,

350
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:16,600
skimming it from the surface
with the filter plates of baleen

351
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,837
that hang from their upper jaws.

352
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:23,279
Grey whales make
one of the longest migrations

353
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:25,403
of any marine mammal -

354
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:28,127
a round trip of 12,000 miles or so

355
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:31,279
from their breeding grounds
off Mexico

356
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:35,599
along the entire coast of North
America up to the Arctic 0cean.

357
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:40,318
They travel close to the coast,

358
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:44,162
with the males and non-breeding
females leading the way.

359
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:48,923
The last to start are cows
that have just given birth.

360
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:53,080
They have to wait until their calves
are sufficiently strong

361
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:55,283
to tackle such an immense journey.

362
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,285
Their progress is necessarily slow.

363
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:01,517
The mothers stay with their young,

364
00:36:01,687 --> 00:36:05,157
and even a strong calf
only travels at a couple of knots.

365
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,276
They stick even closer
to the shore,

366
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,438
often within just 200 metres.

367
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,005
Killer whales.

368
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:21,160
They have learnt that grey whales
follow traditional routes.

369
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,318
The killers have no trouble

370
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:27,082
in overtaking the calf
and its devoted mother.

371
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:34,118
Normally, they continually call
to one another,

372
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:36,562
but now they have fallen silent.

373
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,718
The grey whale and her calf

374
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:41,879
have no idea
that they've been targeted.

375
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:06,318
Catching up with the grey whales
is the easy part for the killers.

376
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:08,079
They have to be cautious

377
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:11,444
for they are only
about half the size of the mother.

378
00:37:14,927 --> 00:37:18,124
She can inflict real damage
with her tail.

379
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:29,557
But the killers are after her calf.

380
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:33,606
As long as the mother can keep it
on the move, it will be safe,

381
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,884
and she does her best
to hurry it along.

382
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:44,122
At first, the killers avoid getting
too close but just stay alongside.

383
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:49,077
They know that the calf, going at
this speed, will eventually tire.

384
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:01,282
After three hours of being harried,

385
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:04,757
the calf becomes too exhausted
to swim any further.

386
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,918
The mother has to stop.

387
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:10,477
This is the moment the killers
have been waiting for.

388
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:14,960
They start to try and force
themselves between mother and calf.

389
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:39,959
A calf separated from its mother
will not be able to defend itself.

390
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:43,119
Time and again,
the black fins of the killers

391
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,482
appear between the grey whales.

392
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:58,478
At last the killers succeed,

393
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:01,639
and now they've got the calf
on its own,

394
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,798
they change their tactics.

395
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:07,357
They leap right onto the calf,
and try to push it under.

396
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:20,278
They are trying to drown it.

397
00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:33,439
The calf snatches
a desperate breath.

398
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:48,999
The mother becomes
increasingly agitated.

399
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:52,921
Frantically, she tries to push
her calf back to the surface

400
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:55,078
so that it can breathe.

401
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,318
But now it's so exhausted

402
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:02,559
that it has to be supported
by its mother's body.

403
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:21,398
The killers won't give up.

404
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:25,560
Like a pack of wolves, they take
turns in harassing the whales.

405
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:48,847
Now, the whole pod is involved.

406
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,646
0ne of them takes a bite.

407
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:17,723
Soon, the sea is reddened
with the calf's blood,

408
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:20,879
and the killers close in
for the final act.

409
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,004
The calf is dead.

410
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:50,278
After a six-hour hunt,

411
00:41:50,447 --> 00:41:53,644
the killer whales
have finally won their prize.

412
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:01,078
The mother, bereft,

413
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:04,284
has to continue her migration north
on her own.

414
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:11,679
She leaves behind
the carcass of a calf

415
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:15,476
that she cherished for 13 months
in her womb,

416
00:42:15,647 --> 00:42:19,037
for which she delayed
her own journey to find food.

417
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:26,119
The 15 killer whales spent over
six hours trying to kill the calf,

418
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:28,403
but having succeeded,

419
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:33,322
they've eaten nothing more
than its lower jaw and its tongue.

420
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:45,360
Valuable food like this
will not go to waste in the ocean.

421
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:48,917
Before long, the carcass
will sink to the very bottom

422
00:42:49,087 --> 00:42:50,759
of this deep sea,

423
00:42:50,927 --> 00:42:53,919
but even there its flesh
will not be wasted.

424
00:42:56,727 --> 00:43:00,561
0ver a mile down, in the total
darkness of the deep ocean,

425
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:02,922
the body of another grey whale,

426
00:43:03,087 --> 00:43:04,566
a 30-tonne adult.

427
00:43:04,727 --> 00:43:07,764
it settled here
only a few weeks ago.

428
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:13,124
Already, it has attracted
hundreds of hagfish.

429
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:23,359
These scavengers, over half a metre
long and as thick as your arm,

430
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:26,041
are only found in the deep sea.

431
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:29,643
They have been attracted
by the faint whiff of decay

432
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:33,004
suffusing through the water
for miles around.

433
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:39,404
With their heads buried
in the whale's flesh,

434
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:43,242
they breathe through gill openings
along their sides.

435
00:43:43,407 --> 00:43:45,716
They're very primitive creatures -

436
00:43:45,887 --> 00:43:48,879
not even true fish
for they lack jaws.

437
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:51,038
They feed, not by biting,

438
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:54,802
but by rasping off flesh
with two rows of horny teeth.

439
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:58,558
in just a few hours,

440
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:02,800
a hagfish can eat several times
its own weight of rotting flesh.

441
00:44:05,887 --> 00:44:07,878
Next to arrive,

442
00:44:08,047 --> 00:44:10,038
a sleeper shark.

443
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:19,404
it moves so slowly
to conserve energy -

444
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:22,718
an important strategy
for so large an animal

445
00:44:22,887 --> 00:44:25,037
surviving in such a poor habitat.

446
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:34,325
Sleeper sharks live
over a mile down,

447
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:36,842
and grow to over seven metres long.

448
00:44:39,607 --> 00:44:43,441
They can go for months
without food, slowly cruising along,

449
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:45,518
waiting for rare bonanzas

450
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:47,484
such as this one

451
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:49,444
to arrive from above.

452
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:59,284
A whole range of different
deep-sea scavengers

453
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,439
will feast on this carcass
for a long time

454
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:05,804
before all its nutriment
has been consumed.

455
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:08,679
18 months later,

456
00:45:08,847 --> 00:45:12,999
all that is left is a perfect
skeleton stripped bare.

457
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:19,839
The sun's energy, that was captured
and turned into living tissue

458
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:21,998
by the floating phytoplankton,

459
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:25,716
has been transferred
to another link in the food chain,

460
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,800
and has ended up as far away from
the sun as it is possible to be -

461
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:31,958
at the bottom of the deep sea.

462
00:45:32,127 --> 00:45:36,040
But some energy
also returns from the deep.

463
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:46,239
Millions of opalescent squid
are on their way to the shallows.

464
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:48,841
They've come up here to mate.

465
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:53,205
As the males grab the females,
their tentacles flush red.

466
00:45:55,687 --> 00:45:57,325
For most of the year,

467
00:45:57,487 --> 00:46:00,604
these squid live
at a depth of around 500 metres.

468
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:04,476
They are part of these breeding
schools for a few weeks.

469
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:07,844
just one school was estimated
to contain animals

470
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:10,316
that weigh around 4,000 tonnes.

471
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:24,244
Wave after wave
rise from the depths,

472
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,637
and soon the seabed
in the shallows

473
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:31,198
is strewn with dense patches of
egg capsules several metres across.

474
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,599
As each female
adds another capsule to the pile,

475
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:42,964
the males fight
to fertilise its contents.

476
00:46:58,287 --> 00:47:01,438
The squid make their huge journey
into the shallows

477
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:05,839
because their eggs will develop
faster in the warmer water here,

478
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:09,238
and when the young emerge,
they will find more food

479
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:12,604
more easily than they would
in the ocean depths.

480
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:18,678
Dawn the next morning,

481
00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:22,635
and the seabed for miles around
is covered in egg capsules.

482
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:26,083
The squid have all gone.
Many have died,

483
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:29,637
but some will have returned
to their home in the deep.

484
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:32,799
They will not return
to the light of the sun

485
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:36,926
until the next time they are
driven up by the urge to spawn.
