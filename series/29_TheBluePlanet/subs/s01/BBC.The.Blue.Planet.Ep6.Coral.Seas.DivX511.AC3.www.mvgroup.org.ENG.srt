1
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:37,841
in all the seas of the world,
the warm waters of the tropics

2
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:41,602
contain the richest
and most colourful communities.

3
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,005
Coral reefs.

4
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:53,557
They may seem
like underwater paradise,

5
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:58,721
but they are perpetual
battlegrounds for space.

6
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:05,040
Even the corals
have to fight for it.

7
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:12,286
in this crowded frenetic community,
every individual needs its place,

8
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,881
its own way of surviving.

9
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:25,562
None of these creatures would be
here if it were not for the coral.

10
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:53,326
A coral larva
drifts in the open sea,

11
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:56,365
floating in a soup
of young reef animals.

12
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:13,723
if just one of these coral larvae
survives in a suitable spot,

13
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:16,242
a new reef will be founded.

14
00:02:21,447 --> 00:02:28,159
in just a few days, the larva
changes form and becomes a polyp,

15
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,363
similar to a sea anemone.

16
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:36,841
identical copies bud off
and, gradually, a colony develops.

17
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:42,320
Each polyp surrounds itself
with a hard skeleton,

18
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:46,366
and, from this solid base,
begins to grow.

19
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:06,400
it increases in length
by an impressive 15cms a year.

20
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:11,402
This branching coral
is only two years old.

21
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,684
A mature reef can be thousands.

22
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,201
Corals provide the foundations

23
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:32,518
on which the entire
reef community relies.

24
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,279
Some organisms,

25
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:39,077
like the Christmas tree worms,
actually live within the coral.

26
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:49,236
0thers climb out,
away from the reef,

27
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:52,046
to filter their food
from the water.

28
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:08,316
As the community grows,

29
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:10,762
intimate relationships form,

30
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:15,284
and different creatures
become dependant on one another.

31
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,683
Even animals that spend much
of their time travelling in the ocean

32
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,407
return to the reef for a clean.

33
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:39,995
Coral reefs can be home
to astounding numbers of fish.

34
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:59,000
Here swim the smallest
and the largest fish in the sea.

35
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:09,198
Whale sharks are only visitors.

36
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:13,406
When currents bring nutrient-rich
water up from the deep,

37
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,558
they come here to feed.

38
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:27,078
All these animals are here

39
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:29,124
because of the coral.

40
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:37,165
This extraordinary complex maze
is built, layer upon layer,

41
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:41,843
by millions and millions
of individual animals -

42
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,599
polyps.

43
00:05:54,927 --> 00:06:00,081
Each polyp's flesh is supported
by a limestone skeleton.

44
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,318
Below the gut...

45
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:14,919
..is the place
where most of the growth occurs.

46
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:20,207
Here, the living tissue deposits
an intricate lattice of limestone.

47
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:28,997
Beneath that,
the limestone skeleton is bare,

48
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,364
having been vacated
by the living coral tissues.

49
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:37,476
This is the hard structure
that forms the foundation of the reef.

50
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,878
A single reef can extend
for many miles.

51
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:00,598
Coral reefs are only found
in the clear, warm,

52
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,122
shallow waters of the tropics.

53
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:11,155
Sunlight is vital to them,
even though they are animals,

54
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:17,277
because inside their flesh live
millions of tiny single-cell algae,

55
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:19,039
plants.

56
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:26,047
And all plants need sunlight
to photosynthesise sugars.

57
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:41,005
98% of the food the corals consume
is produced by the algae.

58
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:44,959
Without them,

59
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:47,436
the reef would not exist.

60
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:59,275
Like any plant, algae need
just the right amount of light.

61
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:02,086
Not too much, not too little.

62
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:10,600
The corals regulate that
with pigments that we can only see

63
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:15,045
when they are illuminated
by ultraviolet light.

64
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:54,962
Most corals, for protection,

65
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:58,676
spend the day withdrawn
into their stony fortresses.

66
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:04,046
Even then they are not safe
from the jaws of these butterfly fish.

67
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:24,682
At night, the corals take in water,

68
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:29,318
expand their tentacles
and emerge to feed.

69
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:47,762
They collect plankton.

70
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:54,205
Each tentacle has stinging cells,
which fire on contact.

71
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:59,077
0nce the prey is caught, it's passed
down to the polyp's mouth.

72
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,805
it is at night,
when the polyps are extended,

73
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:15,324
that they add to the limestone
foundations beneath them.

74
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:29,405
inevitably, the corals
begin to overgrow each other,

75
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,286
and that means trouble.

76
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,643
When neighbours get too close,

77
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,516
they detect
one another's presence chemically.

78
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:48,839
The aggressor on the right
prepares for battle.

79
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:01,160
The polyps extrude their guts

80
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,605
and simply
digest their rivals alive.

81
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,759
A no-man's-land -
a band of white skeleton -

82
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:35,637
is the only evidence
of the night's border dispute.

83
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,197
Some corals are targeted
by yet more deadly predators.

84
00:11:56,647 --> 00:12:00,879
Predators that can crawl
in search of their victims.

85
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,397
Crown of thorns starfish -

86
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:08,196
poisonous,
invincible eating machines.

87
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:14,124
They also extrude their gut
and digest coral wholesale.

88
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:32,839
But some corals have help.

89
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:37,239
Small crabs living within their
branches resist these onslaughts

90
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:40,080
and defend their home.

91
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:52,121
From beneath, they launch an attack

92
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:55,757
on the vulnerable underside
of the starfish.

93
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:15,038
Even the crown of thorns
will retreat

94
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:18,199
from such a determined attack.

95
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:21,200
This coral is left unharmed.

96
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:33,757
Humphead parrotfish,
nearly a metre and a half in length.

97
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:39,126
Their jaws are so powerful
they can bite through rock.

98
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:47,675
When they descend to feed,
the reef itself is under threat.

99
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,725
They are indiscriminate feeders,

100
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:06,915
taking both rock and coral alike
in their quest for algae.

101
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:23,283
These fish play a large part
in the erosion of the reef.

102
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:27,156
The rock and coral emerges later
as a fine sand.

103
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,923
0n a single reef, they can produce
tonnes of it every year.

104
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:49,283
This soft sand
forms the tropical beaches

105
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:51,677
that we find so alluring.

106
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:07,159
0ver time, the sand builds up
to form an island,

107
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:10,876
which is then colonised
by animals and plants.

108
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:21,003
Trees take root.

109
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,964
Birds arrive.

110
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:33,956
The guano from thousands of terns
which have chosen to nest here

111
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:39,201
enriches the sandy soil,
which then can support more plants.

112
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,160
But these terns,
like other seabirds,

113
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:46,397
depend on the ocean for their food.

114
00:15:56,127 --> 00:16:01,804
Below water, there is not only
competition for living space,

115
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:06,483
but a continual contest
between predators and prey.

116
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:17,877
it's the arms race between them
that over millions of years

117
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:22,677
has produced today's
extraordinary diversity of form.

118
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:36,240
jacks are one of the key predators
on the reef.

119
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:38,841
Their weapon is speed.

120
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:56,038
They seek silversides,
whose defence is to congregate

121
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,916
in confusing shoals
of shimmering silver.

122
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:09,518
The jacks deal with that by herding
the silversides onto the reef.

123
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:17,766
Here, the jacks
have a better chance

124
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:21,363
of separating individual fish
from the shoal.

125
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:38,522
The jacks can now catch
the isolated individuals

126
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:40,678
with lightning attacks.

127
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,124
it's far safer to be hidden
on the reef itself,

128
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:00,836
within the tunnels of a sponge,
for example.

129
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:05,637
These tiny shrimp are no bigger
than grains of rice.

130
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:12,243
These shrimps are unique.

131
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:14,398
it's recently been discovered

132
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,764
that they have
a highly-sophisticated social system,

133
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:19,599
similar to that of bees.

134
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:23,555
All members of the colony
are the offspring of one female.

135
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,879
She is the queen
and the only one to produce eggs.

136
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,564
As in a colony of bees,

137
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:43,085
different individuals are
specialised for particular tasks.

138
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,363
Some are guards and are armed

139
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:48,917
with particularly
large and powerful claws.

140
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:57,239
They are on watch at all times,
ready to tackle intruders.

141
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:14,123
A polychaete worm. For it, a sponge
is an excellent hunting ground.

142
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:36,199
in such a maze of tunnels,
attack can come at any time

143
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,358
from any quarter.

144
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:09,196
0nce the guards are alerted,
the worm loses its advantage.

145
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:20,884
Better to retreat intact
than risk serious injury.

146
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:28,802
The sponge not only makes
a safe home for the shrimps,

147
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:33,722
it also supplies them with food,
so they never need venture outside.

148
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:37,562
An establishment that provides
all their needs

149
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,525
is clearly well worth defending.

150
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,956
just as shrimps guard their home,

151
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:47,437
other animals defend
their hunting grounds.

152
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:57,641
Glassfish make tempting prey
for the redmouth grouper.

153
00:20:57,807 --> 00:21:01,277
its strategy is to swim
slowly amongst them

154
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:04,484
till they no longer see it
as a threat.

155
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:17,483
There are other fish here, too.

156
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:20,639
Lionfish are ambush predators,

157
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:26,165
taking their time
and watching for the right moment.

158
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:30,320
But there isn't room here
for two predators.

159
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:42,364
The grouper, braving the lionfish's
poisonous spines,

160
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:44,518
tries to evict its rival.

161
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:03,002
But lionfish are persistent.

162
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:08,878
This grouper spent many hours
simply defending his hunting patch.

163
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:29,003
Some animals prefer to avoid
conflict whenever possible.

164
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:33,604
These harlequin shrimp,
having captured a starfish,

165
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,156
are taking it back to a safe house

166
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:39,717
beyond the reach
of competitors and danger.

167
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:43,482
The problem is that starfish
have minds of their own

168
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:46,480
and five large sticky arms.

169
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:52,844
By the time the shrimps
have prised off one arm,

170
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:55,202
another has reattached itself.

171
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:09,764
0nly by manoeuvring
the starfish onto its back

172
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:13,442
can they have any hope
of gaining the advantage.

173
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,001
Even so, getting it back home

174
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,556
is a major undertaking.

175
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:40,044
The starfish
is now a living larder.

176
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:45,679
if the shrimps can hang onto it,
it will feed them for days to come.

177
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:48,441
The top of the reef
is usually covered

178
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:52,680
by a thin layer of green algae,
another living larder.

179
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:56,556
And many fish depend on it.

180
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:05,241
Powder blue tangs
defend their right

181
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:08,285
to graze on a particular patch.

182
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,122
But, for a larder as well stocked
as this, there is always competition.

183
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:40,724
When a shoal of convict tangs
decide to graze,

184
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:42,923
little can stop them.

185
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:54,960
The powder blue tangs
try to keep them off...

186
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:08,640
..but they are overwhelmed
by sheer numbers.

187
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:17,756
The territory is stripped of algae
in minutes.

188
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:36,876
The blue tangs appear
to be fighting a losing battle.

189
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:46,125
But, eventually,
they begin to get the upper hand.

190
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:02,596
They persist with their attacks

191
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:05,884
until the marauders
are well on their way.

192
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:25,560
When night falls, some very strange
creatures creep out of crevices

193
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:28,366
and crawl over the reef.

194
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:42,003
This moving bush is an animal -

195
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,759
a basket star -

196
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:48,523
which spreads out its arms
to catch the night's plankton.

197
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:12,766
The reef becomes
uncannily tranquil.

198
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:19,040
Fish retire, hiding themselves
where they can.

199
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:20,642
Marbled rays come out to hunt
for prey buried in the sand...

200
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:26,996
..using electro-receptors
to scan the seabed.

201
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:35,438
Their activity attracts sharks.

202
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:55,879
White tips.

203
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:24,043
At night, when vision is of little use,
sharks have a real advantage.

204
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:30,919
They can still use both smell
and electro-reception to track fish.

205
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:44,877
These sharks are also hunting
for fish concealed within the reef.

206
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:52,645
Their slender shape

207
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:57,278
enables them to squeeze
through surprisingly narrow gaps.

208
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:11,763
There is nowhere to hide.

209
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:33,717
Few animals are safe
during these feeding frenzies.

210
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:29,964
Night after night, the reef animals
are subjected to these raids.

211
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:50,885
But life on the reef
is not just about food,

212
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:53,481
it's also about sex.

213
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:58,921
There are many different
breeding strategies,

214
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:04,115
but each is aimed at maximising
the number of young that will survive.

215
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:11,120
Every afternoon for two months,
brown surgeonfish can be seen

216
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:14,040
streaming across reefs
in the Red Sea.

217
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:18,561
They all head for the same place,

218
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:21,446
usually some prominent feature.

219
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:30,286
Here, they wait
for the light to fade.

220
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:36,277
Suddenly, females within the group

221
00:32:36,447 --> 00:32:39,757
make a dash away from the reef
to release their eggs.

222
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:43,397
They're followed
by the quickest and closest males,

223
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:47,480
all of whom are striving
to fertilise the eggs.

224
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:05,723
inevitably, others come here
to feast on such easy food.

225
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,558
As the surgeonfish spawn,

226
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:17,164
fusiliers move in above
to eat the nutritious eggs.

227
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:40,561
These are just the first
of many predators which will feed

228
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,241
on the eggs and developing larvae

229
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:46,444
as they drift
during the next few weeks.

230
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:51,561
0ther fish are less casual
about their eggs.

231
00:33:57,047 --> 00:34:02,997
Banded pipefish stay close
to a small chosen area on the reef.

232
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:07,001
Every morning at sunrise,
the female leaves her sleeping site

233
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:09,044
and swims to find her partner.

234
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:16,440
For ten minutes or so,
they remain together,

235
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:21,123
reaffirming the bond that is
essential to their partnership.

236
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:30,362
They swim together
around his territory

237
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,722
in a simple greeting dance.

238
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:39,515
Throughout the summer,
when the female's eggs are ripe,

239
00:34:39,687 --> 00:34:43,123
courtship begins in earnest
in the early morning.

240
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:47,644
it takes time. After about two hours,
they rise off the seabed,

241
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:50,924
entwining their two bodies.

242
00:34:56,607 --> 00:34:59,280
The male rubs himself
against the female,

243
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:03,122
stimulating her
to release her eggs.

244
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:12,121
And now, swiftly,
the male takes them.

245
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:20,206
The eggs, now stuck to his belly,

246
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:24,076
are patted down
to ensure that they stay there.

247
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:47,200
The female then leaves him,

248
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:51,724
but, every morning, returns for
a session of synchronised swimming

249
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:55,800
and so ensures
that their bond is maintained.

250
00:35:57,207 --> 00:36:02,884
Ten days later, under the cover of
darkness, the male shakes his body

251
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:06,198
and the young pipefish are born.

252
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:17,563
0nly now are they
independent of their parents.

253
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:23,597
Since the male takes charge
of the eggs as soon as they are laid,

254
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,725
the female can start
producing the next batch.

255
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:30,800
Without his help, the pair could
only breed every 20 days,

256
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:32,559
rather than every ten.

257
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:34,718
By sharing the work, they double

258
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:38,596
the number of young
they can produce in any one year.

259
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,395
A flamboyant cuttlefish.

260
00:36:55,447 --> 00:37:00,805
Unlike most cuttlefish, this one
spends much of its time walking,

261
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:03,686
rather than jetting
across the seabed.

262
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,838
This is a male.

263
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,360
He is using his colourful display

264
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:19,523
to try and seduce the larger female,
who seems unimpressed.

265
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:31,721
Eventually, she concedes.

266
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:41,324
The final event, the transfer
of sperm, is very quick.

267
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:48,678
(WHALE S0NG)

268
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:04,439
A singing male humpback whale.

269
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,999
Humpbacks are only visitors
to the reef.

270
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:21,557
After a pregnancy
that lasted a whole year,

271
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:26,721
the females come here to give birth
and suckle their newly-born young.

272
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,926
Their investment in their single
offspring is considerable,

273
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:33,760
for each female
will continue to nurse it

274
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:36,043
for a further six to 12 months.

275
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:39,517
But the males are here to mate.

276
00:38:47,007 --> 00:38:52,604
The lone males sing to establish
their relative seniority.

277
00:38:56,727 --> 00:39:02,359
The louder and longer the song,
the bigger and stronger the singer.

278
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:38,038
The better the song,
the larger the male,

279
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:41,802
the more mating opportunities
he will get.

280
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:49,444
All these different mating
strategies have the same aim -

281
00:39:49,607 --> 00:39:53,486
to ensure that the greatest
possible number of offspring

282
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:56,639
will live long enough
to breed themselves.

283
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:04,561
Corals also reproduce sexually,

284
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:09,926
but being fixed to the seabed,
they can't move to find a mate.

285
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:14,683
Somehow, they must synchronise
their sexual activity.

286
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:18,635
They do so using the rising
water temperatures of spring

287
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,604
and the phases of the moon.

288
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:35,761
A few days after the full moon
in late spring,

289
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:38,680
when tidal currents
are at their weakest,

290
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:43,318
the corals of the Great Barrier Reef
are ready to spawn.

291
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:55,115
Some corals are male
and release clouds of sperm.

292
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:59,519
Nearby, a female
will be releasing eggs.

293
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:19,565
0ther species of coral
are both male and female.

294
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:26,321
These release packages of eggs

295
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:29,445
already pre-wrapped in sperm.

296
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:24,358
Bundles of eggs and sperm
float to the surface

297
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:28,725
to mix with others
from further along the reef.

298
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:36,081
Each kind of coral
times its release

299
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:39,000
to a certain hour
on a certain night.

300
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:43,046
That maximises the chances
for cross-fertilisation.

301
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:51,724
The fertilised eggs

302
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:54,526
drift away from the reef.

303
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:29,087
The stormy season brings real
danger to the animals of the reef.

304
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:41,046
Lobsters in the Caribbean
sense a change in the water.

305
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:45,359
The temperature drops and powerful
swells disturb the sand.

306
00:43:47,727 --> 00:43:50,082
Under the cover of darkness,

307
00:43:50,247 --> 00:43:53,284
they emerge to run before the storm

308
00:43:53,447 --> 00:43:57,042
and risk crossing
the exposed sand flats

309
00:43:57,207 --> 00:44:00,165
to seek shelter in deeper water.

310
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:07,920
Every year they make this journey.

311
00:44:14,807 --> 00:44:19,119
From all over the reef,
lobsters come to join the march.

312
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:24,486
They conserve energy by travelling
in one another's slipstream.

313
00:44:32,247 --> 00:44:34,477
And there is the added benefit

314
00:44:34,647 --> 00:44:36,638
of safety in numbers.

315
00:44:49,327 --> 00:44:53,036
By daybreak, they've reached
the edge of the deep reef

316
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:54,799
and down they go.

317
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:57,401
For the rest of the stormy season,

318
00:44:57,567 --> 00:45:00,877
they will remain in the shelter
of deep water,

319
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:02,924
out of harm's way.

320
00:45:19,687 --> 00:45:23,839
Sometimes, during the stormy
season, a hurricane builds.

321
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:28,922
Then the very structure
of the reef itself is under threat.

322
00:46:55,767 --> 00:47:01,285
An entire reef can be destroyed
by just one big storm.

323
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:06,441
Hundreds of years of growth
gone in a few hours.

324
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:27,318
0ut in the ocean,
new life continues to develop.

325
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:32,766
in time, coral larvae will return
to colonise the rubble

326
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:36,806
and a new reef will grow
on the wasteland.
