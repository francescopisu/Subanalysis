1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,320
Japan, is about to attack
the United States of America.

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,196
On board the aircraft carrier "Zuikaku",
the pilots are woken at 4 AM.

3
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:30,680
Captain Mitsuo Fuchida, gathers them together
for the traditional sake toasts to the Emperor.

4
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:45,720
Fuchida will lead the attack on Pearl Harbor,
the large American naval base in Hawaii,

5
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,920
according to the bold plan,
devised by Admiral Yamamoto.

6
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,080
Yamamoto wants to deal a decisive blow

7
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,503
and eliminate this obstacle to Japan's conquest
of the Pacific.

8
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,680
Fuchida recounts,
"We took off for Pearl Harbor.

9
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,360
I shouted out the code words.
Tora, Tora, Tora!"

10
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,080
AMERICAN ALLIES

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,200
The attack comes as a total surprise.

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,374
Marine Corporal Earl Nightingale,
who is on board the battleship Arizona,

13
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,340
describes the scene:

14
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,480
An explosion caused the ship to shake,
violently.

15
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,250
I looked to the boat deck
and everything seemed aflame.

16
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,990
I reported to the Major
that the ship was aflame.

17
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
The Major ordered us to leave.
I was the last man to leave.

18
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,630
The bodies of the dead were thick and badly
burned men were heading for the quarter deck

19
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,630
only to fall,
apparently dead or badly wounded.

20
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,340
In this attack,
launched without any declaration of war

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,310
2,500 Americans died,
and 1,200 were wounded.

22
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,480
Whereas less than a hundred
of Japanese pilots and sailors were killed.

23
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,020
These images would shock
the American people.

24
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,450
They would no longer oppose
their country's entry into the war.

25
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,760
Yet the Japanese forces did not land in Hawaii,
nor did they take Pearl Harbor.

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,880
They sunk part of the American fleet
but only the now outdated battleships.

27
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:16,110
Aircraft carriers will become the key
to victory in naval warfare.

28
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,240
And the 3 aircraft carriers
based in Pearl Harbor were not there.

29
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,750
They were all out at sea.
And so miraculously, they remain intact.

30
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,960
The President of The United States,
Franklin D. Roosevelt

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,000
had been expecting an attack.

32
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,880
Tension between the two countries
was at its height.

33
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,230
But who would've imagine that
that Japanese naval aviation units

34
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,800
would be able to strike 5000 km away
from their bases?

35
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,000
The next day, Roosevelt goes before Congress.

36
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:52,380
Yesterday, December 7, 1941,

37
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,950
a date which will live in infamy.

38
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,556
United States of America were suddenly
and deliberately attacked.

39
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:13,530
No matter how long it may take us
to overcome this premeditated invasion.

40
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:21,360
The American people in their righteous
might will win through to absolute victory.

41
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,680
It is, indeed, an invasion.

42
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,080
On the same day, the Japanese attack
the British colony of Hong Kong.

43
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,440
Then they bomb the American air bases
in the Philippines

44
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,060
and land on the Bataan peninsula.

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,560
The Japanese have already established
a strong foothold in China.

46
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,780
They invade the British colony of Burma
and Malaya for their rubber.

47
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,080
The Dutch colony of Sumatra for its oil.
And they threaten India and Australia.

48
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,250
A few months earlier they had moved into
the French colony of Indochina.

49
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,720
After France's defeat in 1940

50
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,160
the Vichy regime, which was unable
to refuse anything to an ally of Hitler's

51
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,630
had turned some of its air and naval bases
over to the Japanese.

52
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,135
The United States retaliated by cutting off
its oil supplies to Japan

53
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,771
and freezing Japanese assets.

54
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,310
These economic sanctions had pushed Japan
into the wall.

55
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,320
The country, a chain of over populated islands

56
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,080
lacking in natural resources,
was rapidly developing.

57
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,040
It was in need of raw materials

58
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,760
and it set out to conquer the nations
who had them by force.

59
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,690
Japan had built up its navy

60
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,930
to become one of the second most
powerful fleets on the world.

61
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,480
With no less than 10 aircraft carriers and
with highly sophisticated fighter aircraft.

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,800
The remarkable "Zero", for example,
which outperformed Allied planes

63
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,712
in terms of speed, maneuverability,
and range.

64
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,150
This in addition to an army of millions of men
fiercely devoted to their emperor.

65
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,037
Hirohito is the 124th Emperor of Japan.

66
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,700
The scholarly monarch studies marine biology
in a laboratory in his palace.

67
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,180
He is a living God.

68
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,847
The actions of his military are covered
by his divine authority.

69
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,830
In China, the Imperial Army had carried out
unbelievable massacres.

70
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,480
Such as in Nanking in 1937,
where 300,000 Chinese were slaughtered

71
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,070
before the Japanese could proudly parade
through the Forbidden City in Beijing.

72
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,680
The Emperor reigns but does not govern.

73
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,380
Power lies in the hands of General Tojo
and an ultranationalist group

74
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,000
that controls the country
by their local "Gestapo", the "Kempeitai",

75
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,400
and via loudspeakers,
they broadcast the official declaration of war

76
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,640
against the United States.

77
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,040
100 million Japanese

78
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,800
are now called upon to completely devote
and sacrifice themselves to the country.

79
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,640
As long as we all preserve
this patriotic loyalty

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,040
to the imperial goal of peace
throughout the world

81
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,440
we will fear neither
the Americans nor the British!

82
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,170
These Japanese pilots, who took off
from Indochina at breakfast time,

83
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:15,506
do not fear the British.

84
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,400
They are looking for 2 British battleships
that havel come to protect Singapore.

85
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,360
The venerable "Repulse" and one of
the most modern combat ships of the time,

86
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,220
the "Prince of Wales",
the pride of the Royal Navy.

87
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,160
They are both sunk by the Japanese,
in less than an hour.

88
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:39,930
A fateful date, the end of
Great Britain's dominion of the seas.

89
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,139
The following day in Berlin,
the Fuhrer goes to the Reichstag

90
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,370
for a meeting of Nazi leaders.

91
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,120
For 4 critical days, since Pearl Harbor

92
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,880
and Japan's entry into the war against 
the United States, Hitler has been waiting in vain

93
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,860
for Roosevelt to declare war on Germany.

94
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,600
If Hitler sides with Japan,
perhaps Tokyo will support him in Russia.

95
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,340
The German generals, however,
are far from enthusiastic.

96
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,210
Ribbentrop, the foreign minister
has tried to dissuade Hitler.

97
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,990
But Hitler declares war on the United States.

98
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,880
"We know what powers stand
behind Roosevelt, it is the eternal Jew.

99
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,640
I am grateful to the German people
for designating me to lead this historic struggle

100
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,050
that will determine the history of the world
for the next 10 centuries to come."

101
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,110
The British Prime Minister phones Washington.

102
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,380
Roosevelt says,
"We're all in the same boat now."

103
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,280
This is the moment Churchill's been waiting
for the last two years.

104
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,250
Roosevelt had wanted to show his electorate

105
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,130
that he'd done everything he could
to keep the peace.

106
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,040
The war has now become a world war
and Churchill now feels stronger.

107
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,100
What kind of people do they think we are?

108
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,369
Is it possible that they do not realize
that we shall never cease

109
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,804
to persevere against them

110
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:26,540
until they have been taught a lesson
which they and the world will never forget?

111
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:36,760
Churchill severely underestimates the enemy.
Hong Kong falls to Japan in just 17 days.

112
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,820
General Yamashita, known as
"The Tiger of Malaya",

113
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,440
sends Japanese tanks through
the Malayan Jungle.

114
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,760
He captures Singapore,
the pearl of the British Empire.

115
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,230
A stronghold that was considered impregnable.

116
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,442
Yamashita makes hundreds of prisoners
line up in perfect order

117
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,246
for an impressive and humiliating review.

118
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,840
Yamashita indulges in a chivalrous salute
for the Japanese propaganda crew.

119
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,560
General Yamashita will be hanged
for war crimes in 1946.

120
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,270
General MacArthur, commander of US Forces
in the Philippines,

121
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,940
which are now surrounded by the Japanese
is ordered by Roosevelt to escape,

122
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,260
so he's not to be taken prisoner.

123
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,852
When he arrives in Australia, he declares,
"I shall return."

124
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,209
MacArthur's soldiers are taken prisoner.

125
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,560
30,000 Americans, with their old 1917
"Doughboy" helmets.

126
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,100
And an equal numbers of Filipinos

127
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,500
who set off for their internment camp
100 km away.

128
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,910
This is the "Bataan Death March".

129
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,380
One of the survivors, Sydney Stewart, recalls:

130
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,150
We marched for 10 days and nights
without eating. We were constantly beaten.

131
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,450
Those who cannot longer go on,
were killed by the guards

132
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,557
who beheaded them with a sword.

133
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,480
In just 5 months, Japan has destroyed
the Allied forces in the Far East,

134
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,444
and conquered half of the Pacific.

135
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,030
"Tennouhekai Banzai", long live the emperor.

136
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,920
A huge "Banzai" resounds throughout
the Empire

137
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,630
to celebrate Japan's version
of the lightning war.

138
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,390
It reaches General Tojo and The Emperor

139
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,370
who deigns to make an appearance
in public with his family.

140
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,976
Germany first.

141
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,100
Churchill and Roosevelt both agree on
this strategy.

142
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,750
Their primary objective
is to defeat the Germany.

143
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,020
"We have to bomb it." Says Churchill.

144
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,580
He creates an air fleet,
commanded by general Bomber Harris.

145
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,800
Harris believes he can win the war

146
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,400
with his powerful 4-engined Halifaxes
and Lancasters.

147
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,670
This strategy is criticized as being costly
in terms of men and equipment.

148
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,690
But it does begin to take its toll
on German's cities.

149
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,450
On the March 8, 1942, Essen is bombed.
A way for Churchill to help Stalin.

150
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,920
The city produces weapons used by
the German forces in Russia.

151
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:22,760
The Germans begin to measure
the consequences of Hitler's policies.

152
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,240
The Nazi regime descends
into murderous insanity.

153
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,045
Hitler, Göring, Himmler
and his assistant, Heydrich,

154
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,750
begin to implement what they call
"The Final Solution".

155
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,330
The extermination of Jews in Europe.

156
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,200
It is further endorsed at
the Wannsee Conference, near Berlin

157
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,680
in January 1942.

158
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:59,360
That's why Heydrich comes to Paris
to organize the rounding up of Jews in France.

159
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,610
Their one-way-trip to the gas chambers
in Auschwitz.

160
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,270
The Wannsee Conference is the manufacturing
of mass produced crime.

161
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,430
Thousands of Jews are crowded
into fake showers and gassed.

162
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,880
After the holocaust by bullets in Russia,
the genocide intensifies.

163
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,660
In Paris and across Europe,
the occupation brings poverty.

164
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,800
Everything is rationed,
everything the occupation country produce

165
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,570
goes to feed the German army.

166
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,040
The children's fathers are prisoners
in Germany.

167
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,210
"Stalag" camps for enlisted men,
and "Oflag" camps for the officers.

168
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,220
Gaston Chirac, imprisoned in June 1940,
writes:

169
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,680
I've wasted 5 years of my life in that Stalag
from 20 to 25, without my wife.

170
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,770
In the Oflags, the officers are treating better.

171
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,243
The French generals are interned in
the Fortress of Koenig stein, near Dresden.

172
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:54,200
Including the unfortunately leaders of
the battle of France, such as General Giraud.

173
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,420
His jailer takes great delight in filming him

174
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,290
during an interesting visit
to the city of Dresden

175
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,920
which British bombs would later
raze to the ground.

176
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,710
At the age of 63, general Giraud
will become the hero of an acrobatic escape

177
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,960
that will infuriate Hitler.

178
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,450
For a while, Giraud will be
the rival of general De Gaulle.

179
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,290
It is De Gaulle, however, who, from London,
embodies the French resistance.

180
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,870
In France, attacks against the occupiers
are being on the rise.

181
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,980
especially, since the communists join
the resistance's struggle

182
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:32,085
following Germany's invasion
of the Soviet Union.

183
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,820
In retaliation for the anti-German attacks,
hostages are executed.

184
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,730
De Gaulle now has a small army,
fighting alongside the British in Africa,

185
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,270
called the "Free French Forces".

186
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,970
Its member have been sentenced to death
by the Vichy Government.

187
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,010
Some have been fighting since June 16, 1940.

188
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,020
The most famous among them
is general Lecrec.

189
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,520
His real name is Philippe de Hauteclocque.

190
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,690
But he adopted this alias to protect
his family back in France.

191
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,760
After being promoted to general by De Gaulle,

192
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,160
he fashioned a "Kepi" for himself
with 2 stars taken from an Italian

193
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,330
after the victorious battle in Kufra, Libya.

194
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,160
That day, Leclerc says to his men,
"Swear that you will not lay down your arms

195
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,110
until our flag flies once again
over the Cathedral of Strasbourg."

196
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,400
For 15 days at Bir Hakeim,
in the Libyan deserts,

197
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,520
other Free French Forces repel
the German offensive

198
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,180
launched by Rommel, "The Desert Fox",
and his Afrika korp.

199
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,100
In this global conflict,
the so-called "Axis Powers",

200
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,990
the alliances between Germany, Italy
and Japan are positioned on all fronts.

201
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,760
The Afrika korp are just outside Egypt.

202
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,040
The Wehrmacht occupied a third of Russia.

203
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,520
The Imperial Navy of Japan
controls the Pacific.

204
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:13,950
And Germany's submarines
are wrecking-havoc in the Atlantic.

205
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,520
The U-boat is arguably
German's most dangerous weapon.

206
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,430
In the first few months of 1942,

207
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,697
these submarines have sunk 4,000,000 tons
of Allied ships.

208
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,200
Oil tankers, freighters loaded
with arms and planes

209
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,670
on their way with fresh supplies
to an asphyxiated Great Britain.

210
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,240
Even though The United States have joined
the conflict, the war seems to be lost.

211
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,014
The world is on the brink of destruction.

212
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,830
The German submariners approach
North America.

213
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,660
Through their periscopes,
they film the bright lights of New York.

214
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,550
We have information that a squadron of fleas
is heading towards the Long Island.

215
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:22,320
The American newspapers and radios
warn the public of possible German air raids.

216
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,800
In reality, however, planes do not yet have
such a long range of action from Europe.

217
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,560
Still, the population is told
to black out their light.

218
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,300
It is, in fact, the West Coast,

219
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,640
where the idea of Japanese attack
seems more plausible

220
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,570
that is over-taken by hysteria.

221
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,480
Suddenly, 120,000 Japanese-Americans
fall under suspicion.

222
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,760
First, their radios are confiscated,
then their fingerprints are taken.

223
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,900
The government posts orders
that introduce emergency measures.

224
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,170
Roosevelt declares, "It is a military necessity."

225
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:15,120
These Americans of Japanese ancestry
have lived for generations in California

226
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,250
where they contribute to the agriculture
and economy of the state.

227
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,349
Most of them are US citizens.

228
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,260
They are given 48 hours
to vacate their shops and their houses.

229
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,391
They are then evacuated in groups

230
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,900
to relocation centers,
far out in the desert of Utah

231
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,460
or up in the snows of Colorado,

232
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,670
centers euphemistically called
"Internment camps".

233
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,240
A disgraceful spectacle for the United States.

234
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,410
In the words of the American novelist,
Julie Otsuka:

235
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,250
My upbringing was very American.
We never spoke Japanese at home.

236
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,560
We didn't eat Japanese food.

237
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,590
And then my grandfather was arrested by
the FBI as a suspected spy for Japan

238
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,000
along with my grandmother, my uncle,
my mother.

239
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,800
My family has always been very discreet
about what happened.

240
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,573
But nothing diminishes their loyalty
for America.

241
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,410
6,000 will serve as translators in the Pacific.

242
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,780
Nearly 20,000 will sign up to combat
the German in Europe.

243
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,890
The rest will be freed at the end of the war.

244
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,530
In 1942, American rallies around its flag.

245
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,495
Millions of men enlisted.

246
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,960
6,000,000 women go to work to replace them
in the armament factories.

247
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,320
Roosevelt sets production target
at 125,000 airplanes,

248
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:05,670
75,000 tanks and 10 million tons of ships.
This is the victory program.

249
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:10,270
But victory is uncertain and very far off.

250
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,480
American opinion is flagging
and an exploit is needed to shore it up.

251
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,044
A daring plan is devised.

252
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,040
An aircraft carrier, the USS Hornet

253
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,320
will attempt to get as close to Japan
as possible with a squad of 16 B-25 bombers.

254
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,960
This is the first time that such large planes
will be taking off

255
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,600
from a compact deck of a carrier in battle.

256
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,500
The air crews are trained by Air Force Colonel
Jimmy Doolittle,

257
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,010
once a famous racing pilot.

258
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,140
He will command the raid.

259
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,270
The mission seems impossible.

260
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,080
For the long flight over to Japan these planes
are too heavy in terms of bombs and fuel.

261
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,028
But they succeeded in taking off.

262
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,269
Their mission will be celebrated
in a popular feature film,

263
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,940
"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo".

264
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,920
They dropped 16 tons of bombs
and caused only minor damages.

265
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:35,990
But it is a huge slap in the face
for the Empire of the Rising Sun.

266
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:44,160
Eight raiders went down in Japanese territory
and vengeance was fierce.

267
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,840
Tried for war crimes, 3 were sentenced
to death and 5 received life in prison.

268
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,710
For the prime minister, general Tojo,
and for admiral Yamamoto,

269
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,410
the American raid proved
that it was necessary to extend 

270
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,080
their defensive perimeter to the east.

271
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,800
Their plan is to take Midway.

272
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,760
An American military base 
in the middle of the Pacific.

273
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,920
And then capture Pearl Harbor,
as they should have done 6 months earlier.

274
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,240
What the Japanese do not know

275
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,270
is that the Americans have successfully
broken their secret military code.

276
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,940
And therefore aware of the plan.

277
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:33,480
As the results, US Commander-in-Chief,
admiral Chester Nimitz

278
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,012
prepares to defend Midway.

279
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,070
He has fewer aircraft carriers than Yamamoto.

280
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:43,190
But he brings them all over
to set up an ambush.

281
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,360
Admiral Yamamoto is on his way

282
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,930
at the head of the biggest armada
ever put together.

283
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:59,140
200 battleships, and above all,
an exceptional fleet of 8 aircraft carriers

284
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:02,172
transporting nearly 600 planes.

285
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,210
On board are 5,000 Japanese marines.

286
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:16,340
And a painter, who's come along to immortalize
the battle, Fujita.

287
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,157
In Paris, he was a famous Montparnasse artist.

288
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,590
He has returned to Japan to do his duty.

289
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,730
On the American side,
it is the eminent director John Ford,

290
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,270
who will immortalize
the defense of Midway Island.

291
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,570
On the eve of the battle,
he recreates the atmosphere of his Western

292
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,880
before the final shoot-out.

293
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,420
The marines know that the attack
is slated for the next day.

294
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,160
In the morning,
Ford films the first Japanese attack

295
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,030
which devastate the American base.

296
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,480
A Japanese bomb explodes a bit too close
to the filmmakers, seriously wounding Ford.

297
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,115
Ford will later recall a marine saying,
"My God, that one is close."

298
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,920
He would also recall,
"Marines with me, them kids from 18 to 22.

299
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,090
And they were the calmest people
I've ever seen.

300
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,590
I figured then,
while this war is practically won."

301
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:43,440
The pilots on board the US aircraft carriers
are no older. They are barely out of college.

302
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:49,960
They pose for John Ford's cameramen
and then take off to attack the Japanese fleet.

303
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,650
Torpedo Squadron 8 will strike first.

304
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,320
One of its pilots,
25 years old, lieutenant George Gay,

305
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,440
nose-dives over the Japanese fleet.

306
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,080
The anti aircraft guns
on the Japanese aircraft carriers

307
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:24,210
shoot down the American planes,
one after the other.

308
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,323
George Gay flies low over the waves,
he is shot down.

309
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,630
He surfaces on the water, miraculously unhurt.

310
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,080
A few hundreds yards away
he can see the feverish activity

311
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,080
on board the Japanese aircraft carriers.

312
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,880
Planes are being fueled
and bombs are being loaded,

313
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,100
in preparation for their second wave of attack.

314
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:54,077
At that very moment,
another squadron of US bombers

315
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,513
flies over the Japanese ships.

316
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:03,490
An incredible stroke of luck,
they sink 4 Japanese aircraft carriers.

317
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,390
George Gay, still in the water, recalls,

318
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,460
"I found myself in the middle of 
the Japanese wreck and the sharks.

319
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:16,208
I saw the Japanese planes coming back
from their first attack on Midway.

320
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,770
They were looking for their aircraft carriers,
the ones we have just sunk.

321
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:27,280
So I saw the Japanese pilots who have
by now, run out of fuel, landing in the water."

322
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,670
George Gay would be rescued
by an American sea plane.

323
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,740
He will go on to become an airline pilot.

324
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,310
The US aircraft carrier Yorktown,
has been damaged by the Japanese.

325
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,580
It tends to its wounds.

326
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,485
Counts the number of casualties,
and attempts to return to its place.

327
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,260
But the next day, it is torpedoed
by the Japanese submarine, I-168.

328
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,160
The Americans have lost an aircraft carrier
but the Japanese have lost 4.

329
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,360
This is the first Japanese defeat
and it boosts the Allies' morale.

330
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,790
It restores their confidence.

331
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,830
But it doesn't seem to have weakened Japan.

332
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,280
Thwarted at Midway,
in the middle of the Pacific,

333
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,560
continues to advance south, towards Australia.

334
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,020
Darwin, the northern most city in Australia
already bombed by the Japanese,

335
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,847
is now preparing for an invasion.

336
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,249
The country's first war.

337
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,330
The Australians will attempt to counter the Japanese

338
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,130
who continue their expansion
invading New Guinea.

339
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,700
An enormous island, practically impenetrable,

340
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,273
which until then had mainly attracted
explorers.

341
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,590
The Papuans will end up providing
precious assistance to the Australians

342
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,560
who will fight a desperate war in New Guinea
against the mosquitoes,

343
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,756
the red ants,

344
00:31:55,158 --> 00:31:56,759
the leeches,

345
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,429
the snakes,

346
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,170
and attacks from the Japanese.

347
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,510
But it is the Island of Guadalcanal
that now concerns the Americans.

348
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,400
One of their reconnaissance planes
has revealed

349
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,640
that the Japanese are building
an airfield on the island.

350
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,360
Another threat to Australia.

351
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,470
The Americans organize
the first big landing of the war.

352
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:52,360
Initially, on the beach,
the marines do not encounter any resistance.

353
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,317
And head into the jungle.

354
00:32:57,954 --> 00:33:00,690
One of them, Edwin Morgan, reports:

355
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,990
We were getting to know the jungle.

356
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:06,196
It was full of suspicious noises
that were frightening.

357
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,640
I was afraid. But we said to ourselves,

358
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,060
there's no reason for the Japanese
to be better than us.

359
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,140
They all live in cities.
There are no jungles in Japan.

360
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,590
The marines are professionals
and the Japanese are die-hards.

361
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,590
The Japanese are so confident
in their superiority

362
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,920
that they charge with their bayonets.

363
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:40,230
Just as in World War 1, in Verdun,
against machine gun fire.

364
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,110
With the same result, as in Verdun,
a blood bath.

365
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,800
Japanese soldiers are killed
in the battle of Tenaru river.

366
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,610
After that, the marines are able
to capture the air field.

367
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,760
They secure it and enlarge the runway

368
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:32,880
for the first planes of the airborne marines,
called "The Black Sheep Squadron".

369
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:42,040
This airfield becomes the target
of incessant shelling by the Japanese.

370
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,640
At night, their cruisers glide up and down
the coast

371
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:52,000
and pound the bases with such regularity,
that marines call it, "The Tokyo Express".

372
00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:00,250
A naval battle is engaged
to prevent reinforcements from landing.

373
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,480
A Japanese elite regiment gets through.

374
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,990
These Japanese marines are fearsome warriors.

375
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:13,360
But they go off to war without any defense
against tropical diseases.

376
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,460
Malaria will kill many of them.

377
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,998
Others will sacrifice themselves
in keeping the Bushido tradition.

378
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,770
Their commander, colonel Ichiki,
reminds them of the Samurai motto:

379
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:39,800
Duty is heavy like a mountain,
but a soldier's death is light, like a feather.

380
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,259
The battle for Guadalcanal
is only just beginning.

381
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,930
The fighting will last 6 months,
a war of attrition.

382
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,970
The US marines feel that they are trapped in,
what they call, a "Green hell".

383
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:10,010
They, too are ill,
their wounds become infected.

384
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,550
But this is only just the beginning
of their ordeal.

385
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:26,060
At that moment, the Red Army is going
through its own ordeal.

386
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,930
The Russians call it,
"The Black Summer of 1942".

387
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,520
The Germans have resumed their march
eastwards and are taking prisoners again.

388
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:41,444
Less than the previous year,
however, because most of the time,

389
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,800
the Soviets have already taken off and
left nothing but scorched earth behind them.

390
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:58,160
Hitler thinks they are fleeing,
but it is in fact, an order from Stalin.

391
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,870
Yet for the Lancers,
the soldiers of the Wehrmacht,

392
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:09,005
a fierce battle has to be waged
for every single town.

393
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,280
Major Hoch of the 18th Infantry Regiment,
writes:

394
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,330
The new recruits are not used
to this kind of fighting.

395
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,454
They soon get depressed,
go crazy and are struck down.

396
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,850
On August 8,
we lost 35 young men like this.

397
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,060
Out of the 50 who were killed
in the 6th Company.

398
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:49,480
Into this quagmire, Hitler throws everything
he has, some 10,000,000 men.

399
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,820
He estimates, however,
that he still needs 800,000 more

400
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,318
for this decisive campaign.

401
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,956
His Romanian, Hungarian and Italian allies
will provide the men.

402
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:03,460
Most of whom are forced to go
and fight for him.

403
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,020
Of the Italians, forced into war
by Mussolini's megalomania.

404
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,071
300,000 will be killed.

405
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,415
Hitler's goal is no longer Moscow,
but Southern Russia.

406
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,690
He is planning a colossal pinser movement

407
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,880
that will close up around the oil fields
in the Caucasus.

408
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,560
And with Rommel advancing through Egypt,
those in the Middle East.

409
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,536
His other goal is Stalingrad,
Stalin's city and its factories.

410
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,880
Hitler launches both offensives at the same time
which alarms his military commanders.

411
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,400
As he did for Moscow the previous year,
Hitler splits up his forces.

412
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,810
A part of the Wehrmacht penetrates
deep into the steppes.

413
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,700
General von Kleist says,

414
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,890
"In front of me, no enemies.
Behind me, no reserves."

415
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,080
They reach the Caucasus mountains,
they head for the Iranian border

416
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,910
which has recently become a supply route
for American aid to the U.S.S.R.

417
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,740
They will never reach it.

418
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,920
In the mean time,
the rest of the German forces,

419
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,020
the 6th Army, led by general Paulus
is marching toward Stalingrad.

420
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,010
To try and stop the relentless advance
of the German tanks,

421
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:52,030
the Russians start using desperate means.

422
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,570
Dogs.

423
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:58,041
Up until now, the skins of these dogs
were used to make boots.

424
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,110
The Russian have hastily
put together a method

425
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:06,140
based on the work of the famous scientist
Pavlov and his condition reflexes.

426
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,550
The dogs are starved and trained to seek
their food under a tracked vehicle.

427
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,200
They are strapped
with remote controlled explosives

428
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,430
and freed at the last minute
when the German tank comes into view.

429
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,720
In August 1942, Churchill and Harriman,
Roosevelt's ambassador,

430
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,020
fly to Moscow to meet with Stalin,

431
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,760
who is demanding that a second front
be opened in the West.

432
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,570
Churchill makes his famous
"V" for victory sign.

433
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,130
But he has no other choice
but to admit to Stalin

434
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,670
that The Allies cannot help him against 
the Germans on the Eastern Front.

435
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:57,470
Harriman promises aid and equipment,
but Stalin is furious.

436
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,280
He knows he will have to fight Hitler, alone.

437
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,480
He assigns the defense of Stalingrad
to one of his most ruthless henchmen,

438
00:41:05,515 --> 00:41:07,910
the Ukrainian, Nikita Khrushchev

439
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,360
who had been responsible for several
of Stalin's massacres before the war.

440
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,970
Khrushchev conveys Stalin's order,
not to retreat.

441
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:26,440
But he is unable to stop the German advance
from arriving on the outskirts of Stalingrad.

442
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,200
By September 1942, Paulus reaches
the railway that goes to Moscow.

443
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,640
He manages to follow it all the way
to Stalingrad and takes the Central Train Station.

444
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,530
The Stukas prepare to destroy the city
that is the pride of the Soviet Union.

445
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,700
The greatest industrial city
in the communist world.

446
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,600
Built to cater to the workers,

447
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,920
with its garden estates
and its "Red October" and barricades factories.

448
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,110
The German's bombs
killed thousands of civilians.

449
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,040
The massive tractor factory,
where the T-34 tanks were manufactured

450
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,760
is reduced to a sea of rubble.

451
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,680
Yet these ruins become blockhouses
and fortresses

452
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,606
that the Germans have to capture
in hand-to-hand combat.

453
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,280
They suffer heavy casualties,

454
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,880
which are however nothing,
compared to the Russian losses.

455
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,950
After 4 weeks of dogged fighting, 

456
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:17,680
the Germans finally get to the top of
the only high point in the city, Mamayev Hill.

457
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,390
From there,
they can control all of Stalingrad.

458
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,050
On October 15, 1942,
the Germans reach their goal,

459
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,360
the great Russian river, the Volga.

460
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:48,960
Only a thin strip of land is still held
by a few Soviet combatants.

461
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,470
General Paulus can inform Hitler
that the Swastika is flying over the city

462
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,650
which is now occupied by the 6th Army.

463
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:11,930
Hitler is delighted.
He gathers all of his associates together.

464
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:16,530
Göring, Goebbels, Himmler and his devotees.

465
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:22,280
And he tells them,
"I wanted to take that city, Stalin city.

466
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,400
It's finally ours!

467
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,160
Boats can no longer sail up the Volga.
That's what is most important."
