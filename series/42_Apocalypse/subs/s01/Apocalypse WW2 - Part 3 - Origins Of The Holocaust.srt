1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,560
After the Germans defeated France,
their soldiers were sent to Paris

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,030
for rest and recreation.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,840
One of the soldiers on leave is 19 year old,
leftenant August von Kageneck.

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,150
His unit did not take part
in the French campaign.

5
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,110
He is visiting the city for the first time.

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,710
He writes:
We are given very strict instructions.

7
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,600
We must be impeccably dressed
and avoid all contact with the population.

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,270
We're inventing mass tourism.

9
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,610
The French refuse to look at them.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,915
Some, have started to fight back.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,720
These two men who sabotage telephone lines
will be the first to be executed by the German.

12
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,630
Sentenced to death by shooting

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,990
The new French state, under
the authoritarian rule of Marechal Petain,

14
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,070
chooses to collaborate with Germany.

15
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,430
Petain promulgates a set of
anti Jewish statutes

16
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,180
that excludes Jews from public life.

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,700
He and Hitler have shaken hands.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,406
Everyday, the Wehrmacht parades.

19
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,620
The Germans occupy
the capital cities of Europe.

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,500
After Prague and Warsaw,
Brussels, Luxembourg, The Hague,

21
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,440
Copenhagen, and Oslo, but not London.

22
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,610
February 1941, in the suburbs of London.

23
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,740
Rose, who is only 3,
has already lived through 2 years of war.

24
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,550
ORIGINS OF THE HOLOCAUST

25
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,538
Rose is brave,
and bravery is called for in Britain.

26
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:52,531
Great Britain's cities have been devastated
by German bombs.

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,760
But the country stands firm around Churchill
and with the providential aid of Roosevelt.

28
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,760
Roosevelt has just been re-elected for a
third term as President of the United States.

29
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,820
Though American opinion remains opposed
to war, he declares,

30
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,710
"We must be the great arsenal of democracy."

31
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,060
Only part of the equipment he sends
to Great Britain gets through.

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,310
Every British ship at sea is in great danger.

33
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,920
The Atlantic ocean is crawling
by the German submarines.

34
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,490
Their periscopes seek out British vessels.

35
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,080
Churchill is worried.
Soon, nothing will get through.

36
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,570
And the outcome of the war seems uncertain.

37
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,880
Great Britain is an island. This is an
advantage as well as a disadvantage.

38
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,160
But it is the best hope for the countries
under occupation.

39
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,120
The German submarines or U-boats, now
have the French harbors at their disposal.

40
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,180
Grouped into packs,
using torpedoes and cannons

41
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,510
These "Wolves of the Atlantic"
succeed in sinking

42
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,460
4,000,000 tons of British shipping
in 1941 alone.

43
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,280
Here, German submariners toss
loaves of bread to a shipwrecked crew

44
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,190
who have almost no chance of surviving.

45
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,480
They will die of thirst, of hunger, of cold
or by choking on oil.

46
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,180
Hitler is delighted with the success
of his submarines

47
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,480
but America's massive
re-armament program worries him.

48
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,920
He tells his secretary, Bormann,

49
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,440
"In one year, the United States
will be ready to go to war.

50
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,950
If we are to face them,
we need more raw materials.

51
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,530
Those materials are in the East.
We need to conquer that living Space.

52
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,920
Then, Britain will lose all hope
and make peace

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,840
and it will be too late for the Americans.
Let us attack Russia as soon as possible."

54
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,680
Hitler codenamed the plan
"Operation Barbarossa"

55
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,020
after the medieval emperor,
Frederick Barbarossa.

56
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,160
The Wehrmacht starts to concentrate
its troop in the East.

57
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,550
Leftenant von Kageneck leaves for Poland.

58
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,840
Polish prisoners and Jews have been put
to work on various construction projects.

59
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:21,697
Hitler wants to build a motorway
across Poland

60
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,560
in order to move his army over to
the new border of with Russia.

61
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,760
This is where the 9th Panzer Division
is installed

62
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,480
along with von Kageneck's regiment.

63
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,240
He writes: Next to us is an SS unit.

64
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,030
The commander asks,
"Do you want to see a Jew?"

65
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,440
He makes a sign and a soldier
brings over a little man.

66
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,510
"How many people have you
stolen from today?"

67
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,590
The man doesn't reply.

68
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,880
Beat him 10 times with a stick.

69
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,080
We were appalled.
So this is our occupation of Poland?

70
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,020
We had heard vague stories of cruelty,

71
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,220
but it was impossible to know
what was really going on.

72
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,020
This country had become
the country of silence.

73
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,100
We didn't know that this was
the beginning of the genocide

74
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,820
to which we would lend our hands
and our courage.

75
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,440
Hitler defers his plans for
an offensive in the East.

76
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,160
He has to help out his ally, Mussolini
who wants to fight his own separate war.

77
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,560
Il Duce has just been routed by the British
in Africa.

78
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,280
The Italian army is in disarray in the desert.

79
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,300
To rescue Mussolini from disaster

80
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,169
Hitler dispatches one of his best generals
over to Libya.

81
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,840
General Rommel, along with
his armored division, the Afrika korp.

82
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,580
In Germany, Rommel is a big hero.

83
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,990
He is the man who took Cambrai,
Arras, Rouen

84
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,760
and Cherbourg in May and June of 1940.

85
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:25,550
And he is a true Nazi.

86
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,200
A devotee who has served Hitler
with great zeal

87
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,200
and efficiency from the very beginning.

88
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,870
Rommel believes in tanks
and in the "Lightning war".

89
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,010
He quickly orders the Afrika korps to set off
for the British positions.

90
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,560
Rommel is already making a name for himself.

91
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,160
The British circulate his picture with
the description: "This man is dangerous."

92
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,210
Hitler attacks Greece, a country
that Mussolini has already tried to take.

93
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,480
After his blitzkrieg in the Balkans
and his occupation of Yugoslavia

94
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,610
he drops his paratroopers over Crete.

95
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,120
Hitler has secured his southern flank
for the invasion of Russia

96
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,290
but he has lost precious time.

97
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:29,276
Operation Barbarossa has been delayed
by several weeks.

98
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,700
A grand military parade is traditionally
held in Moscow's Red Square

99
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,530
to celebrate International Workers Day.

100
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,440
Special preparations have gone
into this one, however,

101
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,910
Stalin wants to make a big impression
on the Germans.

102
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,580
He's been receiving information
from his spies

103
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,980
warning of the imminence of an attack.

104
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,640
But he finds it hard to believe
that Hitler would dare to break

105
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,460
the German-Soviet Non-aggression Pact,
so soon.

106
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
The Germans are attending the parade.
And Marshall Timoshenko,

107
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,840
the People's Commissar
and Stalin's Defense Minister

108
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,800
seems to salute them with great respect.

109
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,880
Hitler is ready to attack
but he wants to avoid fighting on 2 fronts.

110
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,140
He would like to make peace
with Great Britain first.

111
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,825
In the suburbs of London, in a house that
has been spared by German bombs

112
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,490
Rose is helping her parents
who are listening to the radio.

113
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,930
Suddenly, an astonishing announcement
comes over the BBC.

114
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,630
In Scotland, near Glasgow,
the remains of a German plane,

115
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,860
a Messerschmitt 110 have been found.

116
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,560
Its pilot bailed out by parachute.

117
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,870
He turns out to be a top-ranked Nazi.
Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess.

118
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,750
He says, "I have come on a mission of peace."

119
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:16,040
Hess was one of Hitler first supporters
and he is one of the most fanatical.

120
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,680
The Party is Hitler

121
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,760
Hitler is Germany
Germany is Hitler!

122
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,440
Hess feels that the role he has played

123
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,160
has not been as glorious
as that of other Nazi leaders.

124
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,190
He wants to prove to his Führer,
that he, Rudolf Hess,

125
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,800
is the only person capable of finding
the way out of the conflict with Great Britain.

126
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,880
But he is immediately locked up.

127
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:52,602
Churchill rejects his overtures,
and Hitler disowns him.

128
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,710
Hess will remain in prison
for the rest of his life.

129
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,760
Meanwhile, intelligence reports indicate that
Hitler is planning to invade the Soviet Union.

130
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,320
But Stalin ignores the reports.

131
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,820
Just as he ignores the last message
sent by Richard Sorge,

132
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,280
a Soviet spy based in Tokyo.

133
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,200
The document dated May 30, 1941,
warns of a German attack.

134
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,107
In fact, Stalin continues to send
raw materials to the Reich.

135
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,400
Since the signing of the German-Soviet
Non-aggression Pact,

136
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,742
he has exported thousands of tons of oil,
chrome, and nickel to Germany.

137
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,660
All of which, helped Hitler to conquer France.

138
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,890
The last train load is sent off
on the night of the 21st of June, 1941.

139
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,400
Carrying tons of wheat, this train crosses
over the border at midnight.

140
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,360
And on June the 22nd, at 3 AM,
without officially declaring war,

141
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,520
the first Wehrmacht sappers
steal over onto Russian territory.

142
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,690
They are followed by 153 German divisions,

143
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,920
as well as by Finnish, Romanian,
Slovakian, and Hungarian troops.

144
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,990
There is even a division of Spanish fascists.

145
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,190
3,000,000 men,
along with 600,000 trucks.

146
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,560
Many of which are made
by French manufacturers,

147
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,280
such as Berliet and Renault.

148
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,210
More than 3,000 tanks, 7,000 cannons,

149
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,477
3,000 aeroplanes.

150
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,640
Within 24 hours, 1,500 Soviet aircraft
are wiped out on the ground.

151
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:09,235
300 more Russian planes
are shot down by the Germans.

152
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,870
Taken by surprise, over-powered,

153
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,150
the Soviet Air Force have suffered
a devastating blow.

154
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:27,800
The German offensive is unleashed
across 3,000 km and in 3 different directions.

155
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,600
In the north, the ideological target, Leningrad.

156
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,660
Lenin's city, the cradle of the Russian revolution.
Modern day's St. Petersburg.

157
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,740
In the center, the political target,
Moscow, Stalin's capital.

158
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:51,578
In the south, the economic target,
Kiev, and the Ukraine.

159
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,160
Our armies are thrusting to the east

160
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,360
Into Russian land

161
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,400
Comrades, take your guns!

162
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,280
Victory will be ours

163
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,080
From Finland to the Black Sea

164
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Forward, forward!

165
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,120
Forward to the east, storming army

166
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,560
Freedom is our goal

167
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,880
Victory is our banner

168
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,600
Führer, order us!

169
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,160
We will follow you!

170
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,420
In the northern Baltic states, the German
are sometimes hailed as liberators.

171
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,570
After Stalin's reign of terror,
anything is better than the NKVD.

172
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,880
The ruthless Soviet Secret Police,
responsible for political repression.

173
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,320
Forced to pull out, they execute
Baltic anti-communists in the prisons.

174
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,180
Local anti-Semites accuse the Jews
of being in collision with the communists.

175
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,550
Jews are forced to carry the corpses.

176
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,800
Across the Baltic states, people start
organizing pogroms against Jews.

177
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,120
Which the German encourages
with special instructions like:

178
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,140
Do not leave any traces.

179
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,880
Burning the bodies is one way
eliminating them.

180
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,730
On the central front, General Guderian,

181
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,120
the tank strategist and proponent
of the blitzkrieg is held up by the Stalin line.

182
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,100
A series of fortifications that
the panzer grenadiers have to take by a sword.

183
00:16:56,869 --> 00:16:59,806
Guderian continues to advance.

184
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,080
But an unforeseen factor soon slows down
his fine motorized unit,

185
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,790
as described by von Kageneck,

186
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,159
"We advance in our armored cars
and the dust envelopes us.

187
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,297
We're in Russia,
where roads and asphalt don't exist.

188
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,960
It's awful. The sticky yellow
or red dust gets into everything.

189
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,870
Into your eyes, your nose, your mouth."

190
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,680
Under such condition,
these men move 50 km a day.

191
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,180
They haveve marched all the way to Warsaw,
to Oslo, to Bayonne.

192
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:51,291
They are beginning to realize
just how vast Russia is.

193
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,870
Hundreds and hundreds of kilometers go by,
without a single village in sight.

194
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,720
It is becoming harder and harder
for the supply,

195
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,920
fuel and ammunition trucks to get through.

196
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,880
But there is another situation
that the German soldiers must deal with.

197
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,020
The Russian are putting up a good defense.

198
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,600
A new type of Russian tank appears
on the scene and this is a big surprise.

199
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,500
The T-34, a 30 ton monster 
equipped with a formidable cannon

200
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,540
and wide tracks that can go anywhere.

201
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,910
It is superior to the German tanks
in gun power and armor thickness.

202
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,740
But has only rudimentary radios,
and clunky gearboxes.

203
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,960
The only weapon powerful enough
to neutralize it is the German 88 cannon.

204
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,480
Still, the Germans are better armed
and their army is stronger.

205
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,450
But these "Ivans", as they call the Russians,
will fight tooth and nail, until the very end.

206
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,440
The Russians have already
suffered heavy losses,

207
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,680
but the German casualties are also rising.

208
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,850
The Germans continue to make progress
towards their 3 goals.

209
00:19:55,882 --> 00:20:01,310
Leningrad, Moscow
and Kiev, by capturing entire armies.

210
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,400
Hitler's orders are to immediately execute
all political commissars,

211
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,040
members of the Communist Party
whose job is to oversee the officers

212
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,120
and keep an eye on the soldiers
in each military unit.

213
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,880
Guderian is opposed to this criminal order.

214
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,500
However, according to the Commander of
the 4th Panzer Army Group, General Hoepner,

215
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,280
"This war must be led
with unprecedented brutality.

216
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,510
There is to be no mercy for the Bolsheviks."

217
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,400
The Bolsheviks, the Russians, fight desperately

218
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,170
with fewer and fewer weapons,
often with only one rifle for 4 men.

219
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,350
They are forced to retreat
along the entire front.

220
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,520
For Stalin, things are looking very bad.

221
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,280
With his heavy, Georgian accent, 
he pronounces words he's never used before.

222
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,310
He calls the Russians,
"My brothers" and "my sisters".

223
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,120
He tells them the truth,

224
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:35,380
"We are under attack by Hitler's Germany.
The enemy is cruel and implacable.

225
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,818
A grave danger hangs over our country."

226
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,388
In the darkest hour, he dares to predict:

227
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,300
Is it true that German fascist troops
are invincible?

228
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,260
Napoleon's army was considered invincible,
but it was beaten.

229
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,585
He orders the factories along with
their machines and their workers

230
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,820
to relocate to the East, to the Ural mountains.

231
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,300
And he gives farmers and peasants
an absolute order:

232
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,690
Leave, leave your izba, your house.
Destroy everything.

233
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:32,660
Leave behind nothing that can be of any use
to the fascist-Hitlerite aggressor.

234
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,200
This is Stalin's Scorched Earth Policy.

235
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,420
The German officers have not forgotten
about Napoleon.

236
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,830
In 1812, the Russians defeated
Napoleon's Grand Army

237
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,530
by burning their towns and fields.

238
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,800
And then massacre dthe French
in the Battle of Berezina.

239
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,290
In early July 1941,
the Germans also reach the Berezina river

240
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,720
on the central front and they keep going.

241
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,866
Resistance by the Soviets is growing stronger.

242
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,930
On the other side of the river,
an unpleasant surprise awaits the Germans.

243
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,110
The Russians has set up a new kind of artillery.

244
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,214
A rocket launcher called
"Stalin's Organ" or "Katyusha"

245
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,250
because it sounds like a nest of organ pipes.

246
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,800
A most terrifying weapon.

247
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,880
But nothing can stop the German advance.

248
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,160
By mid-July, they have reached Smolensk,
the last big city before Moscow.

249
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:03,142
The battle for Smolensk lasts 3 weeks.

250
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,658
The Russians fight until the very end

251
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,740
despite the calls for surrender coming over
the German loud speakers.

252
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,760
Surrender!

253
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,200
You will be treated well.

254
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,140
Very few are taken prisoner.

255
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,215
Some of the survivors go into hiding in
the deep forest and become insurgents.

256
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,720
They are joined by many peasants
and farmers, whom they train to fight.

257
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:00,000
They hunt down traitors and disrupt
the enemy's communication lines.

258
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,640
Reprisals are brutal.

259
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,440
The Führer orders,
"Immediately liquidate all people suspected

260
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,390
of harboring even the
smallest amount of hostility."

261
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Hitler consults with
the Wehrmacht's commander-in-chief,

262
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,480
Field Marshall Keitel.

263
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,900
Operation Barbarossa is slowing down.

264
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,960
Some of the generals believe that
Hitler's strategy of using a 3-pronged attack 

265
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,610
is to blame.

266
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,480
Instead, Marshall von Bock,
commander of the army group center

267
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,670
wants all of his forces focused on Moscow.

268
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:02,955
Hitler does not like generals
who dare to contradict him.

269
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:14,120
General Guderian is there, he insists,
"We're only 350 km away from Moscow now."

270
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,240
"You understand nothing." Says the Führer.
"You know nothing of war time economics.

271
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,480
First, we need the wheat from the Ukraine,

272
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,980
so that they don't starve
as they did in the previous war.

273
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,210
Moscow is nothing but a symbol.
We'll take care of it later."

274
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,650
He orders Guderian to swing south
towards Kiev

275
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,560
in order to close the pincer around
the Russian armies still operating

276
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,470
in pockets to the rear of the Wehrmacht.

277
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,930
It will be the biggest encirclement of all time.

278
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:56,250
The Germans capture 600,000 Russian soldiers
in one fell swoop.

279
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:59,587
Himmler comes through on a visit.

280
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,060
No provisions have been made
to feed the prisoners.

281
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,360
With supreme indifference,
Himmler contemplates those he calls:

282
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,700
the "Untermensch" or "Sub-humans".

283
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,940
He will coldly let them starve to death.

284
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,843
Leftenant von Kageneck writes:
We live quite well in the Ukraine.

285
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,720
We had everything we needed.
Eggs, butter, fruit, milk, wine,

286
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,950
an excellent red wine
from the area around the Black Sea.

287
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,320
He goes on, "The Ukrainians will come up
to us, smiling, filled with joy.

288
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:56,880
The women will bring us bread and honey.
They saw us as their liberators."

289
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:08,017
The Ukrainians have many reasons to hate
the Russians, and especially Stalin,

290
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,954
who in the early 30s, orchestrated
a massive starvation policy

291
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,920
that killed as many as 7,000,000 people.

292
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,400
Many Ukrainians, some anti-Semitic, also
incriminate the Jews and carry out pogroms.

293
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,630
Such as here, in Zolochiv,
while the Germans look on.

294
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,210
In fact, many Ukrainians side with the Nazis.

295
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,980
But Germany will spoil this opportunity
to gain an ally.

296
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:44,990
Marshall Göring, the second highest ranking
figure in the Reich, comes to the Ukraine.

297
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,480
He says, "No useless mouths to feed.

298
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,190
Those who can work, will work
for the Reich. The rest, will die.

299
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,240
Those who work will give everything
they have until they themselves die."

300
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,600
Göring is here to implement this policy
of enslaving the Ukraine

301
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,390
and to carry out the methodical annihilation
of the Jews.

302
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:23,060
He's accompanied by Alfred Rosenberg,
a central theoretician of Nazi racism.

303
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,920
Himmler and Heydrich set up
execution commandos, called "Einsatzgruppen"

304
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,800
that are composed of SS members, policemen

305
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,940
and Wehrmacht soldiers,
who round up the Jews.

306
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,450
The SS take the Jews into the woods
and give them shovels

307
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:55,876
so that they can dig their own graves.

308
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,430
But they decide that this process is too slow.

309
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,740
So they order long, common graves to be dug

310
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,800
and make their victims lie down on top
of the last group of dead bodies.

311
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,280
But even this procedure takes too long.

312
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,353
The SS prepare a ravine known as "Babi Yar",
near Kiev.

313
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:06,400
33,771 Jews will be executed in 2 days.

314
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,330
Men, women and children.

315
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,380
In this living hell, as in hundreds of others
throughout the front,

316
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,980
the executioners take picture of their victims.

317
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,920
This premeditated, cold-blooded massacre
of a million Jews

318
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,990
will come to be known as
"The Holocaust by bullets".

319
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,993
But Himmler is not pleased.

320
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,600
He has attended one of the Einsatzgruppen
so called "Actionz".

321
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:47,240
Noticing the psychological burden that
these mass killings have for one soldiers,

322
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,040
he begins searching for alternative methods.

323
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,370
This would lead to the use of the gas vans

324
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,680
with exhaust pipes hooked up
to their rear compartments.

325
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:00,316
And a year later, the gas chambers.

326
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,710
In the north,
the long siege of Leningrad begins.

327
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,480
The Germans have their plan:
Instead of fighting in the streets,

328
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,500
we'll let our artillery and starvation do the job.

329
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,590
City buildings are destroyed.

330
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,630
A zoo elephant is the victim of an air raid.

331
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,880
Food rations soon fall below
the minimum necessary.

332
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,050
But the worst is to come
with the arrival of winter.

333
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:18,594
In the south, Guderian finally receives
the order from Hitler 

334
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:24,200
to rejoin the other armies up north,
and proceed towards Moscow.

335
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,280
Along this enormous front,
from Leningrad to Odessa,

336
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,310
the thrust towards Moscow
seems unstoppable.

337
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,010
The Germans take another 700,000 prisoners.

338
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,860
General Jodl, chief of staff
of the Wehrmacht says,

339
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,950
"We have won the war."

340
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,320
von Kageneck writes:

341
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,540
We suddenly have to deal with
a most frightful adversary.

342
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,710
the autumn rain and mud,
which the Russians call "Rasputiza".

343
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,790
Endless mud so gluey and sticky
that it sucks and holds onto everything.

344
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,520
It won't let go of anything.

345
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:25,000
Whether it be a tank, a truck,
a horse, or a man.

346
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:40,520
It makes any movement impossible.
We do 5 to 8 km a day, instead of 30.

347
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,770
Putting one foot in front of the other
requires superhuman effort.

348
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,360
The panzers, the pride of the Wehrmacht,
are brought to a standstill.

349
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,470
Hitler writes to his troops:
Soldiers on the eastern front.

350
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,440
Comrades, today begins the last,
great decisive battle.

351
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:23,586
And all at once, the German army starts
moving again towards Moscow

352
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,150
because the frost has come
and hardened the ground.

353
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,390
The world is holding its breath.
Will Hitler defeat Stalin?

354
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:39,068
This is when right wing extremists
in the occupied countries

355
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,600
start signing up to serve in the German Army.

356
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,640
Belgians, Danes, Dutchmen,

357
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,840
and the young men in the LVF,
the Legion of French Volunteers,

358
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:55,520
decide to don the German uniform
and fight on the Eastern Front.

359
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:05,861
They will suffer.

360
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,830
An early cold front sweeps through
beginning in November 1941.

361
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,830
Temperatures will plummet
to almost minus 40 degrees Celsius.

362
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:21,340
The Wehrmacht was designed to conduct
a blitzkrieg, a lightning war.

363
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,123
It was supposed to bring Russia
to its knees in 4 months.

364
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,490
It is not equipped for winter.

365
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,020
Guderian writes in his memoirs:

366
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,640
It was a sight to see those half starved,
insufficiently clothed men

367
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,430
fight over a poor shelter.

368
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,680
They fight to control even the tiniest village.

369
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,200
Losing a village, losing even a single izba,
means death.

370
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,260
The men die of cold or dysentery.

371
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,553
Diarrhea makes them run off 30 times a day.

372
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,820
Doctor Haape,
the Wehrmacht physician warns them,

373
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,930
"You have to choose,
if you pull down your trousers,

374
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,200
you'll freeze to death.
You must take apart the seam in the back,

375
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,530
so you won't have to pull them down."

376
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,340
In sharp contrast, the men in Afrika korps,
in the desert

377
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:27,540
are able to fry egg on the top of
the sizzling surfaces of their tanks,

378
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,880
while listening to the war song, "Lili Marlene".

379
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:51,000
The war in the desert is also getting
bogged down, in the sand.

380
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,560
Petrol and food supplies are lacking.
Rommel has to order a halt.

381
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,310
However, he is planning a new offensive.

382
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,380
And new sacrifices for his men
in the Afrika korps.

383
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,480
Meanwhile, on the road to Moscow,

384
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,550
the Germans are no longer able to wash
or change their clothes.

385
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,690
Like their enemies, they are driven crazy
by lice and parasites

386
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:20,181
that bring scabies and typhus.

387
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,490
Napoleon's Grand Army lost over
100,000 men to typhus.

388
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,840
In spite of it all, the Wehrmacht pushes on.

389
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,550
The German vanguard reaches
the outskirts of Moscow.

390
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,820
And even the end of the bus line that
goes straight to Red Square.

391
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:51,160
While the Soviet army holds back
the advancing German troops,

392
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,097
Stalin orders the parade commemorating
the anniversary of the revolution

393
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,200
to be held as usual.

394
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,880
To galvanize his troops, Stalin makes a speech
that invokes forbidden images from the past,

395
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,410
the great soldiers from the time of the Tsars.

396
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,190
"Be worthy of your glorious ancestors.

397
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:28,680
Alexander Nevsky, Dmitry Pozharsky,
Alexander Suvorov and Mikhail Kutuzov."

398
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,330
Stalin has organized Moscow's defense

399
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,520
in conjunction with one
of his most brilliant generals.

400
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:39,380
A tank specialist considered to be
the Russian equivalent of Guderian,

401
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,240
45 year old, General Zhukov.

402
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:46,087
Luck is on Zhukov's side.

403
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,650
Sorge, the Soviet spy, has discovered
that Japan, though it is Hitler's ally

404
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:57,080
has not decided to attack Russia, because
its primary enemy is the United States.

405
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,010
This enable Zhukov to reduce
the number of troops in the Far East.

406
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,070
He brings over several of
the Siberian divisions, they are well equipped.

407
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:10,372
Siberians are not afraid of the cold.

408
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,310
They are rugged outdoorsmen,
who used to using their wits.

409
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,780
They have brought their skis
and their reindeer with them.

410
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,760
And now they are going hunting, for Germans.

411
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,690
Zhukov wants to trap the Wehrmacht
on a pincer movement.

412
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,660
Some 30,000 Germans are killed or missing.

413
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,110
Thousands are sent off to Siberia.

414
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,310
Their struggle with the cold is far from over.

415
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,915
Less than 1 in 3 will return home,
almost 15 years later.

416
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:10,025
August von Kageneck is severely wounded
and evacuated back to Germany.

417
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,080
He writes:
Faith disappears, doubt becomes obsessive.

418
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,100
Death becomes your best friend,
man's only friend,

419
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,190
because it will deliver you from your suffering.

420
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,280
The suffering of the Russians is not over either.
Their country has been ravaged.

421
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,450
Moscow has been saved, but millions of people
have been killed or taken prisoner.

422
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,160
And the danger is still there.

423
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,760
The Wehrmacht
has been pushed back 200 km.

424
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,720
Hitler orders his army
to defend that new line at all costs.

425
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:14,640
He dismisses 35 generals, including Guderian
and takes personal charge of the Wehrmacht.

426
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:24,700
He will succeed in re-establishing
his army's position.

427
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,130
Re-equipping his troops
and plotting his revenge.

428
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,890
The Wehrmacht remains firmly planted
in Russia.

429
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,860
Hitler returns to his dogs back
in his chalet in Bavaria.

430
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:47,125
In his opinion the defeat before Moscow was
the fault of his generals and his diplomats.

431
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,730
Weren't they the one's who had claimed

432
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,030
that France and Britain
wouldn't go to war for Poland?

433
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,280
And of the Abwehr,
the German Intelligence Service,

434
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:58,590
that misinformed him about
the state of the Russian army.

435
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,760
Hitler adds,
"The Bolshevik army is made up of peasants

436
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,240
who fight with barbarian unconsciousness,

437
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,480
and workers, trained by the fanatical mysticism
of communism."

438
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,600
But Hitler believes in his lucky star.
He will prevail.

439
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:24,990
He can enjoy himself in the company
of his sycophants.

440
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,280
Here, Bormann's mistress introduces him
to a German movie star,

441
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,830
the actress, Magda Schneider.

442
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,354
Not far away, her daughter, Romy Schneider,
plays with Bormann's children.

443
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,480
Life in Germany is still carefree.
The massive bombings have not yet begun.

444
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:02,400
And those who sacrificed their lives
in Moscow are so far away, deep in the snow.

445
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:10,600
Two days after Hitler's first major defeat, 
his ally, Japan, launches a surprise attack

446
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,181
on the United States' big naval base
in the Pacific, Pearl Harbor.

447
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:23,000
And with this wave of Japanese planes,
the war becomes a world war.

448
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,270
In London, Rose dances.
She is already dreaming of Christmas.

449
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,002
She hears her parents say,

450
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,760
"Now the Americans will fight on our side,
the Russians are on our side.

451
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,000
We, British are no longer alone in this,
anymore."
