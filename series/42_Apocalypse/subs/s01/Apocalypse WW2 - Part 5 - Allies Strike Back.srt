1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,760
By the end of October 1942,
the city on the Volga still has not fallen.

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,830
The Führer announces to the German people,

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,900
"We have taken Stalingrad.
A few pockets of resistance remain.

4
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,670
We will take them one by one.
It is just a question of time."

5
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,750
For Hitler, Stalingrad has come
to represent his victory over Russia.

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,000
ALLIES STRIKE BACK

7
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,080
After 2 years of fighting in Russia,

8
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,390
the Germans have threatened to vanquish
the "Eastern Giant".

9
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,840
In the north,
Leningrad is surrounded by the Germans.

10
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,770
It has been a year since the Germans entered
this northern city.

11
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,600
In the center, Moscow, the target city,
remains just within reach for the Germans.

12
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,240
In the south, the drive towards
the Baku oil fields

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,920
has come to a halt in the Caucasus mountains.

14
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,120
In Stalingrad,
the Soviets are holding their ground.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,450
Contrary to Hitler's declarations,

16
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,720
Soviet boats continue to cross the Volga,
bringing over reinforcements.

17
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,357
Everyday, thousands of young Russian men,

18
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,000
sometimes without any weapons
or military training

19
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,360
are disembarked on the riverbanks.

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,320
Those who back away from the German shells

21
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
are ruthlessly executed
by the political commissars.

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,960
On the 7th of November,
the anniversary of the revolution,

23
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,840
the beleaguered soldiers holding Stalingrad
and the Soviet troops all along the front,

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,720
listen to their commander-in-chief, Stalin,
make this astonishing declaration:

25
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,560
Tomorrow, there will be celebrations
in our streets.

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,640
And indeed, general Zhukov,
the man who saved Moscow

27
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,160
has a plan to keep those pockets of resistance
fighting to the very end

28
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,360
in order to retain the German troops
of general Paulus inside Stalingrad.

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,010
On the other side of the Volga, Zhukov is
secretly putting together an entire army.

30
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,480
The country has been ravaged,
one-fourth of its territory lost.

31
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,185
But the entire Soviet Union is toiling away

32
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,520
to provide this new army with huge amounts
of equipment.

33
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,990
Factories that were moved out
and rebuilt behind the Ural mountains

34
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,860
are operating 24 hours a day.

35
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,800
In this endeavor, lives will be sacrificed.

36
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,960
It is the winter of 1942.

37
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,480
The women working in these unheated,

38
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,080
sometimes ruthless workshops,
are cold and hungry.

39
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
Many will die of exhaustion.

40
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,320
But the country's industrial production
will increase tenfold.

41
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,840
The United States is now providing
massive amounts of aid to the Soviet Union.

42
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,640
The Allies are able to reduce the threat,posed by
the German submarines in the North Atlantic

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,600
by forming protective convoys to Soviet ports,
such as Murmansk.

44
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,280
Anti-communism is put on hold.

45
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,040
For the Americans,
Joseph Stalin is now, "Uncle Joe"

46
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,160
and for the British, "Good Old Joe".

47
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,480
The Russians receive huge shipments
of jeeps, tanks, planes, and trucks.

48
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,840
And cans of corned beef.

49
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,120
When they open the tins of meat,
the Russian soldiers joke,

50
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,640
"We're opening the second front."

51
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,200
Along with Stalin, everyone expects the Allies
to do more to alleviate their plight.

52
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,829
In Egypt however, the British are being
threatened by the Germans.

53
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,000
Rommel, whom Hitler just promoted to
Field Marshall after his victories in the desert,

54
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
and his tank army, the Afrika korps,

55
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,760
are getting dangerously close
to the Suez Canal.

56
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,280
They have reached El Alamein.
The British Empire is in peril.

57
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,920
The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill
comes to encourage his army in the desert.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,400
The situation is grim,
but he retains his sense of humor

59
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,240
and shares cheerful moments with his men.

60
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,200
He meets with the newly appointed
general Montgomery.

61
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,560
Montgomery wasn't Churchill's first choice.

62
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,880
And all of these soldiers in the desert
are a little worried.

63
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,560
The British, the Australians, the New Zealanders,
the South Africans and the Free French.

64
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,320
As soon as he arrived, Montgomery,
the son of a clergyman,

65
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,860
ordered a new program of strict rules
and discipline to be imposed.

66
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,330
He is cautious,
he waits until his army is superior

67
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,640
in terms of both men and equipment.

68
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,920
The new American Sherman tanks
for example, built for speed and power.

69
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,960
Montgomery launches his offensive
with a preliminary artillery barrage,

70
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,989
followed by a massive tank assault.

71
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,480
But the German 88 flak guns
cause tremendous losses.

72
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,530
Rommel's soldiers counterattack relentlessly.

73
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,480
The battle turns into a bayonet charge
just like in the Battle of the Somme in 1916,

74
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,450
with heavy casualties on both sides.

75
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,280
In this deadly game, it is the side
with the most men that wins.

76
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,600
In a letter to his wife, Rommel writes:

77
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,120
We're simply being crushed
by the enemy's weight.

78
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,320
He receives a message from Hitler:

79
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,800
There can be no other thought than
to stand fast, yield not a yard of ground.

80
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,520
Rommel writes back to his wife:

81
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,600
I wracked my brains for a way
of this plight for my poor troops.

82
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,280
We are facing, perhaps the most
difficult days that a man can undergo.

83
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,400
And he adds: The dead are lucky.
It's all over for them.

84
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Rommel retreats.

85
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,400
In London, Churchill announces
to his fellow citizens

86
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,880
what is really the first good news of the war.

87
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,480
Now this is not the end.
It is not even the beginning of the end.

88
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,840
But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.

89
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,800
Churchill's words ring out around the world.
The old British lion has stood up to Hitler.

90
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,760
Back in his headquarters, the Wolf's Lair,
Hitler is scornful.

91
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,800
He says, "It is just a set-back.
The war will go on."

92
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,160
And indeed it does.
The Allies open up a new front in North Africa.

93
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,640
A first step towards controlling
the Mediterranean.

94
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,850
As in 1917, American troops sail across
the Atlantic.

95
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,040
The French writer, Antoine de Saint Exupery,
who is exiled in New York,

96
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,960
will return from the US with one
of these military convoys.

97
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,520
The author of the "Little Prince" writes:

98
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,360
Friends in America,
I'd like to do you complete justice.

99
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,200
50,000 soldiers were going to war
not only for the United States

100
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:32,480
but for humanity, for human respect,
for human freedom and human greatness.

101
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,489
Off the coast of Casablanca and Oran,

102
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,430
the British and Americans are greeted
with cannon fire from the Vichy French.

103
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:52,738
They counterattack.

104
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,040
North Africa is still controlled
by the Vichy regime

105
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,320
which collaborates with the Germans.

106
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,570
The fighting is violent and the Vichy forces
suffer extensive damage.

107
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,080
The Free France Leader, general de Gaulle,
makes a speech over the radio in London:

108
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,600
To the French leaders, soldiers, sailors,
airmen, civil servants.

109
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,200
French colonials on North Africa,
I say, rise up!

110
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,680
Help our Allies!
Join them without hesitation.

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,040
After 2 days of fighting against the liberators,
the guns are silenced.

112
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,210
The Allies secure their landing.

113
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,280
In Algiers, the pragmatic
US commander-in-chief, general Eisenhower, 

114
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,850
negotiates with the Vichy regime's
military commander, admiral Darlan.

115
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,160
Darlan is one of
France's most die-hard collaborators

116
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,890
who had even met Hitler.

117
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,930
He decides to switch sides.

118
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,200
And the French forces in Algeria and Morocco
join the Allies.

119
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,160
A few weeks later, Darlan will be assassinated
by a French resistance fighter.

120
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,240
Many of the French in North Africa
greet the Americans warmly.

121
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,220
The "Zouaves" in the French army of Africa
are also relieved.

122
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,990
They never really want to shoot
the Americans.

123
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,520
In fact, they will soon be fighting
side-by-side with them.

124
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
Like almost all of the others French colonials.

125
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,640
As will the "indigenous soldiers",
as they are called at the time

126
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,710
who will form the Moroccan and Algerian
"Tirailleur Units".

127
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,320
The Axis Power has anticipated the Allies
by moving into Tunisia,

128
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,200
a territory still controlled by Vichy regime,
which allows Germans to stay.

129
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,840
Rommel is retreating towards Tunisia.

130
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,520
Two days later, in order to secure
the Mediterranean coast,

131
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,200
Hitler invades southern France,
the hitherto unoccupied free zone.

132
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,320
Hitler's orders are to take the port of Toulon
where most of the Vichy navy is based.

133
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,760
With their shaky autonomy now at risk,
the Vichy admirals decide to scuttle their fleet.

134
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,880
They proceed to sink their own ships,

135
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,360
in order to keep them from falling
into the hands of the Germans or the Allies.

136
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
That is the tragic result
of the politics of the Vichy regime.

137
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,040
But it's not good news for Hitler.

138
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,410
With the arrival of the Germans, those Jews

139
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,360
hiding in the remaining pockets
of French tolerance

140
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,960
have little chance of survival.

141
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,480
Amidst the increasingly sinister atmosphere
of round-ups

142
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,560
and denunciations all over Europe,
children are saved by courageous families.

143
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,410
Like Carl de Brouwer's family.
He is a Belgian banker.

144
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,440
He films his 4 children, while he and his wife,
Denise, hide 2 Jewish children.

145
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,280
Monique Mogoulsky,
the 12 year-old daughter of an engineer

146
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,720
who is hiding somewhere himself.

147
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,160
And 6 year-old, Adrien Sapcaru.

148
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,480
Adrien's mother was arrested and deported
to a work camp in eastern Europe.

149
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,720
She will never return from Auschwitz.

150
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,440
By now, many people suspect that when
the occupiers use words like "Work camp",

151
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,240
its true meaning is death.

152
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,960
Carl and Denise du Brouwer
are everyday heroes

153
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,160
who will one day be awarded the title of 
"Righteous among the Nations"

154
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,440
along with more than 20,000 other men
and women from all over occupied Europe.

155
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,520
3.000 km away, outside of Stalingrad,

156
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,080
the Germans have been enjoying
a brief respite behind the lines 

157
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,240
before returning to fight the Russians

158
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,350
in order to eliminate their remaining pockets
of resistance.

159
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,120
The German army's flanks are defended
by units from the Reich's satellite countries.

160
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,800
Romanians, Hungarians and Italians

161
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,700
who are totally unaware of the danger
looming just around the corner.

162
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,660
A few km away, the Soviet troops
are preparing to attack.

163
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,640
They are ready to fight
and there are over a million of them.

164
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,040
They are going to storm
the enemy's weakest units

165
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,180
in order to surround the German army
occupying Stalingrad.

166
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,320
At 7 AM,
the Soviets obliterate the enemy's lines.

167
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,130
Pounding them with the rocket launchers
they call "Stalin's organs".

168
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Zhukov's massive army launches the offensive.

169
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,760
The Hungarians
don't have enough ammunition.

170
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,080
The Romanians don't have any anti-tank weapons.

171
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,800
They, as well as the Italians,
lost a massive number of men.

172
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,640
The two Soviet armies from the north
and the south meet up.

173
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,840
Soviet filmmakers use their skills
to glorify the moment.

174
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,260
The Germans see the Soviet tanks
close the circle around them.

175
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,800
General Paulus's 6th Army is trapped
inside Stalingrad.

176
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,400
Hitler is in the Berghof, his retreat
in Berchtesgaden in the Bavarian Alps,

177
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,230
where he is informed of the Soviet offensive.

178
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,880
His immediate reaction is to hide this news
from the German people.

179
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,960
He rushes off to his headquarters
in East Prussia, declaring,

180
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,680
"If the 6th army withdraws from Stalingrad,
the Wehrmacht will never be able to return."

181
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,800
Paulus could still break out of the encirclement
but he would have to obey orders.

182
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,720
For when Hitler arrives at the Wolf's Lair
he sends him this message:

183
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,150
Stand firm, an army will come to rescue you.

184
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,080
But no army is able to reach them.

185
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,400
And the aeroplanes of the Luftwaffe,
fail to deliver sufficient supplies

186
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,080
in spite of the promises made by
the Head of the Air Force, Hermann Göring.

187
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,800
At Christmas, rations are reduced to
50 grams of bread and 12 grams of fat.

188
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,680
Mussolini, who has just lost an army
in Stalingrad

189
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,530
is looking for a way to shift German attention
back to North Africa.

190
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,160
He writes to Hitler: In my opinion,
Russia can never be annihilated.

191
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,160
She is defended by her very size,
a territory so vast,

192
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,160
that it can never be conquered or held.

193
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,600
The Russian chapter is over,
we should make peace with Stalin.

194
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,355
What would Hitler do?

195
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,947
To negotiate would be to admit that the campaign
in Russia was a huge failure.

196
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,580
Future events however,
would not give Hitler the choice.

197
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,840
Roosevelt, the President of the United States,
has arrived in Casablanca in Morocco

198
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,200
to attend one of the most important meetings
in modern history.

199
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,800
He and Churchill want to settle
the prickly question of French political power.

200
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,720
Roosevelt wants to exclude de Gaulle

201
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,760
who since 1940
has been claiming his legitimacy

202
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,160
as the leader
of the French resistance movement.

203
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,640
Roosevelt says, "General de Gaulle is a soldier.
Certainly a patriot and devoted to his country.

204
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,120
But on the other hand,
he is also a politician and a sectarian.

205
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,960
And I believe in him,
he has all the attributes of a dictator.

206
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,000
Roosevelt prefers to invite
another a France's great leaders

207
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,520
to Casablanca, general Giraud.

208
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,640
Taken prisoner in 1940,
he has just escaped from Germany

209
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,200
and arrived in North Africa.

210
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,200
He cuts a dashing figure.

211
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,040
Churchill continues to support de Gaulle
who he invites in order to reconcile

212
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,280
the two rival generals,
which is not an easy task.

213
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,640
Roosevelt and Churchill agree
that future cooperation

214
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,480
between the two adversaries
is necessary in order to save France.

215
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,400
It is obvious that Roosevelt has
warmer feelings for Giraud than for de Gaulle.

216
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,680
Then at the closing press conference,

217
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,920
Roosevelt and Churchill make a declaration
of the utmost importance.

218
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,240
With great vehemence,
they pronounce the words

219
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,560
that henceforth will become the Allies credo.

220
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,800
Unconditional surrender by Germany,
Japan and Italy.

221
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,479
There will be no more negotiating.

222
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,170
The Allies will keep fighting the Axis Powers
until the very end.

223
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,290
The price in lives will be high.

224
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,320
And many believe that this radical position,
who purpose is to reassure the Soviets,

225
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,960
will only serve to increase
the German devotion to their Führer.

226
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:33,280
Stalin is satisfied.

227
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,730
He feared that Hitler will conclude
a separate peace with the Allies

228
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,330
in order to pit all of his forces against Russia.

229
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,600
He launches his offensive to annihilate
the beast still lurking in the ruins of Stalingrad.

230
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,320
Beyond the red flag, is the Univermag store

231
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,480
where the commander of the 6th Army,
general Friedrich Paulus, is entrenched.

232
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,720
His men surrender.

233
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,600
The day before, Hitler had promoted him
to Field Marshall,

234
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,320
thinking it would compel him to commit suicide
in order to save his honor.

235
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,410
Paulus however, on the verge of collapse,
weakened by dysentery

236
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,320
and revolted by the absurdity of Hitler's orders
allows himself to be captured.

237
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,480
Field Marshall Paulus is an extraordinary prize
for the Soviets.

238
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,320
He is the man that masterminded
Operation Barbarossa.

239
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,170
The plan to invade the Soviet Union.

240
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,770
The Soviet leaders can hardly believe it.

241
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,160
Paulus will collaborate with the Soviets
and testify at the Nuremberg trials

242
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,180
against his former commanders,
such as Keitel.

243
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:36,240
When he is released in 1953,
he will settle in East Germany.

244
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,160
His reaction is mainly a rejection
of Hitler's outrageous policies.

245
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,840
Many of his men feel the same way.

246
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,424
Hitler can go to the devil!

247
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,080
The German prisoners dare to mutter
in a few words of Russian they know.

248
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:53,443
We want to go home.

249
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,520
We can only imagine how the people
in the occupied countries must have felt.

250
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,280
After the German defeat in Stalingrad,
hope is revived.

251
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,560
The German news broadcasts do not,
of course, show any of these images.

252
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,040
And Hitler says,
"We must not use the word "surrender".

253
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,880
We must explain that our men were unable
to receive supplies

254
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:26,280
and that is why they were beaten.
We have to use the word "sacrifice".

255
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,040
The Nazis want to turn this national disaster

256
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,800
into an opportunity for galvanizing
the German people.

257
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,560
The Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels,
assumes the task of mobilizing

258
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,090
all the nation's energy
and resources towards this end.

259
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,800
I ask you,
do you want total war?

260
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Yes!

261
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,560
A war that is even more total
and more radical

262
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,560
than anything we could ever
imagine?

263
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,560
Yes!

264
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,640
People, rise up!
Let the storm break loose!

265
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,640
Deutschland, Deutschland über alles
Germany, Germany above everything

266
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,600
Above everything in the world!

267
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,160
Deutschland, Deutschland über alles
Germany, Germany above everything

268
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,280
In the audience,
seemingly ecstatic is Albert Speer.

269
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,120
He will furnish Hitler with the means
to implement total war.

270
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,120
Hitler calls him, "His only friend".

271
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,960
The 38 year-old architect,
builder of the Führer's megalomaniac edifices

272
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,400
has been appointed Minister of Armaments.

273
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,400
Speer gives new impetus
to the German war industry.

274
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,120
He is a masterful organizer,
but above all, he is an adamant Nazi.

275
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Under his orders, millions of foreign
or Jewish civilians will be rounded up

276
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,560
and worked to exhaustion or to death.

277
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,560
After Russia and Poland, occupied France

278
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,040
is the country that provides the Nazis
with the greatest number of workers.

279
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,000
The Vichy regime institutes
a compulsory labor service

280
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,800
and drafts 600,000 French workers
for Germany.

281
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:56,440
Those who want to evade the service take to
the forest and join the resistance movement.

282
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,320
The song of this group is the "Partisan" song.

283
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,800
Friend, do hear the dark flight
of the crows over our plains?

284
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,240
Friend, do you hear the dulled cries
of our country in chains?

285
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,800
Partisans, laborers, farmers,
take up your arms!

286
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,480
Underground resistance groups had been
created in all of the occupied countries.

287
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,800
Tonight the enemy shall know
the price of blood and tears.

288
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,960
Come out of the mines,
come down from the hills, comrades!

289
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,600
Take the guns, munitions and grenades
from under the bay!

290
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,440
Hey you, hitmen,
with bullets and knives, kill swiftly!

291
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,720
Hey you saboteurs, watch out
for your load of dynamite!

292
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,440
We break open the jail bars
for our brothers.

293
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,200
Here, we march on, we kill and we die.

294
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,240
Friend, if you fall, a friend from
the shadows will take your place.

295
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,400
Behind the walls of the Warsaw ghetto

296
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,930
the Germans are confronted
by a Jewish uprising.

297
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,120
Before the war, this area of Warsaw
was a lively open district.

298
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,760
Filmed in color here by an American tourist.

299
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,920
In 1940, the Nazis turned
this pleasant area of Warsaw

300
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,640
into an over-populated prison.

301
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,000
This woman shrieks in grief as she carries
her dead child through the streets.

302
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,670
The Warsaw ghetto in 1941.

303
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,120
The ghetto in 1942.

304
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,330
The ghetto in 1943.

305
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,400
The Nazis deliberately starve
the people in order to kill, weaken

306
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:03,029
and prevent any kind of revolt.

307
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,000
But the Jews manage to acquire weapons,
and they die fighting.

308
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:13,640
The survivors are deported
to the Treblinka extermination camps

309
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:15,775
and executed.

310
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,180
The ghetto is razed to the ground.

311
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,040
At the same time,
the Allies win another victory.

312
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,030
They enter Tunis.

313
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,440
Behind these gates,
the Germans had already initiated policies

314
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,720
to persecute the Jews in Tunisia
during their short occupation.

315
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,640
The Jews immediately take the opportunity
to remove their yellow stars.

316
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,930
The Italian prisoners receive insulting gestures
from the crowd.

317
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,520
Rommel, who is still in Tunisia,
is filmed by a German officer

318
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,360
before boarding one of the last planes
leaving for Germany.

319
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,840
In March 1943, he wrote:

320
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,040
I have received instructions to take sick leave
and get myself back into shape.

321
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,680
All my efforts to save my men and get them
back to the continent have been fruitless.

322
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,800
Orders have been issued
by the Führer's headquarters

323
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,760
to maintain the utmost secrecy
concerning my recall to Germany.

324
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,160
My military reputation
is still to serve as a deterrent.

325
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,720
The Afrika korps has been captured

326
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,120
and is now marching in long lines
towards the American fleet's ships

327
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,390
to be taken away
to the other side of the Atlantic.

328
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,520
During the war, 380,000 Germans will be sent
over to Canada and the United States

329
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,440
from where escape is impossible.

330
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,600
These prisoners are about to embark
on a strange odyssey.

331
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:37,880
It begins on these military transport ships.
Many feel like they're in a dream.

332
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,980
For them, the war is over and they are safe.

333
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,600
However, for these German soldiers,
the dream will soon turn into a nightmare,

334
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,200
because even here,
the Nazis remain in control.

335
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,440
These men coming off the boat in Canada,
insist on making the salute.

336
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,280
Even those with just one arm.

337
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,760
Some prisoners are sent to camps
in Virginia and Texas.

338
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,960
They work on cotton or tobacco plantations.

339
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,290
In these barracks, Nazi law continues
to terrorize the prisoners.

340
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,960
LONG LIVE OUR FÜHRER

341
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,120
Within a short time, Nazi officers
have taken control of the prisons.

342
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,240
Using intimidation, torture and even murder

343
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,560
to maintain fascist ideology
among their fellow prisoners.

344
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,960
And this message must reach
the German soldiers,

345
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,080
fighting and suffering on all of the German fronts.

346
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,800
They have to understand
that they have nothing to gain

347
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,800
from turning themselves in to the Allies.

348
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,440
On the eastern front,
ever since the fall of Stalingrad,

349
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,080
the Wehrmacht is never the same.

350
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,720
The soldiers exchange rumors
about the Führer.

351
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,280
Apparently he's lost his head!
He's being secretly held in Berchtesgaden.

352
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
It's his double that we're seeing.

353
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,720
But no, it is Hitler himself, filmed here
in Berchtesgaden by his mistress, Eva Braun.

354
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,400
Since his army's defeat in Stalingrad
and El Alamein, he's changed.

355
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,120
His famous moustache has grayed.

356
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,920
One of his generals, Von Senger,
is struck by his appearance.

357
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,960
He says, "His skin was flaccid.

358
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,480
The look in his blue eyes
which had mesmerized the crowds

359
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,840
was reddened by insomnia."

360
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,960
In fact, his physician, Doctor Morrel
has concocted cocaine eye drops for him.

361
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,720
Morrel is filmed here on the 20th of April, 1943,
with the secretaries and close friends

362
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,360
who have come to wish the Führer
a happy birthday.

363
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,680
He is only 54.

364
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,760
Morell is able to make him presentable
for ceremonies.

365
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,160
Hitler, however, is careful to keep
his left arm under control.

366
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,460
It tends to tremble.

367
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,680
He is already showing signs
of Parkinson's disease.

368
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,240
As a result, the head of the SS, Himmler,
becomes even more important.

369
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,160
The SS, whose recruits were now
coming from the Hitler youth,

370
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,000
started out as the Schutzstafell,
the protection squad for the Nazi officials.

371
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,680
Later, it would provide the guards
for the concentration camps.

372
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,840
The SS has now created a veritable army
of its own, the "Waffen SS".

373
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,760
In the future, these elite troops,
under Himmler's orders

374
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,640
are expected to replace the Wehrmacht,
which is no longer considered completely loyal.

375
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,440
Increasingly, Himmler recruits
from the occupied countries.

376
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,720
Fanatics such as these Bosnian SS.

377
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,960
In the occupied areas of Russia,

378
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,480
the SS also has no problem
recruiting two divisions of Cossacks

379
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,400
who during the time of the Tsars

380
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,360
were already known
for their bloody anti-Semitic pogroms.

381
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,720
They will form
the fearsome 15th SS Cavalry Corps.

382
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,680
As for the Wehrmacht, it will enlist
as many as 1,000,000 Soviet prisoners

383
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,160
who have no other choice.

384
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,680
They can either die of hunger
or fight alongside the Germans.

385
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:42,680
Some, like former Soviet general,
Andrey Vlasov, are also against Stalin.

386
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,960
After the German siege of Leningrad,
Vlasov was taken prisoner and changed sides.

387
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,320
He will command the Russian Liberation Army
under the flag of the Wehrmacht.

388
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,640
The Germans outfit this veritable foreign
legion of theirs with the best equipment.

389
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,770
Such as the Tiger tank, designed by
the brilliant engineer, Ferdinand Porsche.

390
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,760
With its 88 mm gun, the Tiger was
the most dreaded of the German tanks.

391
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,040
As a result, back in the Wolf's Lair,
Hitler starts to feel hopeful again.

392
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,370
He can now renew his obsession
with destroying the Red Army.

393
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,853
He wants to attack at Kursk.

394
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,200
The Russians have pushed forward
into the frontlines

395
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,560
and Germany will launch
a massive summer offensive.

396
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,920
"Operation Citadel",
the biggest tank battle in history.

397
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,680
2,700 German tanks are preparing to combat
3,600 Soviet tanks.

398
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,440
But the technical superiority
of the German Tiger,

399
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,080
appears to be overwhelming.

400
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,520
Hitler knows the importance of this battle.
To lead his force of 900,000 soldiers,

401
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,000
he has chosen the man who helped him to win
the Battle of France,

402
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,690
Field Marshall von Manstein.

403
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,880
The offensive, led by the Tiger tanks,
breaks through the Soviet lines.

404
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,040
But encounters a brutal anti-armor defense,
set up by the Soviets

405
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,280
and dense concentrations of tanks.

406
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,200
The Wehrmacht's troops are pushed back.

407
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,760
Even the formidable Tiger tanks
are falling victim to the Soviets.

408
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,760
And the Soviets have a secret weapon.

409
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,520
The British have succeeded
in capturing and decoding

410
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,470
the German encryption machine,
called "Enigma".

411
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,010
And they are now able to read
all of the most secret German orders.

412
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,380
The powerful Soviet Secret Service
in Great Britain

413
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,920
had managed to pass on
the decoded operation plans to Moscow.

414
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,430
This war is also an espionage war.

415
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,440
At Kursk, the outcome is devastating
for the Germans

416
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,470
who have already lost 50,000 men
in this battle.

417
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,680
Von Manstein wants reinforcements
in order to continue his offensive.

418
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,600
He is waiting for Hitler.

419
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,320
He immediately tells him,

420
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,840
"We have suffered losses,
but the Russians have too. Even worse."

421
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,160
Hitler seems very hesitant.
He mutters a few inanities.

422
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,160
Von Manstein will write:
He seems to me to be quite feeble.

423
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,320
This impression is confirmed,
when von Manstein shows Hitler

424
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,444
the figures of the losses incurred at Kursk.

425
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:45,720
Since the beginning of the war,
2,000,000 German soldiers

426
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,840
have already been killed, wounded
or gone missing in action.

427
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:52,822
Hitler will never be able to fill that void.

428
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,790
Things are now a far cry from
the victories of the lightning war campaigns,

429
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,530
the Blitzkrieg of the Battle of France.

430
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,200
Kursk is the real turning point in the war
because Hitler moves over to the defensive.

431
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,880
Overcome by paranoia, he insists on having
stenographers present.

432
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,716
Von Manstein does not believe that
everything is lost, but Hitler disagrees.

433
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:30,630
Von Manstein implores him to continue
the offensive. Hitler refuses.

434
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,130
The Battle of Kursk is over.

435
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,770
For Hitler, the priority now
is to send reinforcements over to Sicily

436
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,970
where the Allies have just landed.

437
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,040
The noose is tightening.
Things are moving fast.

438
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:57,687
All Hitler can do is try to hold back
the advancing Allies.

439
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,830
But he is unable to prevent
the fall of Mussolini,

440
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:09,400
which leads Italy to surrender
and to change sides.

441
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,610
The new Italian government has
Mussolini imprisoned, up in the mountains.

442
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,320
Hitler sends an airborne commando unit
to rescue him.

443
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,280
Hitler wants Mussolini back in power.

444
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,320
He sends him back to Italy to reestablish
his fascist regime

445
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,810
with the help of the German army.

446
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,840
The Germans invade Italy

447
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,920
and have no qualms about slaughtering
their former allies who attempt to resist.

448
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:57,200
The Germans immediately start going
after the Jews in Rome, Milan,

449
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,920
Genoa, Florence and Trieste.

450
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,720
Hitler's greatest concern is to prevent
any further Allied landings in Italy,

451
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,890
and above all, in France.

452
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,140
This is the idea behind "Fortress Europe",
whose emblem is the Atlantic wall.

453
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,560
A staggering system of fortifications

454
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,520
stretching from Norway,
down to the Spanish border.

455
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,080
Rommel is put in charge
of defending "Fortress Europe".

456
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,520
He says, "It is absolutely necessary that we
push the British and Americans

457
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,800
back from the beaches.
Afterwards, it will be too late.

458
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,800
The first 24 hours of the invasion
will be decisive.

459
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,790
It will be, the longest day."

460
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,960
For Rommel and the Nazis, this is
the beginning of the twilight of the Gods.

461
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,040
The final months of Nazi Germany.

462
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,920
And yet, these German newsreel images
of Rommel

463
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,540
who had been invited to tea
by Magda Goebbels,

464
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,440
the wife of the propaganda minister,

465
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,650
are revealing of the moods of the Nazis
at this point of the war.

466
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,480
Nazi ideology puts faith in victory
and vanquishes doubt.

467
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,920
Magda Goebbels worshipps Hitler like a god.

468
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,200
Even though he is driving Germany into
a frenzy of bloodshed and death.

469
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,280
Magda Goebbels has given all
of her 6 children first names

470
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,540
that begin with the letter "H",
just like Hitler.

471
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:40,040
Helga, Hildegard, Holdine,
Helmut, Hedwig and Heidrun.

472
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:45,360
She would kill them all, one by one,
on the last day of the Reich.
