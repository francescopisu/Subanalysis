00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:22,970
<i>Your Grace.</i>

3
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:26,707
The trial will be
getting under way soon.

4
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,541
You got my money?

5
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:02,943
Later.
Go away.

6
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:16,056
Grand Maester.

7
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:58,932
Ser Loras Tyrell.

8
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,504
Are you prepared to stand trial

9
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:07,307
and profess your guilt or
innocence before the Seven?

10
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,312
There'll be no need for a trial.

11
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:17,217
I confess before the Seven

12
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,319
and freely admit to my crimes.

13
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:23,557
To which crimes
will you be confessing?

14
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,993
All of them.

15
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,430
I lay with other men

16
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:32,966
including the traitor
Renly Baratheon.

17
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:39,239
<i>I perjured myself before the gods.</i>

18
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:41,642
I am guilty of depravity...

19
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:45,145
dishonesty,

20
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,714
profligacy,

21
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:49,683
<i>and arrogance.</i>

22
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,218
I see that now.

23
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:55,823
I humble myself before the Seven

24
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:59,326
and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

25
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:06,233
The gods' judgment is fierce,

26
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:08,869
but also fair.

27
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,339
The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

28
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:14,708
beyond the reach of justice.

29
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:19,279
But the Mother shows her mercy

30
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:23,183
to those who kneel before her.

31
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:33,927
<i>I take full
responsibility for my many sins</i>

32
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,530
and unburden myself of my desires.

33
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,936
My only remaining wish

34
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,639
is to devote my life to the Seven.

35
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:48,809
<i>May I be a living example
of their grace</i>

36
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,578
<i>for others to witness.</i>

37
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:56,617
You understand fully

38
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:58,552
what this means?

39
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:00,154
I do.

40
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,858
I will abandon the Tyrell name

41
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,995
and all that goes with it.

42
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:11,865
I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

43
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:17,738
I will never marry

44
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
and I will never father children.

45
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:25,779
<i>Brother Loras...</i>

46
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:30,651
...I ask you to dedicate
your life to the seven gods.

47
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,691
Will you fight to defend your faith

48
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:40,227
against heretics and apostates?

49
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:41,829
I will.

50
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,192
No, I can't let them--

51
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:15,262
Faith is the way, Father.

52
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,986
All right.

53
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:41,922
I'm ready.

54
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:51,865
I have to go.
I'm--

55
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,901
I'm late for the trial.

56
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:09,149
<i>You mutilated him.</i>

57
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,151
You gave me your word.

58
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:13,620
And I have kept my word.

59
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:16,490
<i>Once the queen mother's
trial is concluded,</i>

60
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,625
<i>Brother Loras is free to leave.</i>

61
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:20,627
And where is the queen mother?

62
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:23,997
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

63
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:28,035
It appears the queen mother doesn't
wish to attend her own trial.

64
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:33,106
Go to the Red Keep
and show her the way.

65
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,735
Get the others.

66
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:45,712
Where's the king?

67
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,617
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

68
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,352
What's the meaning of this?

69
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:54,321
I was told that--

70
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,889
ah.

71
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,091
I have more important
things to do with my time

72
00:11:58,193 --> 00:11:59,559
than waste them
in the presence--

73
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:02,329
Please, Grand Maester.
I bear you no ill will.

74
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,133
Please forgive me if you can.

75
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,033
This pains me, my lord.

76
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,202
Whatever your faults,
you do not deserve

77
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,272
to die alone in such
a cold, dark place.

78
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:49,109
But sometimes before
we can usher in the new,

79
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:53,346
the old must be put to rest.

80
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,624
The longer you wait,
the worse it'll be for you.

81
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,620
What are you doing?

82
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,056
There's something wrong.

83
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:18,625
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

84
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,594
The trial will begin shortly.

85
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:23,396
Cersei is not here.
Tommen is not here.

86
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:24,858
Why do you think they're not here?

87
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,766
If the accused is not here,

88
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:28,935
she will be tried regardless.

89
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,271
We cannot escape
the justice of the gods--

90
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:34,007
Forget about the bloody gods and
listen to what I'm telling you.

91
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:37,544
Cersei understands the
consequences of her absence

92
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,412
and she is absent anyway,

93
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:43,383
which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

94
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:47,354
The trial can wait.
We all need to leave.

95
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:15,248
We all need to leave now.

96
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:22,656
Loras.

97
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:24,924
Stay with me.

98
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,173
Let me through.
Let me through.

99
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,344
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

100
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:54,587
Let us through.

101
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:26,079
<i>Confess.</i>

102
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,216
<i>Confess.</i>

103
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,556
- No.
- Confess.

104
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,002
Confess.
It felt good.

105
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:52,806
Beating me, starving me,

106
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:55,809
frightening me, humiliating me.

107
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:01,581
<i>You didn't do it because
you cared about my atonement.</i>

108
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,818
You did it because it felt good.

109
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,153
<i>I understand.</i>

110
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:10,423
I do things because they feel good.

111
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:16,729
I drink because it feels good.

112
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:20,934
I killed my husband because it
felt good to be rid of him.

113
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:29,242
I fuck my brother because it feels
good to feel him inside me.

114
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,411
I lie about fucking my brother...

115
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:37,450
because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

116
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:42,021
I killed your High Sparrow...

117
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:46,159
<i>and all his little sparrows...</i>

118
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,097
all his septons, all his septas,

119
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:54,033
all his filthy soldiers,

120
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:57,337
because it felt good
to watch them burn.

121
00:19:59,174 --> 00:20:03,009
It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

122
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:06,446
No thought has ever
given me greater joy.

123
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:15,655
Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

124
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,863
You've always been quiet.

125
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,807
I said my face would be the last
thing you saw before you died.

126
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,976
Do you remember?

127
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,045
Good.

128
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:43,583
I'm glad to see your face.

129
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,421
I'm ready to meet the gods.

130
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:49,856
What?

131
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,793
Now?

132
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,361
Today?

133
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:00,867
You're not going to die today.

134
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:05,838
You're not going to die
for quite a while.

135
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:10,243
Ser Gregor.

136
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:16,549
<i>This is Ser Gregor Clegane.</i>

137
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,252
He's quiet, too.

138
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:31,998
Your gods have forsaken you.

139
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:35,368
This is your god now.

140
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:48,381
No.

141
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:50,650
No.

142
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:55,421
Shame.

143
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,758
Shame.

144
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,562
Shame.

145
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:09,969
<i>I'm very sorry, Your Grace.</i>

146
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:13,272
Very sorry.

147
00:22:57,052 --> 00:22:59,419
<i>For House Lannister!</i>

148
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:01,454
<i>Hear me roar!</i>

149
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,295
For House Frey!

150
00:23:09,397 --> 00:23:12,465
We stand together!

151
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:15,435
May we stand together
through the centuries,

152
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:18,004
good friends to the last.

153
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:22,141
And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

154
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:26,045
may we speak the words
of our alliance,

155
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:29,549
"The Freys and the Lannisters

156
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,851
send their regards."

157
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,671
You don't even have
to do anything, do you?

158
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:55,341
You just sit there,
a rich slab of beef,

159
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:56,876
and all the birds come pecking.

160
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,378
- You're welcome to her.
- She doesn't want me.

161
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,881
She wants your golden
fingers up her twat.

162
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:05,852
Those two have their eyes on you.

163
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:09,722
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

164
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,624
Not my type.

165
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,292
Not blonde enough?

166
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:19,198
Ladies, have you met
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

167
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,467
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

168
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:23,936
- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

169
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,741
Fuck it.

170
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:32,011
No need to call me ser just
because I'm an anointed knight.

171
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:39,752
This came together rather well.

172
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:43,656
Your father would be pleased.

173
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:45,424
I'm sure he would be.

174
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:50,897
Edmure is back in a cell.

175
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:54,634
Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

176
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:56,903
Give the family a bad name.

177
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:04,310
So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

178
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:07,313
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

179
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:11,083
Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

180
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:13,719
I'm a bit old for all that.

181
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:16,522
No, but back in your day.

182
00:25:16,624 --> 00:25:19,559
The purpose of fighting

183
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:22,862
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

184
00:25:22,964 --> 00:25:24,964
I've defeated mine.

185
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:28,768
Riverrun belonged to House
Tully for a thousand years.

186
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,436
Now it's mine.

187
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:32,839
What do you call that?

188
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:34,207
Victory.

189
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,809
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

190
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:42,181
Go on, mock me, boy.
You think I mind?

191
00:25:42,283 --> 00:25:45,017
The Tullys mocked me for years.

192
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,286
The Starks mocked me.

193
00:25:47,388 --> 00:25:48,855
Where are they now?

194
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:51,424
<i>You talk about war
as if you're an expert,</i>

195
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:53,826
but the one battle
I remember you fighting,

196
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:56,829
you were captured by Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

197
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,832
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

198
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,269
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

199
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:07,240
We know what it's like to
have them grovel to our faces

200
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:10,343
and snigger behind our backs.

201
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,011
We don't mind, do we?

202
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:16,082
Fear is a marvelous thing.

203
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:17,783
They don't fear the Freys, though.

204
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:20,620
They fear the Lannisters.

205
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:23,089
We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

206
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:25,625
If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

207
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:28,127
every time you lose them,

208
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:30,196
why do we need you?

209
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:53,552
Show me.

210
00:26:56,357 --> 00:26:58,324
Your Grace,
there's no need--

211
00:26:58,426 --> 00:26:59,792
Show me.

212
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:16,108
What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

213
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,878
As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

214
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,748
<i>perhaps a ceremony
in the throne room?</i>

215
00:27:24,218 --> 00:27:27,353
He should be with his grandfather,

216
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:30,289
his brother, his sister.

217
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:35,394
Burn him

218
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:38,464
and bury his ashes
where the sept once stood.

219
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,412
Whoa, whoa.

220
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,556
Hello.

221
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:48,034
From Lord Commander Snow
at Castle Black.

222
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,917
I'm--

223
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:06,519
I'm to be the new maester.

224
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,002
Oh.

225
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:25,504
According to our records,

226
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:27,373
Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

227
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,509
He died.

228
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:33,179
We received no report from
the maester at Castle Black.

229
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:36,415
Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

230
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:38,784
He's since passed away.

231
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,922
Which is why I'm here.

232
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:48,127
This is irregular.

233
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:52,898
Yes, well, I suppose
that life is irregular.

234
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:08,581
The archmaester will discuss
these irregularities with you.

235
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:14,186
In the meantime, you are
permitted to use the library.

236
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:16,155
Follow me.

237
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:21,127
No women or children.

238
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:17,676
When we had feasts,

239
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:20,045
our family would sit up here...

240
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:23,949
and I'd sit down there.

241
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:28,854
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

242
00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:30,723
You had a family.

243
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:31,991
You had feasts.

244
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,296
Aye, you're right.
I was luckier than most.

245
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:54,413
What is that?

246
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,983
Tell him.

247
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:03,222
<i>Tell him who it belonged to.</i>

248
00:33:08,095 --> 00:33:09,695
The Princess Shireen.

249
00:33:09,797 --> 00:33:12,097
Tell him what you did to her.

250
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:15,267
Tell him!

251
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:23,676
We burned her at the stake.

252
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:39,158
Why?

253
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,361
The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

254
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:45,531
- It was the only way.
- You burned a little girl alive!

255
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:47,066
I only do what my Lord commands.

256
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:50,302
If he commands you to burn
children, your Lord is evil.

257
00:33:53,607 --> 00:33:55,307
We are standing here because of him.

258
00:33:56,811 --> 00:34:00,079
<i>Jon Snow is alive
because the Lord willed it.</i>

259
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:03,782
I loved that girl
like she was my own.

260
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:07,186
She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

261
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,856
So did her father.

262
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,626
So did her mother.

263
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:19,064
<i>Her own blood knew
it was the only way.</i>

264
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,767
The only way for what?

265
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:23,369
They all died anyway.

266
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,239
You told everyone
Stannis was the one.

267
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:29,675
You had him believing it,
all of them fooled.

268
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:32,244
- And you lied.
- I didn't lie.

269
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:35,314
I was wrong.

270
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:38,650
<i>Aye, you were wrong.</i>

271
00:34:38,753 --> 00:34:42,388
How many died because you were wrong?

272
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:51,263
I ask your leave to execute
this woman for murder.

273
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:53,165
<i>She admits to the crime.</i>

274
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:58,070
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

275
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,674
I've been ready
to die for many years.

276
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:07,513
If the Lord was done with
me, so be it, but he's not.

277
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:10,816
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

278
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:14,186
You know the great war
is still to come.

279
00:35:14,288 --> 00:35:17,256
You know the army of the
dead will be upon us soon.

280
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,059
And you know I can
help you win that war.

281
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,209
Ride south today.

282
00:35:38,712 --> 00:35:40,612
If you return to the North,

283
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:43,315
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

284
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:03,669
If you ever come back this way,

285
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:06,138
I will execute you myself.

286
00:36:38,138 --> 00:36:40,939
I'm having the lord's
chamber prepared for you.

287
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:44,710
Mother and Father's room?

288
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,013
You should take it.

289
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,383
I'm not a Stark.

290
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:53,886
You are to me.

291
00:36:57,558 --> 00:36:59,224
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

292
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:03,228
You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

293
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,832
<i>The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.</i>

294
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,134
They came because of you.

295
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,074
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

296
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:17,943
- He did.
- And you trust him?

297
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:21,680
Only a fool
would trust Littlefinger.

298
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:27,586
I should have told you about him,

299
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:31,023
about the Knights of the Vale.

300
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,591
I'm sorry.

301
00:37:43,904 --> 00:37:45,871
We need to trust each other.

302
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,974
We can't fight a war
amongst ourselves.

303
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:51,577
We have so many enemies now.

304
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,861
Jon.

305
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:13,398
A raven came from the Citadel.

306
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,400
A white raven.

307
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:19,638
Winter is here.

308
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:35,053
Well, Father always
promised, didn't he?

309
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:52,304
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

310
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:54,506
he was assassinated.

311
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:57,175
100 red scorpions, was it?

312
00:38:57,277 --> 00:38:59,778
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

313
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,014
You murder your own prince,

314
00:39:02,116 --> 00:39:03,849
but you expect me to trust you?

315
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:06,918
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

316
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:09,287
You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

317
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,890
What is your name again?

318
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:13,358
Barbaro?

319
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,060
Obara.

320
00:39:15,162 --> 00:39:18,296
Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

321
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:21,033
<i>Don't presume to tell me what I need.</i>

322
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:24,469
Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes--

323
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,073
Do shut up, dear.
Anything from you?

324
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:30,075
No? Good.

325
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:32,577
Let the grown women speak.

326
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,381
The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

327
00:39:36,483 --> 00:39:39,451
They have declared war on Dorne.

328
00:39:39,553 --> 00:39:43,188
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

329
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:47,459
Cersei stole the future from me.

330
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:49,327
She killed my son.

331
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,463
<i>She killed my grandson.</i>

332
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:54,766
She killed my granddaughter.

333
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:57,703
Survival is not what I'm after now.

334
00:39:57,805 --> 00:39:59,971
You're absolutely right.

335
00:40:00,074 --> 00:40:02,641
I chose the wrong words.

336
00:40:02,743 --> 00:40:05,243
It is not survival I offer.

337
00:40:05,345 --> 00:40:07,679
It is your heart's desire.

338
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:12,718
And what is my heart's desire?

339
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:16,521
Vengeance.

340
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,723
Justice.

341
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,328
Fire and blood.

342
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:32,604
Your ships are nearly ready.

343
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:35,006
I saw them painting the sails.

344
00:40:38,445 --> 00:40:42,247
I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

345
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:44,249
You're not coming with us.

346
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,855
New strategy?

347
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:53,158
You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

348
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,861
If we take Casterly Rock,

349
00:40:55,963 --> 00:40:59,531
the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

350
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:01,566
You're not going to Westeros.

351
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,603
You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

352
00:41:04,705 --> 00:41:07,339
There's finally peace in Meereen.

353
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:10,776
You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

354
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,879
Fuck Meereen.

355
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:15,881
Fuck the people.

356
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:18,250
I'm here for you, not them.

357
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:20,018
You promised me.

358
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,054
"My sword is yours.
My life is yours."

359
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:26,258
<i>This is what I command.</i>

360
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,361
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

361
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:31,963
I'll need to make alliances.

362
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:35,433
The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

363
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:40,605
Who are you marrying this time?

364
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:44,075
I don't know.
Maybe no one.

365
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:47,279
But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

366
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:49,347
Are you a queen or fish bait?

367
00:41:51,785 --> 00:41:54,753
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

368
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:57,088
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

369
00:41:57,191 --> 00:42:00,091
So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

370
00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:03,495
I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

371
00:42:03,597 --> 00:42:05,697
sits beside you in the throne room.

372
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:08,834
I don't want a crown.
I want you.

373
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:18,009
I love you.

374
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:20,579
And I make you happy.

375
00:42:20,681 --> 00:42:22,547
You know I do.

376
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:28,486
Bring me with you.
Let me fight for you.

377
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:37,362
I can't.

378
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,840
The dwarf told you to do this?

379
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:50,609
<i>No one tells me to do anything.</i>

380
00:42:50,711 --> 00:42:53,879
Clever fellow.
Can't argue with his logic.

381
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:55,714
I'm no use to you over there.

382
00:42:55,816 --> 00:42:57,082
Don't get angry.

383
00:42:57,184 --> 00:43:00,352
I'm not angry.
I'm full of self-pity.

384
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:02,053
Who comes after you?

385
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:05,323
Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

386
00:43:05,425 --> 00:43:07,692
A great number of women, I imagine.

387
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,734
Specific orders will be left for you

388
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:18,770
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

389
00:43:18,872 --> 00:43:20,672
Bay of Dragons?

390
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:23,775
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

391
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,081
You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

392
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:33,618
I hope it brings you happiness.

393
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:41,293
I pity the lords of Westeros.

394
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:43,561
They have no idea
what's coming for them.

395
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:47,599
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

396
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:08,586
How did he take it?

397
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:10,755
No tears.

398
00:44:12,826 --> 00:44:15,460
I know it was hard for you.

399
00:44:15,562 --> 00:44:17,595
You turned away a man
who truly loves you

400
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,598
because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

401
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,871
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

402
00:44:26,974 --> 00:44:29,140
if it's any consolation.

403
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:33,845
It's not.

404
00:44:33,947 --> 00:44:36,247
No, I suppose not.

405
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,882
I'm terrible at consoling.

406
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:40,285
Yes, you really are.

407
00:44:43,457 --> 00:44:47,659
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

408
00:44:49,162 --> 00:44:52,030
You have your armies,
you have your ships,

409
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:54,132
you have your dragons.

410
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,201
Everything you've ever wanted

411
00:44:56,303 --> 00:44:59,204
since you were old enough
to want anything,

412
00:44:59,306 --> 00:45:01,172
it's all yours for the taking.

413
00:45:02,943 --> 00:45:04,876
Are you afraid?

414
00:45:08,048 --> 00:45:09,914
Good.

415
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:12,751
You're in the great game now.

416
00:45:12,853 --> 00:45:15,420
And the great game's terrifying.

417
00:45:15,522 --> 00:45:17,989
The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

418
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:20,191
are madmen like your father.

419
00:45:22,295 --> 00:45:24,396
Do you know what frightens me?

420
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:28,533
I said farewell
to a man who loves me.

421
00:45:30,404 --> 00:45:33,972
A man I thought I cared for.

422
00:45:34,074 --> 00:45:36,041
And I felt nothing.

423
00:45:37,644 --> 00:45:39,544
Just impatient to get on with it.

424
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:45,717
He wasn't the first to love you

425
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:47,886
and he won't be the last.

426
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:56,694
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

427
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:01,733
For what it's worth,
I've been a cynic

428
00:46:01,835 --> 00:46:03,968
for as long as I can remember.

429
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:06,871
Everyone's always asking me
to believe in things--

430
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:10,708
family, gods, kings, myself.

431
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:12,644
It was often tempting

432
00:46:12,746 --> 00:46:15,080
until I saw where belief got people.

433
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,050
So I said no, thank you to belief.

434
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:22,454
And yet here I am.

435
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:27,425
I believe in you.

436
00:46:29,362 --> 00:46:31,763
It's embarrassing, really.

437
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:35,633
I'd swear you my sword,

438
00:46:35,735 --> 00:46:38,770
but I don't actually own a sword.

439
00:46:38,872 --> 00:46:40,872
It's your counsel I need.

440
00:46:40,974 --> 00:46:43,408
It's yours.

441
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,943
Now and always.

442
00:46:46,446 --> 00:46:48,279
Good.

443
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,616
I, um...

444
00:46:51,718 --> 00:46:53,485
I had something made for you.

445
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,722
I'm not sure if it's right.

446
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,734
Tyrion Lannister,

447
00:47:09,836 --> 00:47:11,736
I name you Hand of the Queen.

448
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:48,506
You're not one of mine, are you?

449
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:50,108
No, my lord.

450
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,876
Didn't think so.

451
00:47:51,978 --> 00:47:54,212
Too pretty.

452
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:01,286
Where are my damn moron sons?

453
00:48:01,388 --> 00:48:05,123
Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

454
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:07,058
They're here, my lord.

455
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,461
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

456
00:48:10,564 --> 00:48:12,630
Tell them to come here now.

457
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:14,999
But they're already here, my lord.

458
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,040
Here, my lord.

459
00:48:40,327 --> 00:48:42,360
They weren't easy to carve.

460
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,930
Especially Black Walder.

461
00:48:46,032 --> 00:48:48,600
What...

462
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:57,675
My name is Arya Stark.

463
00:48:57,777 --> 00:48:59,277
I want you to know that.

464
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:02,113
The last thing
you're ever going to see

465
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:04,949
is a Stark smiling down
at you as you die.

466
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,739
Forgive me, my lady...

467
00:50:03,176 --> 00:50:06,177
if you're at prayer.

468
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:08,279
I'm done with all that.

469
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:13,017
I came here every day
when I was a girl.

470
00:50:14,313 --> 00:50:17,555
I prayed to be somewhere else.

471
00:50:17,657 --> 00:50:19,757
Back then I only thought
about what I wanted,

472
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,693
never about what I had.

473
00:50:25,465 --> 00:50:26,898
I was a stupid girl.

474
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,933
You were a child.

475
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,706
What do you want?

476
00:50:34,808 --> 00:50:37,175
I thought you knew what I wanted.

477
00:50:37,277 --> 00:50:38,876
I was wrong.

478
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:41,646
No, you weren't.

479
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:46,315
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

480
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:48,651
I close my eyes and see
the same picture.

481
00:50:50,354 --> 00:50:53,756
Whenever I consider
an action, I ask myself

482
00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:57,993
will this action help to make
this picture a reality?

483
00:50:59,964 --> 00:51:02,732
Pull it out of my mind

484
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:04,667
and into the world?

485
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:09,739
And I only act if the answer is yes.

486
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:17,079
A picture of me on the Iron Throne...

487
00:51:19,884 --> 00:51:21,784
and you by my side.

488
00:51:31,863 --> 00:51:33,763
It's a pretty picture.

489
00:51:39,303 --> 00:51:42,805
News of this battle will spread
quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

490
00:51:42,907 --> 00:51:46,408
I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

491
00:51:46,511 --> 00:51:48,978
You've declared for other
houses before, Lord Baelish.

492
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,781
It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

493
00:51:51,883 --> 00:51:54,083
The past is gone for good.

494
00:51:54,185 --> 00:51:56,252
You can sit here
mourning its departure

495
00:51:56,354 --> 00:51:59,288
or you can prepare for the future.

496
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,857
You, my love,

497
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:04,593
are the future of House Stark.

498
00:52:04,695 --> 00:52:08,364
Who should the North rally behind?

499
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:11,133
A trueborn daughter
of Ned and Catelyn Stark

500
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:13,135
born here at Winterfell

501
00:52:13,237 --> 00:52:16,438
or a motherless bastard
born in the south?

502
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,934
This is where I leave you.

503
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,836
You're not coming with us?

504
00:52:48,306 --> 00:52:51,707
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

505
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:54,977
Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

506
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:58,848
Strong magic

507
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:02,084
to protect men from what lies beyond.

508
00:53:02,186 --> 00:53:06,022
And while it stands,
the dead cannot pass.

509
00:53:06,124 --> 00:53:07,124
I cannot pass.

510
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:25,775
Where will you go?

511
00:53:25,877 --> 00:53:27,410
The great war is coming

512
00:53:27,512 --> 00:53:30,312
<i>and I still fight for the living.</i>

513
00:53:32,383 --> 00:53:34,483
I'll do what I can...

514
00:53:35,853 --> 00:53:38,054
as long as I can.

515
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:44,060
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

516
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:46,495
I wish you both good fortune.

517
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,304
Are you sure you're ready for this?

518
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:31,507
I'm the Three-Eyed
Raven now.

519
00:54:31,609 --> 00:54:33,843
I have to be ready for this.

520
00:55:07,445 --> 00:55:10,079
<i>Ned?</i>

521
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:12,604
Lyanna.

522
00:55:12,784 --> 00:55:14,884
Is that you?

523
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:20,656
Is that really you?

524
00:55:25,596 --> 00:55:27,496
You're not a dream?

525
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:30,733
No, I'm not a dream.

526
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:34,270
I'm here.

527
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,706
Right here.

528
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:40,142
I've missed you, big brother.

529
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:45,481
I've missed you, too.

530
00:55:49,821 --> 00:55:51,720
I want to be brave.

531
00:55:51,823 --> 00:55:54,256
Shh.

532
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:56,859
You are.

533
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:59,695
I'm not.

534
00:56:01,899 --> 00:56:04,667
I don't want to die.

535
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:07,002
You're not going to die.

536
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:12,641
Get her some water.

537
00:56:12,743 --> 00:56:15,044
- No, no water.
- Is there a maester?

538
00:56:15,146 --> 00:56:17,479
Listen to me, Ned.

539
00:56:23,888 --> 00:56:26,622
If Robert
finds out, he'll--

540
00:56:26,724 --> 00:56:28,591
you know he will.

541
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:30,559
You have to protect him.

542
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:35,531
Promise me, Ned.

543
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:39,802
Promise me.

544
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,916
Promise me, Ned.

545
00:56:58,389 --> 00:57:00,189
Promise me.

546
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:33,656
You can't expect Knights of the Vale

547
00:57:33,758 --> 00:57:36,392
to side with wildling invaders.

548
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:40,429
We didn't invade.
We were invited.

549
00:57:40,531 --> 00:57:42,231
Not by me.

550
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,133
The free folk, the northerners,

551
00:57:44,235 --> 00:57:46,602
and the Knights of the Vale
fought bravely,

552
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:49,004
fought together, and we won.

553
00:57:49,106 --> 00:57:53,842
My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

554
00:57:53,945 --> 00:57:56,545
The Boltons are defeated.

555
00:57:56,647 --> 00:57:58,580
The war is over.

556
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,582
Winter has come.

557
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:04,186
If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

558
00:58:04,288 --> 00:58:07,723
We should ride home
and wait out the coming storms.

559
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:09,925
The war is not over.

560
00:58:10,027 --> 00:58:12,061
And I promise you, friend,

561
00:58:12,163 --> 00:58:15,097
the true enemy
won't wait out the storm.

562
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,699
He brings the storm.

563
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:40,756
Your son was butchered at the
Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

564
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:42,691
but you refused the call.

565
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,031
You swore allegiance
to House Stark, Lord Glover,

566
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:51,734
but in their hour of greatest need,

567
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:53,836
you refused the call.

568
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,973
<i>And you, Lord Cerwyn,</i>

569
00:58:58,075 --> 00:59:01,944
your father was skinned
alive by Ramsay Bolton.

570
00:59:02,046 --> 00:59:04,513
Still you refused the call.

571
00:59:07,618 --> 00:59:11,487
<i>But House Mormont remembers.</i>

572
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,289
The North remembers.

573
00:59:14,392 --> 00:59:18,961
We know no king but the King in
the North whose name is Stark.

574
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:22,498
<i>I don't care if he's a bastard.</i>

575
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,200
<i>Ned Stark's blood
runs through his veins.</i>

576
00:59:25,302 --> 00:59:29,772
He's my king from this
day until his last day.

577
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,024
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

578
00:59:49,126 --> 00:59:50,426
and truly.

579
00:59:53,831 --> 00:59:58,934
My son died for Robb Stark,
the Young Wolf.

580
00:59:59,036 --> 01:00:02,104
I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

581
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:04,640
I didn't commit my men to your cause

582
01:00:04,742 --> 01:00:07,376
'cause I didn't want more
Manderlys dying for nothing.

583
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,113
But I was wrong.

584
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,054
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

585
01:00:19,156 --> 01:00:21,557
<i> He is the White Wolf.</i>

586
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,593
The King in the North.

587
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:34,536
I did not fight
beside you on the field

588
01:00:34,638 --> 01:00:38,073
and I will regret that
until my dying day.

589
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:42,811
<i>A man can only admit
when he was wrong</i>

590
01:00:42,913 --> 01:00:44,480
and ask forgiveness.

591
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:49,785
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

592
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:54,890
There will be more fights to come.

593
01:00:54,992 --> 01:00:58,527
House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

594
01:00:58,629 --> 01:01:00,929
as we have for a thousand years.

595
01:01:02,766 --> 01:01:05,000
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

596
01:01:07,438 --> 01:01:09,505
the King in the North!

597
01:01:11,408 --> 01:01:14,309
The King in the North!

598
01:01:14,411 --> 01:01:17,713
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

599
01:01:17,815 --> 01:01:21,150
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

600
01:01:21,252 --> 01:01:24,453
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

601
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:28,056
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

602
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,827
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

603
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:35,797
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

604
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,767
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

605
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:42,037
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

606
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:45,340
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

607
01:01:45,442 --> 01:01:48,744
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

608
01:01:48,846 --> 01:01:51,680
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

609
01:01:57,384 --> 01:01:59,888
<i>Company halt!</i>

610
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:04,359
<i>Halt!</i>

611
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,363
<i>Halt!</i>

612
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,043
Come on.

613
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,801
I now proclaim Cersei
of the House Lannister

614
01:03:19,903 --> 01:03:22,537
First of Her Name,

615
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,008
<i>Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,</i>

616
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:29,311
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

617
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:17,225
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

618
01:04:17,328 --> 01:04:19,494
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

619
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:52,792
