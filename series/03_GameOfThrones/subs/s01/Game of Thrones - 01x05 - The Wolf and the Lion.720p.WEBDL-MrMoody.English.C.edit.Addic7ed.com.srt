1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:02,738
Very handsome armor
<i>Not a scratch on it.</i>

2
00:00:02,772 --> 00:00:04,440
People have been swinging
at me for years,

3
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:05,677
but they always
seem to miss.

4
00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:08,614
You've chosen your
opponents wisely then.

5
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:10,583
Aah aah!

6
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:12,253
Why didn't you
get up and fight?

7
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:15,556
I'm a coward.
My father always says so.

8
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:17,892
Gods, who is that?

9
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:20,495
<i>They call him the Mountain,</i>
<i>the hound's older brother.</i>

10
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:23,865
- Sansa: <i>And his opponent?</i>
- Littlefinger: <i>Ser Hugh of the Vale.</i>

11
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:32,140
"The lineages of the great
houses of the Seven Kingdoms."

12
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:35,376
Did jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?- He d.

13
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:38,779
There was one phrase
he kept repeating:

14
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:40,514
"The seed is strong."

15
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:43,419
You might want to visit
a certain armorer in the city.

16
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:46,222
<i>My observers saw Lord Arryn</i>
<i>visit this armorer.</i>

17
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:49,494
- Jory: <i>Find anything?</i>
- King Robert's bastard son.

18
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:51,663
<i>Sam's no different</i>
<i>from the rest of us.</i>

19
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:53,799
There was no place for him in
the world, so he's come here.

20
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,234
He's our brother now and we're
going to protect him.

21
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,505
- Aah!
- And now you've woken the dragon--

22
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,407
Uh!

23
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,577
I am the wife
of the great Khal

24
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:05,780
and I carry his son
inside me.

25
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,350
The next time
you raise a hand to me

26
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:11,187
will be the last time
you have hands.

27
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:12,790
What is it you hope
to accomplish?

28
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:14,558
The king called on me
to serve him.

29
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:16,460
You're just a soldier,
aren't you?

30
00:01:16,495 --> 00:01:19,563
- I was also trained to kill my enemies.
- As was I.

31
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:22,166
This man
came into my house

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,102
and conspired
to murder my son.

33
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:27,138
In the name of King Robert,
seize him.

36
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:53,055
Does Ser Hugh have
any family in the capital?

37
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,280
No.

38
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:59,235
I stood vigil for him myself
last night.

39
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:02,262
He had no one else.

40
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,327
He'd never worn
this armor before.

41
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:07,596
Bad luck for him--

44
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:14,835
All the knights
draw straws, Lord Stark.

45
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,503
Aye.

46
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:19,740
But who holds
the straws?

47
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:22,310
You've done
good work, sisters.

48
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,953
Life is strange.
Not so many years ago

49
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:32,956
we fought as enemies
at the Trident.

50
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,792
I'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

51
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:37,727
As is my wife.

52
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:39,763
I don't think the widow's life
would suit her.

53
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:42,132
You're too modest.

54
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,535
I've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

55
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,203
My father once told me

56
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:48,438
you were the best
he'd ever seen.

57
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:51,308
I never knew the man to be
wrong about matters of combat.

58
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:53,644
He was a fine man,
your father.

59
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:57,047
What the Mad King did to him
was a terrible crime.

60
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:58,649
And that lad--

61
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,718
he was a squire
until a few months ago.

62
00:05:00,753 --> 00:05:03,354
How could he afford
a new suit of armor?

63
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:05,856
Perhaps Lord Arryn
left him some money?

64
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:10,027
I hear the King wants
to joust today.

65
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,728
Yes, that will
never happen.

66
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:14,564
Robert tends to do
what he wants.

67
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:17,234
If the King got what
he wanted all the time,

68
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:19,870
he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

69
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:27,344
It's made too small,
Your Grace. It won't go.

70
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:29,680
Your mother was
a dumb whore

71
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:32,116
with a fat ass.
Did you know that?

72
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:38,255
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

73
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,025
He can't even put a man's
armor on him properly.

74
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:43,327
You're too fat
for your armor.

75
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,330
Fat?
Fat, is it?

76
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:49,567
Is that how you speak
to your King?

77
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:58,609
That was funny, is it?

78
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:02,346
No, Your Grace.

79
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:05,516
No?
You don't like the Hand's joke?

80
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:08,352
You're torturing
the poor boy.

81
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:11,188
You heard the Hand.
The King's too fat for his armor.

82
00:06:11,223 --> 00:06:14,325
Go find the breastplate
stretcher-- now!

83
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:19,397
"The breastplate stretcher"?

84
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:21,765
How long before
he figures it out?

85
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,494
Maybe you should
have one invented.

86
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,819
All right, all right.

87
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:27,604
But you watch me out there--
I still know how to point a Lance.

88
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,742
You have no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

89
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:34,112
Why, because I'm king?
Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

90
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:36,514
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

91
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:39,617
- And the last man in his saddle--
- Will be you.

92
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:41,786
There's not a man
in the Seven Kingdoms

93
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,754
would risk hurting you.

94
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,690
Are you telling me those
cowards would let me win?

95
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,293
Aye.

96
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:56,166
- Drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

97
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,768
Drink.
Your King commands it.

98
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,441
Gods,

99
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,976
too fat for my armor.

100
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:10,546
Your squire...
A Lannister boy?

101
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,015
Mm. A bloody idiot,

102
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,150
but Cersei insisted.

103
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,620
I have Jon Arryn
to thank for her.

104
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:21,790
"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," she told me.

105
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:24,694
"You'll need her father
on your side."

106
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:29,967
I thought being King meant I
could do whatever I wanted.

107
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:35,540
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

108
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:38,309
At least I can smell
someone else's blood.

109
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:40,211
- Robert?
- What?

110
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:44,014
Oh.

111
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:47,051
An inspiring sight
for the people, eh?

112
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:49,987
Come, bow before your King!
Bow, you shits!

113
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:07,071
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

114
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:11,509
The Knight of the Flowers.

115
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,618
Thank you, Ser Loras.

116
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,751
Don't let Ser Gregor
hurt him.

117
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:57,188
- Hey.
- <i>I can't watch.</i>

118
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:02,125
100 gold dragons
on the Mountain.

119
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,206
I'll take that bet.

120
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,096
Now what will I buy
with 100 gold dragons?

121
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,097
A dozen barrels
of Dornish wine?

122
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,166
Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?

123
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,455
Or you could even
buy a friend.

124
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:14,731
He's going to die.

125
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,372
Ser Loras rides well.

126
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,304
Such a shame,
Littlefinger.

127
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,639
It would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

128
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:54,909
And tell me, Lord Renly,

129
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,445
when will you be having
<i>your</i> friend?

130
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,759
Loras knew his mare
was in heat.

131
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:11,527
<i>Quite crafty, really.</i>

132
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:13,863
Ser Loras would
never do that.

133
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:15,226
<i>There's no honor in tricks.</i>

134
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:17,036
No honor and quite
a bit of gold.

135
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:21,672
Sword!

136
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,000
Leave him be!

137
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:14,226
Stop this madness
in the name of your King!

138
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:22,166
<i>Let him go!</i>

139
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:33,078
I owe you my life, Ser.

140
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:35,380
I'm no Ser.

141
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:00,236
Remove his hood.

142
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,206

00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:13,317
This isn't the Kingsroad.

147
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:15,185
You said we were
riding for Winterfell.

148
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,555
I did...
Often and loudly.

149
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,891
Very wise.

150
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:21,727
They'll be out
in droves,

151
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:23,761
looking for me
in the wrong place.

152
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:26,465
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

153
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:29,301
He'll be offering
a handsome reward.

154
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:32,705
Everyone knows a Lannister
always pays his debts.

155
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:35,241
Would you be so good
as to untie me?

156
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:38,411
- And why would I do that?
- Why not?

157
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:40,079
Am I going to run?

158
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:42,014
The hill tribes would
kill me for my boots.

159
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:43,816
Unless a Shadowcat
ate me first.

160
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,019
Shadowcats and hill tribes are
the least of your concerns.

161
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:51,189
Ah, the eastern road.

162
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:53,425
We're going to the Vale.

163
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,460
You're taking me
to your sister's

164
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,395
to answer for my
imagined crimes.

165
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,832
Tell me, Lady Stark, when was
the last time you saw your sister?

166
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:02,934
Five years ago.

167
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:05,370
She's changed.

168
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:07,372
She was always
a bit touched, but now--

169
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:09,074
you might as well
kill me here.

170
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:12,044
- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am I!

171
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:14,813
I had nothing to do with the
attempt on your son's life.

172
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:16,915
- The dagger found--
- What sort of imbecile

173
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,617
arms an assassin
with his own blade?

174
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:20,852
- Should I gag him?
- Why?

175
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:22,754
Am I starting
to make sense?

176
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:25,723
<i>Rodrik!</i>

177
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:31,395
<i>My Lady, this way.</i>

178
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,182
Untie me.

179
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:51,584
If I die, what's the point?

180
00:13:58,392 --> 00:13:59,692
Ah!

181
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,702
Rodrik?

182
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:46,404
I'll be fine, My Lady.

183
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:49,140
<i>There's no need</i>
<i>to bloody yourself.</i>

184
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:52,376
Your first?

185
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:55,646
You need a woman.

186
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,616
Nothing like a woman
after a fight.

187
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:02,554
I'm willing if she is.

188
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:16,869
Bran.

189
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:18,871
<i>The Iron Islands.</i>

190
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:20,372
A Kraken.

191
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:23,141
We do not sow.

192
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:25,310
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

193
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:26,978
Famed for their skills
at archery,

194
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,813
navigation
and lovemaking.

195
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:32,816
And failed rebellions.

196
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:36,320
A stag--

197
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:38,956
a crowned stag
now that Robert's King.

198
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,192
- <i>Good.</i>
- Words: Ours is the fury.

199
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:44,896
- Lords: The Baratheons.
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,931
<i>The Westerlands.</i>

201
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:49,034
- Sigil: A lion.
- Mmm.

202
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,441
A Lannister
always pays his debts.

203
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:52,504
<i>No.</i>

204
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:54,842
A common saying, but not
their official motto.

205
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,911
The Lannisters.

206
00:15:57,945 --> 00:16:00,847
- We're still on their words.
- I don't know them.

207
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:02,715
You do know them.
Think.

208
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:05,151
"Unbowed, unbent,
unbroken."

209
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,819
- That's House Martell.
- "Righteous in wrath."

210
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:11,823
- House Hornwood.
- "Family, duty, honor."

211
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,825
<i>Those are Tully words--</i>
<i>your mother's.</i>

212
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:16,961
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honor...

213
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:19,630
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

214
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:21,999
Family comes first?

215
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:24,635
Your mother had
to leave Winterfell

216
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:26,303
to protect the family.

217
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:28,605
How can she <i>protect</i>
the family

218
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,308
if she's not
<i>with</i> her family?

219
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:34,745
Your mother
sat by your bed

220
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,448
for three weeks
while you slept--

221
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,917
and then she left!

222
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:42,986
When you were born,
I was the one

223
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,404
who pulled you
from your mother.

224
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:48,461
<i>I placed you in her arms.</i>

225
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:52,398
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

226
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,702
she will love you.

227
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:58,806
<i>Absolutely.</i>

228
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,109
- <i>Fiercely.</i>
- Why did she leave?

229
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:04,078
I still can't tell you,

230
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,280
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

231
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,249
Today?

232
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:09,461
No, I don't.

233
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,832
Then how can you promise me
she'll be home soon?

234
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:18,427
Sometimes I worry you're too
smart for your own good.

235
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:22,198
I'll never shoot
another arrow.

236
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,867
And where is that written?

237
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:28,070
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

238
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,806
If the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

239
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
you could learn to shoot a bow
from horseback.

240
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,909
Really

241
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:38,712
Dothraki boys learn
when they're four years old.

242
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:40,348
Why shouldn't you?

243
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,967
Shh, keep it down.

244
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:00,570
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

245
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:04,073
I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

246
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:06,876
Important enough
for the likes of you.

247
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,879
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

248
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,848
Who, the Imp?

249
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,750
I'd call him
half a nobleman.

250
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,618
Jealous?

251
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,587
Why should I be jealous?

252
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:20,624
Anyone with a few coppers in his
pocket can own you for the night.

253
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:23,626
What's a dwarf like
down below?

254
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:25,762
I've always wondered.

255
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:28,465
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

256
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,501
He's good
with his fingers too.

257
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:33,637
And his tongue.

258
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:36,339
Generous tipper.

259
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:39,109
I guess gold is cheap
for a Lannister.

260
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,144
You are jealous.

261
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:42,846
I'm a Greyjoy.

262
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,115
We've been lords of the
Iron Islands for 300 years.

263
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:48,252
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

264
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,187
not even the Lannisters.

265
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:52,623
And what about
the Starks?

266
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:56,660
I've been Lord Stark's ward
since I was eight years old.

267
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:59,296
A ward--
that's a nice word for it.

268
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,765
Your father rebelled
against King Robert

269
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,267
- and if he does it again--
- My father fought

270
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:06,436
for the freedom
of his people.

271
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,906
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

272
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,508
You're a very serious boy.

273
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:16,146
- I'm not a boy.
- Oh yes, you are.

274
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,216
A serious boy
with a serious cock.

275
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:22,819
I don't want
to pay for it.

276
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:25,855
Then get yourself
a wife.

277
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:31,428
<i>Come on.</i>

278
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:35,232
I'm not gonna hurt you.

279
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:45,141
How is your son,
My Lord?

280
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:48,177
He'll never
walk again.

281
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,015
But his mind is sound?

282
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,217
So they say.

283
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:56,686
A blessing then.

284
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:01,692
I suffered an early
mutilation myself.

285
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:05,863
Some doors
close forever...

286
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:09,535
Others open
in the most unexpected places.

287
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:13,239
May I?

288
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:20,747
If the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,

289
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:22,916
off comes my head.

290
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,585
And who would mourn
poor Varys then?

291
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,289
North or South, they sing
no songs for spiders.

292
00:20:29,323 --> 00:20:31,858
But there are things
you must know.

293
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:34,961
You are the King's Hand
and the King is a fool--

294
00:20:34,995 --> 00:20:37,230
your friend, I know,
but a fool--

295
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:40,232
and doomed
unless you save him.

296
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,567
I've been in the capital
a month.

297
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:46,537
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

298
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:48,706
I didn't trust you.

299
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,074
So why do you trust me now?

300
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,310
The Queen is
not the only one

301
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:55,745
who has been
watching you closely.

302
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:58,314
There are few men of honor
in the capital.

303
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:00,015
You are one of them.

304
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,084
I would like to believe
I am another,

305
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:04,086
strange as that may seem.

306
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,789
What sort of doom
does the King face?

307
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:09,792
The same sort
as Jon Arryn.

308
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:13,496
<i>The tears of Lys,</i>
<i>they call it.</i>

309
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,132
<i>A rare and costly thing,</i>

310
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,901
as clear
and tasteless as water.

311
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:20,070
It leaves no trace.

312
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:30,850
Who gave it to him?

313
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:33,787
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

314
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,489
There were many.

315
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:38,225
Lord Arryn was a kind
and trusting man.

316
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,627
There was one boy.

317
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:43,329
All he was
he owed to Jon Arryn.

318
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:46,166
The squire, Ser Hugh?

319
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,337
Pity what happened
to him,

320
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:53,441
just when his life seemed
to be going so nicely.

321
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,978
If Ser Hugh poisoned him--

322
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:00,813
who paid Ser Hugh?

323
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:04,016
Someone who could afford it.

324
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,419
Jon was a man of peace.

325
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,420
He was Hand for 17 years--

326
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:10,589
17 good years.

327
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:12,424
Why kill him?

328
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:16,862
He started
asking questions.

329
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:48,060
Man's voice:
<i>He's found one bastard already.</i>

330
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:50,228
He has the book.

331
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:52,264
The rest will come.

332
00:22:52,298 --> 00:22:54,867
Man #2: <i>And when he knows</i>
<i>the truth, what will he do?</i>

333
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:56,802
<i>The gods alone know.</i>

334
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:59,471
The fools tried
to kill his son.

335
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,641
What's worse--
they botched it.

336
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:08,080
The wolf and the lion will
be at each other's throats.

337
00:23:08,115 --> 00:23:11,750
- <i>We will be at war soon, my friend.</i>
- <i>What good is war now?</i>

338
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:13,586
We're not ready.

339
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,222
If one Hand can die,
why not a second?

340
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:18,991
This Hand
is not the other.

341
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:20,993
<i>We need time.</i>

342
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:23,663
Khal Drogo will not make his
move until his son is born.

343
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:25,832
You know how
these savages are.

344
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:29,536
<i>"Delay," you say.</i>
<i>"Move fast," I reply.</i>

345
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,872
<i>This is no longer</i>
<i>a game for two players.</i>

346
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:35,408
<i>It never was.</i>

347
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,663
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

348
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,534
I admire
your industry.

349
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:03,702
You do move quietly.

350
00:24:03,737 --> 00:24:06,638
We all have
our qualities.

351
00:24:08,074 --> 00:24:09,908
You look
a bit lonely today.

352
00:24:09,942 --> 00:24:12,210
You should pay a visit to
my brothel this evening.

353
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:13,707
First boy is on the house.

354
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:15,879
I think you're mistaking
business with pleasure.

355
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,049
Am I?

356
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:21,686
All those birds that
whisper in your ear--

357
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,820
such pretty little things.

358
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:27,323
Trust me,

359
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:30,159
we accommodate
all inclinations.

360
00:24:30,194 --> 00:24:31,894
Oh, I'm sure.

361
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:35,097
Lord Redwyne likes his boys
very young, I hear.

362
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:38,433
I'm a purveyor
of beauty <i>and</i> discretion--

363
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:40,136
both equally important.

364
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,907
Though I suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

365
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,642
Is it true that

366
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:48,979
Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

367
00:24:49,014 --> 00:24:52,216
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

368
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:55,820
And I heard the most awful
rumor about a certain lord

369
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:57,856
with a taste
for fresh cadavers.

370
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:02,261
Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.

371
00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:04,196
The logistics alone--

372
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,599
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

373
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:09,602
Strictly speaking,
such a thing

374
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:11,904
would not be in accordance
with the King's laws.

375
00:25:11,938 --> 00:25:14,506
Strictly speaking.

376
00:25:17,077 --> 00:25:19,611
Tell me--
does someone somewhere

377
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:23,181
keep your balls
in a little box?

378
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:25,650
I've often wondered.

379
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:28,887
Do you know I have no idea
where they are?

380
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:32,057
And we had been so close.

381
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:34,559
But enough about me.
How have you been

382
00:25:34,593 --> 00:25:36,561
since we last
saw each other?

383
00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:39,364
Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?

384
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:40,937
Now the last time
I saw you,

385
00:25:40,962 --> 00:25:42,587
you were talking
to the Hand of the King.

386
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:45,803
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes I own.

387
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,370
Council business.

388
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:50,473
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

389
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,509
Everyone's well aware
of your enduring fondness

390
00:25:53,543 --> 00:25:55,444
for Lord Stark's wife.

391
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:59,448
If the Lannisters were behind
the attempt on the Stark boy's life

392
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:01,497
and it was discovered
that you helped

393
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:03,642
the Starks come
to that conclusion...

394
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:08,491
To think a simple word
to the Queen--

395
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,028
- one shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

396
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:13,698
But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen <i>you</i>

397
00:26:13,732 --> 00:26:15,600
even more recently
than you have seen me.

398
00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:18,537
- Have you?
- Yes.

399
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:20,372
Earlier today,
I distinctly recall

400
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:22,808
seeing you talking to Lord Stark
in his chambers.

401
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:25,044
Was that you
under the bed?

402
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:26,946
And not long after that

403
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,949
when I saw you
escorting a certain

404
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:32,651
<i>foreign</i> dignitary...

405
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:35,287
Council business?

406
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:38,891
Of course you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

407
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:41,427
You're from there
yourself, after all.

408
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:44,797
We're friends,
aren't we, Lord Varys?

409
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:47,000
I'd like to think we are.

410
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:49,403
So you can imagine
my burden,

411
00:26:49,437 --> 00:26:53,307
wondering if the King might
question my friend's sympathies.

412
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:57,378
To stand at a crossroads where
turning left means loyalty to a friend,

413
00:26:57,412 --> 00:26:59,279
turning right
loyalty to the realm--

414
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:01,448
- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

415
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,750
where a simple word to the King--

416
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:05,819
What are you two
conspiring about?

417
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:09,423
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

418
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:10,991
My brother is coming.

419
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:12,693
To a small council meeting?

420
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:15,729
Disturbing news
from far away.

421
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:18,365
Haven't you heard?

422
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,300
Off with you.
No begging.

423
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,136
I'm not a beggar.
I live here.

424
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,572
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

425
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,507
I want to see my father.

426
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:59,276
I want to fuck the Queen,
for all the good it does me.

427
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,144
You want your father, boy?

428
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,346
He's lying on the floor
of some tavern,

429
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,448
getting pissed on
by his friends.

430
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:07,183
My father
is Hand of the King!

431
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,520
I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell

432
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:12,149
and if you lay a hand on me,
my father

433
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:13,713
will have both
your heads on spikes.

434
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:16,559
Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you

435
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:19,061
on the ear to help
with your hearing?

436
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:24,434
You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?

437
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,406
You promised me
this would stop.

438
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,075
They said they were
going to kill you.

439
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,578
- Who did?
- I didn't see them,

440
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:35,881
- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya.

441
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:38,651
I'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

442
00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:41,654
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage--

443
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:43,355
something about the savage.

444
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,757
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

445
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,196
near the dragon skulls.

446
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:48,556
What were you doing
in the dungeons?

447
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:52,397
Chasing a cat.

448
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,167
Pardon, My Lord.

449
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,336
<i>There's a night's watchman</i>
<i>here begging a word.</i>

450
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,670
<i>He says it's urgent.</i>

451
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:10,547
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

452
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,424
This must be your son.
He has the look.

453
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:13,549
I'm a girl!

454
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,034
Did Benjen send you?

455
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:16,885
No one sent me,
My Lord.

456
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,154
I'm here to find
men for the Wall,

457
00:29:19,188 --> 00:29:20,950
see if there's any scum
in the dungeons

458
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:22,175
that might be fit for service.

459
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:24,493
Oh, we'll find
recruits for you.

460
00:29:24,527 --> 00:29:25,994
Thank you, My Lord.

461
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:28,497
But that's not why
I disturb you now.

462
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,435
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black--

463
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:34,537
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

464
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:37,507
It's for his sake
I rode here so hard

465
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:40,143
<i>I damn near</i>
<i>killed my horse.</i>

466
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:41,878
There are others
riding too.

467
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:43,981
The whole city
will know by tomorrow.

468
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,716
Know what?

469
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,854
Best said
in private, My Lord.

470
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:58,365
Go on.
We'll talk more later.

471
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,000
Jory, take her
safely to her room.

472
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:04,170
Come along, My Lady.
You heard your father.

473
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:11,610
How many guards
does my father have?

474
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,846
Here in
King's Landing? 50.

475
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:17,249
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

476
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:20,519
No fear on that count,
little lady.

477
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:28,160
- Well?
- It's about your wife, My Lord.

478
00:30:29,763 --> 00:30:31,597
She's taken the Imp.

479
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:50,682
You're far from home,
Lady Stark.

480
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,450
To whom do I speak?

481
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:54,486
Ser Vardis Egan,
knight of the Vale.

482
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,488
Is Lady Arryn
expecting your visit?

483
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,790
There was no time
to send word.

484
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:01,025
May I ask, My Lady,

485
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,761
why <i>he</i> is with you?

486
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,830
That's why
there was no time.

487
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,766
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

488
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,103
My <i>sister</i> will decide
what he looks like.

489
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,272
Yes, My Lady.

490
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,508
She will at that.

491
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,983
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

492
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,319
Give me 10 good men
and some climbing spikes--

493
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,221
I'll impregnate the bitch.

494
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,824
I like you.

495
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,601
Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

496
00:31:46,636 --> 00:31:49,003
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

497
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:51,205
I need to see
the King first-- alone.

498
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,674
The King is at the small council
meeting, My Lord.

499
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,442
He has summoned you.

500
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:58,646
- Is it about my wife?
- No, My Lord.

501
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,616
I believe it concerns
Daenerys Targaryen.

502
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,018
The whore is pregnant.

503
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:06,988
- You're speaking of murdering a child.
- I warned you

504
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:09,491
this would happen.
Back in the North, I warned you,

505
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:11,127
but you didn't care
to hear.

506
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:13,764
Well, hear it now.

507
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,068
I want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

508
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,237
<i>And that fool Viserys</i>
<i>as well.</i>

509
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,305
Is that plain enough
for you?

510
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,940
<i>I want them both dead.</i>

511
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,509
You will dishonor yourself
forever if you do this.

512
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:26,544
Honor?!

513
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,246
I've got Seven Kingdoms
to rule!

514
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,049
One King,
Seven Kingdoms.

515
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,518
Do you think honor
keeps them in line?

516
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,987
Do you think it's honor
that's keeping the peace?

517
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:39,623
It's fear--
fear and blood.

518
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,357
Then we're no better
than the Mad King.

519
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,393
Careful, Ned.
Careful now.

520
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:45,395
You want
to assassinate a girl

521
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:47,463
because the Spider
heard a rumor?

522
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,400
No rumor, My Lord.
The princess is with child.

523
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,201
Based on whose
information?

524
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:53,568
Ser Jorah Mormont.

525
00:32:53,593 --> 00:32:55,881
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

526
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:58,340
Mormont?
You bring us the whispers

527
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:02,077
of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

528
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:05,147
Jorah Mormont's
a slaver, not a traitor.

529
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:07,584
Small difference, I know,
to an honorable man.

530
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,287
He broke the law, betrayed
his family, fled our land.

531
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,191
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

532
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,193
<i>And if he's right?</i>

533
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,262
If she has a son?

534
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:20,431
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army...

535
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:24,135
- <i>What then?</i>
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

536
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,304
I'll fear the Dothraki

537
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,773
the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

538
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,908
Do nothing?

539
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:33,111
That's your wise advice?

540
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:36,247
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

541
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:39,116
You're my council.
Counsel!

542
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:42,986
Speak sense to this
honorable fool.

543
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,023
I understand your misgivings,
My Lord.

544
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,726
Truly, I do.
It is a terrible thing

545
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,827
we must consider,
a vile thing.

546
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:55,096
Yet we who presume
to rule must sometimes

547
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:58,666
do vile things for
the good of the realm.

548
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:01,903
Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

549
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:03,671
the realm will bleed.

550
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:06,007
I bear this girl no ill will,

551
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,109
<i>but should</i>
<i>the Dothraki invade,</i>

552
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:10,011
how many innocents will die?

553
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:12,080
How many towns
will burn?

554
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:15,316
Is it not wiser,
kinder even,

555
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,752
that she should die now

556
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:21,155
so that tens of thousands
might live?

557
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:23,691
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

558
00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:26,159
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

559
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:29,529
<i>best close your eyes,</i>
<i>get it over with.</i>

560
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:32,966
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

561
00:34:38,872 --> 00:34:41,741
I followed you
into war--

562
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,776
twice,

563
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:46,046
without doubts,

564
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:48,015
without second thoughts.

565
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:51,653
But I will not
follow you now.

566
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:54,055
The Robert I grew up with

567
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:57,659
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

568
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:01,530
She dies.

569
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:04,800
I will have no part in it.

570
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,102
You're the King's Hand,
Lord Stark.

571
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,805
You'll do as I command
or I'll find me a hand who will.

572
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,814
And good luck to him.

573
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:23,417
I thought you were
a better man.

574
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,720
Out.
Out, damn you.

575
00:35:25,754 --> 00:35:28,390
I'm done with you.

576
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:31,393
Go, run back
to Winterfell!

577
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:34,231
I'll have your head
on a spike!

578
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,502
<i>I'll put it there</i>
<i>myself, you fool!</i>

579
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:42,040
<i>You think you're too good for this?</i>
<i>Too proud and honorable?</i>

580
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:43,841
<i>This is a war!</i>

581
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,846
I'll go ahead
with my daughters.

582
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,448
Get them ready.
Do it yourself.

583
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,918
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, My Lord.

584
00:35:51,952 --> 00:35:54,087
Lord Baelish
is here for you.

585
00:35:56,224 --> 00:35:58,525
His Grace went on about you
at some length

586
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,794
after you took your leave.

587
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:02,763
The word "treason"
was mentioned.

588
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:05,499
What can I do for you?

589
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:07,300
When do you return
to Winterfell?

590
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:08,643
Why? What do you care?

591
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,353
If you're still here
come nightfall,

592
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:12,273
I'll take you to see
the last person Jon Arryn

593
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:13,798
spoke with before falling ill.

594
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:16,976
If that sort of thing
still interests you.

595
00:36:17,878 --> 00:36:19,579
I don't have the time.

596
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:22,248
It won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

597
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,351
Round up all the men we have

598
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:30,929
and station them outside
the girls' chambers.

599
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:35,026
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

600
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,762
Find them and meet me
at the stables.

601
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:45,670
You bring him here
without permission?

602
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:48,741
<i>You pollute my home</i>
<i>with his presence?</i>

603
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:53,546
Your aunt has done
a bad thing, Robin,

604
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:55,382
a very bad thing.

605
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,885
You remember her,
don't you?

606
00:36:59,188 --> 00:37:01,089
<i>Isn't he beautiful?</i>

607
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:03,892
And strong too.
Jon knew it.

608
00:37:03,926 --> 00:37:06,961
His last words were
"the seed is strong."

609
00:37:06,995 --> 00:37:08,496
He wanted everyone to know

610
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,799
<i>what a good, strong boy</i>
<i>his son would grow up to be.</i>

611
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:15,737
Look at him,
the Lord of all the Vale.

612
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:17,505
Lysa,

613
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,609
you wrote me about
the Lannisters,

614
00:37:20,643 --> 00:37:23,478
- warning me--
- To stay away from them!

615
00:37:23,512 --> 00:37:26,482
Not to bring one here!

616
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:28,617
Mommy?

617
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:31,319
- Is that the bad man?
- <i>It is.</i>

618
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:36,158
He's little.

619
00:37:36,192 --> 00:37:38,694
<i>He's Tyrion the Imp</i>
<i>of House Lannister.</i>

620
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:41,063
He killed your father.

621
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:42,798
He murdered
the Hand of the King!

622
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:45,167
Oh, did I kill him too?

623
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:47,036
I've been a <i>very</i> busy man.

624
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,738
You will
watch your tongue!

625
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:52,508
These men are knights
of the Vale.

626
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:55,377
Every one of them
loved Jon Arryn.

627
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:57,079
Every one of them would
die for me.

628
00:37:57,113 --> 00:37:58,518
If any harm comes to me,

629
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,691
my brother Jaime will see
that they do.

630
00:38:00,816 --> 00:38:01,890
You can't hurt us.

631
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:03,549
No one can hurt us here.
Tell him, mommy!

632
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,656
- Tell him!
- Shh shh shh, my sweet boy.

633
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:10,192
He's just trying
to frighten us.

634
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:12,060
Lannisters are all liars.

635
00:38:12,095 --> 00:38:15,064
<i>No one will</i>
<i>hurt my baby.</i>

636
00:38:15,098 --> 00:38:17,600
<i>Mommy...</i>

637
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:20,503
I want to see
the bad man fly.

638
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:23,573
Perhaps you will,
my little love.

639
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:25,742
This man is <i>my</i> prisoner.

640
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:28,779
I will <i>not</i> have him
harmed.

641
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:32,350
Ser Vardis,

642
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:35,220
<i>my sister's guest</i>
<i>is weary.</i>

643
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:38,089
<i>Take him down below</i>
<i>so he can rest.</i>

644
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:41,325
Introduce him to Mord.

645
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:44,928
You go sleep,
dwarf man.

646
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:48,065
Sleep good,
little dwarf man!

647
00:39:23,401 --> 00:39:25,902
Lord Stark's lucky
he still has a head.

648
00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:28,839
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

649
00:39:28,873 --> 00:39:30,407
He adores the man.

650
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:32,209
You're jealous.

651
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:34,477
Are you sure
this won't hurt?

652
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:37,780
Only if I slip.

653
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:42,684
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hmm.

654
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:45,520
If you want hairless, maybe
you should find a little boy.

655
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:47,322
I want you.

656
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:52,192
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

657
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:54,962
He treats me as if
I'm a spoiled child.

658
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,064
Oh, and you're not?

659
00:39:58,098 --> 00:40:01,434
Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?

660
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,636
How many wars
have you fought in?

661
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,140
Oh, and how much did your father
spend on that armor of yours?

662
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:09,743
Hold still.

663
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:12,979
All I ever hear from Robert and
Stannis is how I'm not tough enough,

664
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:15,081
how I squirm
at the sight of blood--

665
00:40:15,116 --> 00:40:17,651
you did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

666
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:19,615
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!

667
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,688
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

668
00:40:21,757 --> 00:40:22,957
Easy for you to say.

669
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:25,559
Not everyone is such
a gifted swordsman.

670
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:28,094
It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

671
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:30,263
I'm good because
I work at it--

672
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:33,032
every day of my life
since I could hold a stick.

673
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:35,401
I could work at fighting
all day, every day,

674
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:37,337
and still never
be as good as you.

675
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:39,939
Yes well, I guess
we'll never know.

676
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,885
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

677
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:54,554
So how did it end up?

678
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,188
The Targaryen
girl will die?

679
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:59,358
It needs to be done,
unpleasant as it is.

680
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,593
Robert's rather
tasteless about it.

681
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,462
Every time he talks
about killing her,

682
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:05,665
I swear the table
rises six inches.

683
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:08,434
It's a shame he can't muster the
same enthusiasm for his wife.

684
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:11,170
He does have a deep, abiding
lust for her money.

685
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:13,339
You have to give it
to the Lannisters--

686
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:15,274
they may be the most
pompous, ponderous cunts

687
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:16,976
the gods ever suffered
to walk the world,

688
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,678
but they do have outrageous
amounts of money.

689
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:23,082
I have an outrageous
amount of money.

690
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:25,083
Not as much
as the Lannisters.

691
00:41:25,117 --> 00:41:27,385
But a lot more than you.

692
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:31,388
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

693
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:33,757
Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

694
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,359
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

695
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,862
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

696
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,866
Oh. But Robert
loves his killing.

697
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,302
- And he's the King.
- Hmm.

698
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,639
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

699
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,975
And he used to be
good at it.

700
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,978
Do you know
who should be king?

701
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:56,848
- Be serious.
- I am.

702
00:41:56,883 --> 00:41:59,184
My father could be
your bank.

703
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:02,086
I've never fought in a war before,
but I'd fight for you.

704
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:04,021
I'm fourth in line.

705
00:42:04,056 --> 00:42:06,857
And where was Robert in the line
of royal succession?

706
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:08,357
Joffrey is a monster.

707
00:42:08,382 --> 00:42:10,093
- Tommen is eight.
- Stannis?

708
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:12,023
Stannis has the
personality of a lobster.

709
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,230
He's still
my older brother.

710
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,566
- What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

711
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,714
You cut me.

712
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,143
It's just blood.
We've all got it in us.

713
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:21,537
Sometimes a little spills.

714
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:24,974
If you become King, you're
going to see a lot of this.

715
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:26,809
You need to get used to it.

716
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:28,977
Go on. Look.

717
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,582
People love you.

718
00:42:34,884 --> 00:42:36,919
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

719
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,121
They want to be near you.

720
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,794
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

721
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,563
but you don't gloat over it.

722
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,832
You don't love killing.

723
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,670
Where is it written
that power

724
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:57,472
is the sole province
of the worst?

725
00:42:57,506 --> 00:42:59,574
That thrones are only made

726
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:01,909
for the hated
and the feared?

727
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:08,083
You would be
a wonderful King.

728
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:28,539
I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

729
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:30,474
<i>You seemed</i>
<i>so good together.</i>

730
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:33,544
I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.

731
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:40,150
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

732
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:42,152
I suppose this is where
you tell me

733
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:45,022
to give the job
to your brother Jaime.

734
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:46,691
No.

735
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:48,826
He's not serious enough.

736
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,795
I'll say this for Ned Stark:

737
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,930
He's serious enough.

738
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,967
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

739
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:59,103
I don't know.

740
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,309
But I do know this:

741
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:09,413
If the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

742
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:13,651
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

743
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,221
We won't be able
to stop them.

744
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,757
<i>The Dothraki don't sail.</i>
<i>Every child knows that.</i>

745
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,693
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armor.

746
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:24,695
They don't have
siege weapons.

747
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,563
It's a neat
little trick you do:

748
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:29,867
You move your lips and
your father's voice comes out.

749
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:33,036
Is my father wrong?

750
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,243
Let's say
Viserys Targaryen lands

751
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:42,747
with 40,000 Dothraki
screamers at his back.

752
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:45,282
<i>We hole up</i>
<i>in our castles--</i>

753
00:44:45,317 --> 00:44:48,052
<i>a wise move--</i>
<i>only a fool</i>

754
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:50,988
<i>would meet the Dothraki</i>
<i>in an open field.</i>

755
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,858
They leave us
in our castles.

756
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:57,395
They go from town to town,
looting and burning,

757
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:01,098
<i>killing every man who can't</i>
<i>hide behind a stone wall,</i>

758
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:04,168
<i>stealing all our crops</i>
<i>and livestock,</i>

759
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,670
enslaving all our women
and children.

760
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,706
How long do the people of the
Seven Kingdoms stand behind

761
00:45:09,741 --> 00:45:13,143
their absentee King,
their cowardly King

762
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,611
hiding behind high walls?

763
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,481
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

764
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,150
is the rightful monarch
after all?

765
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:24,621
We still outnumber them.

766
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:29,627
Which is the bigger number:
Five or one?

767
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:32,097
Five.

768
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:34,767
Five...

769
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:38,171
One.

770
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:41,174
One army--
a real army

771
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:44,477
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

772
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:50,783
Our purpose died
with the Mad King.

773
00:45:50,817 --> 00:45:53,018
Now we've got
as many armies

774
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:56,622
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

775
00:45:56,656 --> 00:45:59,124
And everybody wants
something different.

776
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,393
Your father wants
to own the world.

777
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:04,897
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

778
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,532
What do you want?

779
00:46:16,578 --> 00:46:20,314
We haven't had a real fight
in nine years.

780
00:46:20,348 --> 00:46:22,817
Back-stabbing doesn't
prepare you for a fight.

781
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:25,052
And that's all
the realm is now:

782
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:27,222
Back-stabbing
and scheming

783
00:46:27,256 --> 00:46:30,959
and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

784
00:46:30,993 --> 00:46:34,129
Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.

785
00:46:34,163 --> 00:46:36,531
Our marriage.

786
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,077
Ah, so here we sit

787
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:51,379
17 years later,

788
00:46:51,413 --> 00:46:54,048
<i>holding it all together.</i>

789
00:46:55,217 --> 00:46:57,519
Don't you get tired?

790
00:46:57,553 --> 00:46:59,654
Every day.

791
00:47:00,857 --> 00:47:04,327
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

792
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:08,331
Well, 17 years
is quite a long time.

793
00:47:08,365 --> 00:47:10,499
Yes, it is.

794
00:47:11,635 --> 00:47:13,502
Yes, it is.

795
00:47:18,608 --> 00:47:20,709
What was she like?

796
00:47:23,045 --> 00:47:25,513
You've never asked
about her, not once.

797
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:27,916
Why not?

798
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:31,286
At first, just saying
her name even in private

799
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:35,057
felt like I was breathing
life back into her.

800
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:37,292
I thought if I didn't
talk about her,

801
00:47:37,326 --> 00:47:39,761
she'd just
fade away for you.

802
00:47:39,796 --> 00:47:42,498
When I realized that
wasn't going to happen,

803
00:47:42,532 --> 00:47:45,234
I refused to ask
out of spite.

804
00:47:45,268 --> 00:47:47,436
I didn't want to give you
the satisfaction

805
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:50,740
of thinking I cared
enough to ask.

806
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:54,144
And eventually it became clear that
my spite didn't mean anything to you.

807
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:57,081
As far as I could tell,
you actually enjoyed it.

808
00:47:57,116 --> 00:47:59,317
So why now?

809
00:48:00,853 --> 00:48:04,822
What harm could Lyanna Stark's
ghost do to either of us

810
00:48:04,856 --> 00:48:08,026
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

811
00:48:11,964 --> 00:48:14,599
You want to know
the horrible truth?

812
00:48:17,203 --> 00:48:19,838
I can't even remember
what she looked like.

813
00:48:22,675 --> 00:48:27,581
<i>I only know she was the one</i>
<i>thing I ever wanted...</i>

814
00:48:29,217 --> 00:48:33,187
Someone took her
away from me,

815
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:38,026
and Seven Kingdoms couldn't
fill the hole she left behind.

816
00:48:41,764 --> 00:48:44,466
I felt something
for you once, you know?

817
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:47,368
I know.

818
00:48:47,403 --> 00:48:50,604
Even after we lost
our first boy.

819
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:54,307
For quite a while, actually.

820
00:48:58,145 --> 00:49:00,180
<i>Was it ever</i>
<i>possible for us?</i>

821
00:49:00,214 --> 00:49:03,050
Was there ever a time,
ever a moment?

822
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,459
No.

823
00:49:15,465 --> 00:49:18,467
<i>Does that make you feel</i>
<i>better or worse?</i>

824
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:25,573
It doesn't make me
feel anything.

825
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,423
She looks like him,
don't she, My Lord?

826
00:49:43,457 --> 00:49:47,361
She has his nose,
his black hair.

827
00:49:47,395 --> 00:49:49,363
Aye.

828
00:49:49,397 --> 00:49:51,532
Tell him when you
see him, My Lord.

829
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:55,583
If it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

830
00:49:56,573 --> 00:49:58,218
I will.

831
00:49:58,243 --> 00:50:00,801
And tell him I've been
with no one else.

832
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:04,713
I swear it, My Lord,
by the old gods and new.

833
00:50:04,747 --> 00:50:07,048
I don't want no jewels
or nothing,

834
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:08,983
just him.

835
00:50:09,018 --> 00:50:10,919
The King was always
good to me.

836
00:50:10,953 --> 00:50:13,121
When Jon Arryn
came to visit you,

837
00:50:13,155 --> 00:50:15,022
what did he want?

838
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:17,157
He wasn't that sort
of man, My Lord.

839
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:20,360
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

840
00:50:20,394 --> 00:50:22,562
healthy.

841
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:27,300
He looks healthy
enough to me.

842
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:31,404
The girl shall want
for nothing.

843
00:50:37,345 --> 00:50:39,847
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

844
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:41,416
I've found.

845
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,019
Whores rarely sink.

846
00:50:48,225 --> 00:50:51,194
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

847
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:54,531
Well, he has more
than you, for a start.

848
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:57,134
- Ned: <i>How many?</i>
- <i>Does it matter?</i>

849
00:50:57,168 --> 00:51:00,237
<i>If you fuck enough women,</i>
<i>some of them will give you presents.</i>

850
00:51:00,271 --> 00:51:02,406
And Jon Arryn tracked
them all down. Why?

851
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,443
He was the King's Hand. Perhaps
Robert wanted them looked after.

852
00:51:05,477 --> 00:51:08,746
He was overcome
with fatherly love.

853
00:51:11,617 --> 00:51:13,284
Come.

854
00:51:19,357 --> 00:51:21,525
- Jory!
- My Lord.

855
00:51:40,346 --> 00:51:42,713
Such a small pack
of wolves.

856
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,351
Stay back, Ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

857
00:51:46,385 --> 00:51:48,419
<i>Was</i> the Hand
of the King.

858
00:51:48,454 --> 00:51:50,088
Now I'm not sure
what he is--

859
00:51:50,122 --> 00:51:52,524
lord of somewhere
very far away.

860
00:51:52,558 --> 00:51:54,993
What's the meaning
of this, Lannister?

861
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:57,395
Get back inside
where it's safe.

862
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,130
I'm looking
for my brother.

863
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:01,199
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

864
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:04,902
Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

865
00:52:06,071 --> 00:52:07,605
I remember him well.

866
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:09,640
It seems he had
some trouble on the road.

867
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:12,009
You wouldn't know what
happened to him, would you?

868
00:52:12,043 --> 00:52:14,311
He was taken at my command

869
00:52:14,345 --> 00:52:16,546
<i>to answer for his crimes.</i>

870
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:19,682
My lords!

871
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:21,317
I'll bring the City Watch.

872
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,721
Come, Stark.

873
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:27,156
I'd rather you die
sword in hand.

874
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,825
- If you threaten My Lord again--
- Threaten?

875
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,828
As in, "I'm going
to open your lord

876
00:52:32,862 --> 00:52:36,432
from balls to brains and
see what Starks are made of"?

877
00:52:36,466 --> 00:52:38,800
You kill me,

878
00:52:38,835 --> 00:52:41,436
your brother's
a dead man.

879
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:43,438
You're right.

880
00:52:43,472 --> 00:52:45,907
Take him alive.
Kill his men.

881
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:56,111
Yah!

882
00:54:21,072 --> 00:54:23,173
My brother, Lord Stark--

883
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:25,609
we want him back.

884
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:44,848
