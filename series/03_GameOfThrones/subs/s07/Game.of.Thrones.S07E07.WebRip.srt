1
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:11,002
Little Theon!
Come and get her.

2
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,626
It's an invitation...
To King's Landing.

3
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:24,126
You will represent my interests

4
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:25,751
at this gathering
as you see them.

5
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:28,211
It's not safe leaving you
with Littlefinger.

6
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:29,919
She's your sister.

7
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:31,710
Arya would never betray
her family.

8
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,439
She would if she
thought I was going to betray Jon.

9
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:39,627
With the faces,
I can become someone else.

10
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:44,211
I wonder what it would feel like
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

11
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:50,086
All I'd need to find out...
is your face.

12
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:55,043
Daenerys will win this war.

13
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:56,501
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

14
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:57,502
you can ask her yourself.

15
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:59,543
She has
a more important request.

16
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:02,085
Cersei thinks the army
of the dead is nothing

17
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:04,377
but a story.
What if we prove her wrong?

18
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:06,542
Bring the dead to her.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Go!

20
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:22,418
We are going to destroy
the Night King and his army.

21
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,752
Thank you, my queen.

23
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:25,959
- Oil?
- Pitch, my lord.

24
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,502
- How many barrels?
- 500, my lord.

25
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:32,584
Get 500 more.

26
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:33,585
Yes, my lord.

27
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:49,001
I still enjoy it
when they call me "my lord."

28
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,459
The thrill will fade.

29
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,960
If we live that long.

30
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,168
Men without cocks.

31
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:57,876
You wouldn't find me
fighting in an army

32
00:04:57,877 --> 00:04:59,834
if I had no cock.

33
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:02,293
What's left
to fight for?

34
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:04,168
Gold?

35
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,001
I spent my life
around soldiers.

36
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:08,127
What do you think
they spend that gold on?

37
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:11,335
Family.

38
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:13,002
Not without a cock,
you don't.

39
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:17,169
Maybe it really is
all cocks in the end.

40
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,542
Yet, your brother has chosen
to side with the cockless.

41
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:27,417
Yes, he's always been
a champion of the downtrodden.

42
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:08,377
I think we're about to be
the downtrodden.

43
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,793
Archers, stand tall!

44
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:15,752
Cover that wall!

45
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:46,793
- How many people live here?
- A million, give or take.

46
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:50,918
That's more people than the
entire North crammed into that.

47
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,085
Why would anyone
want to live that way?

48
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,542
There's more work
in the city.

49
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:57,752
And the brothels
are far superior.

50
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:38,126
Why isn't she with them?

51
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:40,293
I'm afraid I don't know,
Your Grace.

52
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,459
No one has seen her.

53
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,126
And the rest of them?

54
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,376
They're on their way
to the Dragonpit now.

55
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:47,668
Including our brother?

56
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,460
Yes, Your Grace.

57
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,293
If anything goes wrong,

58
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,335
kill the silver-haired
bitch first,

59
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:01,626
then our brother, then the
bastard who calls himself king.

60
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:04,668
The rest of them you can kill
in any order you see fit.

61
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,459
Come, Ser Gregor.

62
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,627
It's time for us
to meet our guests.

63
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:20,542
Why did they build it?

64
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,168
Dragons don't understand
the difference

65
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,376
between what is theirs
and what isn't.

66
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:28,043
Land, livestock,
children...

67
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:30,584
Letting them roam free
around a city was a problem.

68
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:34,376
I imagine it was
a sad joke at the end.

69
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:37,834
An entire arena for a few sickly
creatures smaller than dogs.

70
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:41,335
But in the beginning, when it
was home to Balerion the Dread,

71
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:44,710
it must have been the most
dangerous place in the world.

72
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:53,044
Maybe it still is.

73
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,044
Welcome, my lords.

74
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:09,085
Your friends arrived
before you did.

75
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:11,960
I've been sent to escort
you all to the meeting.

76
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:38,417
A pleasant surprise
in an unpleasant situation.

77
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,085
I never thought I'd see
you again, my lord.

78
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:42,626
Supporting the enemy,
no less.

79
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:45,377
- Hard to blame you.
- Cersei will anyway.

80
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:48,085
I'm glad you're alive.

81
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,335
Come on!

82
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:50,794
You can suck
his magic cock later.

83
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,835
What's in there?

84
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:02,627
Fuck off.

85
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:13,959
I thought
you were dead.

86
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,126
Not yet.

87
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:18,460
You came pretty close.

88
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:22,418
I was only trying
to protect her.

89
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,709
You and me both.

90
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,626
She's alive.

91
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,794
Arya.

92
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:33,668
- Where?
- Winterfell.

93
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,667
Who's protecting her
if you're here?

94
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:40,168
The only one
that needs protecting

95
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,502
is the one that gets
in her way.

96
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:47,044
It won't be me.

97
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:52,251
Here we are...

98
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,793
the heroes of Blackwater Bay.

99
00:10:54,794 --> 00:10:56,376
Strange place for a reunion.

100
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:58,251
It is, my lord.

101
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:01,335
I don't think I'm anyone's
lord anymore, Podrick.

102
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:03,918
Save the titles for
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

103
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,834
I'm sure your new queen will
be happy to restore yours

104
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:08,293
if she ends up
on the throne.

105
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,417
You've been thinking
about our new queen?

106
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:14,751
Perhaps you've been
reconsidering your allegiances.

107
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:16,793
Remember my offer...

108
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:20,210
whatever they're paying you,
I'll pay double.

109
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:22,751
And that would be
double what now, exactly?

110
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:25,293
Don't you worry about me.
I'm doing all right.

111
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:27,626
- Looking after myself.
- Are you?

112
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,085
Helping me to arrange
this meeting

113
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,542
wasn't exactly looking
after yourself, was it?

114
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,335
You put yourself
at risk.

115
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:36,210
I put yourself at risk.
Important difference.

116
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:39,709
It's your head Queen Cersei's offered
a bag of gold for, it's not mine.

117
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,501
Now, thanks to me,

118
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,709
she's got two traitors' heads
coming right through her door.

119
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,168
She can lop them both off
as soon as she gets tired

120
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:50,043
of the clever words that
pour out their pieholes.

121
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:53,251
All thanks to Ser Bronn
of the fucking Blackwater.

122
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:56,543
If that's not looking after
myself, I don't know what is.

123
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,585
It's good
to see you again.

124
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:04,044
Yeah, you, too.

125
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,752
Anyone touches it,
I'll kill you first.

126
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,417
Come on, Pod.

127
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:17,918
Let's you and me
go have a drink

128
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,460
while the fancy folks
talk, eh?

129
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:50,501
I left this shit city

130
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:53,335
because I didn't
want to die in it.

131
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,627
Am I going to die
in this shit city?

132
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,793
You might.

133
00:13:57,794 --> 00:14:01,210
And this is all
your idea.

134
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:04,542
Seems every bad idea has some
Lannister cunt behind it.

135
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,709
And some Clegane cunt
to help them see it through.

136
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:09,417
Remember me?

137
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:11,335
Yeah, you do.

138
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:15,417
You're even fucking
uglier than I am now.

139
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:17,919
What did they do
to you?

140
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,251
Doesn't matter.

141
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,459
That's not how it ends
for you, brother.

142
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,709
You know who's
coming for you.

143
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,794
You've always known.

144
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:44,336
Where is she?

145
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:46,876
She'll be here soon.

146
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,127
Didn't travel with you?

147
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:51,002
No.

148
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,918
We've been here
for some time.

149
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,211
My apologies.

150
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:01,168
We are all facing a unique...

151
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:03,210
Theon!

152
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:05,126
I have your sister.

153
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,543
If you don't submit
to me here, now...

154
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,336
I'll kill her.

155
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:18,542
I think we ought to begin
with larger concerns.

156
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:20,751
Then why
are you talking?

157
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:22,960
You're the smallest
concern here.

158
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:27,210
Do you remember when we
discussed dwarf jokes?

159
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:28,959
His wasn't even good.

160
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,293
He explained it
at the end.

161
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:31,834
Never explain.
It always ruins it.

162
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,335
We don't even
let your kind live

163
00:18:33,336 --> 00:18:36,542
in the Iron Islands,
you know?

164
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,751
We kill you at birth.

165
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,793
An act of mercy
for the parents.

166
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:43,459
Perhaps you ought
to sit down.

167
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,918
Why?

168
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,127
Sit down or leave.

169
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:11,335
We are a group of people
who do not like one another,

170
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:13,877
as this recent
demonstration has shown.

171
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,667
We have suffered
at each other's hands.

172
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:21,043
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

173
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:23,335
If all we wanted
was more of the same,

174
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:25,584
there would be no need
for this gathering.

175
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:28,626
We are entirely capable of
waging war against each other

176
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,335
without meeting
face-to-face.

177
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,210
So instead, we should
settle our differences

178
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,876
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

179
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:36,293
We all know
that will never happen.

180
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:37,668
Then why are we here?

181
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:43,044
This isn't about
living in harmony.

182
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,335
It's just
about living.

183
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:48,918
The same thing
is coming for all of us.

184
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,959
A general you can't
negotiate with.

185
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,709
An army that doesn't leave corpses
behind on the battlefield.

186
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,293
Lord Tyrion tells me a million
people live in this city.

187
00:19:58,294 --> 00:20:01,709
They're about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

188
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,418
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

189
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:10,002
This is serious.

190
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,168
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.

191
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,001
I don't think
it's serious at all.

192
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:16,459
I think it's
another bad joke.

193
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,210
If my brother Jaime
has informed me correctly,

194
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:20,834
you're asking me
for a truce.

195
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:23,377
Yes.
That's all.

196
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:26,460
That's all?

197
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:29,417
Pull back my armies
and stand down

198
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:31,126
while you go
on your monster hunt.

199
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:33,709
Or while you solidify
and expand your position.

200
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,085
Hard for me to know which it
is with my armies pulled back

201
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:41,751
until you return and march on my
capital with four times the men.

202
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:46,086
Your capital will be safe until the
northern threat is dealt with.

203
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:48,793
You have my word.

204
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:50,918
The word of
a would-be usurper.

205
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,918
There is no conversation

206
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,959
that will erase
the last 50 years.

207
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,169
We have something
to show you.

208
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:17,252
We can destroy them
by burning them.

209
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:30,252
And we can destroy them
with dragonglass.

210
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:34,085
If we don't win
this fight,

211
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:38,086
then that is the fate
of every person in the world.

212
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:57,959
There is only one war
that matters...

213
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,294
the Great War.

214
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:02,794
And it is here.

215
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:09,127
I didn't believe
it until I saw them.

216
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:12,794
I saw them all.

217
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:16,709
How many?

218
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,127
A hundred thousand,
at least.

219
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:36,336
Can they swim?

220
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:38,626
No.

221
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,002
Good.

222
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:44,501
I'm taking the Iron Fleet
back to the Iron Islands.

223
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:46,584
What are you
talking about?

224
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,501
I've been
around the world.

225
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:50,876
I've seen everything,
things you couldn't imagine,

226
00:24:50,877 --> 00:24:52,336
and this...

227
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,127
this is the only thing I've
ever seen that terrifies me.

228
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,376
I'm going back
to my island.

229
00:25:07,377 --> 00:25:10,043
You should go
back to yours.

230
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:12,001
When winter's over,

231
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:14,668
we'll be the only ones
left alive.

232
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:26,169
He's right to be afraid.

233
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,126
And a coward to run.

234
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,376
If those things
come for us,

235
00:25:31,377 --> 00:25:33,293
there will be
no kingdoms to rule.

236
00:25:33,294 --> 00:25:35,709
Everything we suffered
will have been for nothing.

237
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,502
Everything we lost
will have been for nothing.

238
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:42,044
The crown accepts
your truce.

239
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:48,418
Until the dead are defeated,
they are the true enemy.

240
00:25:57,252 --> 00:26:00,252
In return, the King in the
North will extend this truce.

241
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,459
He will remain in the North
where he belongs.

242
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,376
He will not take up arms
against the Lannisters.

243
00:26:06,377 --> 00:26:08,793
He will not
choose sides.

244
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:11,085
Just the
King in the North?

245
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:13,542
Not me?

246
00:26:13,543 --> 00:26:16,168
I would never
ask it of you.

247
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:17,751
You would never
agree to it.

248
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:20,252
And if you did, I would trust
you even less than I do now.

249
00:26:21,585 --> 00:26:24,501
I ask it only
of Ned Stark's son.

250
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:28,044
I know Ned Stark's son
will be true to his word.

251
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:45,001
I am true to my word.

252
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:46,752
Or I try to be.

253
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:52,460
That is why I cannot
give you what you ask.

254
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:56,460
I cannot serve
two queens.

255
00:26:58,835 --> 00:27:00,251
And I have already
pledged myself

256
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:04,002
to Queen Daenerys
of House Targaryen.

257
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:17,709
Then there is
nothing left to discuss.

258
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,709
The dead will come north first.
Enjoy dealing with them.

259
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,710
We will deal with
whatever is left of you.

260
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:32,834
Ser Jaime.

261
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:34,293
It's been good
to see you.

262
00:27:34,294 --> 00:27:36,293
I imagine the next time
will be across a battlefield.

263
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:37,876
We both saw
what just happened.

264
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:39,626
We both saw
that... thing.

265
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:42,417
Yes, and I'm not looking forward
to seeing more of them.

266
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:44,085
But I'm loyal
to the queen,

267
00:27:44,086 --> 00:27:46,001
and you're loyal to Sansa
and her dolt brother.

268
00:27:46,002 --> 00:27:48,126
Oh, fuck loyalty!

269
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:49,667
Fuck loyalty?

270
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,210
This goes beyond houses
and honor and oaths.

271
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:54,710
Talk to the queen.

272
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:01,710
And tell her what?

273
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:14,211
I wish you
hadn't done that.

274
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:21,376
I'm grateful
for your loyalty,

275
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:25,459
but my dragon died
so that we could be here.

276
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,876
If it's all for nothing,

277
00:28:27,877 --> 00:28:30,043
then he died
for nothing.

278
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:31,542
I know!

279
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,210
I'm pleased you bent
the knee to our queen.

280
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:36,918
I would have advised
it, had you asked.

281
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,876
But have you
ever considered

282
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:41,085
learning how to lie
every now and then?

283
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,086
Just a bit?

284
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:46,460
I'm not going to swear
an oath I can't uphold.

285
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:49,417
Talk about my father
if you want,

286
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:52,501
tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

287
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:55,584
But when enough people
make false promises,

288
00:28:55,585 --> 00:28:58,751
words stop meaning
anything.

289
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,918
Then there are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

290
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,667
And lies won't help us
in this fight.

291
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:06,751
That is indeed a problem.

292
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:10,294
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

293
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:12,918
Any ideas
as to how we might

294
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,919
change that state
of affairs?

295
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:17,751
Only one.

296
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:20,168
Everyone stays here,

297
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:22,959
and I go and talk
to my sister.

298
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,376
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

299
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:29,168
I don't want Cersei
to murder me either.

300
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:32,168
I could have stayed in my cell and
saved a great deal of trouble.

301
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,210
I did this.

302
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:36,709
- I should go.
- She'll definitely murder you.

303
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,086
I go see
my sister alone.

304
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:43,085
Or we all go home

305
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:44,835
and we're right back
where we started.

306
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,043
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she kicked me out.

307
00:30:51,044 --> 00:30:54,126
She thinks I was an
idiot to trust you.

308
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:56,251
A lot of people seem to
think that, actually.

309
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:57,876
I'm about to step
into a room

310
00:30:57,877 --> 00:30:59,667
with the most murderous
woman in the world

311
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:03,584
who's already tried to kill
me twice, that I know of.

312
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:05,211
Who's an idiot?

313
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:11,085
I suppose we should
say goodbye,

314
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,668
one idiot to another.

315
00:32:11,627 --> 00:32:13,501
I shouldn't be
surprised, I suppose.

316
00:32:13,502 --> 00:32:15,293
She's your kind of woman...

317
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:17,834
a foreign whore who
doesn't know her place.

318
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:21,626
A foreign whore you can't
abduct, beat, or intimidate.

319
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:23,335
That must be
difficult for you.

320
00:32:23,336 --> 00:32:25,793
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

321
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:27,709
- whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
- I didn't know about that.

322
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,793
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

323
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,918
the goal you've worked
towards your entire life...

324
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,001
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- ...the destruction of this family.

325
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:38,335
I am the one preventing
that from happening.

326
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,876
Daenerys didn't want
to debate and negotiate.

327
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,335
She didn't want
to bring you words.

328
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,293
She wanted to bring you
fire and blood

329
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:46,417
until I advised her
otherwise.

330
00:32:46,418 --> 00:32:48,210
I don't want
to destroy our family.

331
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,168
I never have.

332
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,626
You killed our father.

333
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:53,251
After he sentenced me
to death

334
00:32:53,252 --> 00:32:55,834
for a crime I didn't
commit, yes, I killed him.

335
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:57,501
Hate me for it
if you want.

336
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:59,834
I hate myself for it
in spite of what he was,

337
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:02,293
in spite of
what he did to me.

338
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:04,043
Oh, poor little man.

339
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:05,751
Your papa
was mean to you.

340
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:09,793
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

341
00:33:09,794 --> 00:33:11,626
You left us open.

342
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:13,210
You laid us bare
for the vultures,

343
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:16,751
and the vultures came
and tore us apart.

344
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:18,417
You may not
have killed Joffrey,

345
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:20,335
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

346
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:22,376
No one would've touched them
if Father was here.

347
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,959
- No one would have dared...
- I have never been more sorry about anything.

348
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,667
I will not hear it,
not from you.

349
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:28,418
I will not hear it!

350
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,709
All right.

351
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,168
You love your family,

352
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:38,251
and I have
destroyed it.

353
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:41,001
I will always
be a threat.

354
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:42,336
So put an end to me.

355
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:53,376
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

356
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:56,126
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

357
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:57,459
If it weren't for me,

358
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,542
you'd have
two beautiful children.

359
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:01,709
I've thought
about killing you

360
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,377
more times
than I can count.

361
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:07,377
Do it!
Say the word.

362
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:19,293
I am more sorry about the children
than you could ever know.

363
00:35:19,294 --> 00:35:22,459
- I will not...
- I don't care. I loved them.

364
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,335
You know I did.

365
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:27,835
You know it in your heart if
there's anything left of it.

366
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,668
It doesn't matter.

367
00:35:33,627 --> 00:35:37,251
Your love doesn't matter.
Your feelings don't matter.

368
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:39,417
I don't care
why you did what you did.

369
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:42,293
I only care
what it cost us.

370
00:35:42,294 --> 00:35:43,668
It cost us our future.

371
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:47,459
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

372
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,459
Why did you
allow me to come?

373
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,501
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

374
00:35:52,502 --> 00:35:54,251
Yes, no,
not what you hoped for,

375
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,794
but you must have
hoped for something.

376
00:35:57,835 --> 00:36:00,376
What did you hope for?

377
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:04,043
To make Jon Snow submit
to your queen?
Mm, not like this.

378
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:06,417
But eventually, you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

379
00:36:06,418 --> 00:36:08,168
- Yes.
- Why?

380
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:09,751
Because I think

381
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:11,584
she will make the world
a better place.

382
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:13,502
You said she'd destroy
King's Landing.

383
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,626
She knows herself.

384
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:19,168
She chose an advisor

385
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:22,501
who would check her worst
impulses instead of feeding them.

386
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:24,501
That's the difference
between you.

387
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:26,709
I don't care about
checking my worst impulses.

388
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,335
I don't care about making
the world a better place.

389
00:36:29,336 --> 00:36:31,126
Hang the world.

390
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:33,584
That thing
you dragged here,

391
00:36:33,585 --> 00:36:37,043
I know what it is,
I know what it means.

392
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,251
And when it came at me,
I didn't think about the world.

393
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:41,335
Not at all.

394
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:42,918
As soon as
it opened its mouth,

395
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:44,293
the world
disappeared for me,

396
00:36:44,294 --> 00:36:46,417
right down
its black throat.

397
00:36:46,418 --> 00:36:48,793
All I could think about was
keeping those gnashing teeth

398
00:36:48,794 --> 00:36:50,335
away from the ones
who matter most,

399
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:52,126
away from my family.

400
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:55,751
Maybe Euron Greyjoy
had the right idea.

401
00:36:55,752 --> 00:36:58,542
Get on a boat,
take those who matter...

402
00:36:58,543 --> 00:36:59,710
You're pregnant.

403
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:34,876
No one is less happy
about this than I am.

404
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,294
I know.

405
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,459
I respect
what you did.

406
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,794
Wish you hadn't done it,
but I respect it.

407
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,960
This place was the beginning
of the end for my family.

408
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:06,294
A dragon
is not a slave.

409
00:38:09,127 --> 00:38:11,584
They were terrifying.

410
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:13,294
Extraordinary.

411
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,751
They filled people
with wonder and awe,

412
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:20,002
and we locked them
in here.

413
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:22,835
They wasted away.

414
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:26,335
They grew small.

415
00:38:26,336 --> 00:38:28,960
And we grew small
as well.

416
00:38:30,294 --> 00:38:32,876
We weren't extraordinary
without them.

417
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,710
We were just like
everyone else.

418
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:41,668
You're not like
everyone else.

419
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:50,002
And your family
hasn't seen its end.

420
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:52,793
You're still here.

421
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:55,335
I can't
have children.

422
00:38:55,336 --> 00:38:56,918
Who told you that?

423
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,876
The witch who
murdered my husband.

424
00:38:59,877 --> 00:39:02,085
Has it occurred to you
she might not have been

425
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:03,877
a reliable source
of information?

426
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,834
You were right
from the beginning.

427
00:39:11,835 --> 00:39:15,044
If I had trusted you,
everything would be different.

428
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:20,543
So, what now?

429
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,043
I can't forget what I saw
north of the Wall.

430
00:39:27,044 --> 00:39:28,959
And I can't pretend
that Cersei

431
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,252
won't take back half the country
the moment I march north.

432
00:39:34,377 --> 00:39:36,877
It appears Tyrion's
assessment was correct.

433
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,377
We're fucked.

434
00:40:33,543 --> 00:40:35,627
My armies will not
stand down.

435
00:40:37,086 --> 00:40:39,169
I will not pull them
back to the capital.

436
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,460
I will march them north to fight
alongside you in the Great War.

437
00:40:48,543 --> 00:40:50,460
The darkness
is coming for us all.

438
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:55,210
We'll face it together.

439
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:58,001
And when
the Great War is over,

440
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:01,335
perhaps you'll remember
I chose to help

441
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:04,794
with no promises or
assurances from any of you.

442
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:10,211
I expect not.

443
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:14,376
Call our banners.

444
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:15,877
All of them.

445
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:32,126
It's not easy for
ravens to fly in these storms.

446
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:34,126
Perhaps Jon tried
to send word earlier.

447
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:37,542
No, this is
the way he is,

448
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:39,918
the way
he's always been.

449
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:42,542
He never asked for my opinion.
Why would he start now?

450
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:46,293
I can't believe he'd surrender the
Northern crown without consulting you.

451
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:48,709
This is his writing,
his signature.

452
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,876
He pledged to fight
for Daenerys Targaryen.

453
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,959
He's bent the knee.

454
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,542
I've heard gossip

455
00:41:56,543 --> 00:42:00,542
that the Dragon Queen
is quite beautiful.

456
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:02,752
What does that have to do
with anything?

457
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:07,793
Jon is young
and unmarried.

458
00:42:07,794 --> 00:42:10,001
Daenerys is young
and unmarried.

459
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:12,959
You think he wants
to marry her?

460
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,210
An alliance
makes sense.

461
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:18,418
Together, they'd be
difficult to defeat.

462
00:42:20,044 --> 00:42:23,044
He was named
King in the North.

463
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,877
He can be unnamed.

464
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,376
Even if I wanted to,
Arya would never go along.

465
00:42:33,377 --> 00:42:36,210
She always loved Jon far
more than she ever loved me,

466
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:39,417
and she'd kill anyone
who betrayed her family.

467
00:42:39,418 --> 00:42:41,418
You are family, too.

468
00:42:43,418 --> 00:42:46,001
Would Arya really murder
her own sister?

469
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:48,335
Do you know
what she is now?

470
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:51,709
Do you know what
the Faceless Men are?

471
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,918
Only by reputation.

472
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:57,085
They worship the God
of Death, I believe.

473
00:42:57,086 --> 00:42:59,709
I never trust
godly men.

474
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,210
They're killers.

475
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,086
And Arya
was one of them.

476
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,542
What do you think
she's after?

477
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:12,126
She's your sister.

478
00:43:12,127 --> 00:43:14,252
You know her far better
than I ever could.

479
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:22,542
Sometimes when I try to
understand a person's motives,

480
00:43:22,543 --> 00:43:24,460
I play a little game.

481
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
I assume the worst.

482
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,793
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

483
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:39,751
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

484
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:41,959
Then I ask myself,

485
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,126
"How well does
that reason explain

486
00:43:45,127 --> 00:43:48,086
what they say
and what they do?"

487
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,459
So, tell me...

488
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,002
what's the worst thing
she could want?

489
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:01,834
She could
want me dead

490
00:44:01,835 --> 00:44:05,043
because she thinks
I wronged my family.

491
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:07,336
Why did she come
to Winterfell?

492
00:44:10,543 --> 00:44:12,501
To kill me

493
00:44:12,502 --> 00:44:16,335
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

494
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:19,336
Why did she unearth the
letter Cersei made you write?

495
00:44:22,044 --> 00:44:26,126
To provide proof
of my betrayals.

496
00:44:26,127 --> 00:44:30,876
To provide justification
after she murders me.

497
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:34,542
And after
she murders you,

498
00:44:34,543 --> 00:44:37,211
what does she become?

499
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,418
Lady of Winterfell.

500
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,376
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

501
00:45:02,377 --> 00:45:05,043
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

502
00:45:05,044 --> 00:45:06,542
And the Unsullied?

503
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:08,168
We can sail with them
to White Harbor,

504
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:10,876
meet the Dothraki here
on the kingsroad,

505
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:13,834
then ride together
to Winterfell.

506
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:17,085
Perhaps you should fly
to Winterfell, Your Grace.

507
00:45:17,086 --> 00:45:19,584
You have many enemies
in the North.

508
00:45:19,585 --> 00:45:21,834
Thousands fell
fighting your father.

509
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:25,542
All it takes is one angry
man with a crossbow.

510
00:45:25,543 --> 00:45:27,751
He'll see your silver
hair on the kingsroad

511
00:45:27,752 --> 00:45:30,793
and know that one well-placed
bolt will make him a hero.

512
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,418
The man who killed
the conqueror.

513
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,751
It's your decision,
Your Grace.

514
00:45:36,752 --> 00:45:39,959
But if we're going to be
allies in this war,

515
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,043
it's important for the
Northerners to see us as allies.

516
00:45:44,044 --> 00:45:47,210
If we sail
to White Harbor together,

517
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,460
I think it sends
a better message.

518
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,667
I've not come
to conquer the North.

519
00:45:58,668 --> 00:46:01,002
I'm coming to save
the North.

520
00:46:06,627 --> 00:46:07,960
We sail together.

521
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:24,127
Jon.

522
00:46:26,294 --> 00:46:27,627
Can I speak
with you?

523
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,086
All right.

524
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,542
What you did
in King's Landing,

525
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:42,668
what you said...

526
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,251
you could've
lied to Cersei

527
00:46:48,252 --> 00:46:51,169
about bending the knee
to Daenerys.

528
00:46:55,169 --> 00:46:57,627
You risked everything
to tell an enemy the truth.

529
00:46:59,543 --> 00:47:02,001
We went down there
to make peace.

530
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:05,501
And it seems to me we need
to be honest with each other

531
00:47:05,502 --> 00:47:06,877
if we're going
to fight together.

532
00:47:08,418 --> 00:47:10,877
You've always known
what was right.

533
00:47:14,377 --> 00:47:17,667
Even when we were all
young and stupid,

534
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,168
you always knew.

535
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,418
Every step you take...

536
00:47:22,877 --> 00:47:24,751
it's always
the right step.

537
00:47:24,752 --> 00:47:25,876
It's not.

538
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:28,126
It may seem that way
from the outside,

539
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:31,543
but I promise you,
it's not true.

540
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,542
I've done plenty of
things that I regret.

541
00:47:36,543 --> 00:47:38,251
Not compared to me, you haven't.

542
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:39,877
No.

543
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,502
Not compared to you.

544
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:57,377
I always wanted
to do the right thing.

545
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,126
Be the right
kind of person.

546
00:48:02,127 --> 00:48:04,710
But I never knew
what that meant.

547
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:08,460
It always seemed
like there's...

548
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,960
like there was an impossible
choice I had to make.

549
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:19,211
Stark or Greyjoy.

550
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:27,085
Our father was more of a father
to you than yours ever was.

551
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:29,918
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

552
00:48:29,919 --> 00:48:31,793
Betrayed his memory.

553
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:32,794
I did.

554
00:48:37,794 --> 00:48:39,543
But you never
lost him.

555
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:45,502
He's a part of you.

556
00:48:47,044 --> 00:48:48,793
Just like
he's a part of me.

557
00:48:48,794 --> 00:48:50,960
But the things
I've done...

558
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:55,418
It's not my place to
forgive you for all of it.

559
00:48:58,794 --> 00:49:02,001
But what I can
forgive,

560
00:49:02,002 --> 00:49:03,418
I do.

561
00:49:09,794 --> 00:49:11,960
You don't need
to choose.

562
00:49:13,294 --> 00:49:15,252
You're a Greyjoy...

563
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,794
and you're a Stark.

564
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:35,417
When I was
Ramsay's prisoner,

565
00:49:35,418 --> 00:49:39,459
Yara tried
to save me.

566
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,001
She's the only one

567
00:49:43,002 --> 00:49:44,960
who tried to save me.

568
00:49:52,044 --> 00:49:54,210
She needs me now.

569
00:49:54,211 --> 00:49:57,002
So, why are you
still talking to me?

570
00:50:11,252 --> 00:50:12,709
Load up.

571
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,335
Load up, lads.
Go on.

572
00:50:14,336 --> 00:50:16,668
Tide's coming in.

573
00:50:32,794 --> 00:50:35,377
All of us chose
to follow Yara.

574
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:41,667
We left the Iron
Islands for Yara.

575
00:50:41,668 --> 00:50:44,502
She would never
leave one of us behind.

576
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,085
We're not
leaving her behind.

577
00:50:49,086 --> 00:50:50,542
Your sister's dead.

578
00:50:50,543 --> 00:50:52,251
- She's not dead.
- She's dead.

579
00:50:52,252 --> 00:50:55,126
Even if Euron hasn't cut her
throat yet, she's dead.

580
00:50:55,127 --> 00:51:00,251
- She's our queen.
- She's your sister, and you left her to die.

581
00:51:00,252 --> 00:51:01,752
I did.

582
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:07,001
I ran from my uncle.

583
00:51:07,002 --> 00:51:08,417
I was a coward.

584
00:51:08,418 --> 00:51:11,667
So, why in fuck's name
should we listen to you?

585
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:15,293
They say the dead
can't swim.

586
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:16,876
We're going
to sail east,

587
00:51:16,877 --> 00:51:19,251
find a nice,
quiet island,

588
00:51:19,252 --> 00:51:22,251
kill all the men, and take
their wives for ourselves.

589
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:24,667
- We're done with all that.
- Who says we are?

590
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:27,585
Yara did.
She made a pledge.

591
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:32,667
We're going
to find her,

592
00:51:32,668 --> 00:51:35,460
and we're going
to set her free.

593
00:51:43,919 --> 00:51:47,001
Run away,
little Theon.

594
00:51:47,002 --> 00:51:48,960
It's what
you do best.

595
00:51:52,002 --> 00:51:53,793
He needs to shut his mouth.

596
00:52:00,627 --> 00:52:03,502
Hey!

597
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:09,751
Oh, yes!

598
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,502
That's more like it.

599
00:52:29,377 --> 00:52:30,377
Stay down...

600
00:52:31,627 --> 00:52:33,127
or I'll kill you!

601
00:52:43,668 --> 00:52:47,169
I said stay down
or I'll kill you!

602
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:01,752
Not for me.

603
00:54:05,044 --> 00:54:06,501
For Yara!

604
00:54:06,502 --> 00:54:07,919
Yara!

605
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:55,960
Have my sister brought
to the Great Hall.

606
00:55:41,418 --> 00:55:43,211
Are you sure
you want to do this?

607
00:55:46,044 --> 00:55:49,293
It's not what I want.
It's what honor demands.

608
00:55:49,294 --> 00:55:52,210
And what does honor demand?

609
00:55:52,211 --> 00:55:55,085
That I defend my family
from those who would harm us.

610
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:58,710
That I defend the North from
those who would betray us.

611
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,668
All right, then.

612
00:56:04,086 --> 00:56:05,377
Get on with it.

613
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:10,376
You stand accused
of murder.

614
00:56:10,377 --> 00:56:13,210
You stand accused
of treason.

615
00:56:13,211 --> 00:56:16,002
How do you answer
these charges...

616
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:20,252
Lord Baelish?

617
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:37,543
My sister asked you
a question.

618
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:43,752
Lady Sansa,
forgive me...

619
00:56:45,418 --> 00:56:47,210
I'm a bit confused.

620
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:49,501
Which charges
confuse you?

621
00:56:49,502 --> 00:56:51,542
Let's start with
the simplest one...

622
00:56:51,543 --> 00:56:54,126
you murdered our aunt,
Lysa Arryn.

623
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:57,001
You pushed her through the Moon
Door and watched her fall.

624
00:56:57,002 --> 00:56:58,877
Do you deny it?

625
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:02,417
I did it
to protect you.

626
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,459
You did it to take
power in the Vale.

627
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,751
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

628
00:57:07,752 --> 00:57:10,251
You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
to poison him.

629
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:11,294
Do you deny it?

630
00:57:13,627 --> 00:57:16,793
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

631
00:57:16,794 --> 00:57:19,127
she was
a troubled woman.

632
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:21,751
She imagined enemies
everywhere.

633
00:57:21,752 --> 00:57:24,126
You had Aunt Lysa send
a letter to our parents

634
00:57:24,127 --> 00:57:26,626
telling them it was the
Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn

635
00:57:26,627 --> 00:57:28,126
when, really,
it was you.

636
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:30,335
The conflict between
the Starks and the Lannisters,

637
00:57:30,336 --> 00:57:31,834
it was you
who started it.

638
00:57:31,835 --> 00:57:32,918
Do you deny it?

639
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:34,542
I know
of no such letter.

640
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:36,376
You conspired
with Cersei Lannister

641
00:57:36,377 --> 00:57:40,085
and Joffrey Baratheon to
betray our father, Ned Stark.

642
00:57:40,086 --> 00:57:42,626
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

643
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:46,085
and later executed on
false charges of treason.

644
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:48,918
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

645
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:52,293
None of you were there
to see what happened.

646
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:54,251
None of you
knows the truth.

647
00:57:54,252 --> 00:57:56,169
You held a knife
to his throat.

648
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:04,002
You said, "I did warn
you not the trust me."

649
00:58:07,336 --> 00:58:12,002
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

650
00:58:13,336 --> 00:58:15,210
But that was another
one of your lies.

651
00:58:15,211 --> 00:58:17,044
It was yours.

652
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:25,085
Lady Sansa, I have known
you since you were a girl.

653
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:27,751
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

654
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:29,877
By selling me
to the Boltons?

655
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:33,542
If we could
speak alone,

656
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,086
I can explain
everything.

657
00:58:37,294 --> 00:58:40,417
Sometimes when I'm trying to
understand a person's motives,

658
00:58:40,418 --> 00:58:43,001
I play a little game.

659
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:44,668
I assume the worst.

660
00:58:46,044 --> 00:58:47,959
What's the worst
reason you have

661
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,877
for turning me
against my sister?

662
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,793
That's what you do,
isn't it?

663
00:58:53,794 --> 00:58:55,626
That's what
you've always done...

664
00:58:55,627 --> 00:58:57,459
turn family
against family,

665
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,376
turn sister
against sister.

666
00:58:59,377 --> 00:59:01,584
That's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa,

667
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:03,793
and that's what
you tried to do to us.

668
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:05,126
Sansa, please.

669
00:59:05,127 --> 00:59:08,959
I'm a slow learner,
it's true.

670
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,417
But I learn.

671
00:59:10,418 --> 00:59:12,667
Give me a chance
to defend myself.

672
00:59:12,668 --> 00:59:13,960
I deserve that.

673
00:59:19,794 --> 00:59:21,376
I am Lord Protector
of the Vale

674
00:59:21,377 --> 00:59:23,751
and I command you to escort
me safely back to the Eyrie.

675
00:59:23,752 --> 00:59:25,044
I think not.

676
00:59:28,336 --> 00:59:31,044
Sansa, I beg you!

677
00:59:32,543 --> 00:59:34,584
I loved your mother since
the time I was a boy.

678
00:59:34,585 --> 00:59:36,377
And yet,
you betrayed her.

679
00:59:38,418 --> 00:59:41,584
I loved you.

680
00:59:41,585 --> 00:59:43,211
More than anyone.

681
00:59:44,336 --> 00:59:46,127
And yet,
you betrayed me.

682
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,501
When you brought me
back to Winterfell,

683
00:59:50,502 --> 00:59:53,043
you told me there's no
justice in the world,

684
00:59:53,044 --> 00:59:55,252
not unless
we make it.

685
00:59:57,252 --> 01:00:01,667
Thank you for all your many
lessons, Lord Baelish.

686
01:00:01,668 --> 01:00:03,960
I will never
forget them.

687
01:00:07,668 --> 01:00:08,668
Sansa!

688
01:00:15,668 --> 01:00:16,794
I...

689
01:00:39,877 --> 01:00:41,335
Our men in King's Landing

690
01:00:41,336 --> 01:00:43,001
will march north
in three days' time.

691
01:00:43,002 --> 01:00:44,376
It'll take us a fortnight

692
01:00:44,377 --> 01:00:45,709
just to gather supplies
for the train.

693
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,251
We don't
have a fortnight.

694
01:00:47,252 --> 01:00:49,251
If the North falls, we fall.
Three days.

695
01:00:49,252 --> 01:00:50,793
The remaining forces
in the Westerlands

696
01:00:50,794 --> 01:00:52,501
will take
the river road east.

697
01:00:52,502 --> 01:00:54,043
We'll meet at
Lord Harroway's Town

698
01:00:54,044 --> 01:00:56,043
and march together
to Winterfell.

699
01:00:56,044 --> 01:00:57,211
Ser Jaime.

700
01:00:58,336 --> 01:00:59,709
Your Grace.

701
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:02,169
My lords, I need a
moment with my brother.

702
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,627
Your Grace.

703
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:12,667
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition north.

704
01:01:12,668 --> 01:01:15,251
Expedition north?

705
01:01:15,252 --> 01:01:18,542
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

706
01:01:18,543 --> 01:01:21,210
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

707
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:23,335
and you want to fight
alongside them?

708
01:01:23,336 --> 01:01:25,293
Are you a traitor
or an idiot?

709
01:01:25,294 --> 01:01:27,251
You pledged our forces
to fight our common enemy...

710
01:01:27,252 --> 01:01:28,709
I'll say whatever
I need to say

711
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:30,417
to ensure the survival
of our house.

712
01:01:30,418 --> 01:01:33,168
You expect me to trust the
man who murdered our father?

713
01:01:33,169 --> 01:01:36,751
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

714
01:01:36,752 --> 01:01:38,251
to fight for
the Dragon Queen?

715
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:40,168
You saw it
with your own eyes.

716
01:01:40,169 --> 01:01:42,542
You saw a dead man
trying to kill us.

717
01:01:42,543 --> 01:01:44,376
I saw it burn.

718
01:01:44,377 --> 01:01:46,210
If dragons
can't stop them,

719
01:01:46,211 --> 01:01:49,251
if Dothraki and Unsullied
and Northmen can't stop them,

720
01:01:49,252 --> 01:01:51,251
how will our armies
make a difference?

721
01:01:51,252 --> 01:01:53,251
This isn't about
noble houses,

722
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:55,376
this is about
the living and the dead!

723
01:01:55,377 --> 01:01:57,417
And I intend to stay
amongst the living.

724
01:01:57,418 --> 01:02:00,626
Let the Stark boy and his
new queen defend the North.

725
01:02:00,627 --> 01:02:02,834
We stay here
where we've always been.

726
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:05,377
I made a promise.

727
01:02:07,543 --> 01:02:10,959
Our child
will rule Westeros.

728
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,834
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

729
01:02:15,835 --> 01:02:17,417
The monsters are real.

730
01:02:17,418 --> 01:02:19,542
The white walkers,

731
01:02:19,543 --> 01:02:21,793
the dragons,
the Dothraki screamers...

732
01:02:21,794 --> 01:02:25,793
all the frightening stories we heard
when we were young, they're all real.

733
01:02:25,794 --> 01:02:27,501
So be it.

734
01:02:27,502 --> 01:02:29,626
Let the monsters
kill each other.

735
01:02:29,627 --> 01:02:31,876
And while they battle
in the North,

736
01:02:31,877 --> 01:02:34,293
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

737
01:02:34,294 --> 01:02:37,085
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

738
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:40,001
When the fighting in the
North is over, someone wins.

739
01:02:40,002 --> 01:02:42,168
You understand that,
don't you?

740
01:02:42,169 --> 01:02:45,667
If the dead win, they march
south and kill us all.

741
01:02:45,668 --> 01:02:48,751
If the living win,
and we've betrayed them,

742
01:02:48,752 --> 01:02:50,709
they march south
and kill us all!

743
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,709
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

744
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,126
Most of them
will die in the North.

745
01:02:55,127 --> 01:02:56,709
I faced them
in the field.

746
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:59,251
We can't beat them.
We can't beat their dragons.

747
01:02:59,252 --> 01:03:00,793
How many dragons
did you see at the pit?

748
01:03:00,794 --> 01:03:02,793
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

749
01:03:02,794 --> 01:03:05,293
For all we know,
it's guarding her fleet!

750
01:03:05,294 --> 01:03:08,626
She came here with her dragons and
her Dothraki and her Unsullied.

751
01:03:08,627 --> 01:03:11,417
She came here to show us
all her power.

752
01:03:11,418 --> 01:03:14,459
No, something happened.
The dragons are vulnerable.

753
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,001
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

754
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,834
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

755
01:03:18,835 --> 01:03:21,502
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

756
01:03:23,502 --> 01:03:27,459
You should've listened more when Father
spoke about the importance of gold.

757
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,626
Oh, I know
it's boring for you.

758
01:03:29,627 --> 01:03:33,251
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

759
01:03:33,252 --> 01:03:35,834
But I listened,
I learned.

760
01:03:35,835 --> 01:03:39,834
Highgarden bought us the most
powerful army in Essos...

761
01:03:39,835 --> 01:03:41,626
the Golden Company.

762
01:03:41,627 --> 01:03:45,335
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

763
01:03:45,336 --> 01:03:47,001
The Golden Company
is not here.

764
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:48,376
They're in Essos.

765
01:03:48,377 --> 01:03:52,335
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

766
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:54,834
Do you really think
Euron Greyjoy turned tail

767
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:56,460
and sailed back
to the Iron Islands?

768
01:03:57,585 --> 01:03:58,959
Do you think
he abandoned

769
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,210
the chance to marry
the queen?

770
01:04:02,211 --> 01:04:04,543
No one walks away
from me.

771
01:04:06,377 --> 01:04:08,043
He's sailing with
his fleet to Essos.

772
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:10,126
He's going to ferry
the Golden Company back here

773
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:11,668
to help us win
the war for Westeros.

774
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:17,376
You plotted with Euron
Greyjoy without telling me,

775
01:04:17,377 --> 01:04:19,210
the commander
of your armies?

776
01:04:19,211 --> 01:04:21,834
And you conspired
with Tyrion,

777
01:04:21,835 --> 01:04:23,210
the man who murdered
our father,

778
01:04:23,211 --> 01:04:24,542
without telling me,
your queen.

779
01:04:24,543 --> 01:04:26,001
I didn't conspire
with him.

780
01:04:26,002 --> 01:04:27,876
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

781
01:04:27,877 --> 01:04:29,876
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

782
01:04:29,877 --> 01:04:32,168
That is the definition
of conspiracy.

783
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:34,542
I pledged
to ride north.

784
01:04:34,543 --> 01:04:36,376
I intend to honor
that pledge.

785
01:04:36,377 --> 01:04:38,584
- And that will be treason.
- Treason?

786
01:04:38,585 --> 01:04:40,834
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

787
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,169
What would you
call it?

788
01:04:44,169 --> 01:04:46,044
Doesn't matter
what I'd call it.

789
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:55,752
I told you no one
walks away from me.

790
01:04:58,086 --> 01:05:00,627
Are you going to
order him to kill me?

791
01:05:02,752 --> 01:05:04,709
I'm the only one
you have left.

792
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:07,168
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

793
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:08,918
It's just
me and you now.

794
01:05:08,919 --> 01:05:10,919
There's one more
yet to come.

795
01:05:13,919 --> 01:05:15,919
Give the order, then.

796
01:05:35,294 --> 01:05:37,002
I don't
believe you.

797
01:07:24,919 --> 01:07:27,418
Come in.

798
01:07:31,418 --> 01:07:32,876
Samwell Tarly.

799
01:07:32,877 --> 01:07:35,085
I wasn't sure
if you'd remember me.

800
01:07:35,086 --> 01:07:36,919
I remember everything.

801
01:07:45,086 --> 01:07:47,251
You helped us
get beyond the Wall.

802
01:07:47,252 --> 01:07:49,793
- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

803
01:07:49,794 --> 01:07:52,418
but, um, I'm not sure
that I am.

804
01:07:56,585 --> 01:07:58,752
What happened to you
beyond the Wall?

805
01:08:00,169 --> 01:08:01,752
I became
the Three-Eyed Raven.

806
01:08:03,377 --> 01:08:04,460
Oh!

807
01:08:07,752 --> 01:08:10,126
I don't know
what that means.

808
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:12,876
I can see things
that happened in the past.

809
01:08:12,877 --> 01:08:16,959
I can see things
happening now

810
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,460
all over the world.

811
01:08:19,877 --> 01:08:22,294
Why did you come
to Winterfell?

812
01:08:23,585 --> 01:08:24,960
Um...

813
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:29,335
Jon's the one to lead
the fight against the dead.

814
01:08:29,336 --> 01:08:31,417
I know he is.

815
01:08:31,418 --> 01:08:33,376
But he can't
do it alone,

816
01:08:33,377 --> 01:08:36,251
so I've come here
to help him.

817
01:08:36,252 --> 01:08:39,126
He's on his way
back to Winterfell

818
01:08:39,127 --> 01:08:40,752
with Daenerys Targaryen.

819
01:08:41,919 --> 01:08:44,959
You...
you saw this in...

820
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,627
in a vision?

821
01:08:49,627 --> 01:08:50,835
Oh.

822
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:55,835
He needs to know
the truth.

823
01:08:57,086 --> 01:08:58,376
The truth
about what?

824
01:08:58,377 --> 01:09:00,168
About himself.

825
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:03,709
No one knows.
No one but me.

826
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:06,667
Jon isn't really
my father's son.

827
01:09:06,668 --> 01:09:10,834
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

828
01:09:10,835 --> 01:09:14,667
He was born
in a tower in Dorne.

829
01:09:14,668 --> 01:09:17,126
His last name
isn't really Snow,

830
01:09:17,127 --> 01:09:18,127
it's Sand.

831
01:09:20,502 --> 01:09:21,502
It's not.

832
01:09:23,086 --> 01:09:25,501
Dornish bastards
are named Sand.

833
01:09:25,502 --> 01:09:29,126
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

834
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:31,877
He annulled Rhaegar's
marriage to Elia.

835
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:36,585
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

836
01:09:37,877 --> 01:09:39,335
Are you certain?

837
01:09:39,336 --> 01:09:42,043
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

838
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:43,877
I don't know
why he'd lie.

839
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:48,252
Is this something
you can see?

840
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:53,542
Father, Smith, Warrior,

841
01:09:53,543 --> 01:09:58,417
Mother, Maiden,
Crone, Stranger.

842
01:09:58,418 --> 01:10:02,210
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

843
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:06,542
from this day
until the end of my days.

844
01:10:06,543 --> 01:10:09,668
Robert's
Rebellion was built on a lie.

845
01:10:11,794 --> 01:10:14,919
Rhaegar didn't
kidnap my aunt or rape her.

846
01:10:24,502 --> 01:10:26,044
He loved her.

847
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:35,418
And she loved him.

848
01:11:01,835 --> 01:11:04,794
And Jon...

849
01:11:06,835 --> 01:11:08,627
Jon's real name...

850
01:11:10,627 --> 01:11:14,959
His name
is Aegon Targaryen.

851
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,169
You have
to protect him.

852
01:11:18,668 --> 01:11:20,585
Promise me, Ned.

853
01:11:43,377 --> 01:11:45,668
He's never been a bastard.

854
01:11:49,585 --> 01:11:52,294
He's the
heir to the Iron Throne.

855
01:12:07,127 --> 01:12:08,835
He needs to know.

856
01:12:12,044 --> 01:12:13,835
We need to tell him.

857
01:12:24,169 --> 01:12:26,876
Are you
all right?

858
01:12:26,877 --> 01:12:28,793
It's just strange.

859
01:12:28,794 --> 01:12:32,752
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

860
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:38,251
You did
the right thing.

861
01:12:38,252 --> 01:12:40,793
You did it.

862
01:12:40,794 --> 01:12:42,626
I'm just
the executioner.

863
01:12:42,627 --> 01:12:44,377
You passed
the sentence.

864
01:12:46,543 --> 01:12:49,376
You're the Lady
of Winterfell.

865
01:12:49,377 --> 01:12:50,752
Does that bother you?

866
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:56,211
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

867
01:12:57,668 --> 01:12:59,169
So I had to be
something else.

868
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,126
I never could have survived
what you survived.

869
01:13:04,127 --> 01:13:06,459
You would have.

870
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:08,460
You're the strongest
person I know.

871
01:13:12,543 --> 01:13:15,086
I believe that's the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

872
01:13:16,668 --> 01:13:20,459
Well, don't get
used to it.

873
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,710
You're still very
strange and annoying.

874
01:13:29,211 --> 01:13:31,211
"In winter, we must
protect ourselves.

875
01:13:32,752 --> 01:13:34,794
Look after
one another."

876
01:13:36,919 --> 01:13:38,627
Father.

877
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:45,918
"When the snows fall
and the white winds blow,

878
01:13:45,919 --> 01:13:47,876
the lone wolf dies,

879
01:13:47,877 --> 01:13:50,336
but the pack survives."

880
01:13:57,336 --> 01:13:58,627
I miss him.

881
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,460
Me, too.

882
01:15:25,086 --> 01:15:27,210
It's a long way down.

883
01:15:27,211 --> 01:15:31,044
Yeah. The crows keep telling
me I'll get used to it.

884
01:15:39,794 --> 01:15:42,834
I can see movement...

885
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:45,543
Watch, on the tree line!

886
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:48,376
What is it?

887
01:16:55,668 --> 01:17:08,376

889

Run! Run!
