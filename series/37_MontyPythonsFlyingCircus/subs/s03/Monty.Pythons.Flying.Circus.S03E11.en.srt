1
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,907
Boxing tonight comes
from the empire pool, wembley

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,775
And features
the main heavyweight bout

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,312
Between jack bodell, british
and empire heavyweight champion

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,083
And sir kenneth clark.

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,985
It's the first time
these two have met

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,421
So there should be
some real action tonight.

7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,390
This then is the height

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,926
Of the english
renaissance

9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,096
The triumph of classical
over gothic...

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,531
He's down.

11
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:35,435
Sir kenneth clark is down
in eight seconds.

12
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,938
But he's up again,
he's up at six.

13
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,774
The almost ordered facades
of palladio's villas reflect...

14
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,910
And he's down again

15
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:48,849
And I don't think he's going
to get up this time.

16
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,988
No, so jack bodell has
defeated sir kenneth clark

17
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,424
In the very first round
here tonight.

18
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,594
And so this big lincolnshire
heavyweight becomes

19
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:04,965
The new oxford
professor of fine art.

20
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,633
Thank you.

21
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,968
Thank you.

22
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,304
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

23
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,140
And now...

24
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,810
It's...

25
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:24,551
Monty python's
flying circuseses.

26
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,799
Stand and deliver!

27
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,170
Drop that gun!

28
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,039
Let that be a warning
to you all.

29
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,042
You move at your peril
for I have two pistols here.

30
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,344
I know one of them
isn't loaded anymore

31
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,681
But the other one is, so
that's one of you dead for sure

32
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,183
Or just about
for sure anyway.

33
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,417
It certainly
wouldn't be

34
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,785
Worth your while
risking it

35
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,253
Because I'm
a very good shot.

36
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,288
I practice
every day.

37
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,989
Well, not absolutely every day

38
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,491
But most days in the week.

39
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,995
I expect I must practice
four or five times a week...

40
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,730
At least... at least
four or five

41
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,666
Only some weekends,
like last weekend

42
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,900
There wasn't much time

43
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,836
So that brings the average
down a bit.

44
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,537
But I should say

45
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:54,174
It's definitely a solid
four days' practice every week

46
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,609
At least.

47
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,544
I mean, I reckon I could hit
that tree over there--

48
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,979
The one behind the hillock.

49
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,615
Not the big hillock,
the little hillock on the left.

50
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,016
You can see the three trees--

51
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,151
The third
from the left

52
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,619
And back a bit,
that one--

53
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:10,357
I reckon I could hit that
four times out of five...

54
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,892
On a good day.

55
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:16,129
Say, with this wind, say...
say, seven times out of ten.

56
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,431
What-- that tree there?

57
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:17,998
Which one?

58
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,132
The big beech

59
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,567
With the sort
of bare branch

60
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,935
Coming out
of the top left.

61
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,403
No, no, not that one.

62
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,372
No, no, he means
the one over there.

63
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,140
Look, do you see
that one there?

64
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,208
Yes.

65
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,177
Well, now go two
along to the right.

66
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,079
Just near
that little bush.

67
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,381
Well, it's the one
just behind it.

68
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,049
Ah, the elm!

69
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,551
That's not an elm.

70
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,987
An elm's got sort of great
clumps of leaves like that.

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,658
That's either a beech
or a, um... a, uh... a hornbeam.

72
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,059
A hornbeam?

73
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,127
No, not a hornbeam.

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,395
What's the tree that has

75
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,430
A leaf with sort of
regular veins coming out

76
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,399
And the veins go
all the way out to the...

77
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:52,966
Serrated!

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,668
To the serrated edges?

79
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,702
A willow.

80
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,570
That's right.

81
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,405
That's nothing like a willow.

82
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,307
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

83
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,744
I could hit it seven times
out of ten-- that's the point.

84
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:04,745
Never a willow.

85
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,346
Shut up!

86
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,383
This is a holdup,
not a botany lesson.

87
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:14,054
Right! now, my fine friends,
no false moves, please.

88
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,224
I want you to hand over
all the lupins you've got.

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,559
Lupins?!

90
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,028
Yes, lupins, come on, come on!

91
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,863
What do you mean-- lupins?

92
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,965
Don't try and play for time.

93
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:25,999
I'm not.

94
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,134
You mean the flower lupins?

95
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,402
That's right.

96
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,570
Well, we haven't
got any lupins.

97
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,737
Honestly.

98
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,039
Look, my fine friends

99
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,843
I happen to know
that this is the lupin express.

100
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,145
You must be out
of your tiny mind.

101
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,680
Get out of the coach.

102
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,083
Come on, get out!

103
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,888
Just as I thought.

104
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,091
Not clever enough,
my fine friends.

105
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,528
Come on, concorde.

106
00:04:55,896 --> 00:05:00,200
Well, so much for the lupins.

107
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,402
Dennis moore, dennis moore

108
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,404
Galloping through the sward

109
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,573
Dennis moore, dennis moore

110
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,242
And his horse, concorde

111
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,410
He steals from the rich

112
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,579
And gives to the poor

113
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,248
Mr. moore

114
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,415
Mr. moore...

115
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,750
Here we are,
I'll be back.

116
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,586
Mr. moore.

117
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,229
Morning,
mrs. trepidatious.

118
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,331
Oh, I don't know
what's good about it.

119
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,734
My right arm's hanging off
something awful.

120
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,636
Oh, you want to
have that seen to.

121
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,304
What-- by that dr. morrison?

122
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,574
He's killed more patients
than I've had severe boils.

123
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,976
What do the stars say?

124
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,445
Well, petula clark says
burst them early

125
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,147
But david frost...

126
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,782
No, the stars in the paper

127
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,753
You cloth-eared heap
of anteater's catarrh.

128
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,656
The zodiacal signs,
the horoscopic fates

129
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,524
The astrological portents

130
00:05:57,558 --> 00:06:00,561
The omens, the genethliac
prognostications

131
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:04,431
The mantalogical harbingers,
the vaticinal utterances

132
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,001
The fratidical premonitory utterances
of the mantalogical omens.

133
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,637
What do the bleeding stars
in the paper predict

134
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,440
Forecast, prophesy,
foretell, prognosticate...

135
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,076
And this is where
you at home can join in.

136
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,644
Forebode, bode,
augur, spell...

137
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:20,113
Foretoken, presage, portend

138
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:23,617
Foreshow, foreshadow, fore-run

139
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,288
Herald, point to, betoken,
indicate?!

140
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:29,957
I don't know.

141
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,458
What are you?

142
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,693
I'm nesbitt.

143
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,697
There's not a zodiacal
sign called nesbitt.

144
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,132
All right,
derry and toms.

145
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:43,804
"aquarius, scorpio, virgo,
derry and toms.

146
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:48,675
April 29 to march 22,
even dates only."

147
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,877
Well, what does it presage?

148
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,479
"you have green, scaly skin

149
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,348
"and a soft
yellow underbelly

150
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,216
"with a series of finlike ridges

151
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,151
"running down your spine
and tail.

152
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,686
"although lizardlike in shape

153
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,089
"you can grow anything
up to 30 feet in length

154
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,324
"with huge teeth
that can bite off

155
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,826
"great rocks
and trees.

156
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,295
"you inhabit arid
subtropical zones

157
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,163
And wear spectacles."

158
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,833
Hmm, it's very good
about the spectacles.

159
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,368
It's amazing!

160
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,136
Hmm, what's yours,
irene?

161
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,137
Basil.

162
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,472
I'm sorry, what's
yours, basil?

163
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,008
No, that's my
star sign-- basil.

164
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,342
There isn't
a star sign...

165
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,577
Yes, there is.

166
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,146
"aquarius, sagittarius,
derry and toms

167
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,017
Basil-- june 21 till june 22."

168
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,385
Well, what does it say?

169
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,153
"you have green, scaly skin

170
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,656
"and a series of yellow
underbellies running down

171
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,124
Your spine
and tail..."

172
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,158
That's exactly the same!

173
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,826
Oh! try another one.

174
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,528
What's aquarius?

175
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,930
It's a zodiacal sign.

176
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,665
I know that!

177
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,168
What's it say in the paper,
mrs. flan-and-pickle?

178
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:50,404
All right.

179
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,840
Oh! it says,
"a wonderful day ahead.

180
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,109
"you'll be surrounded
by family and friends.

181
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,278
"roger moore will
drop in for lunch

182
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,247
"bringing tony curtis with him.

183
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,117
"in the afternoon, a substantial
cash sum will come your way.

00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,387
"in the evening, petula clark
will visit your home

185
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,957

the mike sammes singers.

"before you go to bed,
peter wyngarde will come

188
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,465
And declare
his undying love for you."

189
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,534
Both:
eww!

190
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,602
What's scorpio?

191
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,537
Oh, that's very good.

192
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,274
"you will have lunch with a
school friend of duane eddy's

193

instrumental hits.

"in the afternoon,
you will die.

00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,181
You will
be buried..."

197
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,516
Good morning.

198
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,817
Oh, morning, doctor.

199
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,520
And how's the old arm
this morning, mrs. ikon?

200
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,788
Oh, it's still hanging off at
the shoulder.

201
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:46,026
Good, well, let's have
a look at it, shall we?

202
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,528
Oh, damn!

203
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,197
Oh, damn this
wretched little bag.

204
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,534
Oh, damn, this wretched,
bloody little bag.

205
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,970
If there's one thing I hate
about being a doctor

206
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,673
It's this wretched,
bloody little bag.

207
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,377
Oh, damn this wretched,
bloody little bag!

208
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,712
Damn it!

209
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,148
Damn that wretched
little bag.

210
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:12,486
Damn you wretched
little bag!

211
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,626
There, right.

212
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:24,998
What's that doing in here?

213
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,168
Right! well...

214
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:32,072
Hand over the money.

215
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,277
Come on, all of it.

216
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,918
Thank you.

217
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,387
Yes, that seems
to be okay.

218
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:51,725
I'll just test
your reflexes.

219
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,628
Everything seems
to be okay.

220
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,029
I'll see you
next week.

221
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,931
Keep collecting
the pensions

222
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,067
And try not to spend
too much on food.

223
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,301
Thank you, doctor.

224
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:02,503
Morning, mr. henson.

225
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:03,570
How are we today?

226
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,905
Not too bad, doctor.

227
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,407
Okay, take it easy.

228
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,576
Expecting any postal
orders this week?

229
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,577
No.

230
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,578
Righto.

231
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,980
Ah, mr. rodgers,
have you got

232
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,581
Your unemployment
benefits, please?

233
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,083
Right-- well,
can you write me

234
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,786
A check then, please?

235
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,757
Thank you very much.

236
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,261
Soon have you
down to nothing.

237
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,797
Ah, mr. millichope.

238
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:48,575
Hmm... two hours
left to do.

239
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:08,862
Ooh, lovely!

240
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,566
Dinner's ready, dear.

241
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,335
Sorry, your time's up,
mr. spewm.

242
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,604
I'm afraid you lose
both the 3p suite

243
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:21,808
And your youngest daughter.

244
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,006
Hello.

245
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,875
Should there be another
television channel

246
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,510
Or should there not?

247
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,745
On tonight's program,
the minister for broadcasting

248
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,647
The right honorable
mr. ian throat m.p.

249
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,615
Good evening.

250
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,883
The chairman

251
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,385
Of amalgamated money tv,
sir abe sappenheim.

252
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,320
Good evening.

253
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,855
The shadow spokesman

254
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,823
For television, lord kinwoodie.

255
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:10,757
Hello.

256
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,825
And a television critic

257
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:12,860
Mr. patrick loone.

258
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:13,894
Hello.

259
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,262
Gentlemen

260
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,998
Should there be a fourth
television channel or not?

261
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,333
Ian?

262
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,300
Yes.

263
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:21,001
Francis?

264
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:21,502
Nope.

265
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,035
Sir abe?

266
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,536
Yes.

267
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,036
Patrick?

268
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,570
No.

269
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:24,972
Well, there you have it--

270
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,673
Two say "will," two say "won't."

271
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:29,776
We'll be back again next week,
and next week's great debate

272
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,579
Will be about government
interference in broadcasting

273
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:37,317
And will be canceled
mysteriously.

274
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,800
Just starting on bbc 1 now,
victoria regina

275
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,670
The inspiring tale of
the simple crofter's daughter

276
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,373
Who worked her way up
to become queen of england

277
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,809
And empress of the greatest
empire television has ever seen.

278
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:06,547
On bbc 2 now,
episode three of george i

279
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,081
The new 116-part serial

280
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,884
About the famous english king
who hasn't been done yet.

281
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:14,354
On itv now, the...

282
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:20,360
...but absolutely
delightful.

283
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:24,198
But, of course,
you know, who cares?

284
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,799
Ah! 'tis my lord
of buckingham.

285
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,167
Pray welcome,
your grace.

286
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,535
Thank you,
grantley.

287
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:29,970
Ladies, may i
introduce to you

288
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,505
The man who prophesied

289
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,707
That a german monarch would
soon embroil this country

290
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,875
In continental affairs.

291
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,677
Oh, how so, my lord?

292
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,213
Madam, you will recall that,
prior to his accession

293
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,715
Our gracious sovereign george
had become involved

294
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,383
In the long-standing
northern war

295
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,385
Through his claim
to bremen and verdun.

296
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,920
These duchies
would provide

297
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,055
An outlet
to the sea

298
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,823
Of the utmost
value to hanover.

299
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,191
The treaty
of westphalia

300
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,826
Has assigned
them to sweden.

301
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,827
In 1648.

302
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:55,062
Exactly.

303
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,030
Meanwhile,
frederick william of denmark

304
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,399
Taking advantage of
the absence of charles xii

305
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,201
Seized them-- 1712.

306
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,269
Oh, yes.

307
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,337
It all falls into
place-- more wine?

308
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,638
Oh, thank you.

309
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,673
However, just prior
to his accession

310
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,242
George had made an alliance

311
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,110
With frederick william
of prussia

312
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,012
On the grounds of party feeling.

313
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,948
While frederick william had
married george's only daughter.

314
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:15,949
I remember
the wedding.

315
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,184
But chiefly,
through concern

316
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:21,288
At the concerted
action...

317
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,956
Stand and deliver!

318
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,324
Dennis moore!

319
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,425
The same.

320
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,227
And now, my lords, my ladies

321
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,762
Your lupins, please.

322
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,564
Our what?

323
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,901
Come, come, don't play games
with me, my lord of buckingham.

324
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,102
What can you mean?

325
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,471
Your life or your lupins

326
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,140
My lord.

327
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,317
In a bunch, in a bunch.

328
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,686
Thank you, my friends.

329
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:57,424
And now a good evening
to you all.

330
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,130
He seeks them here,
he seeks them there

331
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,466
He seeks those lupins
everywhere.

332
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,001
The murdering
blackguard!

333
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:09,636
He's taken
all our lupins.

334
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,972
Not quite.

335
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,473
Oh, you tricked him.

336
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:14,875
We still
have one.

337
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,477
Hooray!

338
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,684
Dennis moore, dennis moore,
riding through the night

339
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:27,354
Soon every lupin in the land
will be in his mighty hand

340
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:31,758
He steals them from the rich
and gives them to the poor

341
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,794
Mr. moore

342
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,629
Mr. moore

343
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,432
Mr. moore.

344
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,039
Try to eat some, my dear.

345
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,509
It'll give you strength.

346
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:51,411
Oh, mr. moore, mr. moore,
she's going fast.

347
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,546
Don't worry,
I've...

348
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,114
I've brought
you something.

349
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,282
Medicine, at last?

350
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,283
No.

351
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,117
Food?

352
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,751
Nope.

353
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:58,886
Blankets?

354
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,387
Clothes, wood for the fire?

355
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,356
Nope.

356
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,724
Lupins!

357
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,492
Oh, christ!

358
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,560
I thought you'd
like them.

359
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,462
I'm sick to bloody death
of them!

360
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,663
So am i!

361
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,664
She's bloody dying

362
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,232
And all you bring us
is lupins!

363
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:15,669
All we've eaten, mate, for
the last four bleeding weeks

364
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:19,106
Is lupin soup, roast lupin,
steamed lupin

365
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,974
Braised lupin
in lupin sauce

366
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,577
Lupin in the basket
with sauteed lupins

367
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,380
Lupin meringue pie,
lupin sorbet.

368
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,082
We sit on lupins,
we sleep in lupins

369
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,018
We feed the cat on lupins

370
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:35,722
We burn lupins,
we even wear the bloody things!

371
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:36,924
Looks very smart.

372
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,225
Oh, shut up!

373
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:43,764
We're sick to death
with the stench of them!

374
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,265
Look!

375
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,368
The cat's just choked
itself to death on them!

376
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,571
I don't care
if I never see another lupin

377
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:51,972
Till the day I die!

378
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,942
Why don't you go out
and steal something useful?

379
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:55,976
Like what?

380
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,178
Like gold and silver and clothes

381
00:17:58,212 --> 00:17:59,980
And wood and jewels and...

382
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,349
Hang on, I'll get
a piece of paper.

383
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:07,154
Dennis moore, dennis moore,
dum, dum, dum, the night.

384
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:11,058
Dennis moore, dennis moore,
dum, de, dum, dum, plight.

385
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:15,128
He steals dum, dum, dum
and dum, dum, dum, dum, dee

386
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:20,367
Dennis, dum, dennis, dee,
dum, dum, dum.

387
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,170
This, coupled with the presence

388
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,172
Of peter and his prussians
in mecklenburg

389
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,007
And charles and his swedes
in pomerania

390
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,910
Made george and stanhope eager
to come to terms with france.

391
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,512
Meanwhile, a breach
had now opened with...

392
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,747
Oh, no, not again!

393
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,815
Oh, come on!

394
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,149
Stand and deliver again!

395
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:40,454
Your money, your jewelry,
your... hang on...

396
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,624
Your clothes, your snuff,
your ornaments

397
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,527
Your glassware,
your pussy cats...

398
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,428
Don't say anything
about the lupin.

399
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,697
Your watches, your lace,
your spittoons...

400
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:54,101
Dennis moore, dennis moore,
riding through the woods

401
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,938
Dennis moore, dennis moore,
with a bag of things

402
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:02,042
He gives to the poor
and he takes from the rich

403
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:05,245
Dennis moore,
dennis moore...

404
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,280
Here we are.

405
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,349
Dennis moore.

406
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,355
Well, it may be the end of that

407
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:16,857
But it's certainly far
from the end of...

408
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,725
Well, in fact,
it's the beginning...

409
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,194
Well, not quite the beginning.

410
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,362
Well, certainly nearer
the beginning than the end...

411
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,698
Well, yes, damn it, it is,
to all intents and purposes

412
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,900
The beginning of this year's
ideal loon exhibition

413
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:28,535
Sponsored by the daily express.

414
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,904
Numbskulls and boobies
from all over the country

415
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:33,507
Have been arriving to go
through their strange paces

416
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,942
Before a large paying crowd.

417
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:37,010
This is the 15th
ideal loon exhibition

418
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:38,679
And we took a good look round

419
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:43,383
After it was opened
by its patron.

420
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,686
Here's kevin bruce, the
digger duffer from down under

421
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:48,088
Who's ranked 14th in the
world's silly positions league.

422
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,324
This kind of incoherent behavior

423
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,327
Is really beginning
to catch on down under.

424
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,929
There's norman kirby, from
new zealand, whose specialty

425
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,732
Is standing behind a screen
with a lady with no clothes on.

426
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,634
In real life,
norman is a gynecologist

427
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,069
But this is his lunch hour.

428
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,137
And from france

429
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:06,707
There's a superb exhibition
of rather silly behavior

430
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,142
By the friends of
the free french osteopaths.

431
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:12,713
...trois, un, deux, trois,
un, deux, trois

432
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,282
Un, deux, trois,
un, deux, trois...

433
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,851
They do this
over 400 times a day.

434
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,186
Nobody knows why.

435
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,021
But for sheer pointless behavior

436
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,956
You've got
to admire brian broomers

437
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,392
The battling british boy
who, for two weeks

438
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,829
Has been suspended
over a tin of condemned veal.

439
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,397
Always popular with the crowd

440
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,466
Is the scotsman
with nae trews exhibit

441
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,368
And this year's no exception.

442
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,571
Sponsored by natural gas
and glasgow city council

443
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,773
This exhibit is
entirely supported

444
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,642
By voluntary contributions.

445
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,377
But for a truly magnificent
waste of time

446
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,346
You've got to go no further
than the exhibit from italy--

447
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,714
Italian priests in custard

448
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,583
Discussing vital matters
of the day.

449
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,785
These lads from a seminary
near cremona

450
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,221
Have been practicing
for well over a year.

451
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,356
As always,
one of the great attractions

452
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,758
Of this 14-day exhibition

453
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,626
Is the display
of counter marching

454
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,229
Given by the massed pipes
and toilet requisites

455
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:06,166
Of the colwyn bay massed pipes
and toilet requisites club.

456
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,936
An interesting point
about these boys is

457
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:12,406
They all have one thing
in common-- hip injuries.

458
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,942
Not far away,
the crowds are flocking to see

459
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:19,580
A member of the famous
royal canadian mounted geese.

460
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:25,519
But the climax of the whole
event is the judging.

461
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,157
Mr. justice burke.

462
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,728
Well, that's the last

463
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:40,367
And let's just see
those last six once again.

464
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:50,511
And the winner is
number 41, mr. justice burke.

465
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:16,036
Attention, attention,
suspect heading due north.

466
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:20,240
Plan 13-a is now in effect.

467
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,015
Whoop!

468
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,005
Yet fear,
not like an aged florin

469
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,807
Can so disseminate men's eyes

470
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,343
That fortune, straining
at a kissing touch

471
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,145
May stop her ceaseless search

472
00:22:58,178 --> 00:23:00,714
To sport amidst
the rampant thrust of time

473
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,616
And bring
the thing undone to pass

474
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:05,285
By that with which the cock
may chance an arm.

475
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,620
Well, that's all
very well, sir

476
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,189
But this is
an off-license.

477
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,924
Uh, just a bottle
of sherry then, please.

478
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,159
Certainly, um,
amontillado?

479
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,094
Yes, I think
amontillado--

480
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:15,929
Finely grown,
well-chosen

481
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:18,198
From the cask
of pluto's hills

482
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,501
Cell'd deep within
the vinous soil of spain

483
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:23,136
Wrench'd thence from
fiery regions of the sun...

484
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,605
Yes, yes, sir,
just one bottle?

485
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:26,039
Just one bottle.

486
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,207
Just one jot.

487
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,208
Just one tittle.

488
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,209
That's the lot.

489
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,210
There we are, sir.

490
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,445
That'll be a pound, sir.

491
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:32,613
A pound, a pound

492
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:34,281
And all around abound
a pound found found

493
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:36,016
Lost lost the cost
till was't embossed...

494
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:37,184
Excuse me, sir.

495
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,286
Yes, good victualler,
nature's trencherman

496
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,454
Mine honest tapster...

497
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,322
I was just wondering,
are you a poet?

498
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:44,525
No, no, I'm... I'm a solicitor.

499
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:46,159
A solicitor... oh.

500
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:48,061
Well-versed within
the written law of man

501
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,396
Who can to those who need...

502
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,198
Oh, shut up!

503
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:52,199
I'm sorry.

504
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:54,568
I'm afraid I've caught poetry.

505
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,702
Oh, really?

506
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:56,837
Well, don't worry, sir

507
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,672
I used to suffer
from short stories.

508
00:23:58,705 --> 00:23:59,907
Really? when?

509
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,610
Oh, once upon a time.

510
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:05,479
There lived in wiltshire

511
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,314
A young chap
called dennis moore.

512
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:08,849
Now, dennis was a highwayman
by profession

513
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,017
And for
several months

514
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,818
He'd been stealing
from the rich

515
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,220
To give to the poor.

516
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:16,056
One day...

517
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,693
Here we are again.

518
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,696
Mr. jenkins?

519
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:23,697
There we are.

520
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,732
I'll be back.

521
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:27,634
Meanwhile, frederick william,
busily engaged

522
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,536
In defending against
the three great powers

523
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,671
The province of silesia...

524
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:31,805
Which he
had seized

525
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:32,940
In the war of the austrian
succession

526
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:33,941
Against
his word.

527
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,042
Yes, I remember.

528
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:38,412
Was now dependent
on pitt's subsidies.

529
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:42,449
My lords, my ladies,
on your feet, please!

530
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,551
I must ask you to do
exactly as I say

531
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:49,189
Or I shall be forced to shoot
you right between the eyes!

532
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:50,924
Well, not right between the
eyes, I mean...

533
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,226
When I say "between the eyes"

534
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,961
Obviously I don't have
to be that accurate.

535
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,430
I mean, if I hit you
in that sort of area, like that

536
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:58,098
Obviously, that's
all right for me.

537
00:24:58,131 --> 00:24:59,399
I mean, I don't
have to try

538
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:00,868
And sort of hit a point
bisecting a line

539
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:02,703
Drawn between your pupils,
or anything like that.

540
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:05,005
I mean, from my point of view,
it's perfectly satisfactory...

541
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,507
What do you want?

542
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,075
Why are you here?

543
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:09,610
Well, why are any of us here?

544
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,345
I mean, when you get down to it

545
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:13,146
It's all so meaningless,
isn't it?

546
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,882
I mean, what do any of us want?

547
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:17,050
No, no, what do you
want now?

548
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:18,385
Oh, I see, oh,
just the usual things

549
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:19,720
A little place of my own,
the right girl...

550
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:20,888
No, no, no!

551
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,423
What do you want from us?

552
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:27,794
Oh, um... your gold,
your silver, your jewelry.

553
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:29,029
You've taken
it all.

554
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:30,764
This is all
we've got left.

555
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:32,432
That's nice.

556
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,601
I'll have them.

557
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:35,802
Come on.

558
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:38,338
You'd better take the bloody
lupin, too.

559
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:39,373
Thank you very much.

560
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:43,710
I've gone through that stage.

561
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:50,050
Dennis moore, dennis moore,
etcetera, etcetera.

562
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,355
What you got for us
today, then?

563
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,857
Well, I've managed to
find you

564
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,560
Four very nice silver spoons,
mr. jenkins.

565
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:00,994
Who do you think
you are

566
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:02,729
Giving us poor
this rubbish?

567
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:04,198
Bloody silver--

568
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,699
Won't have it
in the house.

569
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:06,967
And those
candlesticks

570
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,101
You got us
last week

571
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:09,469
Were only 16-carat.

572
00:26:09,503 --> 00:26:11,638
Yeah, why don't you go out
and steal something nice

573
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:12,806
Like some venetian silver?

574
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,877
Or a velasquez
for the outside loo.

575
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,912
Oh, all right.

576
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:22,883
Dennis moore, dennis moore,
riding through the land

577
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:26,720
Dennis moore, dennis moore,
without a merry band

578
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:31,325
He steals from the poor
and gives to the rich

579
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:32,659
Stupid bitch.

580
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:34,294
What did you sing?

581
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:39,967
We sang, "he steals from
the poor and gives to the rich."

582
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,870
Wait a tic...

583
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:44,905
Blimey, this
redistribution of wealth

584
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:48,375
Is trickier than I thought.

585
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:51,512
Good evening, and welcome
to another edition of prejudice

586
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:53,981
The show that gives you
a chance to have a go

587
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:57,184
At wops, krauts, nigs, eyeties,
gippos, bubbles, froggies

588
00:26:57,217 --> 00:27:03,223
Chinks, yidds, jocks,
polacks, paddies and dagoes.

589
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:04,892
Tonight's show comes live

590
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:07,995
From the tiny village of rabid
in buckinghamshire.

591
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:11,365
And our first question tonight
is from a mrs. elizabeth scrint

592
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:14,501
Who says she is going on
a mediterranean cruise next week

593
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:17,571
And can't find anything wrong
with the syrians.

594
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,339
Well, mrs. scrint,
apart from being

595
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:21,608
Totally unprincipled,
left-wing troublemakers

596
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,343
The syrians are
also born skivers.

597
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:25,312
They're dirty, smelly
and untrustworthy

598
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:30,250
And, of course, they're friends
of the awful gippos.

599
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:31,618
Well, there you are,
mrs. scrint.

600
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,320
Hope that answers
some of your problems.

601
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:34,855
Have a nice trip.

602
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:37,925
Well, now, the result
of last week's competition

603
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,259
When we asked you

604
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:41,895
To find a derogatory term
for the belgians.

605
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:43,564
Well, the response was enormous

606
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:46,433
And we took quite a long time
sorting out the winners.

607
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:48,202
There were some
very clever entries.

608
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:49,703
A mrs. hatred,
of leicester, said

609
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:55,642
"let's not call them anything,
let's just ignore them."

610
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,145
And a mr. st. john,
of huntingdon, said

611
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:04,484
He couldn't think of anything
more derogatory than "belgians."

612
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:07,855
But in the end, we
settled on three choices.

613
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:10,224
Number three, "the sprouts"

614
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:13,360
Sent in by mrs. vicious,
of hastings.

615
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:14,862
Very nice.

616
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:16,797
Number two, "the phlegms"

617
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,834
From mrs. childmolester,
of worthing.

618
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,503
But the winner
was undoubtedly

619
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:25,539
From mrs. no-supper-for-you,
from norwood in lancashire

620
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:30,277
"miserable, fat
belgian bastards."

621
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:36,884
Very good, very good,
thank you, carol.

622
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:38,785
But, as you know,
on this program

623
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:42,556
We're not just prejudiced
against race or color.

624
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:45,359
We're also prejudiced against--
yes, you've guessed--

625
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:49,062
Stinking homosexuals!

626
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:52,599
So before the streets start
emptying in chelsea tonight

627
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:55,602
Let's go straight over to our
popular prejudiced panel game

628
00:28:55,636 --> 00:29:00,674
And invite you once again
to "shoot the poof"!

629
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:06,480
And could our first contestant
sign in, please?

630
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:13,520
Our first contestant
is a hairdresser from...

631
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:18,926
Ooh, I never did like
that kind of person.

632
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:28,435
Halt! halt!

633
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:31,471
Gentlemen, ladies, bring out
your valuables, please.

634
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:32,472
Oh, no!

635
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:34,241
Come along, sir,
come along.

636
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,411
Come along,
madam.

637
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,913
Now...

638
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,348
Is that all
you've got?

639
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:43,116
Yes.

640
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,818
Well, he's got much more
than you

641
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:46,520
So you'd better have
some of his.

642
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:47,821
He's got
a lot of these.

643
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:50,157
Oh, sorry... pick them up
in a moment.

644
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,826
There's about, oh, what, nine
down there

645
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,094
So you must
have about...

646
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,696
Oh, he's still
got lots...

647
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:56,763
You've got what?

648
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,832
You've got more
than he started with

649
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,901
So if I give you
some of those...

650
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:04,371
Uh, well, now, look,
if I give you that, uh...

651
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:05,939
Have you got a bit of jewelry?

652
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,407
Yes, if I give you that one

653
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:11,979
And you have
some of his coins...

654
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:13,614
Is that
another box?

655
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:17,818
Were you trying
to hide it?

656
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:21,688
Ooh,
that's nice!

657
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:22,856
I'll have that.

658
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,857
Right.

659
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:24,892
Now, I've got
a tiara...

660
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:25,893
You've got one,
you've got one.

661
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:27,094
You've got one
of the boxes.

662
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:28,095
You've got one.

663
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:32,032
Anyone else
got a tiara?

664
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:35,602
Take your
hat off.

665
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:37,704
Oh, honestly

666
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:38,939
It's absolutely
pointless

667
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:41,041
Trying to do this if you're
going to cheat.

668
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:45,145
It really is
awful of you.

669
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:49,683
I thought you
should have won.

670
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:52,119
I mean, judicially,
you swept the board.

671
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:54,087
All right,
he had posture

672
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:56,256
But where was he
in the summing up?

673
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,194
Oh, shut up, melford,
there's always next year.
