1
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,470
Let's bring them out!

2
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:45,007
Any old iron!

3
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,047
Any old iron!

4
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,152
Thank you.

5
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:58,421
Any old iron!

6
00:00:58,454 --> 00:00:59,989
Thank you.

7
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:03,059
Any old iron!

8
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,864
We are here today to witness
the opening of a new box

9
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:44,266
To replace the box
which used to stand

10
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,703
On the corner of ulverston road
and sandwood crescent.

11
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:49,905
Owing to a program
of road widening

12
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:52,475
Being carried out
by the borough council

13
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:55,678
The ulverston road box
was removed

14
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:58,447
Leaving the wall box
in esher road

15
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:03,285
As the only box for the people
of the ulverston road area.

16
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,421
This new box will enable

17
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:08,424
The people of
the ulverston road area

18
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:12,328
To post letters, postcards
and small packages

19
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:15,631
Without recourse
to the esher road box

20
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:19,268
Or to the box outside the
post office at turner's parade

21
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,170
Which many people used to use

22
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:23,372
But which has now
been discontinued

23
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:25,441
Owing to the opening
of this box

24
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:29,045
And also to the reorganization
of box distribution

25
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:31,113
Throughout the whole area

26
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:34,617
Which comes into force with
the opening of the new boxes

27
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,021
At the wyatt road post office
in july.

28
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:43,225
Nous sommes ici ce matin...

29
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:47,063
...pour remplacer la boite
qui autrefois etait placee

30
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:49,865
Au coin d'ulverston road
et sandwood crescent.

31
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:52,935
Parce que du projet
pour l'elargissement de la rue

32
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:55,338
Qui fait par
le borough council

33
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,873
La boite d'ulverston road
est remplacee

34
00:02:57,907 --> 00:03:00,643
Et la boite de mur
dans esher road

35
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:04,780
Est la seule boite pour
les peuples d'ulverston road.

36
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:06,248
Cette boite nouvelle

37
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:08,818
Rendra capable
les hommes d'ulverston road

38
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:12,088
De mettre dans la poste
les lettres, les carte-postales

39
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:14,357
Et des petit paquets
sans avoir besoin

40
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,425
De la boite de mur
dans esher road

41
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,462
Ou les boites de la
turner's parade bureau de poste

42
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:21,731
Qui beaucoup des hommes
ont fait usage

43
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:24,100
Mais que est
maintenant discontinuee...

44
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,202
A perfectly ordinary morning

45
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:28,704
In a perfectly ordinary
english suburb.

46
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:31,140
Life goes on
as it has done for years.

47
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:35,177
But soon this quiet pattern of
life was to change irrevocably.

48
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:39,048
...en wyatt road le juillet.

49
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:42,985
Wir sind heute morgen...

50
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:50,793
The commonplace routine
of a typical monday morning

51
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:52,995
Would never be the same again

52
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:57,199
For into this quiet little
community came... mr. neutron.

53
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,201
Mr. neutron--

54
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,904
The most dangerous and
terrifying man in the world

55
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,906
A man with
the strength of an army

56
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,142
The wisdom of
all the scholars in history

57
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:11,814
The man who had the power
to destroy the world.

58
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:15,084
No one knows what strange
and distant planet he came from

59
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:16,986
Or where he was going to.

60
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,454
Wherever he went

61
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:21,223
Terror and destruction
were sure to follow.

62
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:23,359
Mr. neutron, the man
whose incredible power

63
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:25,528
Has made him
the most feared man of all time

64
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,431
Waits for his moment to destroy
this little world utterly.

65
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:30,332
Then there's stanley,
he's our eldest.

66
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:31,701
He's a biochemist
in sutton.

67
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:33,269
He's married
to shirley.

68
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:35,905
Shirley who used to be
the hairdresser?

69
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:37,006
Yes, that's right.

70
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,441
I think she's
a lovely person.

71
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:39,875
Mind you,
my husband doesn't.

72
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,411
He thinks she's a bit, uh, thinks
she's a bit flash.

73
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:43,412
I hate her.

74
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,447
I hate her guts.

75
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,115
Of course, they come
down on most weekends

76
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:47,416
So you'll be able
to meet them then.

77
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,951
I'd love to.

78
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:51,053
Hairdressing is
very interesting.

79
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,488
Oh, yes,
and very important, too.

80
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:54,657
If you don't care for
your scalp, you get rabies.

81
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,425
Then there's kenneth,
he's our youngest.

82
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,993
Mind you,
he's a bit of a problem...

83
00:04:58,027 --> 00:04:59,929
At least my husband
thinks he is, anyway.

84
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:01,497
Nasty little
piece of work, he is.

85
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,498
I hate him.

86
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,100
Mind you, the one
we don't hear

87
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:05,568
Much about nowadays
is karen.

88
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:07,603
She married a canadian;
he's a dentist.

89
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:08,738
They live in alberta.

90
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,805
Two lovely children:

91
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,640
Gary who's three,
leslie who's six.

92
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:14,143
Leslie looks absolutely the spitting
image of karen.

93
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:15,544
Do you want
to see a photo?

94
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:16,545
Oh, yes, please.

95
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:17,613
All right.

96
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:19,482
They're a couple
of little bastards.

97
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:20,583
I hate them.

98
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,151
They got eyes
like little pigs

99
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:23,586
Just like their mother.

100
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:24,754
She's a disaster...

101
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:27,256
A really horrible-looking
person, she is.

102
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,825
I thought that one
would stay on the shelf

103
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:32,261
But along comes this
stupid dentist git.

104
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,797
He's a real creepy
little bastard, he is.

105
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,132
I hate him.

106
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:38,267
This is a nice area.

107
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,769
It's like a
bloody graveyard.

108
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:40,836
I hate it.

109
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,471
It's handy
for the shops

110
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,607
And convenient
for the west end.

111
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,876
If you like going
to the west end.

112
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,811
I think it's
a stinking dump.

113
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:52,181
Meanwhile in washington,
at the headquarters of "fear"

114
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:54,116
The federal egg
answering room

115
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,385
In reality
a front name for "feeble"

116
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,723
The free world extra-earthly bodies
location and extermination center

117
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:04,126
All was not well.

118
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,129
Good god! get me
the supreme commander

119
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:12,601
Of land, sea and air forces...
immediately!

120
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,898
Hello.

121
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:45,434
This is captain carpenter, sir,
from fear.

122
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:46,502
You mean feeble?

123
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:47,403
Yes, sir.

124
00:06:47,436 --> 00:06:48,871
What is it?

125
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:50,706
Mr. neutron is missing, sir.

126
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,176
Mr. neutron?!
oh, my god!

127
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,012
Okay, surround the entire city.

128
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:58,381
Send in four waves
of armed paratroopers

129
00:06:58,414 --> 00:07:00,716
With full ground-to-air
missile support.

130
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,019
Alert all air bases,
destroy all roads!

131
00:07:03,052 --> 00:07:05,421
We'll bomb the town flat
if we have to!

132
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:07,356
Sir, he's not in
washington, sir.

133
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,426
Okay, okay, hold everything,
hold everything!

134
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:15,097
Hold it, hold it!
lay off, lay off, lay off.

135
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:16,198
Where is he?

136
00:07:16,232 --> 00:07:17,466
We don't know, sir.

137
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,735
All we know is he
checked out of his hotel

138
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,404
and took a bus to the airport.

139
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:26,175
All right... I want a full-scale
red alert throughout the world.

140
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,545
Surround everyone
with everything we got.

141
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:31,747
Mobilize every fighting unit

142
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:34,917
And every weapon
we can lay our hands on!

143
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,188
I want... I want three
full-scale global nuclear alerts

144
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:43,159
With every army, navy and air
force unit on eternal standby!

145
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:44,160
Right, sir!

146
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:46,195
And introduce conscription!

147
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:47,196
Yes, sir!

148
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:49,699
Right!

149
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:06,349
So the world was in
the grip of fear;

150
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:10,052
A huge and terrifying crisis
generated by one man

151
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:13,356
Easily the most dangerous man
the world has ever seen...

152
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,024
Honestly.

153
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:18,461
Though still biding his time,
he could strike at any moment.

154
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:20,096
Could he be stopped in time?

155
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,631
Got a bit of work
to do there, then.

156
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:24,867
Yes, it is a problem.

157
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,069
Mrs. ottershaw
never used to bother...

158
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,505
Then, of course, she was very old;
she was 2o6.

159
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:30,673
Well, must be going.

160
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:32,942
If you need a hand,
I'll send frank round.

161
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:36,846
He could do with
a bit of exercise.

162
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,149
Fat old bastard.

163
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:49,625
Yes.

164
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,227
Captain carpenter here, sir.

165
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,896
We've been on red alert
now for three days, sir

166
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:55,765
and still no sign
of mr. neutron.

167
00:08:55,798 --> 00:08:57,133
Have we bombed anywhere?

168
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,934
Have we shown 'em we got teeth?

169
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:01,937
Oh, yes, sir, we've bombed
a lot of places flat, sir.

170
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:05,107
Good, good, we don't want
anyone to think we're chicken.

171
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:07,076
Oh, no, they don't
think that, sir.

172
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:09,111
Everyone's really
scared of us, sir.

173
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:10,112
Of us?

174
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,047
Yes, sir!

175
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,848
Of our... power?

176
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:15,017
Oh, yes, sir!
they're really scared

177
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:17,586
when they see
those big planes come over.

178
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,988
Wow! I bet they are.

179
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:21,057
I bet they are.

180
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,725
I bet they're really scared.

181
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:24,527
Oh, they are, sir.

182
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,196
Do we have any figures
on how scared they are?

183
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:31,100
Uh, no... no figures, sir,
but they sure were scared.

184
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,636
Ah! but it's not working?

185
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:34,637
No, sir.

186
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,806
Okay, we'll try another tactic.

187
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,542
We'll try and outsmart
this neutron guy.

188
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:42,378
Yeah, there's one man I know
who could nail him.

189
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,947
One guy?! that won't frighten
anyone, sir.

190
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,916
He's the most brilliant man
I ever met.

191
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:48,517
We were in the c.i.a. together.

192
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:49,885
He's retired now.

193
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,721
He breeds rabbits
up in the yukon.

194
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:52,955
What's his name, sir?

195
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:54,824
His name is teddy salad.

196
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:56,125
"salad" as in...

197
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:58,694
Lettuces, cucumber, radishes...
yeah, yeah, yeah.

198
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,296
Where do I find him, sir?

199
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,132
The yukon.

200
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,469
Oh, and carpenter...

201
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:07,737
Yes, sir?

202
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,641
Make sure you get
a decent disguise.

203
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,867
Oh, uh, hello,
my name's carpenter.

204
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,535
I'm from the
u.s. government.

205
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:41,003
Are you
from the army?

206
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:44,640
No, no, no, no... I'm, uh...
I'm from the ballet.

207
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,709
The u.s. government ballet.

208
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,077
The ballet!

209
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,679
The ballet's
coming here?

210
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:51,647
Uh... well, maybe.

211
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,816
Oh, that's great!
we love the ballet.

212
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:56,085
Last year some of us
from yellow river

213
00:10:56,118 --> 00:10:59,321
We got up a party to go and see
the ballet in montreal.

214
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,190
Look, i...
I was wondering...

215
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:03,059
Oh, we had a
marvelous time.

216
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:04,460
It was
margot fonteyn

217
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:06,062
Dancing
les sylphides.

218
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:07,496
Oh, it was
beautiful.

219
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,497
Look, do you know...

220
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:10,066
Do you know
how old she is?

221
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:10,800
Who?

222
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,801
Margot fonteyn.

223
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:12,535
No.

224
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,103
She's 2o6.

225
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:15,404
Oh...

226
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:16,539
Well, look, I hear

227
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:19,175
There's a u.s. ballet organizer
around these parts

228
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,676
By the name of teddy salad.

229
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,978
You mean the
special agent?

230
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:24,013
Well... uh...

231
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:25,214
He's an
ex-cia man;

232
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:28,851
He's not a
ballet dancer.

233
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:32,154
Oh, uh, well, I just want to
see him on some ballet business.

234
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:34,457
Oh, well, you
could try the store.

235
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,292
Oh, thank you.

236
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:41,297
Hey! could you get us
lionel blair's autograph?

237
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,500
While precious time
was being lost in canada

238
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:48,070
The seconds were ticking away
for the free world.

239
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:50,373
Already neutron,
who, you will remember

240
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:53,476
Is infinitely the most
dangerous man in the world--

241
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,212
He really is--
was gathering allies together.

242
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:59,515
Try having an omelet
for your evening meal

243
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:02,351
Perhaps with yogurt
and grapefruit.

244
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:04,020
Oh, I've tried that.

245
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:07,923
I once got down to 56 stone
but I couldn't stay like that.

246
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:10,526
I had to take potatoes
wherever I went.

247
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,497
I used to go to the cinema
with 300-weight of king edwards.

248
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:19,201
I'd eat them all
before I got out of the toilet.

249
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:21,037
I had to go on to bread.

250
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,538
What about salad?

251
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:23,639
Teddy salad?

252
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:24,974
No, no, no--

253
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,443
Salad as in lettuces,
radishes, cucumber.

254
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:28,577
You don't like it?

255
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:30,413
No, I didn't want
to eat a salad.

256
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:31,514
I wanted
to find out

257
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:32,982
About a man
called salad.

258
00:12:33,015 --> 00:12:34,250
You are the
first person

259
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:36,185
To order a salad here
for two years.

260
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:38,921
All the eskimos eat here
is fish, fish, fish!

261
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:40,189
We are not
eskimos.

262
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,390
Where's our fish?

263
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:43,025
We've finished
our fish.

264
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,260
What fish you want today, huh?

265
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:45,094
Bream.

266
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:46,362
Bream?!

267
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,664
Where do I get bream
this time of year?

268
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:50,599
You bloody choosy eskimo pests!

269
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,435
We are not eskimos.

270
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:54,804
Why don't you like
a nice plate of cannelloni?

271
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:56,572
Yech! that's not fish.

272
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:59,442
Oh, I've had my lot
of the arctic circle.

273
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:01,510
I wish I was back in oldham.

274
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:05,214
Do any of
you eskimos

275
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:08,250
Speak english?

276
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:10,419
We are not eskimos.

277
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:11,420
I am.

278
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:13,022
Haddock!

279
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:14,490
Where?
where?

280
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:18,661
Do any of you know
a man called salad?

281
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:20,129
What, salad as in...

282
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:22,264
Lettuce, cucumbers,
tomatoes-- yeah.

283
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:23,432
Like you have on your plate?

284
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:24,433
Yeah, that's right.

285
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,501
No, I'm afraid not.

286
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:26,569
Where's our fish?

287
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:28,838
What does this teddy salad do?

288
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:33,175
Oh, uh... he's a...
he's a hen teaser.

289
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:35,578
Che cosa? e la stucciacatori
di polli!

290
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:39,348
No, the only teddy salad
we know is a c.i.a. man.

291
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:43,152
Oh, uh, he might know.

292
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,421
Where will I find him?

293
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:47,023
Oh, he lives up
at kipper sound.

294
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:47,823
Thanks a lot.

295
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:50,026
Fishy fishy aye-oo!

296
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,029
Um, are you in
international spying, too?

297
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:54,930
Uh... no, no, no, no.

298
00:13:54,964 --> 00:14:00,336
I'm, uh... I'm with the, uh,
the, uh, the u.s. ballet force.

299
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:01,504
Who are you with?

300
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:02,738
Mi6.

301
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:04,607
But not a word
to the eskimos.

302
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,409
Fishy fishy aye-oo!

303
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:08,277
Here's your
bloody fish.

304
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,879
Thank you, anouk.

305
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:13,349
I'm not an eskimo!

306
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:23,793
Hey!

307
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:25,394
Hey!

308
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:27,763
Hey!

309
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,932
Hi, I'm carpenter
of the u.s. ballet.

310
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:31,567
Hey, great
to have you around.

311
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,969
The last decent ballet
we got around here

312
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:35,137
Was ballet rambert.

313
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:36,972
On thursday
they did petrouchka

314
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:39,442
Then on saturday
they did fille mal gardee.

315
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:41,477
I thought it was
a bit slow but...

316
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,879
It sure is nice to
see you, mr. salad.

317
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,348
I ain't salad.

318
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:46,349
What?

319
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:47,416
You want teddy salad?

320
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,852
Yeah.

321
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,188
I don't see anyone.

322
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,990
The one on the end,
on the right.

323
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,225
That's salad.

324
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:57,860
That's a dog.

325
00:14:57,893 --> 00:15:00,162
No, only
bits of it.

326
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:01,430
What do you mean?

327
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:02,665
Listen,
teddy salad

328
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,433
Is the most
brilliant agent

329
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:06,035
The c.i.a. ever
had, all right?

330
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:07,136
Right.

331
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:11,007
That's how he made
his name-- disguise!

332
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,408
That's incredible!

333
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:13,876
Yeah, he had
to slim down

334
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:16,212
To 11/2pounds to get
into that costume.

335
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:17,880
He cut 18 inches
off each arm

336
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:19,849
And over three feet
off each leg.

337
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:23,652
The most brilliant surgeon in
europe stuck that tail on.

338
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,354
What about the head?

339
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:27,089
All of the head
was removed

340
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,225
Apart from the eyes
and the brain

341
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:31,360
In order to fit
into the costume.

342
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:33,396
That's incredible!

343
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:34,663
Do you want
to talk to him?

344
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:35,898
Yeah, sure.

345
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,334
Let's move over to those trees
over there.

346
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,269
Anyone might
be watching.

347
00:15:40,302 --> 00:15:42,638
Mr. salad

348
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:45,374
There's a mr. carpenter
to see you.

349
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,143
What does he say?

350
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:50,680
Do you have a bone?

351
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:53,749
Here, it's all part
of the disguise.

352
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:56,786
Okay, teddy,
here's the bone.

353
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,587
All right, you've got
his trust now.

354
00:15:58,621 --> 00:16:01,724
You can talk to him.

355
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:03,492
Sir...

356
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:06,062
Sir... mr. salad

357
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,430
Sir, I've
come direct

358
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:08,464
From the commander

359
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:09,732
Of land, sea
and air forces.

360
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:13,469
There's a pretty
dangerous situation, sir.

361
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:16,972
Mr. neutron is missing.

362
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:18,774
The general says
you're the only one

363
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:21,911
Who'll know where
to find him.

364
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:23,112
What's he say?

365
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:24,947
Uh, he wants
to go walkies.

366
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,215
Walkies?

367
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:27,583
Yeah, he's right
into it today.

368
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:29,118
Do you mind taking
him for walkies?

369
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:30,720
While carpenter took

370
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:33,823
The most brilliant agent
the c.i.a. ever had for walkies

371
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:39,695
Events in the world's capitals
were moving fast.

372
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,580
The secretary of state
to see you, prime minister.

373
00:16:57,613 --> 00:16:59,181
Very well, show him in.

374
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:00,182
Prime minister.

375
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:03,719
Oh, do take a seat.

376
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:06,222
Oh!

377
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,457
We've just had the supreme
commander, u.s. forces

378
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:09,692
On the phone.

379
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:11,660
Apparently, they want
a full-scale red alert.

380
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:12,695
They what?

381
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:14,296
They want
a full-scale red alert.

382
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,699
Every troop movement...

383
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:17,700
It's all right.

384
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:18,968
Don't worry
about giuseppe.

385
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:19,969
He's english,
really.

386
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,303
I see...
well, apparently

387
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:23,372
The whole structure of world
peace is threatened...

388
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:25,274
Your anniversary, signore?

389
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:28,277
Uh... no, no, no, giuseppe,
not now.

390
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,379
You mean this
isn't the lady?

391
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:32,181
No, no.

392
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:34,617
Oh, signora, my mistake!

393
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,618
Fine, fine.

394
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:37,653
I play for you, my mistake.

395
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:42,491
My mistake,
I have made my mistake!

396
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:50,266
What a dreadful mistake
is this mistake that I make!

397
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:54,170
My mistake...

398
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,172
Giuseppe, do you mind playing
over there?

399
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:59,875
Oh, very well, signore,
but I play only for you

400
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,112
And your beautiful companion.

401
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,481
My mistake...

402
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:06,749
Well, we think
this mr. neutron

403
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:08,484
Is located somewhere
in the london area.

404
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:10,019
We must find him
and exterminate him.

405
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:11,887
The americans say
if we don't, they will.

406
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:12,788
What?!

407
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:14,590
The americans say

408
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:15,958
If we don't, they will!

409
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:17,727
If he doesn't
know what?!

410
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,464
They'll bomb
the entire london area!

411
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:22,765
We'd better get
out of here!

412
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:24,467
They won't bomb here.

413
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,801
Are you sure?

414
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:26,802
Sure.

415
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:27,803
Right.

416
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:29,138
When are they
going to start?

417
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:31,073
Well, apparently,
they haven't got neutron yet

418
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:32,274
But when they do,
they're going to...

419
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:33,409
I have made my mistake...
what?!

420
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:34,810
They're going to send
a wave of bombers!

421
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:37,246
What a
dreadful mistake...

422
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,016
Well, did he tell
you anything?

423
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,017
Oh, no, no.

424
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,018
We chased sticks

425
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:43,753
We chased
a few reindeer.

426
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,755
Oh, you been chasing
reindeer, have you?

427
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:47,089
You're a naughty boy, eh?

428
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,424
Look, we haven't
got much time.

429
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:50,159
He hasn't given me
any information yet.

430
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,861
Okay, look, tell you
what then, let's eat.

431
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,262
You give him
one of your meatballs

432
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:54,296
He'll tell you
anything, okay?

433
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,598
Okay.

434
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:58,134
Wait a minute, he's trying
to tell us something.

435
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,870
Carpenter...

436
00:19:00,903 --> 00:19:02,805
Ah... carpenter...

437
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:03,873
Yes, mr. salad?

438
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:05,074
Can you hear me?

439
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,810
Yeah, yeah...

440
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:11,347
It's just... it's so
goddamned painful in here.

441
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,115
What's the problem?

442
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:14,984
It's mr. neutron, sir...

443
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:16,385
He's gone missing.

444
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:17,953
The supreme
commander

445
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:19,855
Wants you
to take charge.

446
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:22,958
I... oh, god...

447
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:25,528
I... i...

448
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:27,430
Yes, mr. salad?

449
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:28,464
I...

450
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:32,802
I've got to go walkies again.

451
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:38,274
Still no sign of
captain carpenter, sir

452
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:39,275
or mr. neutron.

453
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:40,276
Okay.

454
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,378
We'll bomb neutron out.

455
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:46,982
Get me moscow, peking,
and shanklin, isle of wight!

456
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:48,417
And so the great powers

457
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,986
And the people of shanklin,
isle of wight

458
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,189
Drew their net
in ever-tightening circles

459
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:55,324
Around the most dangerous
threat to peace

460
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:56,992
The world has ever faced.

461
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:58,961
They bombed cairo, bangkok

462
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:01,130
Cape town,
buenos aires, harrow

463
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:04,967
Hammersmith, stepney,
wandsworth and enfield

464
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:07,670
But always it was
the wrong place.

465
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:10,906
Sorry, enfield.

466
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,243
We apologize
for any inconvenience

467
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:16,445
Caused by our bombing.

468
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,948
Sorry.

469
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:21,984
But what of mr. neutron--

470
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:25,254
The most fearfully
dangerous man in the world

471
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:28,491
The man who could destroy
entire galaxies with his wrist

472
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:30,893
The man who could tear
fruit machines apart

473
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:31,961
With his eyeballs?

474
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:33,662
He had not been idle.

475
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:35,831
In fact, he had fallen in love

476
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:39,702
With the lady
who does for mrs. entrail.

477
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:41,037
Oh, hello, mr. n.

478
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,572
Terrible about enfield,
isn't it?

479
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:45,341
It's all gone;
so is staines.

480
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,009
Lovely shops they used
to have in staines

481
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:49,145
And stanmore, where
the a.a. offices used to be.

482
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:51,847
I don't know where we'll pay
our a.a. subscriptions to now.

483
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,115
Do you know
where we'll pay

484
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,917
Our a.a. subscriptions
to now, mr. n?

485
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,921
I didn't know you were a member
of the a.a., mrs. s.c.u.m.

486
00:20:58,954 --> 00:21:02,725
Oh, yes, ever since the corsair
broke down in leytonstone.

487
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:04,427
They towed it all the way
to deauville

488
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,294
F.o.c.

489
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:06,295
Yes, you know f.o.c.--

490
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:07,229
Free of charge.

491
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:08,264
Well, my husband ken--

492
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,699
K.e.n.-- he said...

493
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:12,368
Oh, forget about your husband,
mrs. s.c.u.m.

494
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,537
Or may I call you "mrs. s.?"

495
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,539
You can call me "linda"
if you like.

496
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:19,241
No, I'd rather
call you "mrs. s."

497
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:20,743
Oh.

498
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:23,245
And you can call me "mr. n."

499
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,214
Well, that's what
I was calling you.

500
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:28,718
Mrs. s., there is something
I have to tell you.

501
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:30,119
Yes, mr. n.?

502
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:34,090
I have just won a kellogg's
corn flake competition.

503
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:36,425
Oh, mr. n., that's wonderful!

504
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:40,129
I got the ball
in exactly the right place.

505
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:42,698
The prize is funt5,000 in cash

506
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:46,102
Or as much ice cream
as you can eat.

507
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,838
funt5,000!

508
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:51,574
I was thinking of taking
the ice cream.

509
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,109
Oh, no!

510
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:54,844
It's been so hot recently.

511
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:57,446
You couldn't eat that
much ice cream, mr. n.

512
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,750
Mrs. s., I can eat enormous
quantities of ice cream

513
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:02,084
Without being sick.

514
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:04,020
No, no,
take the funt5,000!

515
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,888
Please take
the funt5,000!

516
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:08,157
I was thinking
if we got married...

517
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,458
Oh, yes.

518
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:13,062
We could use the funt 5,000
to buy a spoon.

519
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:14,463
Oh, we could buy
a lot more than that.

520
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:16,966
And then fill up
with ice cream.

521
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,701
Oh, forget about
the ice cream;

522
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:19,802
We need the money.

523
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:22,171
We need nothing,
for there is something

524
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:24,273
I have not told you,
mrs. s.c.u.m.

525
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:26,375
Oh, please,
call me "mrs. s."

526
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:27,977
No, I would
rather go back

527
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,147
To calling you mrs. s.c.u.m.,
mrs. s.c.u.m.

528
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,549
I am the most powerful man
in the universe.

529
00:22:33,582 --> 00:22:36,052
There is nothing
I cannot do.

530
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:37,687
Oh, mr. n.

531
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,556
I want you to be my helpmate.

532
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:45,761
As tarzan had his jane,
as napoleon had his josephine

533
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:50,032
As frankie laine had
whoever he had...

534
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:51,434
I want you to help me

535
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,703
In my plan to
dominate the world.

536
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:56,238
Oh, mr. n., that
I should be so lucky!

537
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:59,508
You're not jewish, are you?

538
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:01,777
Another time was
when I as in cairo

539
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,813
I was disguised
as a water hydrant.

540
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,981
The whole top part of my head had been
removed and...

541
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:07,016
Please, mr. salad

542
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:08,984
You must tell us
where neutron is.

543
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:12,388
And I functioned,
do you hear?

544
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:13,389
I really worked.

545
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:15,024
I could put out a fire.

546
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:16,292
Mind you,
it hurt a bit.

547
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:18,627
Please, mr. salad,
there isn't much time.

548
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:20,129
Where is neutron?

549
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:26,168
Okay, give me another meatball,
and I'll tell you.

550
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:30,106
Okay, listen
carefully.

551
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:33,075
I won't repeat this,
you understand?

552
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:34,343
Yes, yes, quick.

553
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:37,613
I know where neutron is
right now.

554
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:41,650
I know the exact address
and the exact house

555
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:42,952
And the exact road.

556
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:44,053
Okay, where is it?

557
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,955
He's not in america.

558
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:47,823
No?

559
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:50,092
He's not in asia.

560
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:51,861
No?

561
00:23:51,894 --> 00:23:54,030
He's not in australia.

562
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:55,331
No?

563
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:56,565
He's in...

564
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,366
Yes?

565
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,234
Europe.

566
00:23:58,267 --> 00:23:59,435
Yes?

567
00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:00,936
You want to know
where in europe?

568
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,971
Yes!

569
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:04,273
Okay, okay, I'll tell you!

570
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:06,609
He's in england, in london

571
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:08,811
At number 19...

572
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:11,681
Okay, that's the yukon,
what's left?

573
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:14,450
Only ruislip, the gobi desert,
and your office, sir.

574
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:17,119
Okay, we'll start
with my office.

575
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:23,392
Ankwat I odr inkerat,
gobi desert ulverston road box.

576
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:29,265
I will take you away from all this,
mrs. s.c.u.m.

577
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:32,435
Oh, mr. n., I'd
follow you anywhere.

578
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:34,837
We will have two weeks
in benidorm.

579
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,339
Oh, yes, yes.

580
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:37,740
And I will
make you

581
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:42,812
The most beautiful
woman in the world.

582
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:50,753
Ooh, it's beautiful.

583
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:55,891
Oh, mr. n., you have
made my heart sing.

584
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:58,294
Late in life's
pageant it may be

585
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:02,732
But you have made roses
bloom anew for me.

586
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:05,001
Life's rich harvest
is being...

587
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:07,203
Shut up, mrs. s.,
we must hurry!

588
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:08,604
Oh, i...

589
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,706
I'd better leave
a note for ken;

590
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,141
He'll be
expecting us.

591
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:14,543
Has mr. neutron
escaped in time?

592
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:16,479
Is the world utterly destroyed?

593
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:19,815
How can mr. neutron
and his child bride survive?

594
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:21,784
Will his mighty powers
be of any avail

595
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:22,985
Against the holocaust?

596
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:25,488
Stay tuned to this channel.

597
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:26,622
Hello.

598
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:28,324
Well, in fact, what happens is

599
00:25:28,357 --> 00:25:31,127
That they are saved
by mr. neutron's mighty powers

600
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,329
Just as the last bomb
falls on ruislip.

601
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:35,798
However, the earth
has been blown off its axis

602
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:39,001
And in a most dramatic and
dangerous and expensive sequence

603
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:40,536
It spins off into space.

604
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:43,472
There are appallingly expensive
scenes of devastation and horror

605
00:25:43,506 --> 00:25:45,975
And the final incredibly
expensive climax is reached

606
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:48,644
As thousands of ape monsters
in very expensive costumes

607
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,179
Descend from the sky onto these

608
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:52,715
Plug up a whole city
which had to be specially built

609
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:55,818
And fling them all into the sea
very expensively.

610
00:25:55,851 --> 00:26:01,390
And we can see those very
expensive scenes right now.

611
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:05,294
Just after the credits
have gotten through.

612
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:08,831
Incidentally, these are going
to be some of the most expensive

613
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:11,100
And lavish scenes
ever filmed by the bbc

614
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:14,937
In conjunction
with time-life, of course.

615
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,806
There are some of
the technical people

616
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,441
Who have been involved
in filming

617
00:26:18,474 --> 00:26:19,909
These very expensive scenes.

618
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:22,244
The sound...
very expensive sound

619
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:24,613
Expensive visual effects there

620
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:26,749
Expensive production assistant

621
00:26:26,782 --> 00:26:28,884
Expensive designer

622
00:26:28,918 --> 00:26:30,486
Cheap director.

623
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:35,057
Well, we're going to see those
very expensive scenes right now.

624
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:36,459
Oh, come on

625
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:42,565
You can give us another minute,
mr. cotton, please.

626
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,837
Good evening.

627
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,406
Last week we learned
how to saw a lady in half.

628
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,907
This week we're going to learn

629
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:54,910
How to saw a lady in three bits
and dispose of the body...

630
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:57,346
Whoa!

631
00:26:57,646 --> 00:26:59,949
Look, look, if you can put on
rubbish like that

632
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:01,450
And "horse of the year show"

633
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:03,953
You can afford us another
minute, mr. cotton, please.

634
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:06,322
I mean, look at this
load of old...

635
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:09,692
World domination t-shirts
are available

636
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:15,798
From the bbc, world domination
department, cardiff.
