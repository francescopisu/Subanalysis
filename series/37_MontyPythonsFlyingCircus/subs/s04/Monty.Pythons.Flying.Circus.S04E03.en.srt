1
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,984
Taking life as it comes--
sharing the good things...

2
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:56,218
And the bad things.

3
00:00:56,252 --> 00:00:59,288
Finding laughter and fun
wherever they go.

4
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:02,324
It's with these two
happy-go-lucky rogues

5
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:06,128
That our story begins.

6
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:12,668
For it is they who were
run over by alex diamond--

7
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:15,438
International crime fighter
and playboy...

8
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:17,273
Fast-moving, tough-talking

9
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:20,076
And just one of the many
hundreds of famous people

10
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:21,510
Who suffer from... lumbago

11
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:24,347
The endemic disease
about which no one knows more

12
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,283
Than this man,
dr. emile koning--

13
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:29,785
Doctor, surgeon, proctologist

14
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:32,221
And selfless fighter
against human suffering

15
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:35,725
Whose doorbell was the one above
the hero of our story tonight--

16
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:37,793
Rear admiral humphrey de vere.

17
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:41,263
Yes, this is the story of
rear admiral humphrey de vere...

18
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:43,265
Or rather, the story
of his daughter

19
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,235
For it was her courage,
foresight and understanding

20
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:49,572
That enabled us to probe
beneath the sophisticated veneer

21
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:52,441
Of the royal arsenal
women's college, bagshot

22
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:57,747
And learn the true history
of this man...

23
00:01:58,114 --> 00:01:59,849
Len hanky--

24
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:02,985
Chiropodist, voyeur, hen-teaser

25
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,287
The man of whom the chairman
of fiat once said...

26
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:10,026
Che cosa e
lo stucciacatori di polli?

27
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,694
Si.

28
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:14,630
Yes, tonight we examine
the career of gino agnelli

29
00:02:14,663 --> 00:02:16,232
The man who started from nothing

30
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,668
To build up one of
the greatest firms in europe

31
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:21,237
And whose telescope was bought
from the shop part-owned

32
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,139
By a man who, at the age
of eight, stole a penknife

33
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:28,477
From the son of this man's brother's
housekeeper's dental hygienist's uncle--

34
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:31,981
The reverend charlie "drooper"
hyper-squawk smith

35
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:34,283
The cleft-palated
r.a.f. chaplain

36
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:40,523
Who, single-handed, shot down
over 500 german chaplains.

37
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:45,428
This is the story
of the men who flew with him.

38
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:48,497
It really is.

39
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:54,837
Morning, squadron leader.

40
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,038
What-ho, squiffy.

41
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:57,206
How was it?

42
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,207
Top hole.

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,709
Bally jerry
pranged his kite

44
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:01,444
Right in the
how's-your-father.

45
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:04,613
Hairy blighter dicky-birdied,
feathered back on his sammy

46
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:05,614
Took a waspy

47
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,316
Flipped over on
his betty harper's

48
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,020
And caught his can
in the bertie.

49
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:13,923
Er... afraid I don't quite
follow you, squadron leader.

50
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:16,892
It's perfectly ordinary
banter, squiffy.

51
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:19,128
Bally jerry
pranged his kite

52
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,696
Right in the how's-your-father.

53
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,133
Hairy blighter dicky-birdied,
feathered back on his sammy

54
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,836
Took a waspy, flipped over
on his betty harper's

55
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:30,740
And caught his can
in the bertie.

56
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:33,576
No, I'm just not understanding
banter at all well today.

57
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,044
Give us it slower.

58
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:38,147
Banter's not the same
if you say it slower, squiffy.

59
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,148
Hold on, then.

60
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:40,116
Wingco!

61
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:41,017
Yes?

62
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,018
Bend an ear

63
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:43,285
To the squadron leader's banter.

64
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,120
Can do.

65
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:44,787
Jolly good.

66
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,623
Fire away.

67
00:03:49,558 --> 00:03:52,228
Bally jerry...
pranged his kite...

68
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:53,863
Right in the how's-your-father.

69
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:56,966
Hairy blighter dicky-birdied...

70
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,135
Feathered back on his sammy...

71
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:02,571
Took a waspy, flipped over
on his betty harper's

72
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:04,640
And caught his can...

73
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:07,543
In the bertie.

74
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:11,647
No, I don't understand
that banter at all.

75
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:16,485
Is something up
with my banter, chaps?

76
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,487
Bunch of monkeys
on the ceiling, sir!

77
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,522
Grab your
egg and fours

78
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:24,260
And let's get
the bacon delivered.

79
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:28,197
Do you understand that?

80
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,200
No, I didn't get a word of it.

81
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,201
Sorry, old man.

82
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:34,236
We don't understand
your banter.

83
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,205
You know...
bally ten-penny ones

84
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:37,807
Dropping
in the custard!

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,142
Um...

86
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,878
Charlie choppers
chucking a handful.

87
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:43,913
No, no,
sorry.

88
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:45,781
Say it a bit
slower, old chap.

89
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:47,717
Slower
banter, sir?

90
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,818
Ra-ther!

91
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:50,653
Um...

92
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:53,356
Sausage squad
up the blue end!

93
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,025
No, still don't get it.

94
00:04:56,058 --> 00:05:01,497
Um... cabbage crates
coming over the briny?

95
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:05,634
No, no, no.

96
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:08,137
But by then it was too late.

97
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,906
The first cabbage crates
hit london on july 7.

98
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,708
That was just the beginning.

99
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:14,643
Five shillings a dozen?

100
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:17,480
That's ordinary cabbages, is it?

101
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:20,216
And what about the bombs?

102
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:22,184
Good lord, they are expensive!

103
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:23,619
Sir!

104
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:24,854
Yes, what is it?

105
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,689
News from the
western front, sir!

106
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:27,757
Yes?

107
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,659
Big enemy attack
at dawn, sir.

108
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:31,827
Yes?

109
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:34,430
Well...

110
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:38,334
The enemy were all wearing
little silver halos, sir.

111
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,037
And they had fairy wands
with big stars on the end

112
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,238
And... and...

113
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,205
And what?

114
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,473
And they had spiders

115
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:46,876
In matchboxes, sir.

116
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,877
Good god!

117
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,178
How did our chaps react?

118
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:51,280
Well, they were
jolly interested, sir.

119
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:52,948
Some of them-- I think it was

120
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:54,784
The fourth
armored brigade, sir--

121
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:55,818
They... they...

122
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,119
Yes?

123
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:59,388
Well, they went and had a look

124
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:00,656
At the spiders, sir.

125
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,657
Oh, my god.

126
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:03,025
Well, thank you,
shirley.

127
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:05,394
Sir!

128
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:07,530
Get me the prime minister.

129
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:08,664
Sir!

130
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:09,665
Not that quickly!

131
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,034
Sir!

132
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:14,403
Gentlemen,
it's now quite apparent

133
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:17,473
That the enemy are not only
fighting this war on the cheap

134
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,642
But they're also not
taking it seriously.

135
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,243
Bastards!

136
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:23,813
First they drop cabbages
instead of decent bombs...

137
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:25,648
Crates were probably
quite expensive, sir.

138
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:27,450
Quiet, critic!

139
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,418
And now they're doing
very silly things

140
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:31,587
In one of the most vital areas
of the war.

141
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,589
What are we going
to do, shirley?

142
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:36,459
Well, we've got to act fast
before it saps morale.

143
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:38,561
We're going to show
these chinese...

144
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:39,562
Germans.

145
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:40,696
These germans.

146
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,531
We're going to show them

147
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:46,469
That no british soldier
will descend to their level.

148
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:49,038
Anyone found
trivializing this war

149
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:55,878
Will face the supreme penalty
that military law can provide.

150
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,115
That was all right, I think.

151
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:00,683
Seemed to go
quite well.

152
00:07:00,716 --> 00:07:03,586
Sapper walters, you stand
before this court

153
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:07,690
Accused of carrying on the war
by other than warlike means--

154
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:12,094
To wit, that you did
on april 16, 1942

155
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:14,263
Dressed up as a bag of dainties

156
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:18,067
Flick wet towels at the enemy
during an important offensive.

157
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,301
Well, sir.

158
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:19,902
Shut up!

159
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:21,070
Colonel fawcett

160
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:24,507
For the prosecution.

161
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,841
Sir, we all know...

162
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,242
Shut up.

163
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,777
I'm sorry?

164
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,944
Carry on.

165
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:31,047
Sir, we all know
the facts of the case--

166
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,515
That sapper walters

167
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:34,850
Being in possession of
expensive military equipment--

168
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:37,353
To wit, one
lee enfield .303 rifle

169
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:39,388
And 72 rounds
of ammunition

170
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:43,125
Valued at funt140,
three shillings and sixpence--

171
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,361
Chose instead to use wet towels

172
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:49,432
To take an enemy command post
in the area of basingstoke.

173
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:50,900
Basingstoke?

174
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,168
Basingstoke in hampshire?

175
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,703
No, no, no, sir, no.

176
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:54,804
Oh, I see-- carry on.

177
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:55,871
The result of his action

178
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:57,206
Was that the enemy received...

179
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,075
Basingstoke where?

180
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:02,311
Basingstoke in westphalia, sir.

181
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:04,313
Oh, I see-- carry on.

182
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,148
The result
of sapper walters's action

183
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:09,218
Was that the enemy received
wet patches upon their trousers

184
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:10,553
And in some cases

185
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:12,955
Small red strawberry marks
upon their thighs.

186
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:16,926
I didn't know there was
a basingstoke in westphalia.

187
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,994
It's on the map, sir.

188
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:20,363
What map?

189
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:23,199
The map of westphalia
as used by the army, sir.

190
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:26,936
Well, I've certainly never heard
of basingstoke in westphalia.

191
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:28,304
It's a municipal borough, sir

192
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:30,172
27 miles north-northeast
of southampton.

193
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:31,407
Its chief manufactures...

194
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,942
Southampton in westphalia?

195
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:34,143
Yes, sir.

196
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,311
Bricks, clothing.

197
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:36,645
Nearby are the remains
of basing house

198
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,147
Burned down by cromwell's
cavalry in 1645...

199
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,649
And who...
who compiled this map?

200
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,451
Cole porter, sir.

201
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:44,153
Cole porter--

202
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:45,721
Who wrote kiss me, kate?

203
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:47,123
No, alas not, sir.

204
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:49,925
This was the cole porter
who wrote "anything goes," sir.

205
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,627
I shall seek to prove...

206
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,528
It's the same one!

207
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:53,662
In olden days

208
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:55,531
A glimpse of stocking...

209
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:57,166
I beg your pardon, sir?

210
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:59,702
In olden days
a glimpse of stocking

211
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:02,238
Was looked on
as something shocking

212
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:05,474
Now heaven knows
anything goes.

213
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,743
No, this one's, uh...
different, sir.

214
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:09,412
How does it go?

215
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:10,413
What, sir?

216
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:12,648
How does
your "anything goes" go?

217
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:13,816
Can I go home now?

218
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:14,984
Shut up!

219
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:16,085
Come on.

220
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:17,420
Sir, really, I think this is...

221
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:19,855
Come on, how does
your "anything goes" go?

222
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:22,925
Anything goes in

223
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,961
Anything goes out

224
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:29,331
Fish, bananas, old pajamas

225
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:32,435
Mutton, beef and trout.

226
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:34,970
Anything goes in...

227
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:36,305
No, that's not it-- carry on.

228
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:38,007
With respect, sir,
I shall seek to prove

229
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,475
That the man
before you in the dock

230
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:41,077
Being in possession
of the following:

231
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,613
One pair of army boots,
value funt3, seven and six;

232
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:48,417
One pair of serge trousers,
value funt2, three and six;

233
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,587
One pair of gaiters,
value funt68, ten shillings...

234
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,257
funt68, ten shillings
for a pair of gaiters?!

235
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,692
They were special gaiters, sir.

236
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,294
Special gaiters?

237
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:00,429
Yes, sir, they were
made in france, sir.

238
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:01,764
One beret costing
14 shillings...

239
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:03,032
What was special about them?

240
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:06,102
They were made of
a special fabric, sir.

241
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:08,637
The buckles were made of
empire silver instead of brass.

242
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:10,339
The total value of
the uniform was...

243
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:14,143
Why was the accused
wearing special gaiters?

244
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:16,812
They were a presentation pair,
sir, from the regiment.

245
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:19,015
The total value of
the uniform, therefore...

246
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:23,652
Why did they present him
with a special pair of gaiters?

247
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,955
Sir... it seems to me
totally irrelevant to the case

248
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:28,391
Whether the gaiters were
presented to him or not, sir.

249
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:31,093
I think the court will be able
to judge that for themselves.

250
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:33,963
I want to know why the regiment
presented the accused

251
00:10:33,996 --> 00:10:36,866
With a special pair of gaiters.

252
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,968
He used to do
things for them, sir.

253
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:39,969
The total value...

254
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:41,370
What things?

255
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:44,674
He used to oblige them, sir.

256
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:46,409
Oblige them?

257
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:47,843
Yes, sir.

258
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:49,245
The total value
of the uniform...

259
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:50,946
How did he oblige them?

260
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,214
What, sir?

261
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:54,383
How did he oblige them?

262
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,786
He, um...

263
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:00,289
He used to make them happy
in little ways, sir.

264
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:01,957
The total value...

265
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:03,826
Did he touch them at all?

266
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:05,127
Sir!

267
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,129
I submit that this is
totally irrelevant.

268
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:08,964
I want to know
how he made them happy.

269
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:11,267
He used to ram things
up their...!

270
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,337
All right, all right, all right.

271
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,240
You don't need
to spell it out.

272
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:20,042
What has the accused got to say?

273
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:22,011
What... me?

274
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:23,312
Yes, yes,
what have you got to say?

275
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:24,947
Well, what can I say, sir?

276
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,650
I mean, how can
I encapsulate in mere words

277
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:29,852
My scorn for
any military solution...

278
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:32,254
The futility
of modern warfare

279
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:35,624
And the hypocrisy by which
contemporary government applies

280
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:38,227
One standard to violence
within the community

281
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,229
And another
to violence perpetrated

282
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,031
By one community upon another?

283
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:45,067
Sorry, but my client
has become pretentious.

284
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:46,435
I will say
in his defense, though...

285
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:48,037
Sir, we haven't finished
the prosecution!

286
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,038
Shut up!

287
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:50,039
I'm in charge
of this court.

288
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:51,040
Stand up!

289
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:52,108
Sit down!

290
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,377
Go moo!

291
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,511
See?

292
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:58,180
Right, now, on
with the pixie hats

293
00:11:58,214 --> 00:12:02,451
And order in
the skating vicar!

294
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:03,986
And...

295
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,758
Anything goes in,
anything goes out

296
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:12,361
Fish, bananas, old pajamas

297
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:15,798
Mutton, beef and trout

298
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:20,636
Anything goes in,
anything goes out

299
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:24,774
Fish, bananas, old pajamas

300
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:28,644
Mutton, beef and trout.

301
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,199
Coming to this cinema soon...

302
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:52,568
The tender, compassionate story

303
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:57,973
Of one man's love
for another man in drag.

304
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:09,218
Thrill to the excitement of
a night emission over germany

305
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,253
When the pilot, jennifer,
has to choose

306
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,022
Between his secret love
for louis

307
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:15,624
The hot-bloodedly
bisexual navigator

308
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:17,226
And andy, the rear gunner

309
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,595
Who, though quite
assertive with girls

310
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:21,664
Tends to take
the submissive role

311
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:23,599
In his relationships with men.

312
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:26,936
And sensational mexican starlet
rosetta nixon

313
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:29,372
Plays the head of bomber command

314
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:32,742
Whose passion for sea birds
ends in tragedy.

315
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:36,379
With ginger, as the half-man,
half-woman parrot

316
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:38,280
Whose unnatural instincts

317
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:39,849
Brought forbidden love
to the aviary.

318
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:43,586
And roger as pip, the half-
parrot, half-man, half-woman

319
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:46,489
Three-quarter badger,
ex-bigamist negro preacher

320
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:48,724
For whom banjo-playing
was very difficult.

321
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,259
And he never mastered it

322
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:53,829
Although he took several courses
and went to banjo college, uh...

323
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:54,964
And everything.

324
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,132
Don't miss it!

325
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:58,067
Coming to your cinema soon.

326
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,705
Only five minutes
from this restaurant.

327
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:05,541
But now...

328
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:08,177
It's...

329
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:06,969
Bloody repeats!

330
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:13,676
Yes, repeats
or war films.

331
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,846
It really makes you want
to micturate.

332
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,614
People on
television treat

333
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:20,883
The general public
like idiots.

334
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,618
Well, we are idiots.

335
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:24,220
Oh, no we are not!

336
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:25,554
Well, I am.

337
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:27,390
How do you know
you're an idiot?

338
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:28,524
Oh, I can show you.

339
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:29,725
How?

340
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,161
Look.

341
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:35,531
Ooh!

342
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:05,327
Ooh, wee! ooh, wee!

343
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,297
You see, the public
are idiots.

344
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,267
You might as well just show them
the last five miles of the m2.

345
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,269
They'd watch it, eh?

346
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:15,471
At last, they
done been put on

347
00:16:15,504 --> 00:16:17,139
Something
interesting.

348
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:18,774
Oh, most
interesting.

349
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:20,576
Our figures show
conclusively

350
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:22,878
That these motorways are
extremely popular.

351
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:24,880
I mean, last time
we showed a repeat

352
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:26,215
Of the leicester
bypasss

353
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:31,921
Our ratings gave us 97,300,912
and itv nought.

354
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:37,026
So I do feel that we ought to
give "b" roads their own series.

355
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,028
I'm sorry, we just can't
give you a bigger budget.

356
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:40,029
Budgie?

357
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:41,030
No, he's
left.

358
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:42,331
Oh, oh.
why not?

359
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,533
We're only one slice
of the cake, you know.

360
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:46,268
Wouldn't mind
a slice of cake

361
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:48,070
Nice chocolate cake--
delicious.

362
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,705
I had a budgie once,
you know.

363
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:52,008
Lovely little budgie,
amusing little chap.

364
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,010
He used to stick
his head in a bell.

365
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:55,311
What was his name, now?

366
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:56,345
Joey,
uh...

367
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,513
Kennedy?

368
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:58,881
Xerxes?

369
00:16:58,914 --> 00:16:59,849
We could
repeat them.

370
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:00,816
Reheat them?

371
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,784
No,
repeat them.

372
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,219
You don't reheat cakes--

373
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:04,420
Not chocolate cakes.

374
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:06,756
What, repeat
the cakes?

375
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:07,923
Mr. heath!

376
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:08,924
What!

377
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,292
That was the name of
the budgie.

378
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:11,494
Good lord,
the bar's open.

379
00:17:11,527 --> 00:17:12,495
Oh! oh! oh!

380
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:14,030
Great off!

381
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:15,097
Oh, no.
no it isn't.

382
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:16,866
I was looking
at the little hand

383
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:20,036
That goes round
awfully fast.

384
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,005
Blast!
blast!

385
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,240
I've got it.

386
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:25,741
We can retitle the repeats.

387
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:26,909
What?

388
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:28,377
Give them different names?

389
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:30,413
Wouldn't that mean
retitling them?

390
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:31,580
Brilliant!

391
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:32,648
Oh, right.

392
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:34,050
All we need is
new titles

393
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,685
And they must
be damned new.

394
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:38,688
How about dad's navy?

395
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,822
Hmm, good, good.

396
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:41,824
Up your mother next door.

397
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:42,992
Even better.

398
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:44,827
Doctor at bee!

399
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,829
What?
what?

400
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:48,297
Someone's knocking
at the door.

401
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,298
Quite like it.

402
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:50,399
Bit long, though,
I think.

403
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:51,400
Far too long.

404
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:52,435
I married
lucy.

405
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:54,070
Oh, hasn't that
been done?

406
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:55,571
Oh, yes, a long
time ago.

407
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:57,573
But they'd never
remember it.

408
00:17:57,606 --> 00:17:59,375
Doctor at three.

409
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:01,010
I think someone's

410
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:02,244
Knocking
at the door.

411
00:18:02,278 --> 00:18:03,746
Well, that's
even longer.

412
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:04,780
I married
a tree.

413
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:06,349
And mother
makes tree.

414
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:09,285
Doctor
at cake.

415
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:10,553
Look, I'm not
absolutely certain

416
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,221
But, well, I do rather
get the impression

417
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:13,723
That there is someone
actually knocking

418
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:15,024
At the door
at this very moment.

419
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,859
That's ridiculous--
half the program gone.

420
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:17,860
Stop lengthening it!

421
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:20,096
I married a cake.

422
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:24,667
I married three
rabbit jelly molds.

423
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,803
Prefer "cake,"
especially chocky cake.

424
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:31,607
Open the
sodding door!

425
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:34,577
No, no. you can't say
"sodding" on television.

426
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,179
No, no.

427
00:18:38,614 --> 00:18:40,216
You're supposed
to knock.

428
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:43,085
Sorry, sir, but there's
trouble at studio five.

429
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,787
You're in security,
aren't you?

430
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,788
Yes, sir.

431
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:47,156
Well, you're
not allowed

432
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,691
To suggest
program titles.

433
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:50,493
Sir, it's the
world war series

434
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:51,560
In studio five.

435
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:54,497
They're not taking it
seriously anymore.

436
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,464
You're
not allowed

437
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:56,899
To suggest
program titles!

438
00:18:56,932 --> 00:18:59,201
Look!

439
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:01,804
Ow! mind me
war wound!

440
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:02,972
That's it!
that's the one!

441
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:03,973
Very good title!

442
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:05,174
Very good!
great.

443
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,709
Mind me war wound.
brilliant.

444
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:11,714
Fish, bananas, old pajamas,
mutton...

445
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:19,455
God! bloody world war ii series!

446
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:20,990
I hate them!

447
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:26,262
Oh, oh, it's a shame, mater--
damned predictable.

448
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:29,799
Just like bloody...

449
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:35,705
Day after day
after day after day!

450
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:38,074
Ugh!

451
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:39,809
Oh, evening star

452
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:45,348
If only we could have
a decent day tomorrow.

453
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:54,457
Oh! this weather's so wretched
and awful and filthy and...

454
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:01,230
What? what's going on?

455
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:05,334
What the hell is going...?

456
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:14,243
Now I can't even sleep!

457
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:23,285
What... what are they doing?

458
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:28,290
Huh? what was that?

459
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:29,291
What was it?

460
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:32,428
What... what's going on?

461
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:36,632
Oh... oh, I can't stand it!

462
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:50,579
All right! that does it!
that does it!

463
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:53,249
I'm going to get out...

464
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:55,084
What a lovely day!

465
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:59,522
Oh, I think I'm going to go...

466
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,009
I say.

467
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,544
Yes, daddy?

468
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,446
Croquet hoops
look damn pretty

469
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,447
This afternoon.

470
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,915
Frightfully
damn pretty.

471
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:27,183
They're
coming along

472
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:28,651
Awfully well
this year.

473
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:29,719
Yes, better than

474
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,921
Your aunt lavinia's
croquet hoops.

475
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:33,456
Oh, dreadful
tin things.

476
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:35,524
I did tell her to stick
to wood.

477
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:38,961
Yes, you can't beat wood.

478
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:41,564
Gorn...

479
00:21:42,698 --> 00:21:43,966
What's gorn, dear?

480
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:44,967
Nothing, nothing.

481
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,302
No, I just like the word.

482
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:47,536
It gives me confidence.

483
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,904
Gorn...

484
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:51,774
Gorn-- it's got a sort of
woody quality about it.

485
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:54,076
Gorn...

486
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,412
Gorn...

487
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:59,115
Much better than
newspaper or litter bin.

488
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:00,583
Frightful words.

489
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:01,951
Perfectly dreadful.

490
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,387
Newspaper...
litter bin.

491
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,655
Dreadful tinny
sort of words.

492
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:07,423
Tin, tin, tin.

493
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:08,491
Oh, dear...

494
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:10,059
Don't say "tin"
to rebecca.

495
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:11,660
You know how
it upsets her.

496
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:15,364
Oh, sorry,
old horse.

497
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:18,734
Sausage.

498
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:20,102
Sausage!

499
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:24,273
There's a good woody
sort of word, sausage.

500
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:26,175
Gorn...

501
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,510
Antelope!

502
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:28,744
Where?
on the lawn?

503
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:30,680
No, no, daddy--
just the word.

504
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:33,249
Don't want an antelope
nibbling the hoops.

505
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:34,450
No, no, an-tel-ope.

506
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:37,286
Sort of nice and woody
type of thing.

507
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,288
Don't think so,
becky, old chap.

508
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,289
No, no.

509
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:41,490
Antelope,
antelope.

510
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:43,626
Tinny sort of word.

511
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:44,827
Oh! sorry, old man.

512
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,961
Really,
mansfield.

513
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:48,030
Well, she's got
to come to terms

514
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,400
With these things.

515
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:53,402
Seemly.

516
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:56,005
Prodding.

517
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:57,773
Vacuum.

518
00:22:57,807 --> 00:22:58,774
Leap.

519
00:22:58,808 --> 00:22:59,775
Oh! hate leap.

520
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:01,177
Perfectly dreadful.

521
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,380
Sort of p.v.c. sort of word,
don't you know?

522
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:05,381
Lower-middle.

523
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:06,716
Bound.

524
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:08,317
Now you're talking.

525
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:09,652
Bound.

526
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:10,853
Vole.

527
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:12,722
Recidivist.

528
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:15,558
Bit tinny.

529
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,260
Oh, sorry,
becky old beast.

530
00:23:18,294 --> 00:23:19,362
Oh, dear, I suppose

531
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:23,299
She'll be gorn
for a few days now.

532
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:24,667
Caribou!

533
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,668
Splendid word!

534
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:27,670
No, dear--
nibbling the hoops.

535
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:29,939
Oh!

536
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:34,643
Caribou gorn.

537
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:40,249
Intercourse.

538
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:41,584
Later, dear.

539
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:43,185
No, no.

540
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:46,455
The word "intercourse,"
good and woody.

541
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:48,791
Intercourse...

542
00:23:48,824 --> 00:23:51,694
Pert...
pert thighs.

543
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:54,296
Body, body, body.

544
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,700
Erogenous zone...

545
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,102
Oh, concubine!

546
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:03,139
Erogenous zone...

547
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:04,507
Loose woman.

548
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,509
Erogenous zone...

549
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:08,778
Oh!

550
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:12,782
Oh, thank you, dear.

551
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:14,817
You know, it's
a funny thing, dear.

552
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,819
All the naughty words
sound woody.

553
00:24:16,852 --> 00:24:17,953
Really, dear?

554
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:19,755
How about "tit"?

555
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:20,990
Oh, dear.

556
00:24:21,023 --> 00:24:23,092
I hadn't thought about that.

557
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,093
Tit, tit.

558
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:25,861
Oh, that's very
tinny, isn't it?

559
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:26,862
Tit, tit.

560
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:29,365
Ugh! tinny, tinny.

561
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:32,134
Oh, dear.

562
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:35,538
Ocelot.

563
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:37,973
Wasp.

564
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:41,210
Yowling.

565
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,045
Oh, dear, I'm bored.

566
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,448
I'd better go and have
a bath, I suppose.

567
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:46,949
Oh, really,
must you dear?

568
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:48,351
You've had nine today.

569
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,886
All right, I'll sack
one of the servants.

570
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,921
Simkins!

571
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:53,456
Nasty tinny
sort of name.

572
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:54,924
Simkins!

573
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:59,829
I say, mater, cabbage crates
coming over the briny.

574
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:01,497
Sorry, dear,
don't understand.

575
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,065
Uh, cow catchers
creeping up

576
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:05,835
On the conning towers.

577
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:07,370
No, sorry, old sport.

578
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:10,306
Um... caribou nibbling
at the croquet hoops.

579
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:12,608
Yes, mansfield shot one
in the antlers.

580
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,477
Oh, jolly good show.

581
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,178
Is, uh, is becca about?

582
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:17,713
No, she's gorn off.

583
00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:21,350
What a super woody sort
of phrase, "gorn off."

584
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:22,885
Yes, she's gorn off

585
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:25,755
Because mansfield
said "tin" to her.

586
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:27,456
Oh, what rotten luck.

587
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,126
Oh, well, whole
afternoon to kill.

588
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,495
Better have a bath,
I suppose.

589
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:34,663
Oh, gervaise,
do sing me a song.

590
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:36,999
Oh, okay.

591
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:40,302
Something woody.

592
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:42,905
For...

593
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:45,474
She's going
to marry yum-yum!

594
00:25:45,508 --> 00:25:46,676
Oh, crikey!

595
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:49,345
The old song's
finished her off.

596
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,413
What's urp?

597
00:25:50,446 --> 00:25:52,148
Oh, I'm afraid mrs. vermin jones

598
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:53,616
Appears to have passed orn.

599
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,451
Dead, is she?

600
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:56,318
Afraid so.

601
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:59,955
What a blow for her.

602
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:01,390
What I want
to know

603
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:02,591
Mrs. elizabeth iii

604
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,694
Is why they show us
crap like this

605
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:07,329
When there's bits of the
leicester bypass

606
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:09,065
That have never
been shown.

607
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:10,066
Biskwit?

608
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:13,235
Oh! thank you.

609
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:20,376
Appearing on the m2 were...

610
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:32,054
Bloody repeats!

611
00:26:32,988 --> 00:26:36,192
Bloody repeats!

612
00:26:36,692 --> 00:26:38,627
Yes, repeats
or war films

613
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:40,796
Makes you want
to micturate.

614
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,998
Hello and welcome
to show jumping...

615
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:44,734
Oh, moto-cross!

616
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,802
Oh, good.

617
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:50,106
Just about to go into
a jump-off against the clock.

618
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,108
The slight pause is
for the stewards

619
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,043
Who are repairing
the sound of music.

620
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:57,246
Captain phillips on 'strewth
just caught one of the nuns

621
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,983
At the very start of what would
have been a fine clear round.

622
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:03,886
It's a formidable obstacle,
this sound of music--

623
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,056
Eight nuns high-- but
they're ready now and singing.

624
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:09,859
The hills are alive...

625
00:27:09,892 --> 00:27:12,161
And there's the bell.

626
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:14,397
She's got 1:07 seconds to beat

627
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,098
But she needs
a clear round to win.

628
00:27:16,132 --> 00:27:18,234
As she comes towards
the sound of music...

629
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:19,235
Quite exciting.

630
00:27:19,268 --> 00:27:20,536
Hmm.

631
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:21,804
Beautifully taken.

632
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:23,205
And now she needs
to pick up speed

633
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,540
For oklahoma,
but not too much.

634
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:28,110
This is where alan jones
knocked down poor judd...

635
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:29,245
You notice how

636
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:31,213
We never actually
see the horses jump?

637
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:33,916
She's taken it superbly,
superb show jumping.

638
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:36,786
And she's coming up to the black
and white minstrel show.

639
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:38,821
Watch this.

640
00:27:38,854 --> 00:27:41,157
Face the music and then...

641
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,858
She's taken it!

642
00:27:42,892 --> 00:27:44,226
She's over the minstrels.

643
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,729
She just flicked
leslie crowther with her tail

644
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:48,264
But the time's good.

645
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:51,067
And now she turns before
coming into the final jump.

646
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,635
This is a tough one.

647
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:55,604
It's ben hur-- 46 chariots,
6,000 spectators, 400 slaves

648
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:56,605
Lion-handlers...

649
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:57,940
I bet we don't
see this one.

650
00:27:57,973 --> 00:28:00,209
No.

651
00:28:00,676 --> 00:28:04,080
We interrupt show jumping
to bring you a news flash.

652
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:07,850
The second world war has now
entered a sentimental stage.

653
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:10,086
This morning
on the ardennes front

654
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,455
The germans started
spooning at dawn

655
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:14,824
But the british
fifth army responded

656
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:16,826
By gazing deep into their eyes

657
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:23,165
And the germans are now reported
to have gone all coy.

658
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:28,270
When does
a dream begin?

659
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:33,175
Does it start with
a goodnight kiss?

660
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:37,646
Is it conceived
or simply achieved?

661
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,584
When does
a dream begin?

662
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:46,322
When does
a dream begin?

663
00:28:46,522 --> 00:28:50,926
Is it born in
a moment of bliss?

664
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,995
Or is it begun

665
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:55,331
When two hearts
are one?

666
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:59,268
When does
a dream exist?

667
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:04,040
The vision of you
appears somehow

668
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:07,677
Impossible to resist

669
00:29:08,577 --> 00:29:12,948
But I'm not imagining
seeing you

670
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:17,219
For who could have
dreamed of this?

671
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:21,157
When does
a dream begin?

672
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,661
When reality
is dismissed?

673
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:28,230
Or does it commence

674
00:29:28,264 --> 00:29:32,335
When we lose
all pretense?

675
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:36,639
When does
a dream begin?
