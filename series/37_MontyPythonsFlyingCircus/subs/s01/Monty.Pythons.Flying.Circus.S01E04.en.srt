1
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,236
It's...

2
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:40,240
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

3
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:19,246
And did those teeth
in ancient time

4
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:24,017
Walk upon england's
mountains green...

5
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,920
Well, hello there again,
ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,891
This time we'd like to up the
tempo a little, change the mood.

7
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,761
We've got a number requested
by pip, pauline, nigel, tarquin

8
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,864
And old spotty--
tarquin's mother.

9
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,299
It's a little number
specially written

10
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,102
For the pubescence
of ex-king zog of albania

11
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,137
And it's entitled "art gallery."

12
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,639
Hope you like it.

13
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,122
Hello, marge.

14
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,657
Oh, hello, janet.

15
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,125
How are you, love?

16
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,627
Fancy seeing you.

17
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,694
How's little ralph?

18
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:08,862
Oh, don't ask me.

19
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,398
He's been nothing but
trouble all morning.

20
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,033
Stop it, ralph,
stop it!

21
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,770
Same as my kevin--
nothing but trouble.

22
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:17,838
Leave it alone.

23
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,108
He's just been in
the florentine room

24
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,543
And smeared
tomato ketchup

25
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,244
<i>All over raphael's
babyjesus.</i>

26
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,279
Oh...

27
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,314
Put that baroque
masterpiece down!

28
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,783
Well, we've just come
from the courtauld

29
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,152
And ralph smashed
every exhibit but one

30
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:35,122
In the danish contemporary
sculpture exhibition.

31
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,657
Just like my kevin.

32
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,492
Show him
an exhibition

33
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,495
Of early-18th-century
dresden pottery

34
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,130
And he goes berserk.

35
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,499
No, I said no,
and I meant no!

36
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,035
This morning
we were viewing

37
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,503
The early
flemish masters

38
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,872
Of the renaissance
and mannerists schools

39
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,807
When he gets out
his black aerosol

40
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,109
<i>And squirts vermeer's
ladyata window.</i>

41
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,545
Still, it's not as bad
as spitting, is it?

42
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,981
No, well...
kevin knows...

43
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,817
If he spits
at a painting

44
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,987
I'll never take him
to an exhibition again.

45
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,655
Ralph used to spit.

46
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:11,725
He could hit a van gogh
at 30 yards, yes...

47
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,127
But he knows now
it's wrong.

48
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,662
Don't you, ralph?

49
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,864
Ralph, stop it.

50
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,898
Stop it!

51
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,967
Stop chewing
that turner!

52
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,635
You are?!

53
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:25,205
You are a naughty, naughty,
vicious little boy!

54
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,542
Oh, look at that.

55
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,277
<i>the fighting
temeraire, ruined.</i>

56
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,445
What shall I do?

57
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:33,347
Don't do anything
with it, love.

58
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,349
Just put it in
the bin over there.

59
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,350
Really?

60
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,151
Yes, take my word
for it, marge--

61
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,855
Kevin's eaten most of the early-19th-century
british landscape artists

62
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,457
And I've learned
not to worry.

63
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,525
As a matter of fact

64
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,059
I feel a bit
peckish myself.

65
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,060
Yes...

66
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,095
I never...

67
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,164
I never used
to like turner.

68
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,300
No... I don't know
much about art

69
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,801
But I know
what I like.

70
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,802
Yes.

71
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,910
I think utrillo's brushwork
is fantastic

72
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,979
But it doesn't always
agree with me...

73
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,118
Not after a rubens, anyway.

74
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,187
All those cherries, ooh.

75
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,055
Ugh...

76
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,424
Got vermeer all down my shirt.

77
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,027
Watteau, dear?

78
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,563
What a terrible joke.

79
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,697
But it's
my only line.

80
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,831
All right,
all right

81
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,099
But you didn't have to say it.

82
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,801
You could have kept
quiet for a change.

83
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,269
That's typical--
talk, talk, talk

84
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,270
Natter, natter, natter.

85
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:36,677
Bring me my arrows of desire

86
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,382
Bring me my spear,
oh clouds unfold

87
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,820
Bring me
my chariot of fire...

88
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,755
Cut to me.

89
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,157
As officer commanding

90
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,693
The regular army's
advertising division

91
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,362
I object, in the strongest
possible terms

92
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,064
To this obvious reference

93
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,868
<i>To our own slogan "it's a dog's
life-- er... man's life--</i>

94
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,836
In the modern army."

95
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,806
And I warn this program
that any recurrence

96
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,942
Of this sloppy, longhaired
civilian plagiarism

97
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,245
Will be dealt with
most severely.

98
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:15,649
Right, now on the command "cut,"
camera will cut to camera two.

99
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,184
All right, director...

100
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,819
Wait for it.

101
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,955
Camera... cut.

102
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,424
This is my only line.

103
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,061
Well, it's my only line.

104
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,926
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

105
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,360
Wait a minute.

106
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,262
I've already warned this program

107
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:05,232
About infringing the army
copyright of our slogan:

108
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,335
<i>"it's a pig's life-- man's
life-- in the modern army"</i>

109
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:10,704
And I'm warning you,
if it happens again

110
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,941
I shall come down on this
program like a ton of bricks.

111
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:14,975
Right.

112
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,443
Carry on, sergeant major.

113
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,978
Sir!

114
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,446
Good evening,
class.

115
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,447
Good evening.

116
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,448
Where's all the others, then?

117
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,449
Not here.

118
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,383
I can see that.

119
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,085
What's the matter with them?

120
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,253
Don't know.

121
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,688
Perhaps they've got flu.

122
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:28,689
Flu?

123
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:29,857
Flu?!

124
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,326
They've eaten
too much fresh fruit.

125
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,127
Right! now, self-defense.

126
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,764
Tonight I shall be carrying on
from where I got to last week

127
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,501
When I was showing you
how to defend yourself

128
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,402
Against anyone who attacks you

129
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,505
Armed with a piece
of fresh fruit.

130
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,806
Oh... you promised

131
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,108
You wouldn't do
fruit this week.

132
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:48,709
What do you mean?

133
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,776
We've done
fresh fruit

134
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:50,911
For the last
nine weeks.

135
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:51,945
What's wrong with fruit?

136
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,146
You think you know it all, eh?

137
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,048
Can't we do something else
for a change?

138
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,518
Like someone who attacks you
with a pointed stick?

139
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,520
Pointed sticks?

140
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,988
Oh, oh, oh.

141
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,490
We want to learn how
to defend ourselves

142
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,459
Against pointed
sticks, do we?

143
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,461
Getting all high
and mighty, eh?

144
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:10,030
Fresh fruit not good
enough for you, eh?

145
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,565
Oh, well, well...

146
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,801
Well, I'll tell you
something, my lad!

147
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,870
When you're walking
home tonight

148
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,506
And some homicidal
maniac comes after you

149
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,275
With a bunch
of loganberries

150
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,809
Don't come crying to me!

151
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,745
Right... the passion fruit.

152
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,014
When your assailant
lunges at you

153
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,016
With a passion fruit thus...

154
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,751
We've done the passion fruit.

155
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,285
What?

156
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,820
We've done the
passion fruit.

157
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,256
We've done oranges, apples,
grapefruits...

158
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,357
Whole and
segments.

159
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,859
Pomegranates,
greengages.

160
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,127
Grapes,
passion fruits.

161
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,228
Lemons.

162
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:42,262
Plums.

163
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,664
Yeah, and mangoes
in syrup.

164
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:44,698
How about cherries?

165
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,832
We done them.

166
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:46,733
Red and black?

167
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,434
Yes.

168
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,371
All right, then... bananas!

169
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,540
We haven't done them, have we?

170
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,375
Right! bananas...

171
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:00,414
How to defend yourself against
a man armed with a banana.

172
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,516
Here... you, take this.

173
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,684
Now, it's
quite simple

174
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,718
To defend yourself

175
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,920
Against the banana fiend!

176
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,991
First of all, you force him
to drop the banana!

177
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:14,828
Next you eat the banana,
thus disarming him.

178
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,830
You have now
rendered him helpless.

179
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,098
Suppose he's got a bunch?

180
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,900
Shut up!

181
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,935
Supposing he's got
a pointed stick?

182
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,237
Shut up!

183
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,138
Right, now... you, mr. apricot.

184
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,139
Harrison.

185
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,140
Harrison,
mr. harrison.

186
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,709
Come at me with
that banana then.

187
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,644
Come on, attack me with it,
as hard as you like, come on.

188
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:31,678
No, no

189
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:32,846
No, no, no!

190
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,415
Put something into it,
for god's sake!

191
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,450
Hold it like that.

192
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,451
Scream.

193
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,485
Now, come on.

194
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,020
Come on, attack me.

195
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,288
Come on, come on

196
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,356
Come on.

197
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,095
Now...

198
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,700
Now I eat the banana!

199
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:54,701
He's dead.

200
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:55,736
You shot him.

201
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,004
He's completely
dead.

202
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,038
You shot him.

203
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:05,913
I have now eaten the banana!

204
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:09,249
The deceased, mr. apricot,
is now disarmed.

205
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:10,651
You shot him.

206
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,653
You shot
him dead.

207
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,454
Well, he was attacking me
with a banana.

208
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:15,622
Well, you
told him to.

209
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,191
Look, I'm only doing my job.

210
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,127
I have to show you how to defend
yourself against fresh fruit.

211
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,528
And pointed sticks.

212
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:22,596
Shut up!

213
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:23,864
Supposing someone come at you

214
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,399
With a banana,
and you haven't got a gun?

215
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,401
Run for it.

216
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,103
Well, you could stand
and scream for help.

217
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,273
Yeah, yeah, you try that with
a pineapple down your windpipe.

218
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,141
Pineapple?

219
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,142
Where, where?

220
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,144
Oh, I was just
saying "pineapple."

221
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,146
Oh, blimey, I thought
my number was on that one.

222
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,147
What, on the pineapple?

223
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,215
Where, where?

224
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,516
No, I was just repeating it.

225
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,550
Oh, oh, I see.

226
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:44,585
Right... whew!

227
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,653
That's the banana, then.

228
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,622
Next, the raspberry.

229
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,591
Harmless-looking thing,
isn't it?

230
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,226
Now, you, mr. tinned peach.

231
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,093
Thompson.

232
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,127
Mr. thompson.

233
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,596
Come at me with that
raspberry, then.

234
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,297
Come on, be as vicious
as you like with it.

235
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:57,998
No!

236
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:58,832
Why not?

237
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,067
You'll shoot me.

238
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:00,534
I won't!

239
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,035
You shot mr. harrison.

240
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,670
That was self-defense.

241
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,973
Come on, I promise
I won't shoot you.

242
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,041
You promised you'd tell us
about pointed sticks.

243
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,343
Shut up!

244
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,512
Now, brandish that...
brandish that raspberry.

245
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,880
Come on!

246
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,715
Be as vicious
as you like with it, come on.

247
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,749
No, throw the gun away.

248
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:16,383
I haven't got a gun.

249
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,584
Oh, yes, you have.

250
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:18,819
I haven't.

251
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,521
You have-- you shot mr. harrison
with it.

252
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,022
Oh... that gun.

253
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,223
Well, throw it away.

254
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,391
All right.

255
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,428
How to defend yourself
against a raspberry

256
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,097
Without a gun.

257
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,231
You were going to shoot me.

258
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:31,965
I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't.

259
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:32,933
You were.

260
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,101
I wasn't, I wasn't.

261
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,702
Come on, come on, you worm.

262
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,104
You miserable little man.

263
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,272
Come at me, then.

264
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,140
Come on, do your worst,
you worm.

265
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,381
If anyone ever attacks you
with a raspberry

266
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,116
Simply pull the lever

267
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:52,052
And a 16-ton weight will drop
on his head.

268
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,820
I learned that in malaya.

269
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,456
Suppose you haven't got
the 16-ton weight.

270
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,991
Well, that's planning, isn't it?

271
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,092
Forethought.

272
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,763
Well, how many 16-ton
weights are there?

273
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,898
Look! look, smarty-pants

274
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,035
The 16-ton weight
is just one way

275
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,204
Just one way!

276
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,306
Of killing
the raspberry killer.

277
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,274
There are millions
of others.

278
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:14,942
Like what?

279
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,476
Shoot him.

280
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,545
Well, supposing you
haven't got a gun

281
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:19,913
Or a 16-ton weight.

282
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:22,282
All right, clever dick,
all right, clever dick.

283
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,351
You two, come at me
with raspberries, then

284
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:25,819
A whole basket each.

285
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,654
Come on, come at me
with them, then.

286
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:28,755
No gun?

287
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:29,289
No!

288
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,458
No 16-ton weight?

289
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:32,659
No pointed sticks?

290
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:33,293
Shut up!

291
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,962
No rocks up
in the ceiling?

292
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:35,996
No!

293
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:36,897
You won't kill us?

294
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,831
I won't kill you.

295
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:38,599
Promise?

296
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,800
I promise I won't kill you.

297
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:40,934
Now, are you going
to attack me?

298
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,769
All right.

299
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:45,138
Right, now don't rush me
this time.

300
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,308
I'm going to turn me back
so you can stalk me, right?

301
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,810
Come up as quietly
as you can

302
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,613
Right close up behind me

303
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:54,615
Then in with the raspberries,
right?

304
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,049
Start moving!

305
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,751
Now, the first
thing to do

306
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,419
When you're
being stalked

307
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,522
By an ugly mob
with raspberries

308
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,156
Is to release
the tiger.

309
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,097
The great advantage of the tiger
in unarmed combat is

310
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,100
That it not only eats
the raspberry-laden foe

311
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,102
But also the raspberries.

312
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:17,671
The tiger, however,
does not relish the peach.

313
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:20,841
The peach assailant should be
attacked with a crocodile.

314
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,075
Right.

315
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,479
Now, the rest of you,
I know you're there

316
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,714
Lurking under the floorboards

317
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,284
With your damsons
and your prunes

318
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,053
Hiding behind the wall bars
with your quinces.

319
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,755
Well, I'm ready for you.

320
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,491
I've wired myself up
to 200 tons of gelignite

321
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,027
And if any of you so much
as tries anything

322
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,562
We'll all go up together.

323
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:42,930
I warned you!

324
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,097
I warned you, right.

325
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,299
That's it!

326
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,575
Say, have I shown you
my last operation?

327
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:59,112
Now, we've got to find
that tumor.

328
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,617
Aha!

329
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,286
Now, where does it go?

330
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,922
No, no.

331
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,462
Good day, harry.

332
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,453
And did those feet

333
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,956
In ancient times

334
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,427
Walk upon england's
mountains green...

335
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,163
Well, now we'd like to alter
the mood a little.

336
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,966
We'd like to bring you
something for mom and dad

337
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,968
Annie and roger,
mazarin and louis

338
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,970
And all at versailles.

339
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,941
It's a little number called
"england's mountains green."

340
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,475
Hope you like it.

341
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,646
And did those feet
in ancient time...

342
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:49,756
Yes, you know, it's a man's life
in england's mountains green.

343
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,225
Right, I heard that,
I heard that.

344
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,693
I'm going to stop
this sketch now.

345
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,027
And if there's
any more of this

346
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,529
I'm going to stop
the whole program.

347
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:57,764
I thought it was supposed
to be about teeth anyway.

348
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:59,633
Why don't you do something
about teeth?

349
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,634
Go on.

350
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,304
What about my rustic monologue?

351
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:06,807
I'm not sleeping
with that producer again.

352
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,144
<i>excitement... drama...</i>

353
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,580
<i>action... violence...</i>

354
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,315
<i>fresh fruit... passion...</i>

355
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,252
<i>thrills... spills...</i>

356
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,321
<i>romance... adventure...</i>

357
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,858
<i>all the things you can read
about in a book.</i>

358
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,269
Ah... oh.

359
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,304
Good morning--
I'd like to buy a book, please.

360
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,972
Well, I'm afraid
we don't have any.

361
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,408
I'm sorry?

362
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,509
We don't have any books.

363
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:43,710
We're fresh out of them.

364
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:44,545
Good morning.

365
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,279
What are all these?

366
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,747
All what?

367
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,549
All these... these...

368
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:52,152
You're referring
to these, um... books.

369
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,086
Yes.

370
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,057
They're, um...

371
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,058
They're all sold.

372
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,126
Good morning.

373
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:00,394
What, all of them?

374
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,662
Every single man jack of them.

375
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,130
Not a single one of them
in an unsold state.

376
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:04,131
Good morning.

377
00:21:04,198 --> 00:21:04,731
Who to?

378
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,133
What?

379
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,367
Who are they sold to?

380
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,237
Oh, various...

381
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,738
Good lord,
is that the time?

382
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,941
Oh, my goodness,
I must close for lunch.

383
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:15,375
It's only half past ten.

384
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:16,577
Yes, well, I feel
rather peckish.

385
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:17,678
Very peckish actually.

386
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,912
I don't suspect
I'll open again today.

387
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:20,347
I think I'll have
a really good feed.

388
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,748
I say! look at that
lovely book shop

389
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,083
Just across the road there.

390
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,751
They've got a much better
selection than we've got.

391
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,153
Probably at ridiculously
low prices.

392
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:27,754
Just across the road
there-- good morning.

393
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,423
But I was told
to come here.

394
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,759
Well...

395
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:33,760
You were.

396
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:34,895
I see.

397
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,666
I hear the gooseberries
are doing well this year.

398
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,169
And so are
the mangoes.

399
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:45,205
I'm sorry?

400
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,409
Oh, I was just saying,
thinking of the weather

401
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:52,880
I hear the gooseberries
are doing well this year.

402
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:55,315
And so are
the mangoes.

403
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,083
Mine aren't.

404
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,484
Go on.

405
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:58,886
What?

406
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,020
Go on, "mine
aren't, but..."

407
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:01,722
Aren't you going
to say something

408
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,023
About "mine aren't

409
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,092
But the big cheese gets
his at low tide tonight"?

410
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:06,126
No.

411
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:08,996
Oh... ah! good morning.

412
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,097
Wait!

413
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:11,265
Who sent you?

414
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,000
The little old lady
in the sweet shop.

415
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,102
She didn't have a dueling scar
just here and a hook?

416
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,136
No.

417
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:17,471
No, no, of course not.

418
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:19,640
I was thinking of somebody else--
good morning.

419
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:20,674
Wait a minute.

420
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,142
There's something
going on here.

421
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:23,143
What? where?

422
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,411
You didn't see
anything, did you?

423
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:26,113
No, but I think there's
something going on here.

424
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,081
No, no, well, there's
nothing going on here at all.

425
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:29,650
And he didn't see
anything-- good morning.

426
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,051
There is something
going on.

427
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:32,553
No, there is
nothing going on.

428
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,655
Please believe me,
there is absolu... u...

429
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,256
Utely nothing
going on.

430
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:37,624
Is there anything
going on?

431
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,560
No, there's nothing going on.

432
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:40,794
See? there's nothing
going on.

433
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:41,828
Who was that?

434
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:42,963
Well, that... my aunt.

435
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,831
Look, what was this book
you wanted, then?

436
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:45,966
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

437
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,334
Oh, I'd like to buy a copy

438
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,503
<i>Of an illustrated history
of false teeth.</i>

439
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:54,875
My god! you've got guts.

440
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:55,943
What?

441
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,044
Just how much
do you know?

442
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,245
What about?

443
00:22:58,312 --> 00:22:59,780
Are you from the british
dental association?

444
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:00,814
No, I'm a tobacconist.

445
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:01,849
Get away
from that door.

446
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:03,083
I'll just go
over the other...

447
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:04,251
Stay where you are.

448
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:05,752
You'll never leave
this book shop alive.

449
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:06,587
Why not?

450
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,721
You know too much

451
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:08,856
My dental friend.

452
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:09,890
I don't know anything.

453
00:23:09,923 --> 00:23:10,958
Come clean.

454
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:12,059
You're a dentist,
aren't you?

455
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,560
No, I'm a tobacconist.

456
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:15,896
A tobacconist who just happens

457
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:18,398
To be buying a book on... teeth?

458
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:19,066
Yes.

459
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,501
Ha! ha! ha!

460
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,336
Drop that gun,
stapleton!

461
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,470
Lafarge!

462
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,506
There is something
going on.

463
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:26,507
No, there isn't.

464
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,108
Okay, stapleton,
this is it.

465
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:30,244
Where's mahoney hidden
the fillings?

466
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,745
Um... what fillings?

467
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,747
You know which
fillings, stapleton.

468
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,148
Upper right,
two and four

469
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,317
Lower right, three
and lower left, one.

470
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:38,485
Come on.

471
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,087
Remember what
happened to nigel.

472
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:41,355
What happened
to nigel?

473
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,690
Orthodontic jake gave him
a gelignite mouthwash.

474
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,392
I knew there was
something going on.

475
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:46,560
But there isn't.

476
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,095
Come on, stapleton.

477
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:49,530
The fillings.

478
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:51,665
They're at
22 wimpole street.

479
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:54,535
Don't play games
with me.

480
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:56,670
Ow!

481
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:57,838
22a wimpole street.

482
00:23:57,905 --> 00:23:58,972
That's better.

483
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,874
But you'll need
an appointment.

484
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:04,044
Okay, brian, make with the
appointment, baby, no gas.

485
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,847
Ah, not so fast,
lafarge.

486
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,382
Van der berg.

487
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:09,917
Yes-- now,
drop the roscoe.

488
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:11,218
There is something
going on.

489
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,219
No, there isn't.

490
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:14,855
Nurse,
get the guns.

491
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:15,989
Who's that?

492
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:17,391
That's van der berg--
he's on our side.

493
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:20,427
All right, get up
against the wall, lafarge.

494
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:22,095
And you, too, stapleton.

495
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:23,197
Me?

496
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:24,364
Yes!

497
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:26,099
You dirty,
double-crossing rat.

498
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:26,867
What's happened?

499
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:27,768
He's two-timed me.

500
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:28,769
Bad luck.

501
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:32,739
All right, where are
the fillings?

502
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,075
Answer me.

503
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,276
Where are they?!

504
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:38,045
This is quite
exciting.

505
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,314
Not so fast.

506
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,715
Brian!

507
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:42,983
Ooh, what's that?

508
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,852
It's a bazooka!

509
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:47,788
All right, get against the wall,
van der berg

510
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,323
And you, nurse.

511
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:51,592
And the first one
to try anything

512
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,962
Moves to a practice
six feet underground.

513
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:58,232
This is an antitank gun,
and it's loaded

514
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:01,735
And you've just got
five seconds to tell me

515
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:04,371
Whatever happened to baby jane.

516
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:05,973
What?

517
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,509
Oh, I'm sorry,
my mind's wandering.

518
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:11,278
I've had a terrible day,
I really have.

519
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:14,181
You've got five seconds
to tell me...

520
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:16,450
I've forgotten.

521
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:19,353
The five seconds haven't
started yet, have they?

522
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:21,088
Only we don't know
the question.

523
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:22,456
Was it about vogler?

524
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:26,326
No, no, you've got five seconds
to tell me...

525
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,394
About nigel?

526
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:28,028
No, no.

527
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:29,429
Bronsky?

528
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:29,997
No, no.

529
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,031
The fillings?

530
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:32,966
Oh, yes, the fillings,
of course.

531
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,968
How stupid
of me.

532
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,971
All right,
you've got five seconds.

533
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:39,973
Where are the fillings?

534
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,941
Five...

535
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,010
Four...

536
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,012
Three...

537
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:46,780
Two...

538
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:48,582
One...

539
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,285
Zero.

540
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,989
Zero.

541
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,358
Oh, I've forgotten
to fire it.

542
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:00,494
Sorry, silly day.

543
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:02,029
Five, four, three

544
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:04,364
Two, one.

545
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:07,201
Drop the bazooka,
brian.

546
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:09,937
The big cheese!

547
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:14,508
I'm glad you could all come
to my little party.

548
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:17,678
And flopsy's glad, too.

549
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,214
Aren't you, flopsy?

550
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,216
Aren't you, flopsy?!

551
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,356
That'll teach you to play
hard to get.

552
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:34,228
There, poor flopsy's dead
and never called me "mother"

553
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:36,563
And soon you will all be dead.

554
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:37,931
Dead, dead.

555
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:43,003
And because I'm so evil

556
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:48,709
You will all die the slow way--
under the drill.

557
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,143
It's 1:00.

558
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,211
So it is.

559
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,579
Lunch break, everyone.

560
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:53,714
Back here at 2:00.

561
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:56,683
Hello?

562
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,652
Give me the british
dental association

563
00:26:58,685 --> 00:26:59,920
And fast.

564
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:02,656
You see, I knew
there was something going on.

565
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:05,359
Of course, the big cheese made
two mistakes.

566
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,828
First of all, he didn't
recognize me, lemming

567
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,329
Arthur lemming

568
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:12,032
Special investigator,
british dental association.

569
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,067
And second-- spit--

570
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:15,836
By the time I got back
from lunch

571
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:18,939
I had every dental surgeon
in sw-i waiting for them all

572
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:20,207
In the broom cupboard.

573
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:21,642
Funny, isn't it

574
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,845
How naughty dentists always make
that one fatal mistake?

575
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:26,013
Bye for now.

576
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,314
Keep your teeth clean.

577
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,750
Lemming, lemming

578
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:31,752
Lemming of the b.d.a.

579
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:33,754
Lemming, lemming

580
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,556
Lemming of the b.d.,
lemming of the b.d.

581
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:37,491
B.d., b.d.a.

582
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,131
Right, no, I warned you.

583
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,233
No, I warned you
about the slogan.

584
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,668
Right, that's the end.

585
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,936
Stop the program.

586
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,504
Stop it.

587
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,098
Oh, got you, my lad.

588
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:52,299
Still acting, eh?

589
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:53,467
Over you go.
