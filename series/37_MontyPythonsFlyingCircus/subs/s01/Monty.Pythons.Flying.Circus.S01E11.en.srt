1
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:07,975
It's... ah!

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,778
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,349
Have you finished
in there yet?

4
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,522
"dear sir, I object strongly

5
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,493
"to the obvious lavatorial turn
this show has already taken.

6
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:03,063
"why do we never hear about
the good things in britain

7
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,033
"like mary bignall's
wonderful jump in 1964?

8
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,601
Yours etc., ken voyeur."

9
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,311
"dear sir, I object strongly

10
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,547
"to the obvious athletic turn
this show has now taken.

11
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,150
"why can't we hear more
about the human body?

12
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:26,720
"there is nothing embarrassing
or nasty about the human body

13
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,690
Except for the intestines
and bits of the bottom."

14
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:33,293
"dear sir, I object strongly
to the letters on your program.

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,330
"they are clearly not written
by the general public

16
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,765
"and are merely included
for a cheap laugh.

17
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,501
Yours etc., william knickers."

18
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,043
That was absolutely revolting.

19
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,613
Nasty. disgusting. rubbish.

20
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,124
I, too, take strong exception

21
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,995
To this resurgence
of cheap jokes about poo-poos.

22
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:12,032
Mr. voyeur's letter stated
very... oh... um... excuse me.

23
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,075
As I was saying, the letter
previously read made quite clear

24
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,677
The view of a great majority...

25
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:47,034
1348... the black death,
typhus, cholera

26
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,337
Consumption, bubonic plague...

27
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,608
Ah, those were the days.

28
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,543
Now, I'm not... I'm...

29
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,814
Now, I'm not prepared
to go on with this

30
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,617
Unless these interruptions
cease-- all right?

31
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,651
Right.

32
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,855
The devastating effect

33
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,790
Of these...

34
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,533
No, don't follow me,
and don't zoom in on me.

35
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,767
No, I'm off, I'm off.

36
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,068
That's it, that's all.

37
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,136
I'm off.

38
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:04,511
Are you nervy, irritable,
depressed, tired of life?

39
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,246
Keep it up.

40
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,422
This house
is surrounded.

41
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,724
I'm afraid I must
not ask anyone

42
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,092
To leave the room.

43
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:22,062
No, I must ask nobody...

44
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,065
No, I must ask everybody...

45
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,967
To... I must
not ask

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,002
Anyone to leave...

47
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,507
No one must be asked
by me to leave room...

48
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:38,712
No, no one must ask
the room to leave i.

49
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:43,217
I ask the room, shall
my someone be left?

50
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,086
Not... ask
nobody the room

51
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,655
Somebody leave shall i?

52
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,291
Shall I leave the room?

53
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:55,929
Everyone must leave
the room as it is...

54
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,931
With them in it.

55
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,466
Understand?

56
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,569
You don't want anybody
to leave the room.

57
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,175
Now, alduce me
to introlow myself.

58
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,545
I'm sorry... alself me
to myduce introlow...

59
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,213
Introme to-lose mylow.

60
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,249
Alme to you introself my...

61
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,817
Excuse me a moment.

62
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,590
Allow me to introduce myself.

63
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,026
I'm afraid I must ask
that no one leave the room.

64
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,529
Allow me to introduce myself:
I'm inspector tiger.

65
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,429
Tiger?

66
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,998
Where, where?!

67
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,502
Me tiger...

68
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,738
You jane.

69
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,274
Beg your pardon.

70
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,042
Allow me to introduce myself.

71
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,978
I'm afraid I must ask
that no one leave the room.

72
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:45,612
Why not?

73
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,713
Elementary.

74
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,050
Since the body was
found in this room

75
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,852
And no one has left it

76
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:55,222
Therefore the murderer
must be somebody

77
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,890
In this room.

78
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,825
What body?!

79
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:59,860
Somebody...

80
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,795
In this room must
the murderer be.

81
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,163
The murderer
of the body

82
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,498
Is somebody
in this room

83
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,966
Which nobody
must leave.

84
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,936
Leave the body in the room
not to be left by anybody.

85
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,638
Nobody leaves anybody
or the body with somebody.

86
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,142
Anybody who is anybody shall
leave the body in the room-body.

87
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,643
Take the tablets, tiger.

88
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,413
Anybody with a body but
not <i>the</i> body is nobody.

89
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,381
Nobody leaves the body in the...

90
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,686
Albody me introbody al...

91
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,862
Now for sir gerald.

92
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,996
That's better.

93
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,831
Now, I'm inspector tiger

94
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,934
And I must ask that
nobody leave the room.

95
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,838
Now, someone has
committed a murder here

96
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,608
And that murderer is
someone in this room.

97
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,142
The question is... who?

98
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,578
Look, there hasn't
been a murder.

99
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,747
No murder?

100
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:54,681
No.

101
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,050
Oh.

102
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,218
I don't like it.

103
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,820
It's too simple

104
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,154
Too clear-cut.

105
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,222
I'd better wait.

106
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,825
No, too simple,
too clear-cut.

107
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,406
By jove

108
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,407
He was right!

109
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,975
This house is surrounded.

110
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,478
I must ask that no one
leave the room.

111
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,580
I'm chief
superintendent
lookout.

112
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:27,181
Lookout?

113
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,215
What? where?

114
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,884
Oh, me... lookout.

115
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,819
Lookout of the yard.

116
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,621
Why? what would we see?

117
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,257
Sorry?

118
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,360
Well, what will we see
if we look out of the yard?

119
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,866
I'm afraid I don't
follow that at all.

120
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,401
Aha! the body.

121
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:52,072
So, the murderer must be
somebody in this room...

122
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,108
Unless he had
very long arms...

123
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,844
Say 30 or
40 feet.

124
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,180
I think we
can discount
that one.

125
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,021
"look out of the yard"!

126
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,223
Very good.

127
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,159
Right... now we'll
reconstruct the crime.

128
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,560
I'll sit down
here.

129
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,063
Constable,
you turn off
the lights.

130
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,166
Good.

131
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,200
Now, then...

132
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,735
There was
a scream...

133
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,773
Then just before the lights
went up, there was a shot.

134
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:33,814
All right, all right.

135
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,048
The house is surrounded

136
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,250
And nobody
leave the room

137
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,484
And all
the rest of it.

138
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,019
Allow me to
introduce myself.

139
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,622
I'm assistant
chief constable
theresamanbehindyer.

140
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,090
Theresamanbehindyer?

141
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,092
Oh, you're not
going to catch me

142
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,660
With an old
one like that.

143
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,795
Right... let's
reconstruct the crime.

144
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,964
Constable, you be
inspector tiger.

145
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:51,999
Right, sir.

146
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,600
Nobody leave
the room I shall.

147
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,736
Somebody I leave nobody
in the room-body

148
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,871
Shall... take the tablets,
tiger buddy.

149
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:58,906
Alself me...

150
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,476
Very good... just
sit down there.

151
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,744
Very good, thank you.

152
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,778
Right.

153
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:05,946
Now, we'll pretend

154
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,481
The lights
have gone out.

155
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,916
Constable,
you scream.

156
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,518
Somebody shoots you.

157
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,720
And the door opens.

158
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:14,755
Nobody move.

159
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,423
I am chief constable fire.

160
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,257
Fire?

161
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,458
Where, where?

162
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,494
We're interrupting this sketch

163
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,563
But we'll be bringing you back

164
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,232
The moment anything
interesting happens.

165
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,068
Meanwhile, here are
some friends of mine.

166
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,735
"dear sir.

167
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,804
"I'm sorry this letter is late.

168
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:07,407
"it should have come at
the beginning of the program.

169
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,543
Yours, ivor bigbottie,
age two."

170
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,079
From the plastic arts,
we turn to football.

171
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,615
Last night in
the stadium of light, jarrow

172
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:18,285
We witnessed the resuscitation
of a great footballing tradition

173
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,388
When jarrow united came of age,
in a european sense

174
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,323
With an almost proustian display

175
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,325
Of modern
existentialist football

176
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,228
Virtually annihilating
by midfield moral argument

177
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:31,732
The now surely obsolescent
catennachio defensive philosophy

178
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,400
Of signor alberto fanfrino.

179
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,303
Bologna indeed were a side
intellectually out-argued

180
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,438
By a jarrow team
thrusting and bursting

181
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,340
With aggressive
kantian positivism

182
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,509
And outstanding
in this fine jarrow team

183
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,810
Was my man of the match

184
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,646
The arch-thinker,
free-scheming

185
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,182
Scarcely-ever-to-be-curbed
midfield cognoscento

186
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,716
Jimmy buzzard.

187
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,151
Good evening, brian.

188
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,954
Jimmy, at least one aging
football commentator

189
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,791
Was gladdened last night by the
sight of an english footballer

190
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,093
Breaking free
of the limpid tentacles

191
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,095
Of packed mediterranean defense.

192
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,401
Good evening, brian.

193
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,669
Were you surprised

194
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,738
At the way the italians
ceded midfield dominance

195
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,273
So early on
in the game?

196
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:18,078
Well, brian...

197
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,853
I'm opening a boutique.

198
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:31,058
This is of course symptomatic
of a new breed of footballer

199
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,228
As it is indeed symptomatic
of your whole genre of player

200
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,662
Is it not?

201
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,298
Good evening, brian.

202
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:39,766
What I'm getting at, jimmy

203
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,169
Is you seem to have
discovered a new concept

204
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,272
With the mode with which you
dissected the italian defense

205
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,473
Last night.

206
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,180
I hit the ball first time

207
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,415
And there it was
in the back of the net.

208
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,017
Do you think
jarrow will adopt

209
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,318
A more defensive posture

210
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,821
For the first leg of
the next tie in turkey?

211
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,155
I hit the ball
first time

212
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,258
And there it was in
the back of the net.

213
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,059
Yes, yes, but
have you any plans

214
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,829
For dealing with the
free-scoring turkish forwards?

215
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,400
Well, brian...

216
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,009
I'm opening a boutique.

217
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,745
And now let's take a look

218
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,814
At the state of play
in the detective sketch.

219
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,051
Ourself me
to introlow my body.

220
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:11,658
Cheeky.

221
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,861
Oh, temper, temper.

222
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,197
Well, some of us
don't like

223
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,900
Having men crawling
over us the whole time.

224
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,538
You need to take

225
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:28,108
All the opportunities
you can get, dear.

226
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,612
Unlike some people
I can mention

227
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,780
I'm quite happily
married, thank you.

228
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:42,189
Yes, athena, I've been
tearing up in the garden.

229
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,134
Hello, good evening, and welcome

230
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,670
To yet another edition
of "interesting people."

231
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:59,006
And my first interesting
person tonight is

232
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,141
The highly interesting
mr. howard stools

233
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,709
From kendal in westmoreland.

234
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,049
Good evening, mr. stools.

235
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,083
Hello, david.

236
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,085
Mr. stools, what makes you

237
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,021
Particularly interesting?

238
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,889
Well, I'm only
half an inch long.

239
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,524
Well, that's
extremely interesting.

240
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,427
Thank you for coming along on
the show tonight, mr. stools.

241
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,764
I thought you'd think that was
interesting, david, in fact...

242
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,934
Mr. howard stools from kendal in
westmoreland, half an inch long.

243
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,139
Our next guest tonight has
come all the way from egypt.

244
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,740
He's just flown
into london today.

245
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,376
He's mr. ali bayan-- he's
with us in the studio tonight

246
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:37,744
And he's stark raving mad.

247
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:47,087
Mr. ali bayan, stark raving mad.

248
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,655
Now it's time for our music spot

249
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,224
And we turn
the spotlight tonight

250
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,925
On the rachel toovey
bicycle choir...

251
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:56,263
With their fantastic arrangement
of "men of harlech"

252
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,298
For bicycle bells only.

253
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:03,337
Keep, my babe,
no ill betide thee

254
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,708
All through the night.

255
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,114
The rachel toovey bicycle choir.

256
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,148
Really interesting.

257
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,850
Remember, if you're interesting

258
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,719
And want to appear
on this program

259
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,588
Write your name and address
on your telephone number

260
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,223
And send it to this address.

261
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,866
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

262
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,568
Now here's
an interesting person.

263
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,970
Apart from being
a full-time stapling machine

264
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,840
He can also give
a cat influenza.

265
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:03,630
You can't get more interesting
than that, or can you?

266
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,632
With me now... with me now

267
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,669
Is mr. thomas walters
of west hartlepool

268
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,671
Who is totally invisible.

269
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,540
Good evening, mr. walters.

270
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:16,176
Over here, hughie.

271
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,415
Mr. walters, are you
sure you're invisible?

272
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:25,786
Oh, yes, most certainly.

273
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,288
Well, mr. walters, what's
it like being invisible?

274
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,959
Well, for a start,
at the office where I work

275
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:35,195
I can be sitting
at my desk all day

276
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:38,265
And the others
totally ignore me.

277
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,835
At home, even though
we are in the same room

278
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:45,939
My wife does not
speak to me for hours.

279
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:51,945
People pass me by in the street
without a glance in my direction

280
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,114
And I can walk

281
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,249
Into a room
without...

282
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,217
Well, whilst we've got
interesting people

283
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:58,785
We met mr. oliver
cavendish who...

284
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,855
Even now you yourself
do hardly notice me...

285
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:03,690
Mr. oliver cavendish
of leicester

286
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:07,127
Who claims to be able to recite
the entire bible in one second

287
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,563
Whilst being struck
on the head with a large ax.

288
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:10,831
Ha, ha, wow!

289
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,000
We've since discovered
that he was a fraud.

290
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,135
He did not... yes, a fraud.

291
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,237
He did not in fact recite
the entire bible.

292
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,740
He merely recited
the first two words, "in the"

293
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,708
Before his death.

294
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,579
And now it's time
for "interesting sport"

295
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:26,980
And this week
it's all-in cricket

296
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:29,082
Live from the
municipal baths, croydon.

297
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,929
All-in cricket, great, great!

298
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,031
With me now is mr. ken dove

299
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:47,401
Twice voted most
interesting man in dorking.

300
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,770
Ken, I believe you're
interested in shouting.

301
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,873
Yes, I'm interested
in shouting, all right.

302
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,509
By jove, you certainly
hit the nail on the head

303
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,145
With that particular
observation of yours then.

304
00:17:58,212 --> 00:17:59,279
What does your wife
think of this?

305
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,380
I agree with him!

306
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,982
Shut up!

307
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,451
At parties, for instance

308
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,220
People never come up to me.

309
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,524
I just sit there and
everybody totally...

310
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,893
Now, that is tiddles, I believe.

311
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,729
Um, yes, this is...
this is tiddles.

312
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,064
Yeah, and what does she do?

313
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,434
She flies across the studio
and lands in a bucket of water.

314
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,435
By herself?

315
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,270
Uh, no, I fling her.

316
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:25,272
Well, that's
extremely interesting.

317
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,909
Ladies and gentlemen,
mr. don savage and tiddles.

318
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:41,989
I'm more interesting
than a wet pussycat.

319
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:46,827
...for hour after
hour after hour...

320
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,095
Yes, great.

321
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,563
Well, now for
the first time on television

322
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,064
"interesting people" brings you

323
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:55,102
A man who claims he can send
bricks to sleep by hypnosis.

324
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,804
Mr. keith maniac
from guatemala.

325
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,039
Good evening.

326
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,808
Keith, you claim you
can send bricks to sleep.

327
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,377
Yes, that is
correct, I can.

328
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,912
Entirely by hypnosis.

329
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:07,347
Yes, I use no artificial
means whatsoever.

330
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:09,616
Oh, oh, oh!

331
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:13,220
You've in jured
mr. stools!

332
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,588
Well, I simply

333
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,857
Stare at the brick,
and it goes to sleep.

334
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:18,825
Well, we have
a brick here.

335
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:22,429
Keith, perhaps you could
send it to sleep for us.

336
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,732
Oh, uh... well, I'm afraid
that is already asleep.

337
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,068
Ha! how do you know?

338
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,237
Well, it's not moving.

339
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:31,405
Oh, I see.

340
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,539
Have we got
a moving brick?

341
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,574
Yes, we've got

342
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:34,575
A moving brick, keith.

343
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,110
It's coming over now.

344
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,116
There we are,
fast asleep.

345
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,952
Very good,
very good indeed.

346
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:45,953
Yes, it's all done

347
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,221
With the eyes.

348
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,090
Yes, mr. keith maniac
from guatemala.

349
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,626
Mr. stools!

350
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,030
Speak to me, howard!

351
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:06,240
And now four tired undertakers.

352
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:14,801
We're interrupting this

353
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,904
To take you back very quickly
to the jimmy buzzard interview

354
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,972
Where we understand something
exciting's just happened.

355
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,209
I've fallen off
my chair, brian.

356
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:22,302
Shh! I think my wife's
beginning to suspect.

357
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,570
You, shut up
up there!

358
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:24,605
What do you mean,
"shut up up there"?

359
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:25,606
You shut up.

360
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,608
Oh, shut up!

361
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:34,281
I apologize for that.

362
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:37,284
I think you'll find this
a bit more interesting.

363
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:11,251
Good evening.

364
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:14,254
Tonight I want to examine

365
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:19,960
The whole question of 18th-
century social legislation...

366
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:23,564
Its relevance

367
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,902
To the hierarchical structure
of post-renaissance society...

368
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:35,642
And its impact on the future
of parochial organization

369
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:39,479
In an expanding
agrarian economy.

370
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:45,219
But first, a bit of fun.

371
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:03,504
To put england's
social legislation

372
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,839
In a european context

373
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:08,709
Is professor gert van der whoops

374
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:11,411
Of the rijksmuseum
in the hague.

375
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:14,414
In holland in the early
part of the 15th century

376
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:17,518
There was three things important
to social legislation.

377
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:20,220
One, rise of merchant classes

378
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:23,056
Two, urbanization
of craft guilds

379
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:24,958
Three, declining moral values

380
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,561
In age of increasing
social betterment.

381
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:30,130
But first, a bit of fun.

382
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:33,267
Ding, dong, merrily on high

383
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,702
In heav'n
the bells are ringing.

384
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:41,241
Oh!

385
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:45,812
And now professor r.j. canning.

386
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:51,084
Glo-o-or...

387
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:55,222
The cat sat on the mat.

388
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:58,659
And now the battle of trafalgar.

389
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:04,565
Tonight we examine popular views
of this great battle.

390
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:07,100
Was the battle
of trafalgar fought

391
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:09,736
In the atlantic
off southern spain

392
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:14,441
Or was it fought on dry land
near cudworth in yorkshire?

393
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:16,376
Here is one man
who thinks it was

394
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,746
And here is his friend.

395
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,785
What makes you think

396
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:28,121
The battle of trafalgar
was fought near cudworth?

397
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:42,302
Because drake was too clever
for the german fleet.

398
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,039
I beg your pardon?

399
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:54,147
I've forgotten what I said now.

400
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:58,285
Mr. gumby's remarkable views
have sparked off

401
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:02,422
A wave of controversy
amongst his fellow historians.

402
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:06,960
Well, I think we should, uh...

403
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:11,732
Reappraise our concept
of the battle of trafalgar.

404
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:17,404
Well, well, I agree with
everything mr. gumby says.

405
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:23,477
Well, uh, I think, uh,
cement is more interesting

406
00:27:23,544 --> 00:27:25,479
Uh, than people think.

407
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:29,416
One subject--
four different views.

408
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:35,355
12 and six in a plain wrapper.

409
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:40,427
The stuff of history
is indeed woven in the woof.

410
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,429
Pearl harbor.

411
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:45,432
There are pages
in history's book

412
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:48,135
Which are written
on the grand scale--

413
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:53,140
Events so momentous that
they dwarf man and time alike.

414
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:56,210
And such is the battle
of pearl harbor

415
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:57,644
Reenacted for us now

416
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,848
By the women of the batley
townswomen's guild.

417
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:02,249
Mrs. rita fairbanks,
you organized

418
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:03,917
This reconstruction of
the battle of pearl harbor.

419
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:05,452
Why?

420
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,755
Uh, well, always been extremely
interested in modern drama.

421
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:12,759
We were, of course, the first
townswomen's guild to perform

422
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:16,029
"camp on blood island,"
and last year, of course

423
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:18,732
We did our extremely
popular reenactment

424
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,534
Of "nazi war atrocities."

425
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:22,069
And so, this year

426
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:25,172
We thought we'd like to do
something in a lighter vein.

427
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:27,708
So you chose
the battle of
pearl harbor?

428
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,176
Yes, that's right, we did.

429
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,178
Well, I can see
you're all
ready to go

430
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:32,846
So I'll just wish
you good luck

431
00:28:32,913 --> 00:28:34,147
In your
latest venture.

432
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,849
Thank you very much, young man.

433
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,084
Ladies and
gentlemen

434
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,586
"the world of history"
is proud to present

435
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,256
The premiere
of the batley
townswomen's guild

436
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,892
Reenactment of "the
battle of pearl harbor."

437
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:15,856
The battle of pearl harbor.

438
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:18,825
Incidentally, I'm sorry
if I got a little bit shirty

439
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:22,095
Earlier on in the program,
when I kept getting interrupted

440
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,730
By all these films and things
that kept coming in, but i...

441
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:25,666
"we shall..."

442
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:36,043
"heretofore shall this soul
be received unto..."

443
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,973
And so I said
if it happened again

444
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,675
I'd get very angry
and talk to lord hill, and...

445
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,145
Tell lord hill.

446
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,526
Whoa!
