1
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,438
And now for something
completely different.

2
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,041
It's...

3
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:21,081
Monty python's flying circus.

4
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:48,709
How to recognize
different parts of the body.

5
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,445
Number one:the foot.

6
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,382
Number two:the shoulder.

7
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:01,121
And number three:
the other foot.

8
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:06,527
Number four:
the bridge of the nose.

9
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:11,231
Number five:
the naughty bits.

10
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,870
Number six:
just above the elbow.

11
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,472
Number seven:

12
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:24,678
Two inches to the right of
a very naughty bit indeed.

13
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:28,715
Number eight:the kneecap.

14
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,721
Once a jolly swagman
camped by a billabong

15
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,089
Under the shade
of a coolibah-tree...

16
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,090
Goodday, bruce!

17
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,091
Oh, hello, bruce.

18
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,660
How are yer, bruce?

19
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,694
Bit crook, bruce.

20
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,695
Where's bruce?

21
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,796
He's not here,
bruce.

22
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,398
Blimey, s'hot
in here, bruce.

23
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,068
S'hot enough to
boil a monkey's bum.

24
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,103
That's a strange
expression, bruce.

25
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,439
Well, bruce, I heard the prime
minister use it.

26
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,641
"s'hot enough to boil a monkey's
bum in 'ere

27
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,776
Your majesty,"
he said

28
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,511
And she smiled
quietly to herself.

29
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,079
She's a good
sheila, bruce

30
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,581
And not at all
stuck-up.

31
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,417
Ah! here comes
the bossfella now.

32
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,484
How are you, bruce?

33
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,485
Hello, bruce.

34
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,486
How are you, bruce?

35
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,088
Gentlemen, I'd
like to introduce

36
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,189
A chap from
pommy land

37
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,958
Who'll be joining
us this year

38
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,926
Here in the philosophy
department

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,996
Of the university
of woolamaloo.

40
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,898
Uh, michael baldwin,
this is bruce.

41
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,566
Michael baldwin,
this is bruce.

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,668
Michael baldwin,
this is bruce.

43
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,970
Is your name not bruce, then?

44
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,371
No, it's
michael.

45
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,606
That's going
to cause

46
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,708
A little
confusion.

47
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,142
Mind if we
call you "bruce"

48
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,344
Just to keep
it clear?

49
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,445
Well, gentlemen

50
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,014
I think we'd better
start the meeting.

51
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,582
Before we
start, though

52
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,784
I'll ask the padre
for a prayer.

53
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,054
O lord, we beseech thee,
have mercy on our faculty, amen.

54
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,089
Amen.

55
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,524
Crack the
tubes, right!

56
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,392
Er, bruce, I now
call upon you

57
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,793
To welcome
mr. baldwin

58
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,629
To the philosophy
department.

59
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,963
I'd like
to welcome

60
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,633
The pommy bastard
to god's own earth

61
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,034
And I'd like
to remind him

62
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,068
That we don't like

63
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,570
Stuck-up
sticky-beaks here.

64
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,437
Hear, hear!

65
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,539
Well-spoken, bruce.

66
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,874
Now, bruce teaches
classical philosophy

67
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,876
Bruce teaches
hegelian philosophy

68
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,179
Bruce here teaches
logical positivism

69
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,415
And is also in charge
of the sheep-dip.

70
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,184
What does
new bruce teach?

71
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,386
New bruce will be teaching
political science--

72
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,087
Machiavelli, bentham,
locke, hobbes

73
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,823
Sutcliffe, bradman, lindwall, miller,
hassett and benaud.

74
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:17,758
Those are cricketers, bruce.

75
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,427
Oh, spit.

76
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,629
Howls of derisive
laughter, bruce.

77
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,365
In addition, as he's going to be
teaching politics

78
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,301
I've told him he's
welcome to teach

79
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,236
Any of the great
socialist thinkers

80
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,872
Provided he makes it clear
that they were wrong.

81
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:35,108
Australia, australia,
australia, australia

82
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,478
We love you, amen.

83
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,913
Any questions?

84
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,382
New bruce,
are you a pooftah?

85
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,951
Are you a pooftah?

86
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:44,952
No.

87
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,220
No, right.

88
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,255
Well, gentlemen,
I'll just remind you

89
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,456
Of the faculty rules.

90
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,358
Rule one:
no pooftahs.

91
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,560
Rule two: no member
of the faculty

92
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,095
Is to maltreat
the abos

93
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,430
In any way
whatsoever

94
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,332
If there's anyone watching.

95
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,666
Rule three:
no pooftahs.

96
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,869
Rule four: I don't want
to catch anyone

97
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,371
Not drinking in their room
after lights out.

98
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,973
Rule five: no pooftahs.

99
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,141
Rule six: there is no rule six.

100
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,810
Rule seven: no pooftahs.

101
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,546
That concludes the reading
of the rules.

102
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,414
Bruce?

103
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,449
This here's
the wattle--

104
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,483
The emblem
of our land.

105
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,718
You can stick it
in a bottle

106
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,386
Or you can hold it
in yer hand, amen.

107
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,154
Amen.

108
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,723
Gentlemen, at 6:00

109
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,559
I want every man-bruce of you in
the sydney harbour bridge room

110
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,262
To take a glass of sherry with
the flying philosopher, bruce

111
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,463
And I call upon you, padre

112
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,031
To close the meeting
with a prayer.

113
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,566
Oh, lord, we
beseech thee

114
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,967
Etc., etc.,
etc., amen.

115

Amen.

116
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,803
Right, let's get
some sheilas.

117
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,804
Okay.

118
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,874
Ah, elevenses!

119
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,176
This should
tide us...

120
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,178
This should tide us
over 'til lunchtime.

121
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,179
Reckon
so, bruce.

122
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,180
Sydney

123
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,147
What's that?

00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,784
Number nine:the ear.

125
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,354
Number ten:the big toe.

126
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:58,625
Number 11:more naughty bits.

127
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:03,864

Number 16:the hand.

132
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,320
Good evening.

133
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,889
I have with me
in the studio tonight

134
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,091
Mr. norman
st. john polevaulter

135
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:35,429
Who, for the past few years, has been
contradicting people.

136
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,431
Mr. polevaulter,
why do you contradict people?

137
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,198
I don't.

138
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,099
You told me you did.

139
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,935
I most certainly did not.

140
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,537
Oh, I see.

141
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,438
I'll start again.

142
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,105
No, you won't.

143
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,607
Shh!

144
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,875
Mr. polevaulter

145
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,443
I understand
you don't contradict people.

146
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,310
Yes, I do.

147
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:51,712
When didn'tyou start

148
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,113
Contradicting people?

149
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,381
Well, I did in 1952.

150
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,182
1952?

151
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:55,916
1947.

152
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:56,984
23 years ago?

153
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:57,618
No.

154
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,819
And so on

155
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,722
And so on and so on.

156
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,723
And now...

157
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,793
Number 17:the top of the head.

158
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:11,231
Number 18:the feather... rare.

159
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,904
Number 19:the nose.

160
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,238
Come in.

161
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,346
Ah, mr. luxury yacht.

162
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,681
Do sit down, please.

163
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:01,782
Ah, no, no.

164
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,650
My name is spelled
"luxury yacht"

165
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:04,785
But it's pronounced

166
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,753
"throatwobbler mangrove."

167
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,088
Ah, well, do
sit down, then

168
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,456
Mr. throatwobbler
mangrove.

169
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,490
Thank you.

170
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,259
Now, what seems
to be the trouble?

171
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,695
Um...

172
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,831
I'd like you to perform
some plastic surgery on me.

173
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,801
I see, and which particular
feature of your anatomy

174
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,236
Is causing you distress?

175
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,872
Well, well, for a long
time now, in fact

176
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,909
Even when I was a child, i...
you know, whenever I left home

177
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,378
To catch a bus
or to catch a train...

178
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,314
And even my tennis
has suffered, actually...

179
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,616
Yes, to be
absolutely blunt

180
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,019
You're worried about
your enormous hooter.

181
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:39,887
No!

182
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,754
No?

183
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,822
Yes.

184
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,123
Yes, and
you want me

185
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,224
To hack a bit off.

186
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:44,958
Please.

187
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,393
Fine.

188
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,196
It is a startler,
isn't it?

189
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,931
Uh, do you mind
if i, uh...?

190
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,399
What?

191
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,567
Oh, no, nothing, then.

192
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,305
Well, I'll just
examine your nose.

193
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,542
Mr. luxury yacht,
this, um...

194
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,944
This nose of yours
is false.

195
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,446
It's made of polystyrene.

196
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,515
And your
own hooter's a beaut.

197
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,451
No pruning necessary.

198
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,254
I'd still like
the operation.

199
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,456
Well, you've had the operation,
you strange person.

200
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,859
Please do an operation.

201
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,161
Well, all right,
all right.

202
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:25,799
But only if you'll come on a
camping holiday with me.

203
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:29,837
He asked me!
he asked me!

204
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,198
Next week, we'll be showing you

205
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:01,401
How to pick up an architect,
how to pull a prime minister

206
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,037
And how to have fun
with a wholesale poulterer.

207
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,507
But now, the men of the
derbyshire light infantry

208
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,176
Entertain us with a precision
display of bad temper.

209
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,012
Attention!

210
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,214
My goodness me!

211
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:17,150
I am in a bad temper today!

212
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:21,154
All right, two, three,
damn, damn, two, three

213
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,424
I am vexed and ratty,
two, three

214
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,728
And hopping mad.

215
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,398
And next, the men of the second
armoured division regale us

216
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,867
With their famous
close order swanning about.

217
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:37,504
Squad...
camp it up!

218
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,374
Ooh, get her! whoops!

219
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,910
I've got your number, ducky.

220
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,280
You couldn't afford me,
dear, two, three.

221
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,482
I'll scratch your eyes out.

222
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,952
Don't come the brigadier bit
with us, dear.

223
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,887
We all know
where you've been

224
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:57,424
You military fairy.

225
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,827
Whoops, don't look now, girls.

226
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:05,098
The major's just minced in
with that dolly color sergeant.

227
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:05,966
Two, three.

228
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,601
Ooh-ho!

229
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,771
And finally...

230
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:27,855
God, if they don't stop,
I'll kill myself.

231
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:31,158
I swear, I will.

232
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:35,395
All right, that's it!

233
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,498
For three days and nights

234
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,835
The displaced eyeball
plummeted earthward

235
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,505
Until...

236
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,454
Oh!

237
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,027
Oh!

238
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,537
What's this?

239
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,971
Keep low, keep down,
don't lag behind.

240
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,106
Come on, everybody,
that's right.

241
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,274
Keep close, that's right.

242
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,675
Watch out for
the killer cars.

243
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,178
Vroom!

244
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,979
Yes, the killer cars.

245
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,448
For years, the city
had been plagued

246
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:31,251
By ever-increasing
pedestrian congestion.

247
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,954
In an attempt
to eliminate this problem

248
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,023
Certain fanatical cars

249
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,225
Had taken the law
into their own hands.

250
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,295
Vroom, vroom!

251
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,298
Vroom!

252
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,967
V-v-vroom.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,703
But the days of the killer
cars were numbered

254
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:55,008
Thanks to the miracle
of atomic mutation.

255
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,451
Vroom!

256
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,954
Vroom!

257
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,124
Oh, thank you!

258
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:12,559
You've saved our city!

259
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:15,963
But at what cost?

260
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,641
Oh, thank you, thank you.

261
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,511
You've saved our city.

262
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:34,581
Of course, there were those
who chose to leave town.

263
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:39,820
This, then, is the story
of two of them.

264
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,847
Morning, sir,
can I help you?

265
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,384
Yes, we've booked on
your flight for america.

266
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,119
Oh, we don't
fly to america.

267
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,687
Oh! the american flight.

268
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,155
On the plane-- oh, yes.

269
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,690
Oh, we do that,
all right.

270
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,725
Safe as houses,
no need for panic.

271
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,827
Is it really 37 and six?

272
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,329
30 bob-- I'm robbing myself.

273
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,330
30 bob?

274
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,198
Twenty-five.

275
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,232
Two quid
the pair of you.

276
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,533
That's
without insurance.

277
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,468
Well, how much is
it with insurance?

278
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:29,670
102 quid.

279
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,138
That's including
the flight.

280
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,439
How long will it take?

281
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,475
Uh, let me put it
this way-- no idea.

282
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:36,577
Six hours.

283
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,044
Six?

284
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,278
Five-- ten for
the pair of you.

285
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:39,079
Oh, is it a jet?

286
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,147
Uh... well, no.

287
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,481
It's not so much a jet.

288
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:44,351
It's more your triumph
herald engine with wings.

289
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,086
When are you taking off?

290
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,087
3300 hours.

291
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,088
What?

292
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,489
2600 hours for
the pair of you.

293
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:50,557
What?

294
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:51,692
Have the injections,
you won't care.

295
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,860
What injections?

296
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,127
Barley sugar injections;
calm you down.

297
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,629
They're compulsory,
board of trade, promise.

298
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,498
Oh, I don't like
the sound of injections.

299
00:14:58,532 --> 00:14:59,733
Hello, yes, right.

300
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,001
You've got to make your
mind up straight away

301
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,002
If you're coming or not.

302
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,036
Yes.

303
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,404
Right, you can't
change your mind.

304
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,672
I'll ring the
departure lounge.

305
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:06,807
Hello?

306
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,711
Two more on the way,
mrs. turpin.

307
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,079
Ah.

308
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,381
Now, the duty-free
trolley is over there.

309
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,116
There's some
lovely drop scones

310
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,618
And some
duty-free broccoli

311
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,353
And there's
fresh eccles cakes.

312
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,122
You're allowed 200 each
on the plane.

313
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,424
The verrifast plane company
announce

314
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:28,295
The departure of flight one
to over the hills and far away.

315
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,297
Will passengers
for flight one

316
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,199
Please assemble
at gate one.

317
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,734
Passengers are advised

318
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,036
That there is
still plenty of time

319
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,437
To buy eccles cakes.

320
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,507
Nearly ready.

321
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,643
Will passengers please get ready

322
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:46,313
For their barley sugar
injections.

323
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,916
Today we all take vow.

324
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,151
Today we smash
the enemy fleet!

325
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:54,855
We... smash... smash!

326
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,294
That's mr. kamikaze, the pilot.

327
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,795
He's very nice, really

328
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:06,500
But make sure he stays
clear of battleships.

329
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:10,537
There have been many
stirring tales told of the sea

330
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:13,106
And also some fairly
uninteresting ones

331
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,343
Only marginally connected
with it, like this one.

332
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,713
Sorry, this isn't a very
good announcement, sorry.

333
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,248
And here is the result

334
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:24,051
Of the "where to put edward
heath's statue" competition.

335
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,919
The winner was a mr. ivy north

336
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:32,593
Who wins ten guineas and a visit
to the sailors' quarters.

337
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:43,470
That was last year's reenactment
of the battle of pearl harbor

338
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,939
Performed by the batley
townswomen's guild.

339
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:50,310
It was written, directed and
produced by mrs. rita fairbanks.

340
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,478
Hello again.

341
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,180
And what
are your ladies

342
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,715
Going to do
for us this year?

343
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,984
Well, this year
we decided to reenact

344
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,186
Something with
a more modern flavor.

345
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,587
We had considered

346
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,423
A version of michael stewart's
speech on nigeria

347
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:06,093
And there were several votes
on the committee

348
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,630
For a staging of herr willy
brandt's visit to east germany.

349
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:11,565
But we've settled instead

350
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:15,369
For a dramatization
of the first heart transplant.

351
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,172
Incidentally, my sister madge
will be playing

352
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,875
The plucky little springbok
pioneer dr. christian barnard.

353
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,177
Well, off
we go, then

354
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,046
With the batley townswomen's
guild reenactment

355
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,484
Of the first
heart transplant.

356
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,095
The first heart transplant.

357
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,098
But this is not the only
open-air production here

358
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,466
That has used the sea.

359
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,669
The theatrical managers
in this area

360
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:50,671
Have not been slow to appreciate

361
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,840
The sea's tremendous
dramatic value.

362
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,942
And somewhere out in this bay is

363
00:17:54,975 --> 00:18:01,381
The first underwater production
of measure for measure.

364
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:25,873
Servant ho!

365
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,848
Fine.

366
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:38,285
The underwater version
of measure for measure.

367
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,753
And further out to sea

368
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,724
Hello, dolly!
is also doing good business.

369
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:46,260
Hello, dolly...

370
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:52,933
And over there on the oyster
beds, formula two car racing.

371
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:03,377
Number 20:the armpits.

372
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:09,983
Number 21:the bottom two-
thirds of the nape of the neck.

373
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:14,054
Number 22:the nipple.

374
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,560
And that concludes
this week's episode

375
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:22,196
of how to recognize
different parts of the body

376
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,497
adapted for radio

377
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,367
by ann haydon-jones
and her husband, pip.

378
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:30,304
And now we present
the first episode

379
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,606
of a new radio drama series

380
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,209
The death
of mary queen of scots.

381
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:39,146
Part one, the beginning.

382
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,094
You are mary queen of scots?

383
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,530
I am.

384
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,467
Episode two of the death
of mary queen of scots

385
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,939
can be heard on radio 4
almost immediately.

386
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:56,323
I think she's dead.

387
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:59,326
No, I'm not.

388
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:12,539
That was episode 2 of the death
of mary queen of scots

389
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:16,043
adapted for the radio by bernard
hollowood and brian london.

390
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:20,480
And now, radio 4 will explode.

391
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,889
We'll have to watch
the telly, then.

392
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:31,258
Yes.

393
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:44,304
Well, what's on
the television, then?

394
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:47,574
Looks like a penguin.

395
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:48,809
No, no, no, no.

396
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:51,011
I didn't mean what's
on the television set

397
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:52,546
I meant what program!

398
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:53,714
Oh.

399
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:54,882
Ooh.

400
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:56,517
Tall and tan

401
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,652
And young and handsome

402
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:03,490
The girl from ipanema
goes walking.

403
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,862
Funny that penguin
being there, innit?

404
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,364
What's it doing there?

405
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,365
Standing.

406
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:14,601
I can see that!

407
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:21,074
If it lays an egg...

408
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:22,743
It will fall
down the back

409
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,211
Of the television set.

410
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:25,612
We'll have
to watch that.

411
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:26,713
Mmm.

412
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:27,781
Unless it's a male.

413
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,384
Ooh, I never
thought of that.

414
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:33,620
Yes, looks fairly butch.

415
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:35,923
Perhaps it comes
from next door.

416
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:38,492
Penguins don't come
from next door.

417
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,627
They come
from the antarctic!

418
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:43,130
Burma!

419
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,900
Why did you say "burma"?

420
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:47,968
I panicked.

421
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:50,237
Oh.

422
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,973
Perhaps it's
from the zoo.

423
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,107
Which zoo?

424
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:56,343
How should I know
which zoo?

425
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,712
I'm not
dr. bloody bronowski!

426
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,214
How does
dr. bronowski know

427
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:01,515
Which zoo
it came from?

428
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,716
He knows everything.

429
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,284
Oh, I wouldn't
like that.

430
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:06,753
It would take
the mystery out of life.

431
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,622
Anyway, if it
came from the zoo

432
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:10,657
It would have
"property of the zoo"

433
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:11,658
Stamped on it.

434
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:12,960
No, it wouldn't.

435
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:16,763
They don't stamp animals
"property of the zoo."

436
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,933
You couldn't stamp
a huge lion.

437
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:24,771
They stamp them
when they're small.

438
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,408
What happens
when they molt?

439
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:29,443
Lions don't molt.

440
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,777
No, but penguins do.

441
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:33,547
There, I've run rings
round you logically.

442
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,818
Oh, intercourse
the penguin.

443
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:41,355
It's just gone 8:00

444
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:44,291
and time for the penguin
on top of your television set

445
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:47,194
to explode.

446
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:53,100
How did he know that
was going to happen?

447
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,434
It was an inspired guess.

448
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:55,435
And now...

449
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:58,205
Number 23:the shin.

450
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:02,576
Number 24:
reginald maudling's shin.

451
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,213
Number 25:the brain.

452
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:11,385
Number 26:
margaret thatcher's brain.

453
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:19,159
And number 27:
more naughty bits.

454
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:24,898
Number 28:the naughty bits
of the cabinet.

455
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:29,503
Number 29:the interior
of a country house.

456
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,071
That's not a part
of the body.

457
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:32,372
No, it's a link, though.

458
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:33,507
I didn't think
it was very good.

459
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,409
No, it's the end
of the series.

460
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:36,577
They must be running
out of ideas.

461
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,278
All right,
don't anybody move.

462
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:39,546
There's
been a murder.

463
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,981
A murder?

464
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:42,449
No, no,
not murder, no.

465
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,118
What's like a murder
but begins with "b"?

466
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,453
Birmingham?

467
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,487
No, no, no, no, no.

468
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:48,488
Burnley?

469
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:49,656
Burnley,
that's right.

470
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,858
Burnley
in lancashire.

471
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,125
There's been
a burnley.

472
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,160
Burglary!

473
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:53,794
Burglary.

474
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:54,828
Yes, good man.

475
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:55,896
Burglary-- that's it,
of course.

476
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:56,897
There's been
a burglary.

477
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,898
Where?

478
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,199
In the back, just below the rib.

479
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,067
No, that's murder.

480
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,637
Oh, no-- in the, uh, the band.

481
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,507
In the bat... barclays bat.

482
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,841
Barclays bank?

483
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:08,842
Yes, nasty business.

484
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:09,943
Got away with funt23,000.

485
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,578
Any clues?

486
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:12,713
Any what?

487
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:16,450
Well, any evidence
as to who did it?

488
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:18,652
Any clues, eh?

489
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,722
Oh, we don't
half talk posh, do we?

490
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:24,091
I suppose we say
"ehnvelope"

491
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:25,792
And "larngerie"

492
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:29,196
And "sarndwiches
on the settee."

493
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,532
Well, this is a murder
investigation, young man

494
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:33,467
And murder is
a very serious business!

495
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,172
I thought you said
it was a burglary.

496
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,641
Burglary is almost as serious
a business as murder.

497
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,843
Some burglaries are
more serious than murder.

498
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:45,345
A burglary in which someone
gets stabbed is murder.

499
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,648
So don't come these petty
distinctions with me.

500
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,283
You're as bad as a judge.

501
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:51,051
Right! now,
the first thing to do

502
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:53,520
In the event of a breach
of a peace of any kind

503
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,757
Is to go and...

504
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,329
Sorry, sorry,
I was miles away.

505
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:03,330
Ring the police?

506
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:04,331
Ring the police.

507
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:05,332
Yes, that's
a good idea.

508
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:06,333
Get them
over here fast.

509
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:07,367
No, on second thoughts

510
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,468
Get them over
here slowly

511
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:09,736
So they don't
drop anything.

512
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,271
Shall I make us all
a cup of tea?

513
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,673
Make what you like,
boskovitch.

514
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:13,907
It won't help
you in court.

515
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,742
I beg your pardon?

516
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:17,211
I'm sorry, sorry.

517
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,580
That's the trouble with
being on two cases at once.

518
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:21,648
I keep thinking I've
got boskovitch cornered

519
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:23,784
Whereas in fact,
I'm investigating a burnley.

520
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:24,785
Burglary.

521
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:27,821
Yes-- good man.

522
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,223
Who's...
who's boskovitch?

523
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,224
Ha!

524
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,993
Boskovitch
is a russian scientist

525
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:34,962
Who's passing information
to the russians.

526
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:37,331
Classified
information?

527
00:26:37,364 --> 00:26:39,299
Oh, there he
goes again.

528
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,535
"classified
information"?

529
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:43,403
Oh, sitting on the settee

530
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:46,940
With our scones and our
classified information?

531
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:49,376
Ah, hello, duckie.

532
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,078
Hello, sir, how are you?

533
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:51,912
Fine, thanks,
how are you?

534
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,080
Well, sir

535
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,748
I'm a little bit
moody today, sir.

536
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:57,518
Why is that, duckie?

537
00:26:57,551 --> 00:26:58,752
Because...

538
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,722
I'm a little bit
sad and lonely

539
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:05,292
Now my baby's gone away

540
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:07,728
I'm feeling kinda blue,
I don't know just what to do

541
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:11,298
I feel a little sad today.

542
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:14,368
He's a little bit sad
and lonely

543
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,804
Now his baby's gone away

544
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:20,607
He's feeling kinda blue,
he don't know just what to do

545
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:24,244
He ain't feeling
too good today.

546
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:27,247
When I smile

547
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:30,717
The sun comes flooding in

548
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:33,587
When I'm sad

549
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,357
It goes
behind the clouds again

550
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:39,860
I'm a little bit
sad and lonely

551
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:43,430
Well, my baby's gone away

552
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:45,098
I'm feeling kinda...

553
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:46,533
Etcetera, etcetera.

00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,769
Lovely song.

555
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:50,804
