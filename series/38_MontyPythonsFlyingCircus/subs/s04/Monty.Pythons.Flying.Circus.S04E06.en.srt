1
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,807
There now follows
a party political broadcast

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,074
On behalf of the liberal party.

3
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:09,043
Pratt, back to pratt.

4
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,012
Pratt again, a long ball
out to pratt

5
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,713
and now pratt is on the ball...

6
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:15,950
a neat little flick back inside
to pratt, who takes it nicely

7
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,419
and sends it through
on the far side to pratt.

8
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:21,756
Pratt with it but passes
instead to pratt, pratt again...

9
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,191
Oh, and well intercepted

10
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:26,127
by the swarthy little
number nine concito maracon.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,461
This 21-year-old halfback

12
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,764
remarkably stocky
for six foot, three inches

13
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:33,167
square shouldered, balding
giant, hair flowing in the wind

14
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,303
bright-eyed, pert,
young for his age

15
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:36,904
but oh-so-old in so many ways.

16
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:39,540
For a 39-year-old you wouldn't
expect such speed.

17
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:42,510
Normally considered slow...

18
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,346
sweeping up and taking
the defense to the cleaners.

19
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,416
Who would have thought,
though many expected it

20
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,984
this remarkable 45-year-old

21
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,019
nine foot, four inches
dwarf of a man

22
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,721
who is still only 17
in some parts of the world

23
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,056
would ever really be...

24
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,424
oh, and there was
a goal there apparently...

25
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,493
and now it's pratt,
back to pratt...

26
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:03,898
Pratt again...
a long ball out to pratt...

27
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,568
I really like
this ano-wheat.

28
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:10,705
It really
unclogs me.

29
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,073
Oh, do be careful!

30
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,441
Sorry, mum.

31
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:14,509
I mean, a lot
of the others

32
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:15,643
Say they
unclog you

33
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,479
But I never had
a single bowel movement

34
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:20,248
With them
"recto-puffs."

35
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,482
Now, if we...

36
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,284
Oh, sorry, mum.

37
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,352
If we lived
in rhodesia

38
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,353
There'd be
someone

39
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:26,521
To mop that up
for you.

40
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,823
Don't be so
bleedin' stupid.

41
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,625
If you lived
in bleedin' rhodesia

42
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,995
You'd be out at bleedin' fascist
rallies every bleedin' day.

43
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:36,397
You're a bleedin' racist,
you bleedin' are!

44
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,632
Language!

45
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:39,867
Well, he gets
on my sodding wick.

46
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,068
That's better.

47
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,470
No, the stuff
I liked was

48
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,438
That stuff they gave you
before the war

49
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:45,807
What was it?--

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,708
Wilkinson's number eight
laxative cereal.

51
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:49,110
Whew, that one
went through you

52
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,412
Like a bloody ferrari.

53
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,514
Now, who's that
at this time of day?

54
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,183
If it's the man
to empty the elsan

55
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,450
Tell him it's
in the hall.

56
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:57,585
Right, dear.

57
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,320
And make sure
that you hold it

58
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,321
The right
way up.

59
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,389
Dad?

60
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,456
Yeah?

61
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,491
No, no,
my dad.

62
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,760
Oh.

63
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,896
Dad, why is rhodesia
called rhodesia?

64
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,964
Oh, sorry, dad.

65
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,699
No, no, thank you
very much.

66
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,267
No, I'm sorry.

67
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,036
Thank you very
much, indeed.

68
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,637
No, thank you
for calling.

69
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:17,972
Not today, thank you.

70
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,607
Good morning.

71
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,042
Who was that?

72
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,845
The liberal party
candidate, darling.

73
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:25,446
What have you
done now?

74
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,447
Sorry, mum.

75
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,815
I was just
washing up.

76
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,118
Go and
sit down!

77
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,920
Mum...

78
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:35,456
Mum, do you know

79
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,092
Why rhodesia's
called rhodesia?

80
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,994
Do you remember
"go-eazi"?

81
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,562
They were
hopeless...

82
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:42,630
Little black
pellets

83
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,998
Tasted foul

84
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,800
And they stuck
inside you

85
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,568
Like flooring
adhesive.

86
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,403
Well, I'm off!

87
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:50,671
What time are you
coming back tonight?

88
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:51,639
3:00 a.m.!

89
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,874
I think it's disgusting

90
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,710
You a member of parliament.

91
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:57,778
Last night I heard you
snogging away.

92
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,881
We was not snogging!

93
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,016
Sure... sounded like
snogging to me.

94
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,353
I could hear his great wet,
slobbering lips going at you

95
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,054
And his hand
going...

96
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:08,055
Dad!

97
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,056
Yeah?

98
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,057
No, not you.

99
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,058
Oh.

100
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:14,996
Just mind
your language.

101
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,731
Oh, sorry, mum.

102
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,332
I've run out of beans!

103
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,767
We was
talking!

104
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,936
We was
not snogging!

105
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,305
Talking about
snogging, I'll bet.

106
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,773
If you
must know

107
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:28,009
We was talking about
council re-housing!

108
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,911
Would it mean
going to live in hollywood?

109
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,613
I've run out of beans!

110
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,582
Where to re-house
his right hand--

111
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,517
That's all he was interested in!

112
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:39,120
And has faye dunaway
definitely said yes?

113
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:42,056
He is the chairman
of the housing subcommittee.

114
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,158
Snogging subcommittee,
more like.

115
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:46,427
Ralph, do answer
that door, will you?

116
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,196
Beans!

117
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,897
Shut up!!

118
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:50,965
Yes, mum.

119
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,034
If it's the man
from probbo-rib

120
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,702
Tell him
it's in the bed.

121
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,538
All right.

122
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,007
Sorry, mum.

123
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,910
Postmaaaan!

124
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,654
Well, a very good try there
by the garibaldi family

125
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,556
Of droitwich in worcestershire.

126
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,325
Professor?

127
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,893
Well, I can't
make up my mind

128
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:19,861
About this family.

129
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:21,128
I don't think there was

130
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:23,498
The sustained awfulness
that we really need.

131
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:25,466
I mean, the father
was appalling...

132
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,301
Appalling, yes.

133
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:29,504
He was dirty, smelly
and distasteful

134
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:33,307
And I liked him
very much, but...

135
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,308
Lady organs?

136
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,610
Well, they were

137
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,111
An unpleasant
family, certainly

138
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:38,246
But I don't
think we had

139
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,814
Any of the really
gross awfulness

140
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:40,982
We're looking for.

141
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,450
Well, harsh words there

142
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,686
For the garibaldi family
of droitwich in worcestershire

143
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,457
At present holders of the east
midlands most-awful-family award

144
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,092
Lower middle-class section

145
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:55,663
But unable today to score more
than 15 on our disgustometer.

146
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,366
Well, with the scores
all in from the judges

147
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,003
The garibaldis are number three
and a surprise at number two:

148
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:06,908
The fanshaw-chumleighs
of berkshire.

149
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,061
Well, some of
the wonderful behavior

150
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:29,330
That made the fanshaw-chumleighs

151
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:32,500
The second-most-awful family
in britain, 1974.

152
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,870
But the winners,
by a clear ten-point margin

153
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:39,440
Once again, the awful
jodrell family of durham.

154
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:41,843
Unfortunately,
we're not allowed to show you

155
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,378
Some of the performance
that won them the award

156
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:47,248
But I assure you it was
of the very highest standard

157
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,015
Was it not, lady organs?

158
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,617
Oh, yes, superb.

159
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,952
I mean, mr. jodrell--

160
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:53,020
You know, the old grandfather
who licks the...

161
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:54,355
Yes, yes...

162
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:55,957
He's superb.

163
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,459
His gobbing is consistent
and accurate.

164
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:00,995
His son is a dirty,
foul little creature

165
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,598
And those frightful scabs
which mrs. jodrell...

166
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,132
Well, thank you
very much, lady organs

167
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,168
And from all of us,
well done to the jodrells

168
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,036
And to all of you,
not forgetting those of you

169
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,304
Who may be halfway in between

170
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:11,973
Without whom, of course
and not forgetting

171
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:13,941
Who made it all possible when,
and we'll be back

172
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,643
Until then, and so
it's good night from me

173
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,345
And here's wishing you
a safe journey home.

174
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,779
Thank you for watching
this show.

175
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,248
Don't forget it was
all great fun, I enjoyed it

176
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,450
And I hope you
watching at home

177
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,086
Have enjoyed it too.

178
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,822
The jodrells win
every bloody year.

179
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,190
Makes you vomit!

180
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,258
Dad?

181
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,359
Yes?

182
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,928
Get your stinking feet
off the bread.

183
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,664
I'm only wiping
the cat's do's off!

184
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,398
Mum?

185
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,534
Shut your gob,
douglas.

186
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,402
I want more
corn plasters!

187
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:45,740
Shut up and eat
what you got!

188
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,976
Some fat bastard at the door!

189
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,646
Shut up!

190
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:55,716
A strong hive of bees contains
approximately 75,000 bees.

191
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,786
Each honeybee must make
154 trips to collect

192
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,488
One teaspoonful
of honey.

193
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,622
Hello, sir.

194
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,224
What do
you want?

195
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,659
Would you like to buy
some of our honey, sir?

196
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,960
What are you
doing in here?

197
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,061
Which would
you like--

198
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,629
The californian
orange blossom

199
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:10,064
The mexican,
the new zealand

200
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,299
Or the scottish
heather?

201
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:12,700
He can't eat honey.

202
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,402
It makes him
go plop-plops!

203
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,637
Come on, please
try some.

204
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,839
All right,
I'll have

205
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,106
Some icelandic
honey.

206
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,341
No, there is no such thing.

207
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,543
You mean you don't make
any honey at all?

208
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:25,780
No, no, we must import it all,
every bally drop.

209
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,415
We are a gloomy people.

210
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,917
It's so crikey cold
and dark up there

211
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,919
And there's only fish to eat.

212
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,621
Fish and imported honey.

213
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:34,956
Oh, strewth!

214
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,258
Well, why do you
have a week?

215
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,125
Listen, buster!

216
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,460
In reykjavik
it is dark

217
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:41,062
For eight months
of the year

218
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,196
And it's
cold enough

219
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,631
To freeze
your wrists off

220
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,633
And there's only
golly fish to eat.

221
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,969
Administrative errors
are bound to occur

222
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:49,270
In enormous
quantities.

223
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,037
Look at this.

224
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,205
It's all a mistake.

225
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,774
It's a real pain
in the sphincter!

226
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,144
Icelandic honey week? my life!

227
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:57,778
Well, why do you
come in here

228
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,547
Trying to flog
the stuff, then?

229
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,983
Listen, cowboy,
I got a job to do.

230
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,985
It's a stupid,
pointless job

231
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,686
But at least
it keeps me

232
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,788
Away from iceland,
all right?

233
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:12,393
The leg of the worker bee has...

234
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,484
Well, mr. cotton,
you have

235
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:11,419
What we in the medical
profession call

236
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:12,353
A naughty complaint.

237
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,921
Now, my advice
to you is

238
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:16,324
To put this paper bag
over your head--

239
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:18,759
It's got little
holes there, you see

240
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,761
Little holes
for your eyes--

241
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,464
And to ring this bell
and to take this card

242
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,266
Along to your
hospital, okay?

243
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,336
And I shall inform all your
relatives and friends

244
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,439
And anyone else that I happen to
bump into, okay?

245
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:33,574
Cash, wasn't it?

246
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:36,978
Thank you very much.

247
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,647
Get out.

248
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,185
Dirty little man.

249
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,387
Hippocratic oath, hippocratic...

250
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,588
Oh, it's not in there.

251
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:48,723
Jolly good.

252
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:52,193
Very useful. next!

253
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:57,064
Ah, yes, you must be
mr. williams.

254
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,733
Well, do take a seat.

255
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,868
What seems to be
the trouble?

256
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:03,671
I've just been stabbed
by your nurse!

257
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:04,872
Oh, dear, yes, well...

258
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:07,108
I'd probably better have
a look at you then.

259
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:08,876
Could you fill in
this form first?

260
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,179
She just stabbed me.

261
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,814
Yes, she's
an unpredictable sort.

262
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:14,949
Look, you seem to be
bleeding rather badly.

263
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,585
I think you'd better hurry up
and fill in that form.

264
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,453
Couldn't I fill it
in later, doctor?

265
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,323
No, no, you'll have
bled to death by then.

266
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,658
Can you hold a pen?

267
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:24,859
I'll try.

268
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,561
Yes, jolly good.

269
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:28,196
It's a hell
of a nuisance

270
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,897
All this damn paperwork.

271
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,032
Really, it is.

272
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,734
It's a real nightmare,
this paperwork.

273
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:36,137
It really is a hell
of a nuisance.

274
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,939
Something ought
to be done about it.

275
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:38,940
Do I have to answer

276
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,274
All the questions,
doctor?

277
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,909
No, no, no, just...

278
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:44,612
Just fill in as
many as you can.

279
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,615
No need to go into too much
detail, you know.

280
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,918
I don't know why we bother
with it all, really

281
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:52,520
It's such a nuisance.

282
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,755
Well, let's see
how you've done, then.

283
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,491
Oh, yes.

284
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:57,692
Oh, dear, oh, dear

285
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,560
That's not
very good, is it?

286
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,762
Look, surely
you knew number four!

287
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:02,997
No...

288
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,232
It's from
the merchant of venice.

289
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:05,233
Even I knew that!

290
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,168
It's going
on the carpet, doctor.

291
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,836
Oh, don't worry
about that!

292
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,505
Look at this--
number six--

293
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:12,406
It's the treaty
of versailles!

294
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,774
Didn't you know that?

295
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,009
Oh, my god.

296
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,646
And number nine--
emerson fittipaldi!

297
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,716
Virginia wade?
you must be mad!

298
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:22,717
Oh, doctor...

299
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,118
I've just shot
another patient.

300
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:26,087
I don't think there's any point
in your seeing him.

301
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,221
You didn't kill him, did you?

302
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:28,523
Afraid so.

303
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:30,158
You mustn't kill them, nurse.

304
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,325
Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.

305
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,261
It was just on the spur
of the moment.

306
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:34,428
Rather silly, really.

307
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:37,765
I'm sorry about
the carpet, doctor.

308
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,035
Mr. williams, I'm afraid I can't
give you any marks

309
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,704
So I won't be able to recommend
you for hospital.

310
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:46,607
I tell you what,
I'll stop the bleeding

311
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,209
But strictly speaking

312
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,977
I shouldn't
even do that

313
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:51,512
On marks like these.

314
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,981
There are no more patients
now, doctor.

315
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:55,983
Oh, well, let's go
for lunch, then.

316
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:57,251
What about... er...

317
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:58,753
Ah, yes, look,
mr. williams

318
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,122
We're just popping out
for a bite of lunch

319
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,457
While we've got a spare
moment, you know.

320
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,426
Look, have another
bash at the form

321
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,128
And if at least
you can answer

322
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,063
The questions
on history all right

323
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,131
Then we
may be able

324
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,566
To give you
some morphine

325
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,234
Or something
like that, okay?

326
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,403
Thank you, doctor, thank you.

327
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:17,738
Dear sir, I wish to protest

328
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:20,475
In the strongest
possible terms.

329
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:21,742
Yours sincerely

330
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:24,779
Brigadier n.f.
marwood-git [retired].

331
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:27,448
Read that back,
will you, brian?

332
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:29,884
"and when he had
built up cedron

333
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,219
"he sent horsemen there

334
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,187
"and an host of footmen
to the end

335
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,656
"that issuing out
they might make outroads

336
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,693
Upon the ways of judea
as the king commanded them."

337
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:39,927
Good!

338
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:41,929
Pop it in an envelope
and bung it off!

339
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,898
It's no good bottling
things up, brian.

340
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,933
If you feel them
you must just say them

341
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:47,101
Or you'll just go mad.

342
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:48,102
Oh, yes, indeed.

343
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,770
As the book of maccabee said

344
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:51,973
"yea, as the flea
is like unto an oxen

345
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,609
"so is the privet hedge
liken unto a botanist

346
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:56,310
Black in thy sight, o lord."

347
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:58,012
Quite.

348
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,214
Look, why don't you just nip out
for lunch, brian?

349
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:01,516
Yea, as raymond
chandler said

350
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:02,717
"it was one
of those days

351
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,552
"when
los angeles felt

352
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:05,753
Like a rock-hard fig."

353
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,090
Brian, let's stop this
pretending, shall we?

354
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,591
Yea, as
dirk bogarde said

355
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,993
In his
autobiography...

356
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,327
Brian!

357
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,796
Let's stop all
this futile pretense.

358
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,331
I've...

359
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:20,535
I've always been
moderately fond of you.

360
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:23,104
Well, to be quite
frank, brigadier

361
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,972
One can't walk
so closely

362
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:27,942
With a chap like you
for... for so long

363
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,578
Without feeling
something

364
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,346
Deep down inside

365
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,549
Even if it isn't
anything...

366
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:37,451
Anything
very much.

367
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:41,255
Well, splendid, brian.

368
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,492
Well, I don't suppose

369
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:46,828
There's much
we can do, really.

370
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:50,631
Not on
television, no.

371
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:53,301
No.

372
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,535
They, uh...

373
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,737
They are a lot more
permissive these days

374
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:57,939
Than they used to be.

375
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:02,143
Ah, yes, but not with
this sort of thing.

376
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,911
No.

377
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,113
I suppose they've...

378
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:10,117
Got to draw
the line somewhere.

379
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:12,487
Yes.

380
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:15,289
Yes.

381
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:19,594
Well, take
a letter, brian.

382
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:24,031
Dear sir,
I wish to protest...

383
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,594
Ooh!

384
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:57,431
Hmm?

385
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:08,042
Oh.

386
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:10,878
Ho-oh!

387
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:13,481
Oh, oh.

388
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,730
Hmm?

389
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:06,868
Mmm... mmm?

390
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:23,551
There now follows...

391
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,922
Hello.

392
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:31,692
I'd like to talk to you tonight
about a minority group of people

393
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:34,028
Who have no mental
or physical handicaps

394
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,497
And who, through no fault
of their own

395
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:38,132
Have never been deprived

396
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:42,303
And consequently are forced
to live in conditions

397
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,905
Of extreme luxury.

398
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:45,840
This often-ignored minority

399
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:50,244
Is very rarely brought to the
attention of the general public.

400
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,615
The average man in the street
scarcely gives a second thought

401
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:57,084
To these extremely
well-off people.

402
00:16:57,118 --> 00:17:00,688
He quite simply fails
to appreciate the pressures

403
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:04,258
That vast quantities of money
just do not bring.

404
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:10,198
Have you at home ever had
to cope with this problem?

405
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:12,867
Or this?

406
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,737
I know it's only human to say

407
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,840
"oh, this will never happen
to me"

408
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,008
And of course, it won't.

409
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,644
So I'm asking you,
please, please

410
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:28,850
send no contributions,
however large, to me.

411
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:31,085
There now follows a party political
broadcast...

412
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:34,622
All right, I'll go.

413
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:39,627
Everything goes up,
everything goes down

414
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,329
Fish, bananas...

415
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:42,430
Hello, madam.

416
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:44,131
Oh, hello, you must
have come about...

417
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:45,533
Finishing the
sentences, yes.

418
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,335
Oh, well, perhaps
you'd like to...

419
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:49,137
Come through this way,
certainly.

420
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,771
Oh, nice place
you've got here.

421
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:52,039
Yes, well, we, uh...

422
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,474
Like it.

423
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:54,575
Yes, we certainly...

424
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,576
Do, good.

425
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,111
Now, when did you first start...

426
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:58,613
Finding it difficult...

427
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,047
To finish sentences, yes.

428
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:01,282
Well, it's not me, it's my...

429
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:01,816
Husband?

430
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:02,683
Yes, he...

431
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:03,518
Never lets you finish

432
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:04,352
What you've started?

433
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:05,653
Quite, I'm beginning to feel...

434
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,655
You'll never finish a sentence
again as long as you live?

435
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:08,222
Exact--

436
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:09,757
--ly-- it must be awful.

437
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,791
It's driving me...

438
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:11,526
To drink.

439
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,026
No, rou--

440
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:12,660
--nd the be--

441
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:13,094
--en--

442
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:13,628
--d.

443
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:14,896
Yes.

444
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:16,030
May i...

445
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:17,064
Take a seat.

446
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:18,199
Thank you.

447
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:19,500
You see, our method

448
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:22,904
Is to reassure the patient
by re-creating normal...

449
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,172
Conditions.

450
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:26,507
Yes, then we try and get them
into a position

451
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,875
Where they
suddenly find

452
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:30,611
That they're completing other
people's sentences...

453
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:32,346
Themselves.

454
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,948
Spot on, mrs...

455
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:35,316
Smith.

456
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,685
Good, well, try not
to overdo it to...

457
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:38,519
Begin with.

458
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:39,487
Keep it to one or two...

459
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,588
Words...

460
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,557
To start off with,
otherwise you may find...

461
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,858
I'm taking on too long
a sentence

462
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:44,892
And getting completely...

463
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:46,327
Stuck.

464
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,930
Good, yes, well,
that's about it...

465
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:49,997
For now, so...

466
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:51,532
Thanks very
much for calling.

467
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:52,567
Oh, not at all.

468
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,568
And...

469
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:54,769
I'd just
like to say...

470
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:56,504
Thank you very much
for coming along.

471
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:57,538
Not at all.

472
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:58,606
And good...

473
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,607
Bye, mr...

474
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,708
Vernon.

475
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:01,776
Carl!

476
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,144
Yes, dear?

477
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:05,446
I've just had
another baby.

478
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,315
Oh, no.
how many is that now?

479
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:09,350
Uh, 12 since lunch.

480
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:13,287
Oh! there's another one.

481
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:19,120
This is stonehenge, and
it's from here we go to africa.

482
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:23,057
Well, here it is at last,
the goal of our quest.

483
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,861
After six months and three days,
we've finally caught up

484
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,730
With the legendary
walking tree of dahomey--

485
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,966
Quercus nicholas parsonsus--

486
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:36,237
Resting here for a moment
on its long journey south.

487
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,606
It's almost incredible,
isn't it

488
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:42,844
To think that this huge tree
has walked over 2,000 miles

489
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:46,247
Across this inhospitable terrain
to stop here

490
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,349
Maybe just to take in water

491
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:52,553
Before the 2,000 miles
on to cape town where it lives.

492
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:55,022
It's almost unimaginable,
I find

493
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:59,594
The thought of this mighty tree
strolling through nigeria;

494
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,095
Perhaps swaggering a little

495
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,097
As it crosses the border
into zaire;

496
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,366
Hopping through
the tropical rain forest

497
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:07,001
Trying to find a quiet grove

498
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:09,070
Where it can jump around
on its own;

499
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:14,275
Sprinting up to zambia for the
afternoon, then nipping back...

500
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:16,477
Oh, super.

501
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:20,882
Well, I've just been told
that this is not in fact

502
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:24,218
The legendary
walking tree of dahomey.

503
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:29,557
This is one of africa's
many stationary trees

504
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,160
Arborus bamber gascoignus.

505
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:35,229
In fact, we've just missed
the walking tree.

506
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:37,598
It left here at 8:00
this morning.

507
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:40,101
It was heading off
in that direction

508
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:43,437
So we'll just see if we can go
and catch it up.

509
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:46,607
Come on, boys.

510
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:53,514
Well, we're still keeping up
with it

511
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:55,449
But it's setting a furious pace.

512
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:57,952
Early this morning,
we thought we'd spotted it

513
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,721
But it turned out to be
an angolan sauntering tree--

514
00:22:00,755 --> 00:22:02,056
Amazellus robin ray--

515
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,625
Out walking with
a gambian sidling bush.

516
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:05,660
So, on we go.

517
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:07,461
It's going to be difficult.

518
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:11,332
A walking tree can achieve
speeds of up to 50 miles an hour

519
00:22:11,365 --> 00:22:15,403
Especially when it's in a hurry.

520
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:16,604
Super.

521
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:19,073
Well, rupert has spotted
something.

522
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:24,779
This could be it--
a walking tree on the move.

523
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:27,849
But what rupert
had in fact discovered

524
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:31,853
Was something very different...

525
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:34,622
The turkish little rude plant.

526
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:38,326
This remarkably smutty piece
of flora was used by the turks

527
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,863
To ram up each others'...

528
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,698
Ah, no!

529
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:48,302
In fact, it was something
even more interesting.

530
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:51,472
Yes, there it was, over
the other side of the clearing--

531
00:22:51,506 --> 00:22:53,941
The legendary puking tree
of mozambique.

532
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:56,644
No, what they'd come across
was a tribe lost to man

533
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:57,879
Since time immemorial--

534
00:22:57,912 --> 00:23:00,148
The legendary batsmen
of the kalahari.

535
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:02,483
Primitive customs
still survive here

536
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:05,286
As if the march of time
had passed them by.

537
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,488
But for all the mumbo jumbo
and superstition

538
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:10,091
The batsmen of the kalahari
are formidable fighters

539
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:12,760
As we can see in this rare
footage of them in action

540
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:14,295
Against warwickshire.

541
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:17,665
Warwickshire had dismissed
the kalahari batsmen for 140

542
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,300
But then it was their turn

543
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,936
To face this extraordinary
kalahari attack.

544
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:25,439
Pratt was the first to go,
but pratt and pratt put on

545
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:27,542
A second wicket stand of naught

546
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:33,748
Which was broken by odinga
in his most hostile mood.

547
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:44,158
That's b. pratt,
hit wicket-- naught.

548
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:46,494
But pratt and z. pratt dug in

549
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:52,834
And took the score to a half
before z. pratt ran away.

550
00:23:55,736 --> 00:24:00,708
But out came m.j.k. pratt to
play a real captain's innings.

551
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,077
He'd taken his own score
up to naught

552
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:09,016
When he mistimed a shot
of bowanga and was l.b.w.

553
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:16,190
Typical of umbonga's hostile
opening spell

554
00:24:16,224 --> 00:24:18,392
Was his dismissal of v.e. pratt

555
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:24,031
Who offered no resistance
to this delivery...

556
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:27,835
And he was caught behind.

557
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:34,108
But by lunch, the situation
had changed dramatically.

558
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:10,378
And so, with
the tension colossal

559
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:12,046
As we come up
to the last ball...

560
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,583
That's all from us.

561
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:38,332
Good evening.

562
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:40,001
Over funt400,000 million

563
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:43,905
Were wiped off the value
of shares this afternoon

564
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:47,642
When someone in
the stock exchange coughed.

565
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:50,578
Sport-- capital punishment
is to be reintroduced

566
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,580
In the first and second
division.

567
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,549
Any player found tackling
from behind

568
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:57,451
Or controlling the ball
with the lower part of the arm

569
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,353
Will be hanged.

570
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:02,423
But the electric chair remains
the standard punishment

571
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,025
For threatening the goalie.

572
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:06,294
Referees' chairman
len goebbels said

573
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:09,030
"at last, the referee
has been given teeth."

574
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:13,634
Finally, politics-- the latest
opinion poll published today

575
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:17,705
Shows labor ahead with 40%,
the a.a. second with 38%

576
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:19,273
And, not surprisingly

577
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:23,010
Kentucky fried chicken running
the liberals a very close third.

578
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:24,679
And now, back to me-- hello.

579
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:28,216
And now it's time to go over
to hugh delaney at paignton.

580
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:30,985
Hello, and welcome to paignton
because it's from paignton

581
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:33,187
That we take you straight back
to the studio.

582
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:35,923
Hello, and it's from here
we go over there.

583
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:38,426
Well, we're already here,
so let's go over there.

584
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,794
Welcome back.

585
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:42,430
And now it's time
for part eight of our series

586
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:45,299
About the life and work
of ursula hitler

587
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,667
The surrey housewife

588
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:48,569
Who revolutionized
british beekeeping

589
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:51,305
In the 1930s.

590
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:54,108
That was a party
political - cast

591
00:27:54,142 --> 00:27:58,613
On behalf of
the liberal party.
