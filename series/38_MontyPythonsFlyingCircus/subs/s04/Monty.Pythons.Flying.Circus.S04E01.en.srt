1
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:16,782
The golden age of ballooning
can be said to begin in 1783...

2
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,785
When the montgolfier brothers
made their first ascent

3
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,353
In a fire balloon.

4
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:23,522
On the eve of that...

5
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,191
Oh, come on.

6
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:26,826
Momentous ascent

7
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,895
The brothers took one last look
at their craft

8
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,298
As it stood on the fields
of annecy.

9
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:35,034
This is a great moment
for us, joseph.

10
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:37,369
It is a great moment
for france.

11
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:38,704
Ah, oui.

12
00:00:38,737 --> 00:00:41,807
The first ascent
in a hot air balloon

13
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,710
By the montgolfier
brothers, 1783.

14
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:46,278
I can see us now

15
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,715
Just after "montesquieu"
and just before "mozart."

16
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,517
I think
I'll go and wash.

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,518
Good luck.

18
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,652
It's quite easy,
really.

19
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,020
I just slap a little
water on my face...

20
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,755
No, no, no.

21
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,123
Good luck for tomorrow.

22
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:59,492
Oh, I see, yes.

23
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:00,759
You, too.

24
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,061
Yours has been
the work.

25
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:06,165
Let us hope
for a safe ascent.

26
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:09,168
And don't use my flannel.

27
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:11,971
You know, when you showed me
the plans in paris

28
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,173
I could not believe
that we should be

29
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:15,841
The first men
who would fly.

30
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,576
Yes, it's wonderful.

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,146
I'm so excited,
I could hardly wash.

32
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:23,215
Yes, i, too, have had
some difficulty washing

33
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,884
These past few days.

34
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:28,120
Still, what is washing
when we are on the verge

35
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,523
Of a great scientific
breakthrough?

36
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:31,524
Jacques...

37
00:01:31,557 --> 00:01:33,359
Yes, joseph?

38
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:35,861
I've not been washing
very thoroughly

39
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,496
For many years now.

40
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,697
What do you mean?

41
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,666
You must have been
washing your face.

42
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:42,268
Oh, yes, my face.

43
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,702
I wash my face.

44
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:49,508
But my legs, my stomach,
my chest-- they're filthy.

45
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:53,279
Well... I don't wash
my stomach every day.

46
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:55,181
Ah, but you wash
far more than me.

47
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:57,883
You are the cleaner of
the montgolfier brothers.

48
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,418
This is nothing, joseph.

49
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:00,786
Monsieur
montgolfier

50
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,556
A mr. parfitt to see you, sir.

51
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:05,457
No, no, no,
bartlett.

52
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,793
A mr. barklit
to see you, sir.

53
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:10,429
No, bartlett,
with a "t."

54
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,697
A mister...

55
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,466
Barr-at-elett to see you, sir.

56
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,468
Bartlett.

57
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,469
Barkit.

58
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:17,636
Bartlett.

59
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,272
Barlit... bartlett.

60
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,209
A mr. bartlett
to see you, sir.

61
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:25,077
I don't want to see
anyone, o'toole.

62
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,178
Tell him to go away.

63
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,046
Thank you, sir.

64
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,415
Well, it's
getting late.

65
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:32,017
I must go
and have a wash.

66
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,086
What will you be washing?

67
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,721
Oh, just my face and neck.

68
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:38,090
Perhaps my feet
and possibly... but no!

69
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:39,692
Lock up the plans,
joseph.

70
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:42,561
Tomorrow, they will make us
the toast of france.

71
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,297
The first ascent by
the montgolfier brothers

72
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,799
In a balloon

73
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:49,335
Just after "ballcock"
and just before "bang."

74
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:50,803
What a position.

75
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,805
So on june 7, 1783

76
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:56,408
The montgolfier brothers had
a really good wash.

77
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,611
Starting on his face and arms

78
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:02,515
Joseph michael montgolfier
went on to scrub his torso

79
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:07,119
His legs and his naughty bits,
before rinsing his whole body.

80
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:10,289
That june night, he and
his brother between them

81
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,658
Washed 17 square feet
of body area.

82
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:15,594
They used a kilo and a half
of carbolic soap

83
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,297
And nearly 14 gallons
of nice hot water.

84
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,767
It was indeed
an impressive sight.

85
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,936
Next week on
the golden age of ballooning

86
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:26,305

of glaisher and coxwell

87

110

Of the award-winning series
the golden age of ballooning.

111
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,274
Oh, joseph...

112
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:38,110
All you think about
is balloons.

113
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,379
All you talk about
is balloons.

114
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,114
Your beautiful house is

115
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,783
Full of bits and pieces
of balloons.

116
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,719
Your books are
all about balloons.

117
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,187
Every time
you sing a song

118
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,090
It is in some way obliquely
connected with balloons.

119
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,491
Everything you eat

120
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,293
Has to have
the word "balloon"

121
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,828
Incorporated
in the title.

122
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:58,364
Your dogs are all
called balloono.

123
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:01,200
You tie balloons
to your ankles in the evenings.

124
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,835
I don't do that.

125
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:04,970
Well, no, you don't do that

126
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:08,641
But you do duck down
and shout, "hey, balloons!"

127
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:12,745
When there are none about.

128
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,847
Your whole life
is becoming

129
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,082
Obsessively balloonic,
you know.

130
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,551
Why do I have
to hang

131
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,920
From this bloody
gas bag all day?

132
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,088
Don't I mean anything
to you?

133
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,090
Oh, ma cherie,
you mean more to me

134
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,359
Than any heavier-than-air
dirigible...

135
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,794
Oh, there you go again!

136
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,095
Don't waggle!

137
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,797
I've run your bath
for you, joseph.

138
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,865
Oh, I'm so sorry.

139
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:34,033
I didn't realize...

140
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,201
It's all right.

141
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,103
We've done the difficult bit.

142
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,472
Well, don't forget

143
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,640
We have our special guest
coming this evening.

144
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,741
Oh?

145
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,109
Don't tell me you've
forgotten already.

146
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,744
The man who is giving us
thousands of francs

147
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,745
For experiments.

148
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,746
What man?

149
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,348
Louis xiv.

150
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,950
Isn't he dead?

151
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,685
Evidently not.

152
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:55,120
All right, I'll be round.

153
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,522
Oh... and, joseph?

154
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:57,723
Yes, jacques.

155
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,925
You will... wash, won't you?

156
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,162
Yes, of course.

157
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,801
His royal majesty,
louis xiv of france.

158
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:12,204
And mr. bartlett.

159
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:19,345
Your majesty, it is
a great privilege.

160
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,180
Welcome to our humble abode.

161
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:25,851
It's, uh... very nice
to be here.

162
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,286
O'toole...

163
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,053
Sir?

164
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,755
A claret for
his majesty, please.

165
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,391
There's a mr. bartlett outside
again, sir.

166
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:33,392
Not now, I can't see him.

167
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:34,527
We have the king
of france here.

168
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,296
Yes, sir.

169
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,084
Your majesty, you've had
a pleasant journey, I trust?

170
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,388
Yes, yes,
oh, definitely, yes, yes.

171
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,624
Oh, aye... aye.

172
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,666
You have come from paris?

173
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,301
Where?

174
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,770
From paris--
you have traveled from paris?

175
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:21,073
Oh, yes, yes, we've come
from... from paris, yes.

176
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:23,008
Oh, yes.

177
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,579
Yes, we've just come from...
yeah, yeah, paris, yes.

178
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,947
Sir?

179
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,248
Yes, o'toole.

180
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,050
Which one is
the claret, sir?

181
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,185
The claret is in the decanter.

182
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,487
The wooden thing?

183
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,988
No, no, the glass thing.

184
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:38,991
The glass decanter
with the round glass stopper.

185
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,493
Oh, yes, behind the door.

186
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,695
No, no... on the sideboard.

187
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,263
The sideboard?

188
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:47,800
The sideboard, yes.

189
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,370
Look, you go into
the salle a manger

190
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:52,805
The dining room, right?

191
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:56,609
And the sideboard's
on your left by the wall.

192
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,811
Beside the
master's portrait.

193
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,779
Ah! above
the mirror, sir.

194
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,315
No, no, no, no, the mirror's
on the other side.

195
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,783
It's opposite the mirror.

196
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,218
But that's
the table, sir.

197
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,420
No, you don't go
as far as the table...

198
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,055
You go into the room, right?

199
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,391
On your right is the door
to the orangery

200
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:15,127
Straight ahead of you is
the door to the library

201
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,062
And to your left
is the sideboard.

202
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,699
Ah, yes, I see, sir.

203
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,869
And the claret is on top of
the sideboard, to the left.

204
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,037
On the left.

205
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,238
Yes.

206
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,907
As one looks
at it, sir?

207
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,241
Yes.

208
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,709
I see, sir--
thank you.

209
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,044
O'toole.

210
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,045
Yes, sir?

211
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:34,413
Will you please
tell monsieur joseph

212
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:35,414
Our guest is here?

213
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,184
Yes, sir.

214
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:45,424
I'm sorry about that,
your majesty.

215
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,726
Apparently, sir,
there is a plan

216
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,895
To build a canal between
the two egyptian towns...

217
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,299
Not now, o'toole.

218
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,935
Well, eh... mr. montgolfier

219
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,636
Let's not beat
around the bush.

220
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,438
My dukes and I are
very busy men.

221
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,440
What we'd like to do is
see the plans

222
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,310
Of your proposed balloon
if that's at all possible.

223
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,511
Certainly,
your majesty.

224
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,179
I have them here
ready prepared.

225
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,647
Oh, great, hen.

226
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,050
What we'd like to do is
take these back wi' us

227
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,718
For the royal archives of, er...

228
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,719
France.

229
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:14,987
France, aye.

230
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,289
Well, it is indeed a great honor,
your majesty

231
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,457
That I cannot
refuse.

232
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,992
Right, okay, let's get 'em.

233
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,227
Just a moment!

234
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,561
Joseph!

235
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,498
That man is not louis xiv.

236
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,399
Joseph, are you
out of your mind?

237
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,369
I've been looking it up
in my bath.

238
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,738
Louis xiv died in 1717.

239
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:34,106
It's now 1783.

240
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,608
Answer me that.

241
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,643
Did I say louis xiv?

242
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:40,813
I'm sorry, I meant louis xv,
louis xv.

243
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,382
He died in 1774.

244
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:47,086
All right, louis xvi.

245
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,756
Listen to me, smartarse.

246
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:54,226
When you're king of france,
you've got better things to do

247
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,697
Than go around all day
remembering your bloody number.

248
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,065
Do you want to argue
about numbers?

249
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,100
No, no.

250
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,234
Well, let's get hold
of these plans

251
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,369
For the royal archives.

252
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,403
We've got to get back
to, er...

253
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:05,638
Paris.

254
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,939
Paris by tonight,
so come on, get a move.

255
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:09,441
I got as far as
the sideboard, sir.

256
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,710
Hey, stop them!
stop them!

257
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,879
No news on the canal,
I'm afraid, sir

258
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,347
But apparently in india

259
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,550
They're thinking of
building a railway

260
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,318
Between the towns
of lahore...

261
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:20,619
Will louis xiv get away

262
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,721
With the montgolfiers'
precious plans?

263
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,089
Is 16 years of work

264
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,292
To be stolen
by this suspect sovereign?

265
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,861
Is france really in the grip
of a glaswegian monarch?

266
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,664
Watch next week's episode of
the golden age of ballooning.

267
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,166
Now...

268
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,108
So now that the government
has collapsed

269
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,610
And shown itself incapable

270
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,812
Of providing any kind
of unifying force

271
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,315
I feel that we do need
the kind of stability

272
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,583
And the breathing space

273
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,785
That a military presence
would provide.

274
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,286
Lord interest.

275
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,388
Yes, I agree the army should
take over

276
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,657
But I think it should not
interfere with the program

277
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,825
Of street executions

278
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,527
Which I feel have been
the shot in the arm

279
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,596
That the british economy
so desperately needed.

280
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,233
Yes, the montgolfier brothers'
plans did indeed turn up

281
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,102
Six months later,
and a long way from paris

282
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,273
At the court of
king george iii of england.

283
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,575
"titty was very worried.

284
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,611
"where could mary be?

285
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,513
"he looked everywhere--

286
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,282
"under the stones
and behind the bushes.

287
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,619
"and mr. squirrel helped him
by looking up in the trees.

288
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:31,957
And mr. badger helped him
by looking under the ground..."

289
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,193
And so, your majesty,
we the commons

290
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,629
Do herein crave
and beseech that...

291
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,632
Your majesty,
louis xviii is here.

292
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,368
Who is louis xviii?

293
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,069
He's the king of france,
your majesty.

294
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,871
And this is a great moment
to have, sir.

295
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,941
There is no louis xviii.

296
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,377
Psst.

297
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:56,649
...tell him
it's louis xvii.

298
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,984
He craves your majesty's pardon.

299
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,254
He has had a long journey here
and miscounted.

300
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,423
He is louis xvii.

301
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:08,527
Louis xvi is
dead already?

302
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,047
Your majesty,
I'm louis xvi.

303
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,048
Oh, christ.

304
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,416
Your majesty, I'm louis xvi

305
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,484
As you so rightly say

306
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,052
And I don't want
to muck about.

307
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,386
I've got a wee proposition

308
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,255
Which could make
the name of george iv

309
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,723
The most respected
in europe.

310
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,458
George iii.

311
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,726
George iii, sorry.

312
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,994
Where can we talk?

313
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,064
Did you see that?

314
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,966
We shall have a state banquet
at st. james's palace.

315
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,100
No, I don't want
to hang about.

316
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,235
Take it or leave it,
you know.

317
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,402
I've got to get back to, er...

318
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,470
Paris.

319
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,972
Paris by tonight,
you know.

320
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,507
Must you leave us,
louis?

321
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,543
I'd rather just sell the plans
and nip off, georgie boy.

322
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,279
Well, all right,
we shall buy the plans

323
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,114
If you will undertake

324
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,683
To disengage your troops
in america.

325
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,519
Do what?

326
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:11,357
And I shall give you funt 10,000
for the plans.

327
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,526
funt10,000!

328
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,693
Right, all right.

329
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,928
We'll disengage the, um...

330
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,096
You know, what you said.

331
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,230
We'll disengage 'em.

332
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,365
I'll tell you what, hen.

333
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,799
I'll put a duke
onto it, okay?

334
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,202
Right.

335
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,337
That's the worst thing
you can do to anybody.

336
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,505
You asked for it, sonny.

337
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,240
You could have broke
my bloody nose.

338
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,241
I'll break your...

339
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,276
North! please!

340
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,343
You saw it.

341
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,711
It was right
on the bone.

342
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,114
North, will you send
for the duke of portland?

343
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,149
We have a financial matter
to discuss.

344
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,317
Well, it
really hurt.

345
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,685
No, look here,
I think it's better

346
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,986
If you give the money to us

347
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,288
You know, we're going back.

348
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,389
We've got a bag.

349
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,557
No, don't
worry, louis.

350
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,359
We shall talk
to your monsieur necker.

351
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,361
Well, actually, we'd rather
you didn't, you know.

352
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,697
We've been having a wee bit
of trouble with him recently

353
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,798
You know what I mean?

354
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,099
Monsieur necker?

355
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,469
The man who introduced
so many valuable reforms

356
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,370
And proved
so popular

357
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,638
Despite his opposition

358
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,041
To mirabeau's policy
of issuing "assignats"?

359
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,409
Aye, yeah.

360
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,045
But the trouble is, he's been
drinking a bit recently.

361
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,980
You know, 14 lagers
wi' his breakfast

362
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,215
That sort of thing.

363
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,483
Well, very
well, louis.

364
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,052
Just a moment!

365
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,019
Oh, christ!

366
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,554
What are you doing?

367
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,323
I am joseph montgolfier

368
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,391
The inventor
of the fire balloon.

369
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,826
The man before you

370
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,228
Is an impostor.

371
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,896
Oh, no, I am not, honestly.

372
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,865
No, no, no, not you,
your majesty.

373
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,399
This man.

374
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,368
This louis the so-called
king of france man.

375
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,337
What number did he give you
this time?

376
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,638
Louis xxiii?

377
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,772
I got it right.

378
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,541
Yeah, I bet you took
a few guesses.

379
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,209
Listen, you spotty
sassenach pillock.

380
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,179
Your majesty,
the ronettes are here.

381
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,213
And mr. bartlett.

382
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,215
George iii

383
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,216
Oh, yeah!

384
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,218
George iii

385
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,120
George iii

386
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,156
George iii

387
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,424
George iii

388
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,660
George iii...

389
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:59,131
Oh, dear, I'm not supposed
to go mad until 1800.

390
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,966
George iii

391
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,935
George iii

392
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,004
George iii

393
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,406
George iii

394
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,642
George iii

395
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,410
George iii...

396
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,513
Joseph has been gone
for six months now.

397
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,315
We have
heard nothing.

398
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,184
He can look
after himself.

399
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,287
Oh, but he had only
on a towel, you know.

400
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,522
Antoinette

401
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:27,693
From now on, there is only
one montgolfier brother.

402
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,261
But louis xiv has the plans.

403
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,530
Oh, you must wait
until joseph returns.

404
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,932
The plans are here, cherie.

405
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,767
Let me put my tongue
in your mouth.

406
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,001
What do you mean?

407
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,304
Well, we're supposed
to be french, aren't we?

408
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,572
No, no, no.

409
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,873
I mean,
what are the plans

410
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,374
Which joseph after
is chasing?

411
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,310
Please, let me put it
in a little way.

412
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,478
Oh, jacques, ze plans!

413
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,279
I take it out
if you don't like it.

414
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,614
Are you sure

415
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,116
The claret was on the left of
the sideboard, sir?

416
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,486
Yes, o'toole, it's
always been there.

417
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,187
Well, I'll look
for one more month, sir.

418
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,555
Please let me
put it...

419
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,291
By the way, sir, mr. bartlett
has gone, sir.

420
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,861
He said he couldn't
wait any longer.

421
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,362
Thank you,
o'toole.

422
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,664
Not at all, sir,
I've enjoyed being in it.

423
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,233
Right.

424
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:11,504
Thank you, sir...
mam'selle.

425
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,749
By the way, sir

426
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:27,953
Mr. bartlett
has gone, sir.

427
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:36,862
He said he couldn't
wait any longer, sir.

428
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,066
Thank you,
o'toole.

429
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,134
Not at all, sir.

430
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,704
I've enjoyed
being in it.

431
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:46,705
Right.

432
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,810
Thank you, sir...
mam'selle.

433
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,213
More! more! more!

434
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,127

and composed by neil innes.

435
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,963
He is available from the bbc

436
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,699
Price four pounds or
eight months' imprisonment.

437
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,236
That was episode three of
the golden age of ballooning.

438
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,805
May I remind you
that there's still time

439
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,041
To get your golden age
of ballooning suppositories

440
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,745
Direct from the bbc, price
4.50 or 19 for a set of six.

441
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,449
Well, in a moment, the bbc will
be closing down for the night.

442
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,051
But first, here is
a party political broadcast

443
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,723
On behalf of
the norwegian party.

444
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,333

Whose name sounds
remarkably like "norway";

453
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,020
Mr. brian waynor, whose name
is an anagram of "norway";

454
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,957
Mr. and mrs. ford,

Of which
there are a lot in norway;

00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,263
Ron and christine boslo...

457

Ferdinand von zeppelin was born
in constance in 1838

458
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,409
The brother of barry zeppelin

459
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:43,215
The least talented
of the 14 zeppelin brothers.

460
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,442
Meanwhile, for
ferdinand von zeppelin

461
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:48,347
The year 1908 was
a year of triumph.

462
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,016
Herr zeppelin,
it's vonderful!

463
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,452
It's put ballooning
right back on ze map.

464
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,387
It's not a balloon,
do you hear?!

465
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,456
It's not a balloon,
it's an airship!

466
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,693
An airship, do you hear?

467
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,761
Well, it's
very nice, anyway.

468
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,763
Tell me, what is

469
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,832
The principle
of these balloons?

470
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,134
It's not a balloon

471
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,603
You stupid,
thick-headed saxon git!

472
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,004
It's not a balloon!

473
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,973
Balloons is for
kiddy-winkies.

474
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:19,778
If you want to play with
balloons, get outside.

475
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,649

A type of thick pancake, eaten

477
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,797
I hear you are to name
the balloon after bismarck.

478
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,834
"bismarck"? of course I'm not
calling it after bismarck.

479
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,435
It's a "zeppelin."

480
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,071
It's nothing to do
with bloody bismarck!

481
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,807
Surely he gave you
some money for it?

482
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,810
Get outside!

483
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,580

485
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,828
Ferdinand, that was
a minister of state

486
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,763
You just threw out
of the balloon.

487

It's not
a balloon!

00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,200
It's an airship!

489
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,367
All right, I'm sorry.

490
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,369
All right, go

00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,062
Oh, look, it's the chancellor!

What? prince von bulow? here?

501
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,233
Ja!

Coming here?

503
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,537
No, he is here.

504
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,139
Oh, I must go and
put my old uniform on.

505
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,908
He won't
notice, helmut.

506
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,109
He's dead.

507
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,510
Dead?

508
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,711
Here?

509
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,014
Ja, in our sitting room.

00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,616
This is our sitting room, dear.

511
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,051
Ja, well, you know what I mean.

512
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,986
The drawing room.

513
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,988
Ja, well, it's
a kind of sitting room.

514
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,690
Well...

515
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,126
Look!

516
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,829

00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:50,963
Here, look!

518
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,231

And hollweg

00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,310
That is

525
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,812
Das ist graunberg.

526
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,547
Das ist moltke.

527
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:10,483
Oh, ja!

He's a lot older
than I thought.

529
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,088
He's a
clever man, ja.

What shall
we do, helmut?

00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,166
We must ring the government.

534
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,936
This is the
government, helmut.

535
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,538
Oh, dear!

536
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:37,143
It is a great honor to have so
many members of the government

537
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,345
Dead in our sitting room.

538
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,513
Drawing room.

539
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:42,181
Ja, well...

540
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,150
No members of the government
are dead in our sitting room.

541
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,684
Ja, you know what I mean.

542
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:48,287
Well...

543
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,125
Perhaps I should make

544
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,528
A little speech,
or something.

545
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,129
No, not a speech,
helmut, no.

546
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,098
Shall we make them
a cup of tea?

547
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,766
It would be
a waste of tea.

548
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,934
But we must
do something.

549
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,336
So many important people
in our drawing room--

550
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,305
We must do something!

551
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,641
We could sort
them out.

552
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,042
And make a little list.

553
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,544
Ja, ja, ja.

554
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,046
Good, we could put the ministers
for internal affairs

555
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,414
Over against the wall

556
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,917
And for those for internal,
here by the clock.

557
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,418
And we can sort them out
alphabetically?

558
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,553
Nein, nein, nein.

559
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:25,257
We just put the cleanest
by the door.

560
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,260
Here we are.

561
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,763
No, no, no, that is...
that's von bulow.

562
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,131
He must go over here.

563
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,699
But that is
my reading chair.

564
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,202
He is the reich chancellor
of germany, helmut.

565
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,269
All right, all right

566
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,071
But I think he would
have been better

567
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,606
Up against
the clock, you know.

568
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,475
No, he would not look
nice under the clock.

569
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,009
I did not say
under the clock

570
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,311
I said against
the clock.

571
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,079
Well, then we could not
see the clock!

572
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,114
We put the minister for
the colonies under the clock.

573
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,349
He's small.

574
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,917
No, the colonies are
internal affairs.

575
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,118
He must go against the wall!

576
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,987
Education.

577
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,256
Ah!

578
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,991
Soon we'll be able
to make a list.

579
00:25:59,024 --> 00:25:59,992
Oh, ja, ja.

580
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:00,960
Wait a minute.

581
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,194
Who's that by
the cat litter?

582
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,262
I don't know!

583
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,497
I've never seen
him before!

584
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,665
He is not a member of
the government.

585
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:07,833
Get him out of here.

586
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,502
Put him in the drawing room.

587
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,304
He's in the drawing room,
my dear.

588
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:13,439
Ja, well, you know what I mean.

589
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,907
Put him in the sitting room.

590
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,542
You can put him
in the sitting room

591
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,010
If he's in
the drawing room.

592
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,646
Count ferdinand
von zeppelin's behavior

593
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,047
On that flight in 1900

594
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,617
Had incredible,
far-reaching consequences

595
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,118
For one of
the fallen ministers--

596
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,753
The talented herr von maintlitz

597
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,389
Architect of the new german
expansionist farm policy--

598
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,460
Fell on top of an old lady in
nimwegen, killing her outright.

599
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,630
Her daughter, alice, suffered
severe cerebral damage

600
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:40,633
From the talented minister's
heavy briefcase

601
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:44,670
But was nursed back to life by
an english doctor, henderson.

602
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,172
Eventually, they married

603
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,574
And their eldest son,
george henderson

604
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,743
Was the father
of mike henderson

605
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,178
Producer and director

606
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:56,682
Ofthe golden age
of ballooning.

607
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:17,736
...mr. and mrs. rita trondheim;
reginald bo-sankway

608
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,406
Who would be next to norway
in a rhyming dictionary

609
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,841
If it included proper names

610
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:27,079
And if he pronounced his name
like that.
