1
00:00:01,236 --> 00:00:02,770
This is
captain macpherson

2
00:00:02,804 --> 00:00:05,440
Welcoming you aboard
east scottish airways.

3
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:06,975
You'll have had
your tea.

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,643
Our destination
is glasgow.

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:12,146
There is no need
to panic.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,048
There's a bomb
onboard this plane

7
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,683
And I'll tell you
where it is

8
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:18,653
For a thousand pounds.

9
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,154
I don't
believe you.

10
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,891
If you don't tell me
where the bomb is...

11
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:24,993
If I don't give you
the money...

12
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:26,895
Unless you give me
the bomb...

13
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:28,596
The money.

14
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,598
The money-- thank you,
pretty lady--

15
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:32,834
The bomb will explode,
killing everybody.

16
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:36,004
Including you.

17
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:39,674
I'll tell you where it is
for a pound.

18
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:40,842
All right,
here's a pound.

19
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,110
I don't want
scottish money.

20
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:43,211
They've got
the numbers.

21
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,212
It can be traced.

22
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,280
One english pound.

23
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,348
Now, where's
the bomb?

24
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:48,583
I can't remember.

25
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:49,751
You've forgotten?

26
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:51,786
Aye, you'd better have
your pound back.

27
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:52,854
Oh... fingerprints.

28
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:53,922
Now, where's
the bomb?

29
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,156
Wait a tick,
wait a tick.

30
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,860
My first is in glasgow,
but not in spain.

31
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,196
My second is in steamer,
but not in train.

32
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,065
My whole is in the luggage
compartment on the plane.

33
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,267
I'll tell you where
the bomb is for a pound.

34
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:07,902
It's in the luggage
compartment.

35
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:09,204
Right, here's your pound.

36
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,105
Is this character
giving you any trouble?

37
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:12,440
He's just ruined
this sketch.

38
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:13,608
Yes, absolutely.

39
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:14,909
Let's go on
to the next one.

40
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:16,010
Wait a tick,
wait a tick.

41
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:17,345
I won't ruin your
sketch for a pound.

42
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:18,346
No, no.

43
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,347
75p.

44
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,248
Next item.

45
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,051
Well, I see my role in it as...

46
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,221
Oh, how can I put it...
the nude man

47
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:30,859
As sort of symbolizing the two
separate strands of existence

48
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:33,228
The essential nudity of man...

49
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,997
Oh, um...

50
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:43,705
It's a very
interesting question.

51
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:45,673
Personally,
I rather adhere

52
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:48,176
To the bergsonian idea
of laughter

53
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,144
As a social sanction

54
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:52,747
Against inflexible
behavior, but...

55
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,082
Excuse me.

56
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,483
And now...

57
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:58,086
It's...

58
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,231
Monty python's flying circuses.

59
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,667
Well, we'll be continuing

60
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,869
With monty python's
flying circus

61
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,637
In just a moment.

62
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:52,373
Yes, yes, we're going back
to the show

63
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:56,477
In just one moment from...

64
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,080
Now.

65
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,749
This new housing development
in bristol is

66
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:04,018
One of the most interesting
in the country.

67
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,120
It's using a variety
of new techniques--

68
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:07,722
Shockproof curtain walling

69
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:10,658
A central high-voltage, self-
generating electricity source

70
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,827
And extruded acrylic
fiberglass fitments.

71
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:15,964
It's also the first major
housing project in britain

72
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,765
To be built entirely

73
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,735
By characters by 19th-century
english literature.

74
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:24,005
Here, little nell from dickens'
old curiosity shop

75
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,542
Fits new nylon siphons
into the asbestos-lined ceiling.

76
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,377
But it's the electrical system

77
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,713
Which has attracted
the most attention.

78
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:34,949
Arthur huntington, who helen
graham married as a young girl

79
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,484
And whose shameless conduct

80
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:39,220
Eventually drove her back
to her brother, lawrence

81
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:41,723
In anne bronte's
the tenant of wildfell hall

82
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,191
Describes why it's unique.

83
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,760
Because, sir,
it is self-generating.

84
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,863
Because we have harnessed here,
in this box

85
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:51,132
The very forces of life itself

86
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:54,702
The very forces that will
send helen running back

87
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,704
To beg forgiveness.

88
00:03:56,738 --> 00:04:00,108
The on-site building techniques
involve the construction

89
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,609
Of 12-foot walling blocks

90
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:04,245
By a crowd of farmhands
from tess of the d'urbervilles

91
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,548
Supervised by the genial
landlady, mrs. jupp

92
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,583
From samuel butler's
way of all flesh.

93
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:12,554
In contrast to the site
in bristol is progress here

94
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:15,690
On britain's first
18-level motorway interchange

95
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:21,396
Being built by characters
from milton's paradise lost.

96
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,897
What went wrong here?

97
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,133
Well, nobody really got on.

98
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,735
Satan didn't get on with eve...

99
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:30,638
Uh... archangel gabriel
didn't get on with satan.

100
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:32,540
Nobody got on with the serpent.

101
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:34,475
So now they have
to work a rota--

102
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,578
Forces of good
from 10:00 till 3:00

103
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,513
Forces of evil, 3:00 till 6:00.

104
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:42,050
But even more modern building
techniques are being used

105
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,719
On an expanding new town site
near peterborough.

106
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,621
Here, the amazing mystico
and janet

107
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:53,294
Can put up a block of flats
by hypnosis in under a minute.

108
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,967
The local council here have

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,237
Over 50 hypnosis-induced
25-story blocks

110
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,772
Put up by el mystico and janet.

111
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,942
I asked mr. ken verybigliar
the advantages of hypnosis

112
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:10,011
Compared to
other building methods.

113
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:13,381
Oh, there is a considerable
financial advantage

114
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,950
In using the services
of el mystico.

115
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,753
A block, like mystico point here

116
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:22,957
Would normally cost
in the region of (funt)1.5 million.

117
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:25,026
But this was put up
for five pounds

118
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,828
And 30 bob for janet.

119
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:29,964
But the obvious question is,
are they safe?

120
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,332
Of course they're safe.

121
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,535
There's absolutely no doubt
about that.

122
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:35,570
They're as strong,
solid and as safe

123
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:38,106
As any other building method
in this country

124
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,441
Provided, of course,
people believe in them.

125
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:44,078
Yes, we received a note
from the council

126
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:47,015
Saying that if we ceased
to believe in this building

127
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:48,383
It would fall down.

128
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,784
You don't mind living

129
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,020
In a figment of
another man's imagination?

130
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,589
No, it's much better
than where we used to live.

131
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,024
Where did you
used to live?

132
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,259
We had an 18-room villa
overlooking nice.

133
00:05:58,293 --> 00:05:59,961
Really? that sounds much better.

134
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:03,831
Oh, yeah, you're right.

135
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:07,836
Oh, no, no, no!

136
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,338
Of course not.

137
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,042
Phew! that was close.

138
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,879
But the construction of these
vast new housing developments

139
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:20,114
Providing homes
for many thousands of people

140
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:23,384
Is not the only project to which
he has applied his many talents.

141
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,286
He also has
an infallible pools method

142
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,856
A school of spanish dancing
and a car hire service.

143
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,457
What's the driving force

144
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,627
Behind a man of such restless
energies and boundless vision?

145
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,863
Here, as with so many
great men of history

146
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,364
The answer lies in a woman.

147
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,399
As antony has his cleopatra...

148
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:41,536
As napoleon has his josephine...

149
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,738
So mystico has his janet.

150
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:46,307
Yes, janet, a quiet, shy girl

151
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,710
An honors graduate
from harvard university

152
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:51,045
American junior sprint
record holder

153
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,282
Ex-world skating champion,
nobel prize winner

154
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:57,619
Architect, novelist and surgeon.

155
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:00,855
The girl who helped crack
the oppenheimer spy ring in 1947

156
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,457
She gave vital evidence

157
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,859
To the senate
narcotics commission in 1958.

158
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:08,796
She also helped to convict the
woman at the chemist's in 1961

159
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,533
And a year later,
she gave police information

160
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,902
Which led to the arrest
of her postman.

161
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,670
In october of that same year

162
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,640
She secured the conviction
of her gardener for bigamy

163
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:20,108
And three months later

164
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:23,278
Personally led the police swoop
on the couple next door.

165
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:26,381
In 1967, she became suspicious
of the man at the garage

166
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:28,216
And it was
her dogged perseverance

167
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,817
And relentless inquiries

168
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:32,954
That, two years later,
finally secured his conviction

169
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:35,523
For not having a license
for his car radio.

170
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:38,326
He was hanged at leeds
a year later

171
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,295
Despite the abolition
of capital punishment

172
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:41,663
And the public outcry.

173
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:44,999
Also in leeds that year,
a local butcher was hanged

174
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,402
For defaulting
on mortgage repayments

175
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,037
And a mr. jarvis
was electrocuted

176
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,638
For shouting in the corridor.

177
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:53,508
We admit there have been
outbreaks of hanging recently

178
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,876
But the police are trying

179
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,778
To keep the situation
under control.

180
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,781
You must remember the courts are
very busy at the moment

181
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:04,786
And the odd death sentence
is bound to slip through.

182
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,088
Electrocutions are
another big worry

183
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:10,225
But we hope that guillotining
has been eradicated

184
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:11,826
From the urban areas

185
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,129
And garroting is confined
almost entirely to luton.

186
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:17,332
So if you have a friend
in prison

187
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:19,133
Or under sentence of death

188
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:24,272
Be sure to let us know
at this address.

189
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,277
...and premier chou en-lai

190
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,179
who called it
"a major breakthrough."

191
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:32,947
Twelve men were
accidentally hanged

192
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,649
at whitby assizes this afternoon

193
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,317
whilst considering
their verdict.

194
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,786
This is one of the worst
miscarriages of justice

195
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,824
in britain since tuesday.

196
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:45,793
Well, it's 13 minutes to
the hour of nine, nine, nine

197
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:47,495
here on wonderful
radio one-one-one

198
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,731
so if you're still lying
in your big, big bed

199
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,432
now's the time to get up
out of it.

200
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,568
We've got another 13 hours
of tiptop sounds

201
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,971
here on wonderful radio one.

202
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:57,972
Oh, sorry about that.

203
00:08:58,006 --> 00:08:59,307
So unless you have brain cells

204
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,176
or have completed the process
of evolution

205
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,511
there's a wonderful day ah...

206
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,747
Must be
on radio four.

207
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,782
Radio two...

208
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,185
Radio three...

209
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:11,619
Radio four.

210
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,255
It's 9:00 and time
for mortuary hour--

211
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:16,925
an hour of talks, tunes
and downright tomfoolery

212
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,927
for all those who work
in mortuaries

213
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,998
introduced as usual
by shirley bassey.

214
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:27,569
Well, we're going to kick
straight off this week

215
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:31,039
with our mortuary quiz, so have
your pens and pencils ready.

216
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,541
Turn that radio off
and look lively.

217
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:35,577
It's mortuary hour,
mr. wang.

218
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,178
Don't argue,
battersby.

219
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:40,715
This is our mortuary
in here, your grace.

220
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,050
I say, I say, i, uh...

221
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,552
I, uh...

222
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:47,956
I, uh... i, uh...

223
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:55,263
I, i, i, uh... i, uh...

224
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,234
I, uh...

225
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,736
I... i... i...

226
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,705
I can't think of anything
to say about it.

227
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:05,540
Well, we're very proud
of it here, sir.

228
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:07,709
It's one of the most up-to-date
in the country.

229
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:09,744
I see, yes, yes, yes.

230
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:13,548
Now, um... what are...

231
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,750
Oh, uh...

232
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:19,153
What are... uh...

233
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:24,792
What are... what...

234
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,295
What are... what is it?

235
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:30,164
Is it a power station?

236
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:31,766
No, your grace, it's a mortuary.

237
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,668
I see, I see,
good, good, good, good.

238
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,036
Well, it has

239
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,272
One of the most advanced
thermostat control systems

240
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:38,673
In the country

241
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,642
And it has computer control
storage facilities.

242
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:42,944
I see, I see.

243
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,779
I, um...

244
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:47,282
I, uh...

245
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,951
Oh, i...

246
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:54,122
I, uh...

247
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,027
I, uh... i...

248
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,797
I'm a good
little doggie.

249
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,865
I'm sorry, your grace?

250
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:04,966
I'm a good little dog.

251
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,634
Oh, dear.

252
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,269
Perhaps we should
postpone the visit.

253
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:09,470
Oh, no, no, no.

254
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:13,174
You see, it's just that
his brain is so tiny

255
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,477
The slightest movement
can dislodge it.

256
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:17,979
Your grace?

257
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:18,980
Your grace?

258
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:19,981
Oh, dear,
it's rather

259
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,482
Like one of those
games you play

260
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,418
Where you have to get the ball
into the hole...

261
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:24,752
Ah!

262
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:28,656
Excellent, excellent,
excellent, excellent.

263
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,360
Now then, uh... uh...

264
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:36,764
What happens when the steel
is poured into the ingots?

265
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:40,001
Perhaps we should go and have
a look at the new showers.

266
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,336
Yes, yes, yes, rather.

267
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,704
Yes, yes, yes, jolly good.

268
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:43,938
Jolly good, jolly good.

269
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:47,575
Jolly good, no fear.

270
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,679
Well, the answers were
as follows:

271
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:53,681
number one, the left hand;

272
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:57,018
two, no; three, normal;
four, yes, it has, in 1963

273
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,721
when a bird got caught
in the mechanism.

274
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,356
Turn that thing off.

275
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,858
It's "mortuary dance
time," mr. wang.

276
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:05,293
Never mind that, battersby.

277
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:06,861
This is the big one.

278
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:09,797
I've just had whitby police
on the phone with 12 hangees.

279
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:11,366
Oh, yeah, we just heard about
that on the radios.

280
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,703
No, these are 12 different ones,
so shtoom.

281
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:19,040
I'll not interrupt
this sketch for a pound.

282
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,074
What?

283
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,409
For one pound

284
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,545
I'll leave the sketch
totally uninterrupted.

285
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:24,546
50p?

286
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:27,949
I'm prepared to negotiate
a 40p deal.

287
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:30,952
For 35p, I won't interrupt
any of the next three items.

288
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:31,953
No, it's no good.

289
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:32,954
25p?

290
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,055
No.

291
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,223
10p and a kiss.

292
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:36,858
You see, it's very simple--

293
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:38,393
I just take these cutout figures

294
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:39,827
And by putting them together...

295
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:40,828
What?

296
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:41,896
Oh, you mean we're on.

297
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,399
Sorry.

298
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,702
Hmm?

299
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:57,045
Wait, nigel.

300
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:59,447
I've got this strange feeling
we're being watched.

301
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,282
Oh, my god, rose,
it's the police.

302
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:04,185
Run for it!

303
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,562
Oh, lunch break.

304
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,018
Gott in himmel!

305
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:40,021
It's coming!

306
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:49,731
Meanwhile, 55 years later
back in london...

307
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,035
Hello, good afternoon

308
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:57,438
And welcome to the second leg
of the olympic final

309
00:13:57,472 --> 00:13:59,240
Of the men's hide-and-seek

310
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:01,809
Here in the heart
of britain's london.

311
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:04,879
We'll be starting in just
a couple of moments from now

312
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:07,315
And there you can see
the two competitors--

313
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:09,050
Francisco huron,
the paraguayan

314
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,885
Who, in this leg, is the seeker

315
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,154
And there's the man
he'll be looking for

316
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:16,324
Our own don roberts
from hinckley in leicestershire

317
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,226
Who, his trainer tells me

318
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,995
Is at the height
of his self-secreting form.

319
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,599
Now, in the first leg,
which ended on wednesday

320
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:27,602
Don succeeded in finding
the paraguayan

321
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,838
In the new world record time

322
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:32,807
Of 11 years, two months, 26 days

323
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:36,344
Nine hours, three minutes,
27.4 seconds

324
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,646
In a sweet shop in kilmarnock.

325
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,616
And now they're
under starter's orders.

326
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,418
On your marks...

327
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:46,187
Get set...

328
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,723
Uno, dos, tres,
cuatro, quince

329
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:51,292
Seis, siete, ocho,
nueve, diez...

330
00:14:51,326 --> 00:14:55,430
Once, doce, trece,
catorce, quince

331
00:14:55,463 --> 00:15:00,168
Diez y seis, diez
y siete, diez...

332
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:16,451
Veintidos, veintitres,
veinticuatro, veinticinco...

333
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,568
...treinta y seis,
treinta y siete, treinta y ocho

334
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:34,969
Treinta y nueve...

335
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,405
Well, don's off to
a really great start there.

336
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,374
Remember, the paraguayan has got

337
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:42,177
11 years, two months,
26 days, nine hours

338
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,914
Three minutes,
27.4 seconds to beat.

339
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:49,284
... y ocho, novecientos
noventa y nueve...

340
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,618
Mil.

341
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:53,221
Coming!

342
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:17,872
Well, we'll be taking
you back there

343
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:21,843
As soon as there are
any developments.

344
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,112
We've just heard
that something is happening

345
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:30,118
In the hide-and-seek final,
so let's go straight over there.

346
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:32,253
Hello again,
and welcome to madagascar

347
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:35,156
Where francisco huron
is seeking don roberts.

348
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,558
And I've just been told

349
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:42,430
That he's been unofficially
described as "cold."

350
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,436
Ah, wait a minute.

351
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,706
I've just been told

352
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:54,475
That huron has requested
a plane ticket to budapest

353
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,277
So he's definitely
getting warmer.

354
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,980
So we'll be back again
in just a few years.

355
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:03,484
Really beginning to hot up now.

356
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:05,486
Well, here we are

357
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,722
On the very last day
of this fantastic final.

358
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,557
Huron now has less
than 12 hours left

359
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,192
To find british ace don roberts.

360
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:14,362
Early this morning, he finished
combing the outskirts of lisbon

361
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:16,464
And now he seems
to have staked everything

362
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:20,235
On one final desperate seek
here in the tagus valley.

363
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:22,270
But roberts is
over 1,500 miles away

364
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:25,373
And it's beginning to look
all over, bar the shouting.

365
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:28,376
The sands of time are running
out for this delving dago

366
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:31,746
This senor of seek,
this perspicacious paraguayan.

367
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,414
He's still desperately cold

368
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:40,021
And it's beginning to look
like another gold for britain.

369
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,080
Prego! prego,
signore!

370
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:40,348
There he is!

371
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:43,184
All right.

372
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:48,556
The official result of
the world hide-and-seek.

373
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,393
Mr. don roberts, from
hinckley, leicestershire:

374
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:57,699
11 years, two months,
26 days, nine hours

375
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,371
Three minutes,
27 seconds.

376
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:07,509
Mr. francisco huron,
paraguay:

377
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:12,814
11 years, two months,
26 days, nine hours

378
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:17,218
Three minutes,
27 seconds.

379
00:20:17,252 --> 00:20:19,888
The result-- a tie.

380
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:22,423
A tie-- what a fantastic result!

381
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:28,363
Well, the replay will start
tomorrow at 7:30 a.m.

382
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:35,904
Well, hello again.

383
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,071
Nice to be back.

384
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:38,806
Glad to see the show's
been going well.

385
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,209
Well, now,
sorry about mon-trerx.

386
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,212
That was a little item
entitled "hide-and-seek."

387
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:47,048
Very anarchic, very effective,
not quite my cup of tea

388
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,184
But very nice
for the younger people.

389
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:52,353
Well, the next item the boys
have put together takes place

390
00:20:52,387 --> 00:20:53,888
In a sitting room.

391
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:57,425
Sorry it's just a sitting room,
but the bank account's a bit low

392
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:03,498
After the appallingly expensive
production of clochmerle.

393
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:05,433
This is a totally
free interruption

394
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:10,672
And no money has
changed hands whatever.

395
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:33,528
Sorry about that, darling.

396
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:34,529
Gravy?

397
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:37,632
Yes, please, dear.

398
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:38,666
Oh, dear, that'll be

399
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,271
The cheap-laughs
from next door.

400
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:49,878
Come in.

401
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:54,082
No! just
breathing heavily!

402
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:58,186
Oh, we just dropped in.

403
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:02,390
Would you like
to come through?

404
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:05,059
Oh, yes.

405
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:18,306
Well, good night
and give us a kiss.

406
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,441
Oh, thank you very much
for a very nice evening.

407
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:21,476
After you, dear.

408
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:22,477
Right-o!

409
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,478
Whoa!

410
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:25,914
Whoa!

411
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:44,999
Oh, honestly, dear, why do we
always have to buy everything

412
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:49,637
Just because
the cheap-laughs have one?

413
00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:52,807
This is not
an interruption at all.

414
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:55,643
It's just neighborliness,
dear, that's all.

415
00:22:55,677 --> 00:23:00,849
Well, I think we should try and
lead our own lives from now on.

416
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:02,350
Ooh!

417
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:07,655
Can't you be serious
for just one moment?

418
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,599
Darling, I'm sorry
I was cross earlier.

419
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:19,300
Oh, that's
all right, dear.

420
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:20,768
It's just that
I get so sick

421
00:23:20,802 --> 00:23:23,204
Of always having to be
like the cheap-laughs.

422
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:25,640
Yes, well, from now on
we'll be like ourselves.

423
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:26,908
Oh, roger!

424
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:29,978
Oh, beatrice!

425
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,550
Many people in this country are
becoming increasingly worried

426
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,985
About bullfighting.

427
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:39,454
They say it's not only cruel,
vicious and immoral

428
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:40,989
But also blatantly unfair.

429
00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:44,025
The bull is heavy, violent,
abusive and aggressive

430
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:45,994
With four legs
and great sharp teeth

431
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:49,564
Whereas the bullfighter is
only a small, greasy spaniard.

432
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:51,699
Given this basic inequality

433
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:54,135
What can be done to make
bullfighting safer?

434
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:56,471
We asked brigadier
arthur farquar-smith

435
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:59,174
Chairman of the british
well-basically club.

436
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:00,942
Well, basically,
it's quite apparent

437
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:03,778
That these minuscule dago
chappies have got it all wrong.

438
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:05,113
They prance round the bull

439
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:07,015
Like a lot of
bally nightclub dancers

440
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:08,917
Looking like
the younger generation

441
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,253
Or a less smooth version
of the lionel blair troupe

442
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:13,888
With much of
the staccato rhythms

443
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:16,858
Of the irving davies dancers
at the height of their success.

444
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:18,126
In recent years

445
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,728
Pan's people have often
recaptured a lyricism...

446
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:22,430
And what we must do now

447
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,232
Is to use devices like radar
to locate the bull

448
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:26,401
And sam missiles fired
from underground silos

449
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:27,802
To knock the bull over.

450
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:29,871
Then I would send in
scottish boys with air cover

451
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:31,472
To provide a diversion
for the bull

452
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:34,142
Whilst the navy came in round
the back and finished him off.

453
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:35,710
That to me would be
bullfighting

454
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:38,446
And not this pansy kind of
lyrical, evocative movement

455
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:41,683
Which george balanchine
and martha graham in the states

456
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:43,585
And our very own
sadler's wells...

457
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:45,954
Troops could be used
in an auxiliary role

458
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:47,188
In international chess, where...

459
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:48,690
What?

460
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:51,926
I'll put the lights
on again for a pound.

461
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,595
I'm sorry about
this interruption

462
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:55,230
But we'll soon put things right

463
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:59,367
With just a simple
little push of a button.

464
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,368
Oh, ow!

465
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:01,703
Help! oh, no!

466
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:02,704
Oh! oh, dear!

467
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:03,705
That's okay...

468
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:04,839
No, no, please.

469
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:06,441
Oh, oh-oh! wow!

470
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:08,776
Oh! no, no, no!

471
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,811
Oh, oh, dear!

472
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:12,413
Ow! oh!

473
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:22,423
"extra" holt mehr schmutz
aus ihrer waesche.

474
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:25,827
Sehen sie selbst.

475
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:54,722
What?

476
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:56,624
I'm very sorry, but I don't know

477
00:25:56,658 --> 00:25:58,960
Why I've been included
in zis cartoon.

478
00:25:58,993 --> 00:26:00,228
That's a bloody lie!

479
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:02,297
It's quite obvious
what's going on here.

480
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,201
This whole thing is loaded
with political significance.

481
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:08,503
I was right.

482
00:26:08,536 --> 00:26:11,239
This is the planet algon

483
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:14,509
Fifth world
in the system of aldebaran

484
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:18,179
The red giant in the
constellation of sagittarius.

485
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:23,384
Here an ordinary cup of drinking
chocolate costs funt4 million.

486
00:26:23,418 --> 00:26:25,954
An immersion heater
for the hot-water tank costs

487
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:27,589
Over funt6 billion

488
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:30,491
And a pair
of split-crotch panties

489
00:26:30,525 --> 00:26:32,827
Would be almost unobtainable.

490
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:36,264
A simple rear-window
demisting device for an 1100

491
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:39,601
Costs funt8,000 million billion

492
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,769
And a new element for
an electric kettle like this

493
00:26:41,803 --> 00:26:44,672
Would cost as much as the
entire gross national product

494
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:49,143
Of the united states of america
from 1770 to the year 2000

495
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:51,479
And even then, they
wouldn't be able to afford

496
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:56,551
The small fixing ring
which attaches it to the kettle.

497
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:58,453
Well, our computers
have been working all day

498
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:01,055
To try and analyze the dramatic
information that's coming in

499
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:03,224
From this first ever
intergalactic probe, algon i.

500
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:06,394
And we're just getting
an interesting development now

501
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:09,097
Which is that attachments
for rotary mowers--

502
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,233
That is, mowers that have
a central circular blade--

503
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,302
Are relatively inexpensive!

504
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:17,238
Still in the region of
nine to ten million pounds

505
00:27:17,272 --> 00:27:18,940
But it does seem to indicate

506
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:21,209
That algon might be
a very good planet

507
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:23,011
For those with larger gardens

508
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:25,713
Or perhaps even an orchard
that's been left for two years

509
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:27,515
Needs some heavy work,
some weeding.

510
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,785
But we're now getting some live
pictures through from algon!

511
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:33,321
Harry, perhaps you could
talk us through them.

512
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:35,657
Very little evidence of
shopping facilities here.

513
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,625
There don't seem to be
any large supermarkets.

514
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:39,627
There may be some
on-the-corner grocery stores

515
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:40,862
Behind those rocks

516
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:42,497
But it's difficult
to tell from this angle.

517
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,898
It does seem to suggest

518
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:46,801
That most of the shopping here
is by direct mail.

519
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,203
Well, of course

520
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:49,971
The big question
that everyone's asking here

521
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:52,574
Is what about those
split-crotch panties?

522
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:54,209
Are they going
to be unobtainable

523
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:56,778
Throughout the universe,
or merely on algon itself?

524
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:57,912
Professor?

525
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:00,081
We must remember

526
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:02,083
That algon is
over 75,000 miles wide.

527
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:04,152
The probe's come down
in this area here

528
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:06,020
And we're really
only getting signals

529
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:08,556
From a radius of 30
or 40 miles around the probe.

530
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,726
Split-crotch panties,
or indeed any items

531
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,764
Of what we scientists call "sexy
underwear" or "erotic lingerie"

532
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:19,767
May be much more plentiful
on other parts of the planet.

533
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,103
Professor, you were
responsible for finding

534
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:24,772
Scanty-panties and golden
goddess high-lift bras

535
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:27,976
On planets which weren't
thought able to sustain life.

536
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,211
And now that man has
discovered a new galaxy

537
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:31,813
Do you think we're
going to see

538
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:33,448
Underwear become
even naughtier?

539
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:34,816
Oh, naughtier
and naughtier.

540
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:36,885
Well, so much for that.

541
00:28:36,918 --> 00:28:39,220
But, of course, the probe
itself has excited

542
00:28:39,254 --> 00:28:40,655
A great deal of interest

543
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:43,424
For it contains uranium-based
dual transmission cells

544
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:45,393
Entirely recharged
by solar radiation

545
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:49,464
Which can take off a bra and
panties in less than 15 seconds.

546
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:52,500
It is, of course, the first
piece of space hardware

547
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,702
To be specially designed
to undress ladies

548
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:56,204
And so there are bound
to be some teething troubles

549
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:57,605
Such as how to cope

550
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:01,176
With the combination of
elastic-sided boots and tights.

551
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:04,712
But I think we're getting some
pictures now from algon itself

552
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,047
And it looks as though... yes!

553
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,849
The satellite has found a bird!

554
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:11,085
The probe has struck crumpet,
and she looks pretty good, too!

555
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,120
Professor?

556
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:13,521
Ja, she's a real honey!

557
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:15,723
Well, the pictures
are a bit sporadic.

558
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:17,525
I think probably
the solar radiation

559
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,993
During the long
journey to algon...

560
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:21,829
Hoy! look!

561
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,198
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

562
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:24,933
We've lost contact.

563
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:27,836
We'll try and reestablish
contact with algon...

564
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:33,474
Hello, the bbc have
offered me the sum of 40p

565
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:35,109
To read the credits
of this show.

566
00:29:35,143 --> 00:29:37,512
Personally, I thought
they should have held out

567
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:40,014
For the full 75, but
the bbc have explained to me

568
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:41,716
About their
financial difficulties

569
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:44,118
And, uh, I decided to accept
the reduced offer.

570
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:46,821
So, "the show was conceived,
written and performed

571
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:48,523
"by the usual lot.

572
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:49,924

00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:52,994

"for 92p and
a bottle of bells whisky.

583
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:17,151
It was a bbc colour production."

584
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:19,120
Uh, I think that's just it.

585
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:22,190
I'd like to say if there are
any bbc producers looking in

586
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:24,425
Who need people to read
the credits for them

587
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:27,262
I would personally...
