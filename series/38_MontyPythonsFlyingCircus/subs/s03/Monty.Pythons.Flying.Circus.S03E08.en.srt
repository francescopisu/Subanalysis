1
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,608
August 18-- fell off
near bovey tracey.

2
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,777
The pump caught
in my trouser leg.

3
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,512
My pump caught
in my trouser leg

4
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,480
And my sandwiches
were badly crushed.

5
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,515
35p, please.

6
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,783
These sandwiches,
however

7
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,284
Were an excellent
substitute.

8
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,485
Give us ten woods,
barney.

9
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,486
Hello.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,587
It's funny, isn't it

11
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,156
How one can
go through life--

12
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,724
As I have--
disliking bananas

13
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,426
And being indifferent
to cheese

14
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,327
But still be able
to eat and enjoy

15
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,463
A banana-and-cheese sandwich
like this.

16
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,431
35p.

17
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,765
Ah!

18
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,434
Oh, I have
only a 50.

19
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,002
Do you have change?

20
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,671
Well, I'll have to look, but
I may have to go to the bank.

21
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,341
I'm most awfully sorry.

22
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,241
15p.

23
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,110
Oh, what
a stroke of luck.

24
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,045
Well, all
the very best...

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,081
And thank you again

26
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:26,786
For the excellent banana-
and-cheese delicacy.

27
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:46,639
August 23-- fell off
near budleigh salterton.

28
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,377
...and the pump got caught
in my trouser leg...

29
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,179
And that's how
they were damaged.

30
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,748
The eggs-- you remember

31
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,751
The hard-boiled eggs
I was telling you about.

32
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,253
They were in
a tupperware container--

33
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,455
Reputedly self-sealing

34
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,758
Which fell open
upon contact

35
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,328
With the tar-macadam
surface of the road...

36
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:12,465
The b-489,
the dawlish road.

37
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,934
That shouldn't happen to a
self-sealing container

38
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,171
Now, should it?

39
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:23,843
What do you keep your
hard-boiled eggs in?

40
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,618
I think in future

41
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:37,424
I will lash them to the
handlebars with adhesive tape!

42
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:42,696
This should obviate a recurrence
of the same problem!

43
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:47,867
Well, I can't stand around here
chatting all day!

44
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,971
I'm on a cycling tour
of north cornwall!

45
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,974
Must be off!

46
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,288
August 26-- fell off
near ottery st. mary.

47
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,924
The pump caught
in my trouser leg.

48
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:16,329
Decide to wear short trousers
from now on.

49
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,073
Fell off near tiverton.

50
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:32,078
Perhaps a shorter pump
is the answer.

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,081
Excuse me, madam.

52
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,616
I wonder if
you could tell me

53
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,618
Of a good bicycle shop
in this village

54
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,953
Where I could
either find

55
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,788
A means of adapting
my present pump

56
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,257
Or, failing that,
of purchasing a replacement.

57
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,461
There's only
one shop here.

58
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,466
What a stroke of luck.

59
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,339
Now perhaps cycling
will become less precarious.

60
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,573
Yes?

61
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,676
Uh... a mr. pither
to see you, doctor.

62
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,911
His bicycle pump
got caught in his sock.

63
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,180
Oh, thank you, nurse,
show him in, please.

64
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,381
This way, please.

65
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,582
Good morning.

66
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,018
And a very good morning
to you, too, doctor.

67
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,486
I understand
you had an accident.

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,654
That's right,
my pump got...

69
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,555
Caught in your sock.

70
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,856
Absolutely, yes.

71
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,993
And my fruit cake was damaged
on one side.

72
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,394
It's got grit all over it.

73
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,163
Are you in pain?

74
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,564
Oh, heavens, no.

75
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,266
Ah, well, where
are you hurt?

76
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,568
Oh, fortunately, i
escaped without injury.

77
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,969
Well, what is
the trouble?

78
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:34,140
Please, could you tell me
the way to iddesleigh?

79
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,475
I'm a doctor, you know.

80
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,409
Oh, yes, absolutely.

81
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,677
Normally, I would have asked

82
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,412
A policeman or a minister
of the church

83
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,648
But finding no one available,
I thought it better

84
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,982
To consult
a professional man

85
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,551
Rather
than rely

86
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,021
On the possibly confused
testimony of a passerby.

87
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,323
Oh, all right.

88
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,591
Take this
to a chemist.

89
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,427
Thank you.

90
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,317
September 2...

91
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,222
Did not fall off
outside iddesleigh.

92
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,196
Fell off in tavistock.

93
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,334
My foot caught in my trouser leg
and that's how the bottle broke.

94
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,636
Tell her today--
you could ring her.

95
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,937
I can't,
I can't.

96
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,239
I said
you'd never guess.

97
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,774
16 years we've
been together.

98
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,108
I can't just
ring her up.

99
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,644
Well, if you can't do it now,
you never will.

100
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,879
Do you like tizer?

101
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,313
What?

102
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,782
Do you want me
or not, james?

103
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,216
It's your
decision.

104
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,886
I suppose it is still available
in this area, is it?

105
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,387
Do you want me
or not, james?

106
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,055
What?

107
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,156
A tizer!

108
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,290
Yes or no?

109
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,125
Is it still available
in this area?

110
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,226
I don't know.

111
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,194
I see--
in that case

112
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,629
It's good-bye
forever, james.

113
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,229
No!

114
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,097
I mean yes!

115
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,498
Oh, it is,
is it?

116
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,132
No!

117
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,233
Oh!

118
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,902
You never could make up
your mind.

119
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:09,903
I can.

120
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:10,904
Good-bye,
james.

121
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,604
I have.

122
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,006
No, wait, lucille!

123
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,141
Does your lovely little daughter
like tizer, eh?

124
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,343
Lucille!

125
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,345
Wouldn't mind buying her
a bottle of tizer...

126
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,414
If it's still available
in this area.

127
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,049
Would you like me
to show you the door?

128
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,651
Oh, that's
extremely kind of you

129
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,019
But I saw it
on the way in.

130
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,821
You stupid,
interfering little rat!

131
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:28,922
I'm kind of confused.

132
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,657
I had just fallen off
my bicycle--

133
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,991
This is
most kind of you--

134
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,626
And my lemon curd
tartlet had...

135
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,731
Damn your lemon curd tart!

136
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:53,179
Just had a chat
with your dad.

137
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,523
My rubber
instep caught

138
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,325
On the rear mudguard
stanchion and...

139
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,094
Really? and what happened
to the corned beef rolls?

140
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,463
The corned beef rolls
were crushed out of all...

141
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,665
Here, how did you know about
my corned beef rolls?

142
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,101
I noticed them-- or what remained of
them-- in the road.

143
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,803
I noticed also that
the lemon curd tart

144
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,505
Had sustained some
superficial damage.

145
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,173
That's right,
the curd had become...

146
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,574
Detached from
the pastry base.

147
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,776
Absolutely
right, yes.

148
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,011
Otherwise, the contents
of the sandwich box

149
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,312
Were relatively unharmed

150
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,715
Although I detected
small particles of bitumen

151
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,116
In the chocolate cupcakes.

152
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,651
But they were
wrapped in foil.

153
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,687
Not the hard chocolate top,
I'm afraid.

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,055
Oh, that's
the bit I like.

155
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,456
The sausage roll,
the crisps

156
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,391
And the ginger biscuit
were unscathed.

157
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,360
How do you know so much
about cycling?

158
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,995
Well, I'm making
a special study

159
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,663
Of accidents involving food.

160
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,765
Yes-- do you know,
in our laboratories

161
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,501
We have developed a cheese sandwich
that can withstand

162
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,937
An impact of up to
4,000 pounds per square inch?

163
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,238
Good heavens!

164
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,606
Amazing, isn't it?

165
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,075
We've also developed
a tomato

166
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,777
Which can eject itself
when an accident is imminent.

167
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,612
Even when it's in
an egg and tomato roll?

168
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,448
Anywhere, even if
it's in your stomach.

169
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,615
If it senses an accident

170
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,850
It will come
up your throat

171
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:04,918
And out of the window.

172
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,252
Do you know
what this means?

173
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,053
Safer food!

174
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,388
Exactly.

175
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,024
No longer will food be
squashed, crushed and damaged

176
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,326
By the ignorance
and stupidity of the driver.

177
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,761
Whole picnics will be built

178
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,696
To withstand the most
enormous forces!

179
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,231
Snacks will be
safer than ever!

180
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,699
A simple pot
of salad dressing

181
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,101
Treated in our laboratories

182
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,702
Has been subjected
to the impact

183
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,671
Of a 4,000-pound
steam hammer every day

184
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,706
For the last 16 years,
and has it broken?

185
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,008
Well... uh...

186
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,142
Yes, of course it has.

187
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,510
But there are other ideas--

188
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,545
Safety straps for sardines,
for example.

189
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,015
Here, that tomato has just
ejected itself!

190
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,182
Really?

191
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,719
It works! it works!

192
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,723
What a strange turn
this cycling tour has taken.

193
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,559
Mr. gulliver appears
to have lost his memory

194
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,362
And far from being
interested in safer food

195
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,830
Is now convinced

196
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,867
That he is clodagh rogers,
the young girl singer.

197
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,836
I am taking him
for medical attention.

198
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,005
Is this the
casualty department?

199
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,541
Yes, that's right.

200
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,645
And what can
I do for you?

201
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,181
I am at present

202
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,950
On a cycling tour
of the north cornwall area

203
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,852
Taking in bude and...

204
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,055
Yes, could I have
your name, please?

205
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,489
Ah, my name
is pither.

206
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,590
What?

207
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:18,525
P-i-t-h-e-r...

208
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,893
As in "brotherhood"

209
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,629
Except with p-i instead
of the b-r-o and no "hood."

210
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,897
Yes, I see.

211
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,966
I have just
visited taunton...

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,967
Shh!

213
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,602
I was cycling
north towards...

214
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,104
Yes, where
were you injured?

215
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,773
Just where the a-237
ilfracombe road meets the...

216
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,208
On your body.

217
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:41,314
Ah, no, it's not I who was
injured, it's my friend.

218
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,285
Name?

219
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,619
Pither.

220
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,689
No, no, no, no,
your friend's name.

221
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,659
Oh, clodagh rogers.

222
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,626
Clodagh rogers?!

223
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,295
Well, only since
about 4:30...

224
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,764
Yes, I think you'd
better talk to dr. wu.

225
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,965
Doctor!

226
00:09:58,998 --> 00:09:59,966
What?

227
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,402
Damn!

228
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,239
I am on
a cycling tour

229
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,874
Of north cornwall,
taking in...

230
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,509
He thinks he's
had an accident.

231
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,045
I have a friend who, as a result
of his injuries

232
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,513
Thinks he is
clodagh rogers.

233
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,614
He what?

234
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,718
Well, what
happened was...

235
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,325
September 4...

236
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,726
Well, I never.

237
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,196
We are now in
the alpes maritimes region

238
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,898
Of southern france.

239
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,702
Clodagh seems more intent
on reaching moscow

240
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,105
Than on rehearsing
her new bbc 2 series

241
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,577
With buddy rich
and the younger generation.

242
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,048
Oh, hello.

243
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,250
We cannot stay here.

244
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,584
We must leave
immediately.

245
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,119
There is a ship
in marseilles.

246
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,321
I did enjoy your song
for europe, clodagh.

247
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,191
I have seen an agent
in the town.

248
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,093
My life is in danger!

249
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,895
Danger, clodagh?

250
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,531
Stalin has always hated me!

251
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,666
No one hates you, clodagh.

252
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,770
I will not let myself fall
into the hands of these scum!

253
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,440
I think you should go and have
a little lie down, my dear.

254
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,741
There's a busy day tomorrow

255
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,644
Of concerts and
promotional tours.

256
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,679
I?! who was one
of the founders

257
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:22,515
Of the greatest
nation on earth?!

258
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,619
I?! whom lenin has called
his greatest friend?!

259
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,555
Taisez-vous,
taisez-vous!

260
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:29,856
Oh, dear.

261
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,758
I?! who have worked
all my life

262
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,393
That my people
should live?!

263
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,295
Qu'est-ce que
le bruit?

264
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,296
C'est impossible!

265
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,332
Oh, my name is pither.

266
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,134
Oh, you are english?

267
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,736
Uh, yes, that's right.

268
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,271
I'm on a cycling tour
of north cornwall...

269
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,673
I will not
be defeated!

270
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,308
I will return
to my country

271
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:53,046
To fight against
this new tyranny!

272
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,384
This is clodagh rogers,
the irish-born girl singer.

273
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,753
O, mais oui,
c'est clodagh rogers--

274
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,654
"jack in the box"!

275
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:05,825
I'm just a jack in the box,
I know whenever love knocks

276
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,762
I'm gonna bounce up and down
on my spring

277
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,797
Boom-boom-boom!

278
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,831
Genevieve!

279
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:12,866
Paul!

280
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,167
C'est clodagh rogers

281
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,102
La fameuse
chanteuse anglaise.

282
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,504
I will never
surrender!

283
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,905
I will never...

284
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,674
Excusez-moi,
madame clodagh.

285
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,242
Ecrivez-vous
votre nom

286
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,412
Dans mon livre des hommes celebres,
s'il vous plait.

287
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,848
La, au-dessous de
le denis compton.

288
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,185
Maman! ce n'est pas
la belle clodagh.

289
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,753
Quoi?

290
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,956
C'est trotsky,
le revolutionnaire!

291
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,358
Trotsky?!

292
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,893
Mais il ne chante pas.

293
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,094
Il chante un peu.

294
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,096
Mais pas
professionnellement.

295
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,698
Tu penses de lenin.

296
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,366
Ah! lenin, eh?
quel chanteur!

297
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,602
If I ruled the world...

298
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,973
Every day would be
the first day of spring...

299
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,176
Lenin! my friend!

300
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,144
I come!

301
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,179
Excuse her...

302
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,681
She's not been
very well recently--

303
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,584
Pressure of work,
laryngitis, you know...

304
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,386
Et aussi monsieur kerensky

305
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,722
Avec le little
white bull, hein?

306
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,424
O, formidable!

307
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,927
Lenin!

308
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,768
Clodagh...

309
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,037
Lenin!

310
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,639
I come!

311
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,141
Lenin...

312
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,576
My friend...

313
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,710
I come!

314
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:33,113
Lenin!

315
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,782
Clodagh!

316
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,953
Lenin!

317
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,456
Je t'aime.

318
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,892
Maurice, regardez!

319
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,428
C'est la chanteuse
anglaise, clodagh rogers.

320
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,731
Ah, mais oui--
jack in the box...

321
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:57,337
I'm going to bounce up
and down on my spring...

322
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,005
After several days

323
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,308
I succeeded in tracking down
my friend mr. gulliver

324
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,210
On the outskirts of smolensk.

325
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,780
Smolensk, 200 miles
east of minsk...

326
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,782
200 miles north of kursk...

327
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,583
1,500 miles west of omsk.

328
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,420
Thank you.

329
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:18,224
Anyway, as we were so far
from home and as mr. gulliver--

330
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,493
Still believing himself
to be trotsky--

331
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,896
Was very tired from
haranguing the masses

332
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,631
All the way from monte carlo...

333
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,233
Monte carlo, 100 miles
south of turin

334
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:30,637
100 miles east of pisa,
500 miles west of bilbao.

335
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,638
Thank you.

336
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,806
I decided to check...

337
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,040
I decided to check...

338
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,275
Oh, sorry, you go on.

339
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,210
I decided to check him
into a hotel

340
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,446
While I visited
the british embassy

341
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,416
To ask for help
in returning to cornwall.

342
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,085
And so we registered

343
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:49,422
At the smolensk young men's
anti-christian association.

344
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,824
Y.m.a.c.a.--

345
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,560
Corner of anti-semitic street
and pogrom square.

346
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,961
Go away.

347
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,129
No, not you.

348
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,531
A single room
for my friend, please.

349
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,467
Yes, sir. bugged
or unbugged?

350
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,303
I think I'd be happier
with a bugged one.

351
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,038
Right, one bugged with bath.

352
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,073
Well, just have
a nice lie down

353
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,209
And I'll go down
to the embassy.

354
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,343
Trotsky?

355
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:13,246
My lack of god, it's trotsky!

356
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,751
Comrades,
socialism is not a...

357
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,103
Oh, uh, excuse me.

358
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,305
Is this
the british consulate?

359
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,807

Or st. albans

461
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,436
Well, I was hoping
that you could help

462
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,071
Me and my friend
to get back to england.

463
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,706
Hackney star bingo.

464
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,743
You see, we're
on a cycling tour...

465
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,513
Bingo! bingo!

Is mr. trotsky

470
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,491
No. he has gone
to moscow.

471
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,627
Moscow-- 1,500 miles south of...

472
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,628
Shut up!

473
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,629
Moscow?

474
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,997
Come with us,
please.

475
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,165
Oh, who are you?

476
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,467
Well, we're not secret
police, anyway.

477
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,735
That's for sure.

478
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,904
If anything, we are ordinary
soviet citizens

479
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,972
With no particular
interest in politics.

480
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,274
None at all.
come with us.

481
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,644
Oh, where are
you taking me?

482
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,645
What do we
tell him?

483
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,046
Don't tell him
any secrets.

484
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,047
Agreed.

485
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,148
Tell him
anything

486
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,750
Except we are taking him
to moscow

487
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,951
Where trotsky
is reunited

488
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,320
With the central
committee.

489
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,289
We are taking you
to a clambake.

490
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,290
Oh, a clambake!

491
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,292
I've never been
to one of those.

492
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,393
Right, let's go.

493
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,994
Who's giving the orders
around here?

494
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,129
I am-- I'm
senior to you.

495
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,130
No, you're not.

496
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,131
You're a
greengrocer.

497
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,432
I'm an insurance
salesman.

498
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,568
Greengrocers are senior to
insurance salesmen.

499
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:02,669
No, they're not!

500
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,371
Cool it-- I'm an ice-cream
salesman

501
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,905
And I am senior
to both of you.

502
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,307
You're an ice-cream
salesman?

503
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,975
I thought you were
a veterinarian.

504
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:09,976
I got promoted.

505
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,977
Let's go.

506
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:11,978
Taxi!

507
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:12,979
Yes.

508
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,347
Drive us
to moscow.

509
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,382
I have
no cab.

510
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,383
Why not?

511
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,420
I'm in the secret police.

512
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:38,371
Vse narodniy prednovich
tovarich trotsky...

513
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:07,701
Shi muska
di scensand dravenka...

514
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,274
And now, comrades, the greatest
moment of a great day

515
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,443
When I ask you to welcome

516
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:20,213
The return of one
of russia's greatest heroes

517
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:24,184
Creator of the red army,
lenin's greatest friend

518
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:28,054
Lev davidovich trotsky!

519
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:36,196
Comrades, bolsheviks,
friends of the revolution

520
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:39,366
I am returned.

521
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,806
The bloodstained shadow
of stalinist repression is past.

522
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,846
I bring you the new light
of permanent revolution.

523
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,417
I may once have been
ousted from power

524
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,252
I may have
been expelled

525
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:02,088
From the party
in 1927

526
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:07,327
I may have been deported
in 1926, but...

527
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:14,100
I'm just an old-fashioned girl
with an old-fashioned mind.

528
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:18,938
Comrades, I don't want
to destroy in order to build

529
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:21,207
I don't want a state
founded on hate and division.

530
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:26,846
I want an old-fashioned house
with an old-fashioned fence

531
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,685
And an old-fashioned
millionaire...

532
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:35,455
My friend mr. gulliver
was clearly undergoing

533
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:38,792
Another change of personality.

534
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,326
So! you have
duped us.

535
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,961
You shall pay
for this.

536
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:45,432
Guards, seize him!

537
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,402
Shall I seize
him, too?

538
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,471
No, I think we'll
have to keep him.

539
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,739
He's going down well.

540
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:54,708
He's more fun
than he used to be.

541
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,309
He's loosened up
a lot.

542
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:58,345
This is an old
lenin number.

543
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,147
Labored hers and hers...

544
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:04,117
April 26--
thrown into russian cell.

545
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,353
Severely damaged my mars bar.

546
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:10,557
Shall I ever see
bude bus station again?

547
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,727
Oh, excuse me.

548
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,706
What a pleasant exercise yard.

549
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,378
How friendly
they were all being.

550
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,950
Cigarette?

551
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,752
Oh, no, thank you.

552
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:41,921
I don't smoke.

553
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,290
After a few moments

554
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:48,728
I perceived a line
of gentlemen with rifles.

555
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,698
They were looking
in my direction.

556
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:57,337
I looked around
but could not see the target.

557
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:06,379
Blindfold?

558
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:09,849
No, thank you, no.

559
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:14,187
Slowotny!

560
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,090
Grydenka...

561
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:21,394
Verschnitzen...

562
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,866
Nyet! nyet!

563
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,769
Nyet! nyet!

564
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,239
Nyet!
nyet!

565
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,642
Nyet!

566
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,644
A telegram?

567
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:40,480
From
the kremlin!

568
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:41,781
The central
committee!

569
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,417
It says...

570
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:48,221
"carry on with
the execution"

571
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:51,524
Verschnitzen...!

572
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,895
Now I was really for it.

573
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:02,769
How could you miss?

574
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,172
He moved.

575
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:07,574
Shut up!

576
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:10,877
Go and practice.

577
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,713
I'm so sorry.

578
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:18,618
Would you mind
waiting in your cell?

579
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:25,225
What a stroke of luck..

580
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:27,660
My crunchie was totally intact.

581
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:33,133
I settled down
to a quick inter-meal snack.

582
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,347
Next time...

583
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,749
Definitely!

584
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:52,519
Now, how many
have been injured?

585
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,620
Oh, god!

586
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:55,588
As I lay down to the sound

587
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:59,359
Of the russian gentlemen
practicing their shooting

588
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,228
I realized I was
in a bit of a pickle.

589
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:04,297
My heart sank as I realized

590
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:10,103
I should never see
the okehampton bypass again.

591
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,973
Come on, dear.

592
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:17,143
Wake up, dear.

593
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:20,480
Mother!

594
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,482
Come on, dear.

595
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:25,652
So... it was
all a dream.

596
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:28,021
No, dear, this
is the dream.

597
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:32,058
You're still
in the cell.

598
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,630
Okay, we're going
to have another try.

599
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:38,932
I think we've
got it now.

600
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,200
My boys have
been looking

601
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:41,634
Down the wrong bit,
you see.

602
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:42,736
Oh, no, no.

603
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,637
You've got to look
down that bit there.

604
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:46,639
I thought you had
to look down that bit.

605
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,608
Oh, no, you've got
to look down that bit

606
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:49,876
Or you won't
hit anything.

607
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,511
All right, we'll
give it a whirl.

608
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:54,481
Guards, seize him!

609
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:59,786
Listen, you've got
to look down this bit.

610
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:11,331
Osledi, osledi, osledi...

611
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,101
And now...

612
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,140
...with pee-pee.

613
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:32,152
Kon'nichi wa.

614
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:53,606
Eartha kitt!

615
00:27:58,545 --> 00:28:01,281
Trade union leaders

616
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:03,483
I would say this:
we've done our part.

617
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:08,521
Now, on behalf of the community
we have a right to expect you...

618
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:10,690
The trade union leaders,
to do yours.

619
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,592
Nyet eartha kitt!

620
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:15,662
Edward heath.

621
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:17,997
...in unjustifiable ways.

622
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,399
Sing "old-fashioned girl"!

623
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:20,734
"old-fashioned girl"!

624
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,202
Sing "old-fashioned girl"!

625
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:23,436
"old-fashioned girl"!

626
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,506
"old-fashioned girl"!

627
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,841
"old-fashioned girl"!

628
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,676
"old-fashioned girl"!

629
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,379
That turnip's certainly
not safe.

630
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:34,614
"old-fashioned girl"!
"old-fashioned girl"!

631
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,216
Oh, no! mr. pither!

632
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:39,119
Mr. pither!

633
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:42,789
Pither!

634
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:45,692
Mr. pither!

635
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:55,201
Pither!

636
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,041
Mr. pither!

637
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,911
Mr. pither! mr. pither!

638
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,081
Mr. pither!

639
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:21,361
Mr. pither!

640
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:23,797
Here!

641
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,201
Gulliver!

642
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,202
Pither!

643
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,271
What a stroke
of luck.

644
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:34,674
Well, yes and no.

645
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:40,647
Charge!

646
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:45,518
Phew! what
an amazing escape.

647
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:47,053
Well, good-bye,
reginald.

648
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:48,388
Good-bye,
mr. pither.

649
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:50,156
And good luck
with the tour!

650
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,525
Huh!

651
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,457
Hey, i... I think
he's finally gone!

652
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,293
Ooh, yeah.

653
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:29,896
Ready, maurice?

654
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,998
Right-o, kevin,
let's go.

655
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,833
All right,
maestro, hit it!

656
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:38,171
I'm just your
jack in the box

657
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,540
I know whenever love knocks

658
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:44,444
I'm gonna bounce
up and down on my spring

659
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:46,379
Until you stop when it stops

660
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:50,984
I'm just
your jack in the box...
