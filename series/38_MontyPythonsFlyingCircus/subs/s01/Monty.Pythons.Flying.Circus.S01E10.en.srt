1
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,817
It's...

2
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:20,487
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

3
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,654
Well, where is he?

4
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,659
Hmm... hmm.

5
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,827
Well, what is it, dear?

6
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,362
It's from the bbc.

7
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,832
They want to know if I want
to be in a sketch on telly.

8
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,668
Ooh, that's nice.

9
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,069
Why, it's acting,
isn't it?

10
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,170
Yes.

11
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,572
Well, I'm a plumber.

12
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,573
I can't act.

13
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,474
Oh, you never know
till you try.

14
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,610
Look at mrs. brando's
son next door.

15
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,679
He was mending the fridge
when they came

16
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,380
And asked him to be
the wild one.

17
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,915
What do they
want you to do?

18
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:24,351
Well, they just want me
to stand at a counter

19
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,453
And when the sketch starts,
I'll go out.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,721
Oh, that sounds nice.

21
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,756
That's what they call a walk-on.

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,325
Walk-on?

23
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,427
That's a walk-off,
that's what this is.

24
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,031
Where is he, georgie?

25
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,900
He should have been
here hours ago.

26
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,401
He bloody should have been.

27
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,171
What else did it say?

28
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,205
It just says

29
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,241
"we would like you
to be in a sketch.

30
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,243
"you are standing
at a counter.

31
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,445
"when the sketch
starts, you go off.

32
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,380
Yours faithfully,
lord hill."

33
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,449
Oh, well, you better
be off, then.

34
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,184
Well, what about the cat?

35
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,186
Oh, I'll look
after the cat.

36
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,854
Goodness me,
mrs. newman's oldest

37
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,155
Never worried
about the cat

38
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,791
When he went off to do
the <i>sweet bird of youth.</i>

39
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,193
All right, then,
all right.

40
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,461
Bye-bye, dear.

41
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,496
Bye-bye, and mind you,
don't get seduced.

42
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,533
It'll make a change
from plumbing.

43
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,275
Dad, frank's got
a television part.

44
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:28,982
You missed him.

45
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,559
Good morning.

46
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm a bank robber.

47
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,894
Uh, please don't panic.

48
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,529
Just hand over
all your money.

49
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,032
This is a lingerie shop, sir.

50
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,534
Fine, fine.

51
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,203
Fine.

52
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,908
Adopt, adapt and improve.

53
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,210
Motto of the round table.

54
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,711
Well, um...

55
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,112
What have you got?

56
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,515
Uh, we've got corsets,
stockings, suspender belts

57
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,016
Tights, bras, slips, petticoats

58
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,651
Knickers, socks
and garters, sir.

59
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,186
Fine, fine.

60
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,789
Fine, fine.

61
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:12,359
Um... no large piles of money
in safes?

62
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,393
No, sir.

63
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,862
No deposit accounts?

64
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:15,829
No, sir.

65
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,398
No piles of cash
in easy-to-carry bags?

66
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,133
None at all, sir.

67
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,136
No luncheon vouchers?

68
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,171
No, sir.

69
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,506
Fine, fine.

70
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,943
Well, um...

71
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,512
Adopt, adapt and improve.

72
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,183
Just a pair of
knickers then, please.

73
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,121
Well, that was a bit of fun,
wasn't it?

74
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,725
And a special good evening
to you.

75
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,560
Not just
an ordinary good evening

76
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,929
Like you get from
all the other announcers

77
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,998
But a special good evening
from me...

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,102
To you.

79
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,670
Well, what have we got next?

80
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,938
This is fun, isn't it?

81
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,808
Look, I'm sorry if
I'm interrupting anything

82
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,710
That any of you
may be doing at home

83
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,180
But I want you to think of me
as an old queen...

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,247
Friend.

85
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,417
Well, let's see
what we've got next.

86
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,319
In a few moments, <i>it's a tree</i>

87
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,755
And in the chair as usual
is arthur tree

88
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,256
And starring in the show

89
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,293
Will be a host of star guests
as his star guests.

90
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,697
And then at 9:30, we've got
another rollicking half hour

91
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,766
Of laughter-packed squalor

92
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,702
With <i>yes, it's</i>
<i>the sewage farm attendants.</i>

93
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,374
And this week, dan falls
into a vat of human dung

94
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,310
With hilarious consequences.

95
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,215
But now it's the glittering
world of show business

96
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,583
With arthur tree.

97
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,504
Hello, hello, people,
and welcome to <i>it's a tree.</i>

98
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,540
We have some really exciting
guests for you this evening--

99
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:10,077
A fabulous spruce
back from a tour of holland;

100
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,478
Three gum trees

101
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,648
Making their first appearance
in this country;

102
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,051
Scots pine and the conifers;
and elm tree bole--

103
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,087
There you go, can't be bad--

104
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,489
An exciting new american plank;

105
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,392
A rain forest
and a bucket of sawdust

106
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,362
Giving their views
on teenage violence;

107
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,198
And an unusual guest
for this program--

108
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,333
A piece of laminated plastic.

109
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,835
Hi there.

110
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:39,206
But first, will you
please, please welcome

111
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,974
A block of wood.

112
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,881
Well, block, nice to have you
on the show again.

113
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,083
Well, uh, thanks, tree.

114
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,286
I got to pay the rent.

115
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,991
Super.

116
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,195
Well, what have you
been doing, block?

117
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,764
Well, I've just been starring

118
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,735
In several major multimillion-
dollar international films

119
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:14,241
And during breaks on the set,
I've been designing a cathedral

120
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:18,278
Doing wonderful unpublicized
work for charity

121
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,715
Uh, finishing my history
of the world, of course

122
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,016
Pulling the birds...

123
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,017
Oh!

124
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,888
Uh, photographing royalty
on the loo

125
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:33,660
Averting world war iii--
can't be bad-- and, uh...

126
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:34,761
Learning to read.

127
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,798
The full renaissance bit,
really.

128
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,900
Super, super.

129
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:43,203
Well, I've got to stop you
there, block, I'm afraid

130
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,872
Because we've got someone

131
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,708
Who's been doing cabaret
in the new forest.

132
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,577
From america,
will you welcome, please

133
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,746
A chippendale writing desk.

134
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,214
Thank you, mr. tree.

135
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,884
I'd now like to do
a few impersonations

136
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,219
Of some of
my favorite englishmen.

137
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,288
First off, long john sliver.

138
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:06,827
Arg, jim boy, arg, arg.

139
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,996
And now, edward heath.

140
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,798
Hello, sailor.

141
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:17,404
Now, a short scene from a play
by harold splinter.

142
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,710
Wasn't that just great,
ladies and gentlemen?

143
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,179
But wait a minute.

144
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,182
We've got something else I just
know you're going to love.

145
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,633
Yes, sir, coming right up

146
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,636
The vocational
guidance counselor sketch.

147
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,924
Vocational guidance
counselor

148
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,093
Vocational
guidance counselor

149
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,996
Vocational guidance
counselor

150
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,867
Vocational guidance
counselor.

151
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,042
Ah, mr. anchovy.

152
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,077
Do sit down.

153
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,111
Thank you.

154
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,613
Take the weight
off the feet, eh?

155
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,413
Yes, yes.

156
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:34,515
Lovely weather

157
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,983
For the time of year,
I must say.

158
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,684
Enough of this gay banter.

159
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,852
And now, mr. anchovy

160
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,354
You asked us
to advise you

161
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,355
Which job in life

162
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,789
You were
best suited for.

163
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,191
That is correct, yes.

164
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,727
Well, I now have the results
here of the interviews

165
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,929
And the aptitude tests
that you took last week

166
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,498
And from them, we've built up
a pretty clear picture

167
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,133
Of the sort of person
that you are

168
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,669
And I think I can say
without fear of contradiction

169
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,238
That the ideal job for you
is chartered accountancy.

170
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,142
But I am a chartered accountant.

171
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:03,644
Jolly good.

172
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,779
Well, back to the
office with you, then.

173
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,514
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

174
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,850
I've been a chartered accountant
for the last 20 years.

175
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,686
I want a new job-- something
exciting that will let me live.

176
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,389
Well, chartered accountancy's
rather exciting, isn't it?

177
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:16,990
Exciting?!

178
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,592
No, it's not!

179
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,228
It's dull, dull, dull.

180
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,363
My god, it's dull.

181
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,000
It's so desperately
dull and tedious

182
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,705
And stuffy and boring
and desperately dull.

183
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,473
Well, uh, yes,
mr. anchovy

184
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,843
But you see, your
report here says

185
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,445
That you are an
extremely dull person.

186
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,781
You see, our experts
describe you

187
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,850
As an appallingly dull fellow

188
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,886
Unimaginative, timid,
lacking in initiative

189
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,921
Spineless,
easily dominated

190
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,791
No sense of humor,
tedious company

191
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,594
And irrepressibly drab
and awful.

192
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,596
And whereas in most professions

193
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,965
These would be
considerable drawbacks

194
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,868
In chartered accountancy,
they're a positive boon.

195
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,671
But you see, I came here
to find a new job, a new life

196
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,673
A new meaning to my existence.

197
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,708
Can't you help me?

198
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,309
Well, do you
have any idea

199
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,611
Of what
you want to do?

200
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:11,678
Yes, yes, I have.

201
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,946
What?

202
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,015
Lion taming.

203
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,522
Yes, yes, of course,
it's a bit of a jump, isn't it?

204
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,458
I mean, chartered accountancy
to lion taming in one go.

205
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,193
You don't think
it might be better

206
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,395
If you worked your way
towards lion taming

207
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,596
Say, via banking or...

208
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:30,731
No! no, no, no, no, no!

209
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,798
I don't want to wait.

210
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,200
At 9:00 tomorrow

211
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,636
I want to be
in there taming.

212
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,204
Fine, fine,
but do you...

213
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,139
Do you have any
qualifications?

214
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:40,140
Yes, I've got a hat.

215
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:42,142
A hat?

216
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,710
Yes, a hat, a lion taming hat.

217
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,345
A hat with "lion tamer" on it.

218
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,947
I got it at harrods.

219
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,482
And it lights up,
saying "lion tamer"

220
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:49,616
In great, big neon letters

221
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,152
So you can tame them after dark
when they're less stroppy.

222
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,387
I see, I see.

223
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,556
And you can claim reasonable
wear and tear--

224
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,224
Switch it off during
the daytime--

225
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,126
As allowable
professional expenses...

226
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,561
Yes, yes, yes

227
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:03,730
I do follow the strategy,
but you see, the snag is

228
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,934
If I now call mr. chipperfield
and say to him

229
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,135
"look here, I've got

230
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:10,737
"a 45-year-old
chartered accountant with me

231
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,739
Who wants to become
a lion tamer"

232
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,875
His first question
is not going to be

233
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,543
"does he have his own hat?"

234
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,778
He's going to ask

235
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,980
What sort of experience
you've had with lions.

236
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,382
Well, I've seen them at the zoo.

237
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,951
Good, good, good.

238
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,586
Yes, they're brown,
furry things

239
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,055
With short, stumpy legs
and great, long noses.

240
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,123
I don't know what
all the fuss is about.

241
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,325
I could tame one of those.

242
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,492
They look pretty tame
to start with.

243
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,762
And these, um, these lions,
how high are they?

244
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,599
Well, they're about
so high, you know.

245
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,801
They don't
frighten me at all.

246
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,935
Really?

247
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,037
And do these lions eat ants?

248
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:44,938
Yes, that's right.

249
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,908
Uh, well, mr. anchovy

250
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,944
I'm afraid what you've got
hold of there is an anteater.

251
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,479
A what?

252
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:54,915
An anteater, not a lion.

253
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,351
You see, a lion is
a huge, savage beast

254
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,321
About five feet high, ten feet
long, weighing about 400 pounds

255
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:07,094
Running 40 miles an hour with
masses of sharp, pointed teeth

256
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,762
And nasty, long,
razor-sharp claws

257
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,197
That could rip your belly open

258
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,765
Before you could say
"eric robinson."

259
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,900
And they look like this.

260
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,374
Time enough, I think,
for a piece of wood.

261
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,112
The larch.

262
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,716
Now, shall I call
mr. chipperfield?

263
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,851
Uh, no, no, no, no.

264
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:31,952
I think your idea

265
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,188
Of making the transition
to lion taming

266
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,723
Via easy stages,
say, via insurance or...

267
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,925
Banking.

268
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,993
Or banking, banking,
yes, banking.

269
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,862
That's a man's life,
isn't it?

270
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,231
Banking-- travel,
excitement, adventure

271
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,967
Thrills, decisions
affecting people's lives.

272
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,502
Jolly good.

273
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,636
Shall I put you

274
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:50,904
In touch with the bank?

275
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,072
Yes...

276
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,340
No, no, no.

277
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,741
Look, it's
a big decision.

278
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,343
I'd like just
a couple of weeks

279
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,878
To think about it,
you know?

280
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,713
Don't want to jump
into it too quickly.

281
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,714
Maybe three weeks.

282
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,316
I could let you know
definitely then.

283
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:06,486
Well, this is just one
of the all-too-many cases

284
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,823
On our books
of chartered accountancy.

285
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:11,825
The only way that we can fight

286
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:14,561
This terrible, debilitating
social disease

287
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,131
Is by informing the general
public of its consequences

288
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,667
By showing young people...

289
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:22,603
Perhaps I could do it,
just for a bit...

290
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,038
That it's just not worth it.

291
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:28,942
So please, give generously
to this address:

292
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,828
Oh!

293
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,665
Well, that was fun, wasn't it?

294
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:53,200
No, it wasn't, you fairy.

295
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,003
Oh, hello, sailor.

296
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,372
Here, you wouldn't have got
on one of our voyages.

297
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,540
They were all dead butch.

298
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,276
Mmm, that's not what I've heard.

299
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,752
There is an epic quality
about the sea

300
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,420
Which has throughout history

301
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,823
Stirred the hearts and minds
of englishmen of all nations.

302
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,727
Sir francis drake, captain webb,
nelson of trafalgar

303
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:22,729
And scott of the antarctic

304
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:26,200
All rose to the challenge
of the mighty ocean.

305
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:30,037
And today, another englishman
may add his name

306
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,008
To the golden roll of history:
mr. ron obvious of neaps end

307
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:39,046
For today, ron obvious hopes
to be the first man

308
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,415
To jump the channel.

309
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,689
Ron, now, let's just
get this quite clear--

310
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,159
You're intending to jump
across the english channel.

311
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,127
Oh, yes, that is
correct, yes.

312
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,196
And just how far
is that?

313
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,299
Oh, well, it's 26 miles
from here to calais.

314
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,201
That's to the beach
at calais?

315
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,570
Well, no, no, provided
I get a good lift-off

316
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:06,273
And maybe a gust
of breeze over
the french coast

317
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,209
I shall be jumping
into the center of
calais itself.

318
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,480
Are you using any
special techniques

319
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,516
To jump this
great distance?

320
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,550
Oh, no, no.

321
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:17,451
I shall be using

322
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,852
An ordinary
two-footed jump

323
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:19,987
Straight up
in the air

324
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,154
And across
the channel.

325
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,623
I see.

326
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,158
Ron, what is
the furthest distance

327
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,194
That you've jumped so far?

328
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:31,765
Oh, uh, 11 foot, six inches
at motspur park on july 22.

329
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:34,168
But I have done nearly
12 feet unofficially.

330
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:38,672
I see, uh... ron, ron,
aren't you worried

331
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:44,778
Ron, aren't you worried jumping
26 miles across the sea?

332
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:45,779
Oh, no, no, no.

333
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,147
It is,
in fact, easier

334
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,449
To jump over sea
than over dry land.

335
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,617
Well, how is that?

336
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,920
Well, my manager
explained it to me.

337
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,955
You see, if you're
five miles out

338
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,523
Over the english channel

339
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,425
With nothing but
sea underneath you

340
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,960
There is a very
great impetus

341
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:00,994
To stay in the air.

342
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,231
I see, well, uh,
thank you very much, ron

343
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,732
And the very best of luck.

344
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:06,967
Thank you,
thank you.

345
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:10,470
The man behind ron's
cross-channel jump

346
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,640
Is his manager,
mr. luigi vercotti.

347
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,810
Mr. vercotti... mr. vercotti.

348
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,312
Mr. vercotti.

349
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,313
What?

350
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,814
Mr. vercotti...

351
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:23,317
I don't know what
you're talking about.

352
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,385
Uh, no, we're from the bbc,
mr. vercotti.

353
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,086
Who?

354
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,588
The bbc.

355
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,789
Oh, oh, I see.

356
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:32,292
I thought... I thought
you were the, um...

357
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,360
I like the police a lot.

358
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,828
I've got lots
of time for them.

359
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,396
Well, uh, mr. vercotti

360
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,366
What is your chief task
as ron's manager?

361
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,534
Well, my main task

362
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,970
Is to fix a sponsor
for the big jump.

363
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,505
And who is the sponsor?

364
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,373
The chippenham
brick company.

365
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,009
They pay all the bills,
in return for which

366
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,646
Ron will be carrying half a
hundredweight of their bricks.

367
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:55,883
I see.

368
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,585
Well, it looks as if
ron is ready now.

369
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,153
He's got the bricks.

370
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,924
He's had his passport checked
and he's all set to go.

371
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:17,437
And he's off on the first-ever
cross-channel jump.

372
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,112
Will ron be trying
the cross-channel
jump again soon?

373
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:26,680
No, no, I'm taking
him off the jumps

374
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:29,082
Because I've got something
lined up for ron next week

375
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,084
That I think is very much
more up his street.

376
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,252
What's that?

377
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,455
Ron is going to eat
chichester cathedral.

378
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:42,396
Well, there he goes,
ron obvious of neaps end

379
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,565
In an attempt
which could make him

380
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:48,168
The first man ever to eat
an entire anglican cathedral.

381
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:12,893
Well, uh,
I think, david

382
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,994
This is something

383
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,796
Which ron and i
are really keen on.

384
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:16,997
Ron is going to tunnel

385
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:20,667
From godalming here
to java here.

386
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,670
Java.

387
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:26,673
Yeah, I personally think
this is going to make ron

388
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,342
A household name overnight.

389
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:29,276
And how far has he got?

390
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,144
Well, he's quite far now, dave,

391
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,312
Uh, well on the way.

392
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,714
Well on the way, yeah.

393
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,415
Well, where is he, exactly?

394
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,850
Yeah.

395
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:37,851
Where?

396
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:39,486
Oh, well, um, you know

397
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,855
It's difficult to say, exactly.

398
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,891
He's, you know, in the area

399
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,959
Of, um...

400
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,629
Ron, how far have you got?

401
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:51,164
Oh, about two foot, six,
mr. vercotti.

402
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:53,300
Yeah, well, keep digging,
lad, keep digging.

403
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,669
Mr. vercotti, are you
sure there isn't a spade?

404
00:18:56,837 --> 00:19:00,207
Uh, mr. vercotti,
what do you say to people

405
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,809
Who accuse you
of exploiting ron

406
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,678
For your own purposes?

407
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,014
Well, that's
totally untrue,
david.

408
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,115
Ever since
I left sicily

409
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:10,117
I've been trying to
do the best for ron.

410
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,852
I know what ron
wants to do

411
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,986
I believe in him

412
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:14,421
And I'm just
trying to create

413
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:15,622
The opportunities
for ron

414
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,591
To do the kind
of things he
wants to do.

415
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:18,926
And what's he going
to do today?

416
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,527
He's going to split
a railway carriage

417
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:21,562
With his nose.

418
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,333
The only
difficult bit for ron

419
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,168
Is getting out
of earth's atmosphere.

420
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:31,572
Once he's in orbit, he'll be
able to run straight to mercury.

421
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,250
I am now
extremely hopeful

422
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,452
That ron will break
the world record

423
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,120
For remaining underground.

424
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,689
He's a wonderful boy, this

425
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,792
And he's got this
really enormous talent

426
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:55,062
This really huge talent.

427
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,730
That's a bit sad, isn't it?

428
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,365
Shh, it's satire.

429
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:01,168
No, it isn't,
it's just zany madcap humor.

430
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,236
Oh, is it?

431
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,744
Good morning,
I'd like to buy a cat.

432
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:11,979
Certainly, sir.

433
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,981
Got a lovely terrier.

434
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,850
No, I want
a cat, really.

435
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,285
Oh, yeah.

436
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,054
How about that?

437
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,625
Well, that's
the terrier.

438
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,827
Well, it's as near
as dammit.

439
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,428
Well, what do you mean?--
I want a cat.

440
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:29,696
Listen, tell you what.

441
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,366
I'll file his legs down a bit,
take his snout off

442
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,368
Stick a few wires
through his cheeks

443
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,036
There you are,
lovely pussycat.

444
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:37,404
It's not a proper cat.

445
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:38,105
What do you mean?

446
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,006
He wouldn't meow.

447
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,941
Well, it would howl a bit.

448
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:42,976
No, no, no, no.

449
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,511
Have you got a parrot?

450
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:48,115
I'm afraid not, actually, guv,
we're fresh out of parrots.

451
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:51,618
Tell you what, though, I'll lop
its back legs off, make good

452
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:54,021
Strip the fur,
stick a couple of wings on

453
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:57,925
And staple on a beak
of your own choice.

454
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,060
No problem, lovely parrot.

455
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,228
How long would
that take?

456
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,296
Oh, let me see

457
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,097
Stripping
the fur off, no legs...

458
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:05,132
Harry?

459
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,133
Yeah.

460
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,801
Can you do
a parrot job on this, uh

461
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,437
Can you do a parrot job
on this terrier straight away?

462
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:12,940
No, I'm still putting
a tuck in the airedale

463
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,608
And then I've got
the frogs to let out.

464
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,576
Friday?

465
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,077
No, I need it for tomorrow;
it's a present.

466
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:20,814
Oh, dear, it's a long job,
you see, parrot conversion.

467
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:23,350
Uh, tell you what, though,
for free

468
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,718
Terriers make lovely fish.

469
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,087
I mean, I would
do that for you
straight away.

470
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,856
Legs off, fins on,
stick a little pipe

471
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:30,224
Through the back
of its neck

472
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,225
So he can breathe

473
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,659
A bit of gold paint.
make good.

474
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:33,861
You'd need
a very big tank.

475
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,562
It's a great
conversation piece.

476
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:38,398
Yeah, all right,
all right.

477
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,935
But... only
if I can watch.

478
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:45,339
Oh, I thought that was
a bit predictable.

479
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:47,341
It's been done before.

480
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:50,043
Yeah, we did it
for caesar's christmas show.

481
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,078
No, you didn't.

482
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:53,247
You did <i>jackand the beanstalk.</i>

483
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,358
Here, what was
that picture?

484
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:05,492
Shh... next.

485
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:12,199
Good morning...
mr. phipps?

486
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:13,700
That's right, yes.

487
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,435
Um, do take a seat.

488
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,137
Right, sir.

489
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,439
Now, could you
tell us, roughly

490
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,109
Why you want to
become a librarian?

491
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:25,179
Well, I've had a certain amount
of experience

492
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:27,214
Running a library at school.

493
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,383
Yes, yes, what sort
of experience?

494
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:34,721
Well, for a time
I ran the upper science library.

495
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:35,856
Yes, yes.

496
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:37,624
Now, mr. phipps,
of course you do realize

497
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,426
That the post of librarian
carries with it

498
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:41,161
Certain very important
responsibilities.

499
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:43,564
I mean, there's
the selection of books

500
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:46,200
The record library
and the art gallery.

501
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:50,103
Now, it seems to me that your
greatest disadvantage is

502
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:52,606
Your lack
of professional experience

503
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:55,742
Coupled with the fact
that being a gorilla

504
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:58,245
You would tend
to frighten people.

505
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,313
Uh, is he a gorilla?

506
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,347
Yes, he is.

507
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,015
Why doesn't it
say on his form

508
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:03,050
That he's a gorilla?

509
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,418
Well, you see

510
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,687
Applicants are not required
to fill in their species.

511
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:07,721
What was
that picture?

512
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:08,722
Shh!

513
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,524
Mr. phipps,
what is your attitude

514
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:12,860
Towards censorship
in the public library?

515
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,294
How do you mean, sir?

516
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:15,863
Well, I mean for instance

517
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:18,732
Would you stock <i>last exit</i>
<i>to brooklyn</i> or <i>groupie?</i>

518
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,133
Yes, I think so.

519
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,835
Good.

520
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:25,739
Yes, well, that seems to be
very sensible, mr. phipps.

521
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,741
I can't pretend
that this library

522
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,543
Hasn't had its difficulties.

523
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,778
Mr. robertson--
your predecessor--

524
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:35,415
An excellent librarian,
savaged three people last week

525
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:36,650
And had to be destroyed.

526
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:37,684
I'm sorry, sir.

527
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:38,919
Oh, no, don't be sorry.

528
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:40,320
You see, I don't believe

529
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:42,222
That libraries
should be drab places

530
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:43,790
Where people sit in silence

531
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,325
And that's been
the main reason

532
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,593
For our policy
of employing

533
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,895
Wild animals
as librarians.

534
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:50,230
And also
they're much
more permissive.

535
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,933
Pumas keep hank janson
on open shelves.

536
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,134
Yes, mr. phipps.

537
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,170
Mr. phipps, I love
seeing the customers

538
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:57,704
When they come in
to complain

539
00:23:57,738 --> 00:23:59,173
About some book
being damaged

540
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:00,941
And ask to see
the chief librarian

541
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:03,510
And then you should see
their faces

542
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:07,014
When the proud beast leaps
from his tiny office

543
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:11,018
Snatches the book from
their hands and sinks his fangs

544
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:12,953
Into their soft...

545
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:14,855
Mr. phipps--
kong--

546
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:17,824
You can be our
next librarian.

547
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:21,795
You're proud, majestic
and fierce enough.

548
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,363
Will you do it?

549
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,365
I don't think I can, sir.

550
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:26,033
Why not?

551
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,368
I'm not really
a gorilla.

552
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:30,871
I'm a librarian in a skin.

553
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,140
Why this
deception?

554
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:34,408
Well, they said it would be

555
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,676
The best way to get a job.

556
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,377
Get out,
mr. librarian phipps

557
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:39,146
Seeing as you're
not a gorilla

558
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:40,681
But only dressed up
as one

559
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:41,915
Trying to deceive us

560
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,884
In order to further
your career!

561
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:47,387
Next?

562
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:54,027

Wake up,
my little lemon.

Come to my arms.

591
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:15,175
Oh, maurice,
what are you doing here?

592
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,177
I could not keep
away from you.

593
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:19,146
I must have you
all the time.

594
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:21,148
Oh, this is most
inconvenient.

595
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:23,483
Don't talk to me
about convenience.

596
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:25,485
Love consumes
my naughty mind.

597
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,154
I'm delirious
with desire.

598
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,690
What's that, vera?

599
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,191
Oh, uh, nothing, dear

600
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,926
Just a trick
of the light.

601
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:33,961
Righto.

602
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,362
Phew, that was close!

Now, then,
my little banana

My little fruit salad.

I can wait for you
no longer.

You must be mine,

Oh, maurice.

608
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:44,404
Vera!

609
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:45,739
How dare you!

610
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:46,507
Roger!

611
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:47,741
What's the meaning
of this?

612
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:49,643
Oh, I can explain
everything, my darling.

613
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:50,978
Who's this?

614
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:53,180
This is maurice
zatapathique,
roger thompson.

615
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,148
Roger thompson,
maurice zatapathique.

616
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,149
How do you do?

617
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:57,150
How do you do?

618
00:26:57,184 --> 00:26:58,719
How could you do this
to me, vera

619
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,220
After all we've been through?

620
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:01,955
Damn it, I love you.

621
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:04,358
Vera, don't you
understand?

622
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:06,393
It's <i>me</i> that loves you.

623
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,162
What's happening,
vera?

624
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,464
Oh, nothing, dear.

625
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:13,133
Just a twig brushing
against the window.

626
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,168
Righto!

627
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,536
Come to me, vera.

628
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,004
Oh, not now,
roger.

629
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:18,906
Vera, my little
hedgehog

630
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,407
Don't turn me away.

631
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,543
Oh, it cannot
be, maurice.

632
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,513
Hands off, you
filthy bally froggie.

633
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:28,549
Oh, ken, ken biggles!

634
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:30,784
Yes, algy is
here as well.

635
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,319
Algy braithwaite?

636
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:33,554
That's right,
vera.

637
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,721
Oh, god, you know

638
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,757
We both still
bally love you.

639
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,758
Oh, biggles!

640
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:38,759
Algy!

641
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,827
Oh, but how
wonderful!

642
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,497
What's happening,
vera?

643
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,400
Oh, nothing, dear,
just the toilet filling up.

644
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,401
Righto!

645
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:49,870
Excuse me, could
you tell me

646
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,972
Where is mrs. vera
jackson, please?

647
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,507
Yes, right
and right again.

648
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,508
<i>muchas gracias.</i>

649
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:55,542
Righto!

650
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:04,651
Oh, vera

651
00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:07,287
Remember acapulco
in the springtime.

652
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,323
Oh, the herman rodrigues four!

653
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:13,126
Vera! I distinctly
heard

654
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,795
A mexican
rhythm combo.

655
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,530
Oh, no, dear,
it was just

656
00:28:16,597 --> 00:28:19,032
The electric blanket
switching off.

657
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,535
Oh... well, I'm
going for a tinkle.

658
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:22,736
No, you can't do that.

659
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:25,038
Here, we haven't
finished the sketch yet!

660
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:26,073
Dash it all

661
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:27,975
There's only
another bally page.

662
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:30,310
I say, there's
no one to react to.

663
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:32,012
Don't talk
to the camera.

664
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,046
Oh, sorry.

665
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,149
It's no good you coming in.

666
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,684
He's gone and left the sketch.

667
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:40,354
Yes, he went
for a tinkle.

668
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,889
Ooh.

669
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:43,557
Shh...

670
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:45,125
I think my wife
is beginning

671
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:46,593
To suspect
something.

672
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:49,162
I felt <i>that</i> ending
was a bit predictable.

673
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:55,469
Yes, indeed, there was
a certain lack of originality.

674
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:02,042
However, it's not necessarily a
good thing just to be different.

675
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:04,111
No... quite, there
is equal humor

676
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:05,445
In the conventional.

677
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,756
But on the other hand, is
it what the public wants?

678
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,591
I mean, with the new
permissiveness

679
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:19,626
Not to mention the balance
of payments

680
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:21,828
And the undeniable fact that...

681
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:25,566
I agree with that
completely.

682
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:29,870
That's it, I'm getting
out of this show

683
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,071
Before it's too late.

684
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,073
Too late!
