1
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,084
It's...

2
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,122
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

3
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,122
Good evening.

4
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:51,712
Hello again, and
welcome to the show.

5
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:56,383
Tonight, we continue to look
at some famous deaths.

6
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,120
Tonight we start
with the wonderful death

7
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,457
Of genghis khan,
conqueror of india.

8
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,459
Take it away, genghis.

9
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:29,950
9.1, 9.3, 9.7.

10
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,187
That's 28.1 for genghis khan.

11
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,721
Bad luck, genghis.

12
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,291
Nice to have you on the show.

13
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,793
And now, here are the scores.

14
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,029
Well, you can see
the scores now.

15
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,232
St. stephen in the lead
there with his stoning.

16
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,435
Then comes king richard iii
at bosworth field--

17
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,803
A grand death, that--

18
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,905
Then the very
lovely jean d'arc.

19
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,574
Then marat, in his bath--

20
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,377
Best of friends with charlotte
in the showers afterwards.

21
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,580
Then a. lincoln
of the u.s. of a.--

22
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,281
A grand little chap, that--

23
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,217
And number six, genghis khan

24
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,719
And the back marker,
king edward vii.

25
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,354
Back to you, wolfgang.

26
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,122
Thank you, eddie.

27
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,627
And now, time for
this week's request death.

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,964
For mr. and
mrs. violet steppings

29
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,766
Of 23 wolverston road, hull

30
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,204
The death of mr. bruce foster
of guildford.

31
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,643
Strewth!

32
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,349
Oh, blimey, how time flies!

33
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:39,853
Sadly, we are reaching the end
of yet another program

34
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,022
And so it is finale time.

35
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,392
We are proud
to be bringing to you

36
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,795
One of the evergreen
bucket kickers

37
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:55,068
Yes, the wonderful death of the
famous english admiral nelson.

38
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,905
Kiss me, hardy!

39
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,953
Well, good evening, everyone

40
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,323
And welcome to the second
of our italian language classes

41
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,326
In which we'll be helping you
brush up your italian.

42
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,762
Now, last week we started
at the beginning

43
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,164
And we learned the italian
for a "spoon."

44
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:27,568
Now, I wonder how many of you
can remember what it was?

45
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,303
<i>si, si!</i>

46
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,971
Sit down, mario--
giuseppe.

47
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,472
<i>il cucchiaio.</i>

48
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,907
Oh, well done, giuseppe

49
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,010
<i>Or as the italians
would say, molto bene, giuseppe.</i>

50
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,746
<i>grazie, signore, grazie
de tutta la sua gentilezza.</i>

51
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,751
Well, now, this week
we're going to learn

52
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,087
Some useful phrases to help us

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,456
Open a conversation
with an italian.

54
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,626
Now, first of all, try telling
him where you come from.

55
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:56,263
<i>For example, I would say, "sono
inglese di gerrard's cross. "</i>

56
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,732
"I am an englishman
from gerrard's cross."

57
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,667
Shall we all try that together?

58
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,669
<i>si, si!</i>

59
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:06,707
<i>sono inglese
di gerrard's cross.</i>

60
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,975
Not too bad.

61
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,310
Now let's try with
somebody else-- mr...

62
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,144
<i>Mariolini, signor.</i>

63
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,145
Mr. mariolini.

64
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,146
And where are you from?

65
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,181
<i>napoli, signor.</i>

66
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,349
You're italian?

67
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,383
<i>si...</i>

68
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,384
<i>si, si.</i>

69
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,752
Well, in that case

70
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:22,089
<i>You would say,
"sono italiano di napoli. "</i>

71
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,090
<i>ah... capisco.</i>

72
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,157
<i>mille grazie,
signore.</i>

73
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,192
<i>per fa vore,
signore.</i>

74
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,226
Yes?

75
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,828
<i>non conosceve parliamente</i>

76
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,496
<i>signor, devo me parlo</i>

77
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,399
<i>"sono italiano di napoli"
quando il habitare de milano.</i>

78
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,567
<i>che stupido!</i>

79
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,002
Sorry, I don't understand.

80
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,138
<i>Ah... signor, my
friend is saying...</i>

81
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,640
<i>bitte,
mein herr.</i>

82
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,908
<i>bitte,
bitte.</i>

83
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,944
<i>was ist das wort
fuer "mittelschmerz"?</i>

84
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,779
Helmut, you want
the german classes!

85
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,381
<i>Oh... danke schoen.</i>

86
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,184
<i>Ah, das deutschen klassenzimmer.</i>

87
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,185
Ach!

88
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,390
My friend, he say, he
say, "why must I say

89
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,525
'i am italian
from napoli'?"

90
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,527
When he lives
in milan.

91
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,997
Ah... well, tell your friend
if he lives in milan

92
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,900
<i>He must say,
"sono italiano di milano. "</i>

93
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,303
<i>eh, milano e tanto
meglio di napoli!</i>

94
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,205
<i>che cosa?</i>

95
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,073
<i>si, I milanesi sono
i megli nel mondo!</i>

96
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,009
He say, "milan is
better than napoli."

97
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,311
Well, he shouldn't
be saying that.

98
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,545
We haven't done
comparatives yet.

99
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,046
Yes, mothers,
new improved whizzo butter

100
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,448
Containing 10% more less

101
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,117
Is absolutely indistinguishable
from a dead crab.

102
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,521
Remember, buy whizzo butter
and go to heaven!

103
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,325
I can't tell
the difference

104
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,694
Between whizzo butter
and this dead crab.

105
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:08,896
Yes, you know,
we find

106
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,098
That nine out of ten
british housewives

107
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,599
Can't tell
the difference

108
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,701
Between whizzo butter
and a dead crab.

109
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:15,903
It's true.

110
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,037
It's true, we can't.

111
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:22,276
You're on television,
aren't you?

112
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,510
Yes, yes.

113
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,147
He does that thing
with those silly women

114
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,682
Who can't tell
the difference

115
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,717
Between whizzo butter
and a dead crab.

116
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:31,818
Oh, yes.

117
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,587
You try that around
here, young man

118
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:34,922
And we'll slit
your face.

119
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,258
Yes, with a razor.

120
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,198
Hello, good evening, and welcome

121
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,533
To another edition
of "it's the arts."

122
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,002
We kick off tonight
with the cinema.

123
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,304
Good evening.

124
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,407
One of the most prolific
of film producers

125
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,742
Of this age, or indeed any age

126
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,211
Is sir edward ross.

127
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,212
Back in this country

128
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,913
For the first time
for five years

129
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,448
To open a season
of his works

130
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,916
At the national
film theater.

131
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,818
And we are very
fortunate to have him

132
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,887
With us here in
the studio this evening.

133
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,655
Good evening.

134
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,124
Edward-- you don't mind
if I call you edward.

135
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,292
No, not at all.

136
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,727
Only it does worry some people--

137
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,796
I don't know why-- perhaps
they're a little sensitive

138
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,165
So I do take the precaution
of asking on these occasions.

139
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,700
Oh, no, that's fine.

140
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,901
So "edward" is all right.

141
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:21,935
Splendid, splendid.

142
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,137
Sorry to have brought it up.

143
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,173
No, no, "edward" it is.

144
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,076
Well, thank you very much indeed
for being so helpful

145
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,478
Only it's more than my job's
worth to, er...

146
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,347
Quite, yes.

147
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,215
Makes it rather difficult
to establish a rapport

148
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,717
To put the other person
at their ease.

149
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,518
Quite.

150
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,652
Yes, silly little point

151
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,053
But it does seem to matter.

152
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,588
Still... less said the better.

153
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,591
Um... ted, when you
first started in the...

154
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,860
You don't mind
if I call you ted?

155
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:47,861
No, no, no.

156
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,329
Everyone
calls me ted.

157
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,298
Well, it's shorter,
isn't it?

158
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,299
Yes, it is.

159
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,400
And much less formal.

160
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,601
Ted, edward,
anything.

161
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,636
Splendid, splendid.

162
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,204
Incidentally,
do call me tom.

163
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,872
I don't want you
playing around

164
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,707
With any of this
"thomas" nonsense.

165
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,310
Now, where were we?

166
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,679
Eddie-baby,
when you first...

167
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,680
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,215
I'm sorry,
I don't like

169
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,983
Being called
eddie-baby.

170
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,386
I'm sorry?

171
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,421
I don't like being
called eddie-baby.

172
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:15,923
Did I call you
eddie-baby?

173
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:16,924
Yes, you did.

174
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,025
Now get on with it.

175
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,194
I don't think I did
call you eddie-baby.

176
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,695
You did call me
eddie-baby.

177
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,130
Did I call him
eddie-baby?

178
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,365
Yes! no!

179
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,367
I didn't really
call you eddie-baby

180
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,368
Did i, sweetie?

181
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,703
Don't call me
sweetie!

182
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,138
Can I call you
sugar plum?

183
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:31,805
No!

184
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:32,840
Pussycat?
no!

185
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:33,841
Angel-drawers?

186
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:34,641
No, you may not!

187
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,642
Now, get on with it.

188
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,243
Frank.

189
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,743
What?

190
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:37,611
Can I call
you frank?

191
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,345
Why frank?

192
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,881
It's a nice name.

193
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,350
Robin day's got a hedgehog
called frank.

194
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,852
What's going on?

195
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,454
Frannie, little frannie,
frannie knickers.

196
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:48,488
No, I'm leaving.

197
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,723
I'm leaving--
I'm off.

198
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,359
Tell us about your
latest film, sir edward.

199
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,560
What?

200
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,629
Tell us about
your latest film

201
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,931
If you'd be so kind,
sir edward.

202
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,635
None of this
"pussycat" nonsense?

203
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,636
Promise.

204
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:03,871
Please,
sir edward.

205
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:07,474
My latest film?

206
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,675
Yes, sir edward.

207
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:14,348
Well, the idea, funnily enough,
came from an idea I had

208
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,251
When I first joined
the industry in 1919.

209
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,587
Of course, in those days,
I was only a tea boy.

210
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,090
<i>Oh, shut up!</i>

211
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,459
Sir edward... ross.

212
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:27,194
Now, later in the program

213
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:29,663
We'll be bringing you
a unique event

214
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,532
In the world of modern art.

215
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:35,135
Pablo picasso will be doing
a special painting for us

216
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,671
On this program...
live, on a bicycle.

217
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,006
This is the first time

218
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,341
That picasso has painted
while cycling.

219
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:45,145
But right now it's time to look
at a man whose meteoric rise...

220
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,626
Last week the royal
festival hall saw

221
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,229
The first performance
of a new symphony

222
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:05,365
By one of the world's
leading modern composers

223
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,234
Arthur "two sheds"
jackson.

224
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,569
Mr. jackson.

225
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:09,736
Good evening.

226
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,171
May I just sidetrack you

227
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,739
For one moment, mr. jackson?

228
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,776
This-- what shall I call it?--
nickname of yours...

229
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,643
Oh, yes.

230
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,644
Two sheds.

231
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,413
How did you come by it?

232
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,348
Well, I don't
use it myself.

233
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,785
It's just a few of my
friends call me "two sheds."

234
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:25,786
I see.

235
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,055
And do you in fact
have two sheds?

236
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,489
No, I've only
one shed.

237
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,124
I've had one
for some time.

238
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,727
But a few years ago
I said I was thinking

239
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,129
Of getting another one,
and since then

240
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,599
Some people have
called me "two sheds."

241
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,068
In spite of the fact
that you have only one.

242
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:41,969
Yes.

243
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,637
I see... and
are you thinking

244
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,172
Of purchasing
a second shed?

245
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,907
No.

246
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,442
To bring you in line
with your epithet?

247
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,176
No.

248
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:50,244
I see, I see.

249
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,713
Well, let's return
to your symphony.

250
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,883
Did you write this symphony

251
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,917
In the shed?

252
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,918
No.

253
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,119
Have you written

254
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,688
Any of your recent works
in this shed of yours?

255
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,291
No, it's just a perfectly
ordinary garden shed.

256
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,759
I see.

257
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,762
And you're thinking of
buying this second shed

258
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:09,763
To write in?

259
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,632
No, no, look...
this shed business

260
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,300
It doesn't really
matter at all.

261
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,768
The sheds aren't
important.

262
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,070
It's just a few friends
call me "two sheds"

263
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,639
And that's all
there is to it.

264
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,440
I wish you'd ask me
about me music.

265
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,508
I'm a composer.

266
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,343
People always ask me
about the sheds.

267
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:24,945
They've got it
out of proportion.

268
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,213
I'm fed up
with the sheds.

269
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,615
I wish I'd never got it
in the first place.

270
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,051
I expect you're probably
thinking of selling one.

271
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,286
<i>I will sell one.</i>

272
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,021
Then you'd be arthur
"no sheds" jackson.

273
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,290
Look, forget about the sheds--
they don't matter.

274
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,791
Mr. jackson, I think,
with respect

275
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,459
We ought to talk
about your symphony.

276
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,694
What?

277
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,629
Apparently your
symphony was written

278
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:43,764
For organ and timpani.

279
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:44,731
What's that?

280
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,766
What's what?

281
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,367
It's a shed--
get it off.

282
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,674
All right.

283
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,776
Now, then,
mr. jackson...

284
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:57,044
Your symphony.

285
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,946
I understand
that you used...

286
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:02,082
That you used to be
interested in trainspotting.

287
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,116
What?

288
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,284
I understand

289
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,719
That about 30 years ago

290
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,222
You were extremely interested
in trainspotting.

291
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,591
What's that got to do
with my bloody music?

292
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,592
Are you having

293
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,693
Any trouble from him?

294
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,894
Yes, a little.

295
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,896
Well, we interviewers
are more than a match

296
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,397
For the likes
of you, two sheds.

297
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,600
Yes, make yourself
scarce, two sheds.

298
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,268
This studio
isn't big enough

299
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,536
For the three of us.

300
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,972
Get your own arts
program, you fairy.

301
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:29,243
Arthur "two sheds"
jackson.

302
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,612
Never mind, timmy.

303
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,015
Oh, michael, you're
such a comfort.

304
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,050
Arthur "two sheds"...

305
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,419
Jackson.

306
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:42,356
And now for more news of
the momentous artistic event

307
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,857
When pablo picasso is doing

308
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,059
A specially commissioned
painting for us

309
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,461
Whilst riding a bicycle.

310
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,630
Pablo picasso,
the founder of modern art

311
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,366
Without doubt the greatest
abstract painter ever

312
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,468
For the first time
painting in motion.

313
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:55,903
But first of all

314
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:58,572
Let's have a look
at the route he'll be taking.

315
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,509
Well, picasso will be starting,
david, at chichester here.

316
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:05,179
He'll then cycle
on the a29 to fontwell.

317
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:09,183
He'll then take the a272, which
will bring him on to the a3

318
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,151
Just north of hindhead here.

319
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,354
From then on, pablo has
a straight run on the a3

320
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,891
Until he meets the south
circular at battersea here.

321
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,761
Well, this is a truly
remarkable occasion.

322
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,262
It's the first time

323
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:26,166
That a modern artist of such
stature has taken the a272.

324
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,635
And it'll be very
interesting to see

325
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,038
How he copes
with the heavy traffic

326
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,640
Round the wisborough
green-- vicky.

327
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,510
Well, picasso will be riding
his viking super roadster

328
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,479
With the drop handlebars
and the dual-thread wheel rims.

329
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,782
And with his wiley-prat
20-to-1 synchro-mesh

330
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,483
He should experience
difficulties

331
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,018
On the sort of road surfaces

332
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,920
They just don't
get abroad-- mitzie.

333
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,590
And now for the latest report
on picasso's progress

334
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,758
Over to reg moss
on the guildford bypass.

335
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,461
Well, there's no sign
of picasso at the moment, david

336
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,697
But he should be
through here at any moment.

337
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,098
However, I do have with me

338
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,434
Mr. ron geppo,
british cycling sprint champion

339
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,502
And this
year's winner

340
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,003
Of the derby
doncaster rally.

341
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:05,038
Well, reg, I think
pablo should be all right

342
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,707
Provided he doesn't
attempt anything

343
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:07,841
On the monumental scale

344
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,376
Of some of his
earlier paintings

345
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,378
<i>Like guernica or
mademoiselles d'avignon</i>

346
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,280
<i>Or even his later
war and peace murals</i>

347
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,282
For the temple of peace
chapel at vallauris

348
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,551
Because with this strong head
wind, I don't think

349
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:19,453
Even doug timpson
of manchester harriers

350
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,488
Could paint anything
on that kind of scale.

351
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:22,890
Well, thank
you, ron.

352
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,626
Well, there still seems to be
no sign of picasso

353
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,694
So I'll hand you
back to the studio.

354
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,229
Well, we've just heard

355
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,466
That picasso is approaching the
tolworth roundabout on the a3.

356
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,201
So come in,
sam trench at tolworth.

357
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,203
Well, something certainly
is happening here

358
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,638
At tolworth roundabout, david.

359
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:38,639
I can now see picasso.

360
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:39,907
He's cycling down very hard

361
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,008
Towards the roundabout.

362
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,376
He's about 75, 50 yards away

363
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,777
And I can now see his painting.

364
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:44,778
It's an abstract.

365
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,313
I can see some blue, some purple

366
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,714
Some little black oval shapes.

367
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:48,715
I think I can see...

368
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:49,716
That's not picasso.

369
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,751
That's kandinsky.

370
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,019
Good lord,
you're right!

371
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,954
It's kandinsky,
wasily kandinsky!

372
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,522
And who's this
here with him?

373
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,758
It's braque, georges braque
of the cubists

374
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,093
Painting a bird in flight
over a cornfield

375
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,929
And going very fast
down the hill

376
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:02,930
Towards kingston.

377
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,498
And piet mondrian
just behind

378
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,466
Piet mondrian
the neoplasticist...

379
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,268
Then a gap,
then the main bunch.

380
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,804
Here they come: chagall,
max ernst, miro, dufy

381
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,472
Ben nicholson,
jackson pollock

382
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,374
And bernard buffet
making a break

383
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:15,475
On the outside here.

384
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,944
Brancusi's
going with him.

385
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,146
So is gericault,
fernand leger, delaunay

386
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,682
De kooning... kokoschka's
dropping back here

387
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:22,716
By a little bit

388
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,852
And so's paul klee
dropping back a bit

389
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,887
And, right at the back
of this group

390
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,455
Our very own
kurt schwitters.

391
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,324
Schwitters
is german.

392
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:34,261
As yet absolutely no sign of
pablo picasso.

393
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:37,030
And so, from
tolworth roundabout

394
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,699
Back to the studio.

395
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,439
Well, I think I can
help you there, sam.

396
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,542
We're getting reports in
from the a.a. that picasso...

397
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,143
Picasso has fallen off!

398
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,714
He's fallen off his bicycle on
the b2127 just outside ewhurst

399
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,250
Trying to get a shortcut
through to dorking

400
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,784
Via gomslake and peashall.

401
00:16:57,885 --> 00:17:00,020
Well, picasso is
reported to be unhurt

402
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,055
But the pig has
a slight headache.

403
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,892
And on that note, we
must say good night to you.

404
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:06,293
Picasso has failed

405
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,729
In his first bid for
international cycling fame.

406
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,365
<i>So from all of us here
at the it's the arts studio</i>

407
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,566
It's good night.
good night.

408
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,211
Hold it.

409
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,681
Sit up.

410
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,682
Sit up!

411
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,020
Sit up!

412
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,958
Sit up.

413
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,001
Ooh!

414
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,342
Shh... there's
somebody out there.

415
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,744
Huh?

416
00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:03,851
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.

417
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,186
Help, help me, I'm
trapped in this body.

418
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,421
Oh, please, help me out!

419
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,198
Help me, oh, please,
help me out.

420
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:22,035
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.

421
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,711
I'm free! I'm free! I'm free!

422
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:44,324
Hmm... just
checkin'.

423
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:46,326
Just checkin'.

424
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:58,539
Oh, no you don't.

425
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,534
Ooh!

426
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,139
Shh... somebody out there.

427
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,410
Dobson's bought
it, sir.

428
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:12,513
Porker, eh?

429
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,647
Swine.

430
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:21,021
This man is ernest scribbler,
writer of jokes.

431
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:22,456
In a few moments

432
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:26,426
He will have written the
funniest joke in the world

433
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,830
And, as a consequence,
he will die laughing.

434
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,558
It was obvious
that this joke was lethal.

435
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,626
No one could read it and live.

436
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:25,586
This morning,
shortly after 11:00

437
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,922
Comedy struck this little
house in dibley road.

438
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,557
Sudden, violent comedy.

439
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,759
Police have sealed off the area

440
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:36,496
And scotland yard's crack
inspector is with me now.

441
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,134
I shall enter
the house

442
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,303
And attempt to
remove the joke.

443
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,075
I shall be aided

444
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,943
By the sound
of somber music

445
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,778
Played on
gramophone records

446
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,047
And also by the
chanting of laments

447
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:55,849
By the men of
"q" division.

448
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:01,421
The atmosphere thus created
should protect me

449
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:04,291
In the eventuality
of me reading the joke.

450
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,746
Well, there goes a brave man.

451
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,781
Whether he comes
out alive or not

452
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:29,750
This will surely be remembered

453
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:32,619
As one of the most courageous
and gallant acts

454
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:33,754
In police history.

455
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,336
It was not long before the army
became interested

456
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,638
In the military potential
of the killer joke.

457
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:53,774
Under top security,
the joke was hurried

458
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,342
To a meeting
of allied commanders

459
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:57,377
At the ministry of war.

460
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,431
Top brass were impressed.

461
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,366
Tests on salisbury plain
confirmed

462
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,368
The joke's devastating
effectiveness

463
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:23,103
At a range of up to 50 yards.

464
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,604
Fantastic.

465
00:23:57,638 --> 00:23:59,673
All through the winter of '43

466
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,343
We had translators working
in joke-proof conditions

467
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,747
To try and produce a german
version of the joke.

468
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:10,250
They worked on one word each
for greater safety.

469
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:12,886
One of them saw
two words of the joke

470
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,422
And spent several
weeks in hospital.

471
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:18,725
But apart from that,
things went pretty quickly

472
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,328
And we soon had
the joke by january

473
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:24,631
In a form which our troops
couldn't understand

474
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,867
But which the germans could.

475
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,209
So on july 8, 1944

476
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:39,713
The joke was first told
to the enemy in the ardennes.

477
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:47,054
Squad, get
ready joke!

478
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,360
Squad, tell
the joke!

479
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:58,799
<i>wenn ist das nunstuck
geht und slotermeyer?</i>

480
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:05,939
<i>ja! ba yerhund das oder
die flipperwaldt gespuhrt!</i>

481
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,134
It was a fantastic success

482
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:37,704
Over 60,000 times as powerful
as britain's great prewar joke

483
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:40,541
And one which hitler
just couldn't match.

484
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:45,746
<i>insbesondere keiner mehr der
in deutschland leben wird...</i>

485
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:49,883
<i>wir sind des reiches
junge mannschaft!</i>

486
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,618
<i>eure schule.</i>

487
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:54,521
In action, it was deadly.

488
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:03,564
<i>wenn ist das nunstuck
geht und slotermeyer?</i>

489
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,698
<i>ja! ba yerhund...</i>

490
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:14,508
<i>wenn ist das nunstuck
geht und slotermeyer?</i>

491
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,976
<i>ja! ba yerhund...</i>

492
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:20,047
<i>...nunstuck geht
und slotermeyer?</i>

493
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:25,118
<i>ja! ba yerhund das oder
die flipperwaldt gespuhrt!</i>

494
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:31,959
German casualties
were appalling.

495
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:37,431
What is the big joke?

496
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:39,967
I can only give
you a name, rank

497
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,203
And "why did the chicken
cross the road?"

498
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,638
That's not funny.

499
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:48,208
I want to know the joke!

500
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:49,877
All right.

501
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:54,548
How do you make
a nazi cross?

502
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:55,649
I don't know.

503
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:58,085
How do you make
a nazi cross?

504
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,720
Tread on his corns.

505
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,722
<i>gott im himmel!</i>

506
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,824
That's not funny!

507
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:11,932
Now, if you don't
tell me the joke

508
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:14,535
I shall hit
you properly.

509
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:17,371
I can stand physical
pain, you know.

510
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:18,906
<i>ach, you're no fun!</i>

511
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,274
All right, otto!

512
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,912
Oh, no-- no, anything
but that, please.

513
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:25,946
Tickle him.

514
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,118
All right, I'll tell you.

515
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:33,187
Quick-- otto,
the typewriter!

516
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:42,863
<i>wenn ist das nunstuck
geht und slotermeyer?</i>

517
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:48,268
<i>ja! ba yerhund das oder
die flipperwaldt gespuhrt!</i>

518
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:03,250
That's not funny!

519
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:11,091
<i>die flipperwaldt
gespuhrt!</i>

520
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,033
<i>was ist,
was gibt's?</i>

521
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,435
<i>wenn ist das nunstuck</i>

522
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:22,569
<i>geht und slotermeyer?</i>

523
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:24,671
<i>ja! ba yerhund das oder

524
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:25,873
Hmm?

525
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:30,611
In peenemunde
in the autumn of '44

526
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:33,146
The germans were working
on a joke of their own.

527
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,319
<i>die ist ein kinderhunder</i>

528
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,688
<i>und zwei mackeluber</i>

529
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:44,858
<i>und bitte schon ist

530
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:47,160
<i>"nein, "zweckt der herren.</i>

531
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:50,197
<i>"istauf'n borger
mitzweitingen. "</i>

532
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,837
We'll let
you know.

533
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,208
But by december,
their joke was ready.

534
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,643
And hitler gave the order

535
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:05,145
For the german v-joke
to be broadcast in english.

536
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:12,119
<i>There were zwei peanuts
walking down the strasse</i>

537
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:15,088
and one was assaulted... peanut.

538
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:24,231
In 1945, peace broke out.

539
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:27,367
It was the end of the joke.

540
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,269
Joke warfare was banned

541
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:33,907
At a special session of the
geneva convention, and in 1950

542
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:38,078
The last remaining copy
of the joke was laid to rest

543
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,681
Here in the berkshire
countryside

544
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:42,616
Never to be told again.

545
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:45,379
And here is the final score:
pigs 9, british bipeds 4.

546
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:49,516
The pigs go on to meet
vicki carr in the final.
