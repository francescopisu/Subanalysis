1
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,502
It's...

2
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:39,106
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

3
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,411
Good afternoon.

4
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,246
Afternoon.

5
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,881
Ah... lovely day,
isn't it?

6
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,549
Ar... 'tis that.

7
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,053
Are you here
on holiday or...?

8
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,721
No, no, I live here.

9
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,157
Oh, jolly good.

10
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,262
<i>I say, those are sheep,
aren't they?</i>

11
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,763
Ar.

12
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,266
Yes, yes, of course,
I thought so.

13
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,102
Only... why are they
up in the trees?

14
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,105
A fair question

15
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,940
And one that
in recent weeks

16
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,509
Has been much
on my mind.

17
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,177
It is my
considered opinion

18
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,612
That they're nesting.

19
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,613
Nesting?

20
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:54,948
Like birds?

21
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,116
Ar... exactly.

22
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,552
Birds is the key
to the whole problem.

23
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,522
It's my belief
that these sheep are laboring

24
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,525
Under the misapprehension
that they're birds.

25
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,193
Observe their behavior.

26
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,495
Take for a start
the sheep's tendency

27
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,031
To hop about the field
on their back legs.

28
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:18,639
Now witness their attempts
to fly from tree to tree.

29
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,708
Notice they do not
so much fly as plummet.

30
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,848
Observe, for example,
that ewe in that oak tree.

31
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,384
She is clearly trying
to teach her lamb to fly.

32
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,257
Talk about the blind
leading the blind.

33
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,726
But why do they think
they're birds?

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,228
Another fair question.

35
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,663
One thing is for sure:

36
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,998
A sheep is not
a creature of the air.

37
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,600
It has enormous
difficulty

38
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,436
In the comparatively
simple act of perching.

39
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,773
As you see.

40
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,543
As for flight, its body
is totally unadapted

41
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,946
To the problems
of aviation.

42
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,582
Trouble is,
sheep are very dim.

43
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,617
And once they get an idea
into their heads

44
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,085
There's no shifting it.

45
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,854
But where do they get
the idea from?

46
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:07,955
From harold.

47
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,890
He's that sheep over
there under the elm.

48
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,193
He's that most dangerous
of animals--

49
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,229
A clever sheep.

50
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,597
He's the ringleader.

51
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,699
He's realized
the sheep's life consists

52
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,701
Of standing around
for a few months

53
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,869
And then being eaten.

54
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,004
And that's
a depressing prospect

55
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,906
For an ambitious sheep.

56
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,376
He's patently hit
on the idea of escape.

57
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,079
But why don't you just
get rid of harold?

58
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,249
Because of the enormous
commercial possibilities

59
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,050
Should he succeed.

60
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,385
<i>and what exactlyare</i>

61
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,888
<i>the commercial possibilities
of a vine a viation?</i>

62
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:41,989

We get a lot of french people
around here.

00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,117
Oh, yes.

114
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,452
All over, yes.

115
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,853
And how do
you get on

116
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:20,921
With these
french people?

117
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:21,955
Oh, very well.

118
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,956
So do i.

Yes, yes.

122
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,127
Yes, I like them.

123
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,463

well, don't they?

Mm, blaise

Yes, voltaire.

128
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,469
Ooh.

129
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,670
Rene
descartes.

130
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:40,140
Hmm... hmm.

131
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,141
Hmm!

132
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,382
And now for something
completely different--

133
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,917
A man with three buttocks.

134
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,087
Good evening.

135
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,256
I have with me
mr. arthur frampton

136
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,025
Who has...

137
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:02,996
Mr. frampton, I understand
that you, as it were

138
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,531
Have...

139
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,466
Well, let me put it
another way.

140
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,968
I believe, mr. frampton

141
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,170
That whereas
most people have two...

142
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,205
Two...

143
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:14,775
You... you.

144
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,243
I'm sorry?

145
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,344
Ah, yes...
yes, I see.

146
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,046
Um... are you
quite comfortable?

147
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,480
Yes, fine, thank you.

148
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,149
Um... mr. frampton...

149
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,453
Vis-a-vis your rump.

150
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,588
I beg your pardon?

151
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,755
Your rump.

152
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:29,857
What?

153
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,192
Your... posterior.

154
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,328
Derriere.

155
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,396
Sit-upon.

156
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,264
What's that?

157
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,999
Buttocks.

158
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,133
Oh, me bum!

159
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,235
Shh.

160
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:46,640
Well, mr. frampton,
I understand, mr. frampton

161
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,509
You have a 50% bonus

162
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,211
In the region
of what you said.

163
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,246
I've got three cheeks.

164
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,747
Yes, yes,
splendid, splendid.

165
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,749
Well, we were wondering,
mr. frampton

166
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,684
If you could
see your way clear...

167
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,152
Here, what's that
camera doing?

168
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,154
Nothing, nothing,
nothing at all, mister.

169
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,624
We were wondering if you
could see your way clear

170
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,058
To giving us a quick...

171
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,694
A quick visual...

172
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,934
Mr. frampton, will you take
your trousers down?

173
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,202
What? get off!

174
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,670
I'm not taking me trousers off
on television.

175
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,671
Please take them down.

176
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:18,672
No.

177
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,673
Just a little bit.

178
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:20,674
No.

179
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,042
Now...

180
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,644
Now, look here, mr. frampton

181
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,546
It's perfectly easy for somebody

182
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,481
Just to come along here
to the bbc

183
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,183
Simply claiming that they have

184
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,318
A bit to spare
in the botty department.

185
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,254
The point is, mr. frampton,
our viewers need proof.

186
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,856
I've been
on persian radio.

187
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,057
Get off!

188
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,626
Arthur figgis knows
I've got three buttocks.

189
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:40,661
How?

190
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,696
We go cycling
together.

191
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,500
'strewth!

192
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,403
And now for something
completely different--

193
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,405
A man with three buttocks.

194
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,008
Good evening.

195
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,244
I have with me
mr. arthur frampton who...

196
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,083
Mr. frampton, I understand
that you, as it were

197
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,185
Have...

198
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,287
Well, let me put it
another way.

199
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,791
I believe, mr. frampton,
that whereas most people...

200
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,761
Didn't we do this just now?

201
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:15,762
Why, yes.

202
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,197
Well, why didn't you say so?

203
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,199
I thought it was
a continental version.

204
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,802
And now for something
completely the same--

205
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,337
A man with three buttocks.

206
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,041
Hello.

207
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,177
Oh, did we?

208
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,147
And now for something
completely different--

209
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,682
A man with three noses.

210
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,551
He's not here yet!

211
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,120
Two noses?

212
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,203
Ladies and gentlemen,
wasn't she just great, eh?

213
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,538
Wasn't she just great?

214
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,341
And she can run as fast
as she can sing.

215
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,879
And I'm telling you
because I know.

216
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,714
No, only kidding.

217
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,421
Seriously now,
ladies and gentlemen

218
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:18,825
We have for you one of the most
unique acts in the world today.

219
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,561
He's... well, I'll say no more

220
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,629
And just let you see
for yourselves.

221
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,066
Ladies and gentlemen, my very
great privilege to introduce

222
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,402
Arthur ewing
and his musical mice!

223
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,504
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

224
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,374
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have in this box

225
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,010
23 white mice--

226
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,681
Mice which have been
painstakingly trained

227
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:46,220
Over the past few years
to squeak at a selected pitch.

228
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,523
This is e-sharp.

229
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,059
And this one is g.

230
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,194
You get the general idea.

231
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:58,565
Now, these mice are so arranged
upon this rack

232
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,401
That when played
in the correct order

233
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:06,874
They will squeak
"the bells of st. mary."

234
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,844
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you, on the mouse organ

235
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,046
"the bells of st. mary."

236
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,581
Thank you.

237
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,655
Oh, my god!

238
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,723
Oh, stop him!

239
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,824
Stop him!

240
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,330
For god's sake,
stop him!

241
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,035
Next.

242
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,193
Are you the marriage
guidance counselor?

243
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,327
Yes-- good morning.

244
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,728
Morning, sir.

245
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,631
And good morning to you,
madam.

246
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,234
Name?

247
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:10,871
Mr. and mrs. arthur pewtey...
pewtey.

248
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:14,041
And what is the name
of your ravishing wife?

249
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,409
Wait!

250
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,910
Don't tell me.

251
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,279
It's something
to do with moonlight.

252
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,747
It goes with her eyes.

253
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,250
It's soft and gentle,
warm and yielding

254
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,853
Deeply lyrical and yet
tender and frightened

255
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,287
Like a tiny white rabbit.

256
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,288
It's deirdre.

257
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,994
Deirdre...
what a beautiful name.

258
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,463
What a beautiful,
beautiful name.

259
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,968
And what seems
to be the trouble

260
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,302
With your marriage,
mr. pewtey?

261
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,904
Well, it all started
about five years ago.

262
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,806
We started going on holiday
to brighton together.

263
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,307
Deirdre, that's my wife,
has always been

264
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:48,709
A very good
companion to me.

265
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,911
I never particularly anticipated
any marital strife.

266
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,246
Indeed, the very idea

267
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,147
Of consulting a professional
marital advisor

268
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,583
Has always been of
the greatest repugnance to me.

269
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:57,951
Although, far be it from me

270
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:00,387
To impugn the nature of
your trade or profession.

271
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,522
Do go on.

272
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,825
Well, as I say, we've always
been good friends

273
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,760
Sharing the interests,
the gardening and so on

274
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,028
The model airplanes

275
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,429
The sixpenny bottle
for the holiday money

276
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:10,797
And, indeed,
twice in the month

277
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,633
Setting down in the evening
to do the accounts

278
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,701
Something which deirdre...
deirdre, that's my wife

279
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,004
Particularly looked forward to
on account of her feet.

280
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,839
I should probably have
said at the outset

281
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,175
That I'm noted for having
something of a sense of humor

282
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,242
Although I've kept myself

283
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,011
Pretty much to myself
over the last two years

284
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,245
Notwithstanding, as it were.

285
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,481
And it's only been
comparatively recently

286
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,016
That I've begun
to realize...

287
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,652
Well, perhaps "realize" is
not the correct word.

288
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,221
Imagine... imagine

289
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:38,692
That I was not the only thing
in her life.

290
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,060
You suspected your wife?

291
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,031
Well, yes... yes.

292
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,166
At first, frankly, yes.

293
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,702
Her behavior did seem
at the time to me

294
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,771
Who was, after all,
there to see

295
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:52,005
To be a little odd.

296
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,207
Odd?

297
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,842
Yes, well, I mean, to
a certain extent, yes.

298
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,510
I'm not by nature
a suspicious person--

299
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:57,544
Far from it.

300
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:58,879
I have something
of a reputation

301
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,881
As an after-dinner speaker,
if you take my meaning.

302
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,516
Yes, I certainly do.

303
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,218
Anyway, in the area
where I'm known

304
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,353
People, in fact, know me
extremely well.

305
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,387
Right.

306
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:09,556
Will you hold this?

307
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,691
Thank you.

308
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:11,758
Yes-- anyway,
as I said

309
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,360
I must learn to
face up to the facts

310
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:14,595
Stop beating
about the bush

311
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:15,696
Or I'd never
look myself

312
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,064
In the bathroom
mirror again.

313
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,499
Anyway, so...

314
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,235
Would you mind running
along for ten minutes?

315
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,269
No, no.

316
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,270
Make it half an hour.

317
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,673
Yes, I'll wait outside,
shall i?

318
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:30,177
Yes, well, that's perhaps
the best thing, yes.

319
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,548
Certainly put my mind
at rest on...

320
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:37,351
On one or two... points there.

321
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:45,259
Now, wait
there, stranger.

322
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,562
A man can run and run
for year after year.

323
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,864
Till he realizes

324
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,834
That what he's
running from is hisself.

325
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:54,835
Gosh!

326
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,404
Now, a man's
got to do

327
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,839
What a man's
got to do

328
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,208
And there ain't
no sense in running.

329
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,944
Now, you got to turn
and you got to fight

330
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,113
And you got to
hold your head up high.

331
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,214
Yes!

332
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,449
Now, you go back
in there, my son

333
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,484
And be a man.

334
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:12,219
Walk tall.

335
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,253
Yes.

336
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,490
Oh, I will!

337
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,158
I will!

338
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,594
I've been pushed around
long enough.

339
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,563
This is it.

340
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,399
This is your moment,
arthur pewtey.

341
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,568
This is it, arthur pewtey.

342
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,203
At last...

343
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,504
You're a man!

344
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,444
All right, deirdre,
come out of there!

345
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,579
Go away!

346
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,746
Right, right.

347
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,803
These historic pictures
of queen victoria

348
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,239
Taken in 1880 at osborne

349
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,774
Show the queen with gladstone.

350
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:11,378
This unique film provides
a rare glimpse

351
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:15,749
Into the private world of a
woman who ruled half the earth.

352
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:19,219
The commentary, recorded
on the earliest wax cylinders

353
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:24,091
Is spoken by alfred lord
tennyson, the poet laureate.

354
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,894
Well, hello,
it's the wacky queen again...

355
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,362
And who's the other fella?

356
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,863
It's willy gladstone

357
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,833
And when these two way-out
wacky characters get together

358
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,668
There's fun aplenty.

359
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,171
And, uh-oh, there's a hose pipe.

360
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,439
This means trouble for somebody.

361
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:42,109
Uh-oh, charlie gardener's
fallen for that old trick.

362
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,077
Queenie's put him
in a heap of trouble.

363
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,647
Uh-oh, that's one in the eye
for willy.

364
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,815
"here, you have a go."

365
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:01,395
"well, doggone it,
where's that water?"

366
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,932
Uh-oh, there it is,
all over his face.

367
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:16,310
Well, hello, what's britain's
wacky queen up to now?

368
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:20,080
Well, she's certainly not sitting
on the fence... she's painting it.

369
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,983
Surely nothing
can go wrong here.

370
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,386
Uh-oh, here's the p.m.,
coming back for more.

371
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,288
And he certainly gets it.

372
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,973
Well, that's one way
to get the housework done.

373
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,637
Oh, dad, look
who's come to see us!

374
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,838
It's our ken.

375
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,208
Ah, and about bloody
time, if you ask me.

376
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,377
Aren't you pleased
to see me, father?

377
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,612
Yes, of course he's
pleased to see you, ken.

378
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,614
All right, woman, all right.

379
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,650
I've got a tongue in me head.

380
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,118
I'll do the talking.

381
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,219
Bligh!

382
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,754
I like your fancy suit.

383
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:36,757
Is that what they're wearing
up in yorkshire now?

384
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,458
It's just
an ordinary suit, father.

385
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,627
It's all I've got,
apart from the overalls.

386
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:41,795
How are
you liking it

387
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:42,863
Down the
mine, ken?

388
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,398
Oh, it's not too bad, mum.

389
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,934
We're using some new
tungsten carbide drills

390
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,903
For the preliminary
coal-face scouring operations.

391
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:51,405
Oh, that sounds
nice, dear.

392
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,473
Tungsten carbide drills?

393
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,611
What the bloody hell is
tungsten carbide drills?

394
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:00,147
It's something they use
in coal mining, father.

395
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,182
"it's something they use
in coal mining, father."

396
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,651
Your bloody fancy talk
since you left london.

397
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:05,719
Not that again.

398
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:07,454
He's had
a hard day, dear.

399
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,722
His new play opens

400
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,757
At national
theatre tomorrow.

401
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,226
Oh, that's good.

402
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,360
Good?! good?!

403
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,895
What do you know about it?

404
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:17,431
What do you know about getting
up at 5:00 in the morning

405
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,933
To fly to paris, back at
the old vic for drinks at 12:00

406
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:21,435
Sweating the day

407
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,537
Through press interviews,
television interviews

408
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,206
Then getting back here at 10:00
to wrestle with the problem

409
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,141
Of an homosexual
nymphomaniac drug addict

410
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,510
Involved in the ritual murder

411
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,111
Of a well-known
scottish footballer?

412
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,579
That's a full working day, lad!

413
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,680
And don't you forget it!

414
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,749
Oh, don't shout
at the boy, father.

415
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:38,952
Hampstead wasn't good enough
for you, was it?

416
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:42,189
You had to go poncing off
to barnsley.

417
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,259
You and your
coal-mining friends.

418
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,795
Coal mining is
a wonderful thing, father.

419
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,198
But it's something
you'll never understand.

420
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,199
Just look at you.

421
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,333
Oh, ken, be careful!

422
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,801
You know what he's like

423
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:56,570
After a few novels.

424
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,105
Go on, lad, go on.

425
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,974
Out with it--
what's wrong with me?

426
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:02,976
Your tit!

427
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,811
I'll tell you
what's wrong with you.

428
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:06,880
Your head's addled
with novels and poems.

429
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:08,182
You come home
every evening

430
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,683
Reeling of
chateau la tour.

431
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:10,784
Don't, don't!

432
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,319
And look what you've
done to mother.

433
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,354
She's worn out with meeting film
stars, attending premieres

434
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,556
And giving
gala luncheons.

435
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,492
There's nowt wrong
with gala luncheons, lad!

436
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,327
I've had more
gala luncheons

437
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,196
Than you've had
hot dinners.

438
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,297
Oh, please, please.

439
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,599
Oh, no!

440
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,600
What is it?

441
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,036
Oh, it's his
writer's cramp.

442
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,537
You never told
me about this.

443
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,105
No, we didn't
like to, kenny.

444
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,107
I'm all right,
I'm all right, woman.

445
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:35,475
Just get him
out of here!

446
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,044
Oh, ken, you'd better go.

447
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,178
All right,
I'm going.

448
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,813
After all
we've done for him.

449
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,114
One day you'll realize

450
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,050
There's more
to life than culture.

451
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,652
There's dirt and smoke
and good, honest sweat!

452
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,521
Get out, get out,
you laborer!

453
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:51,825
Hey, you know, mother?

454
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:53,427
I think there's
a play there.

455
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,661
Get agent
on the phone.

456
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:56,563
Aye, I think
you're right, frank.

457
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:57,664
It could express...

458
00:19:58,966 --> 00:19:59,933
It could express

459
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,268
A vital theme
of our age.

460
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:04,171
Oh, shut up!

461
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,106
Shut up!

462
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,341
Well, that's better.

463
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,409
Now, for something
completely different--

464
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:10,844
A man with three buttocks.

465
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:11,979
We've done that!

466
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,983
Oh, all right, all right!

467
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:18,986
A man with... nine legs.

468
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,153
He ran away!

469
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,122
Oh, bloody hell.

470
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:26,560
Uh...

471
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,262
A scotsman on a horse.

472
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,781
Harold!

473
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:49,183
Come back, harold!

474
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,184
Harold!

475
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:51,718
Come back, harold.

476
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,220
Oh, blast!

477
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:12,506
<i>Good evening, and welcome
once again to the epilogue.</i>

478
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:18,412
On the program this evening

483
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,455

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,598
Good evening.

488
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,567
Tonight, instead of discussing

489
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:44,037
The existence
or nonexistence of god

490
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:46,273
They have decided
to fight for it--

491
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:49,476
The existence or nonexistence
to be determined

492
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,912
By two falls, two submissions
or a knockout.

493
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:55,249
All right, boys,
let's get to it.

494
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,851

From wigan, dr. tom jack.

507
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:46,433
Now, dr. jack's got
the flying mare there.

508
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,701
Flying mare there.

509
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:48,936
What's he doing?

510
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:51,138
And this is going
to be a full body slam.

511
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,272
Full body slam there.

512
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,874
And he's going in again.

513
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,576
No, he's standing back.

514
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:59,079
Well, there we're...

515
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:02,349
<i>We're leaving the epilogue
for the moment.</i>

516
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,785
We'll be bringing you the result

517
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:05,919
Later on in the program.

518
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,288
Oh, my god!

519
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,125
Oh!

520
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:34,448
Oh!

521
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:36,483
Isn't he an impressive
figure of a man?

522
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:39,119
People all over the country...

523
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,889
...defacement of public property

524
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:44,224
And this sort of thing
has got to be stopped.

525
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:46,827
Destruction, defacement
has got to be put to an end.

526
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,295
This country is not standing

527
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:50,297
For vandals and hooligans
running about.

528
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:56,770
Oh, yes, that's much better.

529
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:04,745
Oh, isn't he
a lovely little...

530
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:13,086
Oh, isn't he
a lovely little...

531
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:24,431
Oh, isn't he
a lovely little...

532
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:26,600
Wait a minute, buckaroos.

533
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,535
This has gone far enough.

534
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:29,803
Look out!

535
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,104
Get away from me!

536
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:35,576
Get it away,
get it away!

537
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,510
Yes, the mouse problem.

538
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:45,145
<i>This week, the world around us</i>

539
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:48,182
Looks at the growing social
phenomenon of mice and men.

540
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:51,785
What makes a man
want to be a mouse?

541
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:55,622
Well, uh, it's
not a question

542
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,758
Of wanting
to be a mouse.

543
00:25:57,824 --> 00:26:01,228
It just sort of
happens to you.

544
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:06,200
All of a sudden,
you realize

545
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,302
That's what
you want to be.

546
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:10,437
And when did
you first notice

547
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:12,840
These, shall we say,
tendencies?

548
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:15,509
Well, I was about 17

549
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:20,480
And some mates and
me went to a party

550
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:23,617
And, uh, well, we had
quite a lot to drink

551
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:27,521
And then some of
the fellows there

552
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:31,024
Started handing cheese around.

553
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:38,966
Well, just out of curiosity,
I tried a bit and...

554
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,234
Well, that was that.

555
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,703
Yes, and what else
did these fellows do?

556
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:49,676
Well, uh,
some of them started...

557
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,211
Dressing up as mice a bit.

558
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,246
Um...

559
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:57,584
And then when they
got the costumes on, they...

560
00:26:57,618 --> 00:27:00,020
Started squeaking.

561
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,054
Was that all?

562
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,189
That was all.

563
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:03,924
And what was your
reaction to this?

564
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:04,992
Well, I was shocked.

565
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,026
Yes.

566
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,027
But, uh...

567
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:10,697
Gradually I came to feel

568
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:14,101
That I was more at ease
with other mice.

569
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,571
A typical case, whom
we shall refer to as mr. "a."

570
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,773
Although his real name is this.

571
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:29,449
What is it that attracts someone like
mr. "a" to this way of life?

572
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:31,818
I have with me
a consultant psychiatrist.

573
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:34,021
Well, we've just heard

574
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,423
A typical case history.

575
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:41,061
I myself have over 700 similar
histories, all fully documented.

576
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:42,963
Would you care
to choose one?

577
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:52,806
Mr... arthur aldridge
of livington.

578
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:54,908
Well, that's amazing.

579
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:56,276
Thank you.

580
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,611
Amazing...
thank you, janet.

581
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:08,322
Kargol, speaking
as a psychiatrist

582
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:10,224
As opposed
to a con jurer...

583
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:11,358
Oh.

584
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:14,394
What makes certain men
want to be mice?

585
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:16,763
Well, we psychiatrists
have found

586
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:21,235
That over eight percent of the population
will always be mice.

587
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,538
I mean, after all, there's something
of the mouse in all of us.

588
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:27,140
I mean, how many of us
can honestly say

589
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:31,912
That at one time or another, he hasn't
felt sexually attracted to mice?

590
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:34,648
I know I have.

591
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:37,885
I mean, most normal adolescents
go through a stage

592
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:40,420
Of squeaking
two or three times a day.

593
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:42,356
Most youngsters,
on the other hand

594
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,759
Some youngsters, are attracted to it
by its very illegality.

595
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,828
It's like murder.

596
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:51,265
Make a thing illegal,
and it acquires a mystique.

597
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:52,432
Look at arson.

598
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,468
I mean, how many of us
can honestly say

599
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,836
That at one time
or another

600
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:58,272
He hasn't set fire
to some great public building?

601
00:28:58,305 --> 00:28:59,907
I know I have.

602
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:05,145
The only way, the only way
to bring the crime figures down

603
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:07,181
Is to reduce
the number of offenses.

604
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:08,615
Get it out in the open.

605
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:09,950
I know I have.

606
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:12,452
Hmm... the amazing kargol
and janet.

607
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,555
What a lot of people
don't realize is

608
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:16,156
That a mouse, once accepted

609
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:18,625
Can fulfill
a very useful role in society.

610
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,195
Indeed, there are examples
throughout history

611
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,664
Of famous men now known
to have been mice.

612
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:27,034
<i>veni, vidi, vici.</i>

613
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:41,615
And of course, hilaire belloc.

614
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,251
But what is the attitude...

615
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:45,819
Of the man in the street
towards...

616
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,022
This growing social problem?

617
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,057
I'm down on them.

618
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,458
I'd strangle them.

619
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:54,928
Well, speaking as
a member of the stock exchange

620
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:57,865
I would suck their brains out
with a straw

621
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:01,034
Sell the widows and orphans
and go into south american zinc.

622
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:04,938
Yeah, I'd stuff sparrows
down their throats

623
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:08,742
Until the beaks stuck out
through the stomach walls.

624
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,644
Oh, well,
I'm a chartered accountant

625
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:13,113
And consequently too boring
to be of interest.

626
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:16,383
I feel that these
poor, unfortunate people

627
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:22,256
Should be free to live
the lives of their own choice.

628
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:26,059
I'd, uh, split their nostrils
open with a boat hook, I think.

629
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:28,262
Oh, well, I mean,
they can't help it, can they?

630
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,464
But, I mean, there's
nothing you can do about it

631
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:31,932
So I'd kill them.

632
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:35,269
Clearly the british public's
view is a hostile one.

633
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:36,436
Hostile.

634
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:40,741
But perhaps this is because
so little is generally known

635
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:41,875
Of these mice men.

636
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:43,410
We have some film now

637
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:45,646
Taken at one of the notorious
weekend mouse parties

638
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,681
Where these disgusting
little perverts meet.

639
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:51,318
Mr. "a" tells us
what actually goes on

640
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:52,653
At these mouse parties.

641
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,621
Well, uh, first of all

642
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:56,890
You get shown
to your own private hole

643
00:30:56,957 --> 00:30:58,292
In the skirting board.

644
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:04,665
Then you put
the mouse skin on... uh...

645
00:31:04,731 --> 00:31:08,902
Then you scurry
into the main room

646
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:11,939
And perhaps take
a run in the wheel.

647
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,109
The remainder of this film
was taken secretly

648
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:18,011
At one of these mouse parties

649
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,247
By a bbc cameraman
posing as a vole.

650
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:23,584
As usual, we apologize for
the poor quality of the film.

651
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:29,857
Well, uh, then you steal
some cheese-- brie or camembert

652
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:33,827
Or cheddar or gouda,
if you're on the harder stuff.

653
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:37,297
You might go and see
one of the blue cheese films.

654
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:43,036
Then there's a big clock
in the middle of the room

655
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:48,075
And about 12:50,
you climb up it and then...

656
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:51,278
Eventually it strikes one
and you all run down.

657
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:52,946
What's that?

658
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,182
That's the farmer's wife.

659
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,751
Perhaps we need to know
more of these mice men

660
00:31:57,818 --> 00:31:59,620
Before we can really judge them.

661
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:00,988
Perhaps not.

662
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:02,756
Anyway, our 30 minutes are up.

663
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:09,696
Good night.

664
00:32:24,845 --> 00:32:28,282
<i>And here is the result
of the epilogue:</i>

665
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:30,717
God exists
by two falls to a submission.
