1
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,540
It's...

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:10,377
<i>Monty python's flying circus.</i>

3
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:49,683
<i>senores, senoras y senoritas,
buenas noches.</i>

4
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,752
<i>buenas noches.</i>

5
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,756
<i>esta noche presentamos
con mucho gusto</i>

6
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:00,294
<i>informacion interesante
acerca de la llama.</i>

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,929
<i>la llama!</i>

8
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,096
Ay-ya!

9
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,172
<i>amazonas!</i>

10
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,974
Pa-pa-pa!

11
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,452
<i>ole!</i>

12
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,078
<i>cuidado, llamas!</i>

13
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:08,128
<i>cuidado, cuidado, cuidado,
cuidado las llamas.</i>

14
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,864
<i>ole!</i>

15
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,548
Fine.

16
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,651
Okay.

17
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,420
And now for something
completely different:

18
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,956
A man with a tape recorder
up his nose.

19
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,896
And now for something
completely different:

20
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:20,267
The office
of sir george head, o.b.e.

21
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:22,903
Next, please.

22
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,879
Ah, one at a time, please.

23
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,681
There is only me, sir.

24
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,754
So there is.

25
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,822
Ah, take a, um...

26
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,157
Seat?

27
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,692
Seat, seat--
take a seat.

28
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,027
So, you want to join

29
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,496
My mountaineering
expedition, do you?

30
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,033
Me, sir?

31
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,168
Yes.

32
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,136
Yes, I'd very much
like to, sir.

33
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,504
Jolly good,
jolly good.

34
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,572
And how about you?

35
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,042
There is only me, sir.

36
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,416
Well, bang goes
his application then.

37
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,717
Now, let me
fill you in.

38
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,920
I'm leading
this expedition

39
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,922
And we're
going to climb

40
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,257
Both peaks of
mount kiliman jaro.

41
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,561
I thought there was
only one peak, sir.

42
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,935
Well, that'll
save a bit of time.

43
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,002
Well, then.

44
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,438
Now, the object of
this expedition is

45
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,840
To see if we can find

46
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,275
Any traces of last
year's expedition.

47
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:38,712
Last year's expedition?

48
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,480
Yes, my brother
was leading that.

49
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,815
They were
going to build

50
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,450
A bridge between
the two peaks.

51
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,723
My idea,
I'm afraid.

52
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,225
Now, I ought
to tell you

53
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,160
That I have practically
everyone

54
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,062
That I need for
this expedition.

55
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,664
So what special qualifications
do you have?

56
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,799
Well, sir...

57
00:04:58,866 --> 00:04:59,833
Yes, you first.

58
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,168
There is
only me, sir.

59
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,669
I wasn't
talking to you.

60
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:03,770
Carry on.

61
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:07,140
Well, I'm a fully
qualified mountaineer.

62
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,141
Mountaineer?

63
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,444
Mountaineer?

64
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:16,650
Mound... mountain...

65
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,085
A mountaineer:

66
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,521
Two men skilled in
climbing mountains.

67
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,557
Jolly good,
well, you're in.

68
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,025
Congratulations.

69
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,059
Both of you.

70
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,228
Now, what are
your names?

71
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,263
Arthur wilson.

72
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,964
Arthur wilson, right.

73
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,468
Well, look, I'll call
you arthur wilson one

74
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,802
And you
arthur wilson two

75
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,137
Just to avoid
confusion.

76
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,706
Are you actually leading this
expedition, sir?

77
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,774
Yes, we are leading

78
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,209
This expedition
to africa.

79
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,812
And what routes will
you both be taking?

80
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:46,813
Good questions.

81
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,814
Shall i?

82
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,815
Fine.

83
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,619
Well, we'll be
leaving on january 22

84
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,055
And taking the
following routes:

85
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,723
The a23s through purleys

86
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,693
Down onto the main roads
near purbrights--

87
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,096
Avoiding leatherheads--
and then taking the a231s

88
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,666
Entering rottingdeans
from the north.

89
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,803
From rottingdeans, we go
through africa to nairobis.

90
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,840
We take the south road
out of nairobis

91
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,409
For about 12 miles and then ask.

92
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,045
Does anyone speak
swahili, sir?

93
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,380
Oh, yes, I think most
of them do down there.

94
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,584
<i>Does anyone in our party
speak swahili, sir?</i>

95
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,686
Well, matron's got a smattering.

96
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,554
Apart from the two matrons...

97
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,022
Good god, i
forgot about her.

98
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,891
Apart from them,
who else is coming

99
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,125
On the expedition, sir?

100
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,128
Well, we've got
the arthur brown twins

101
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,197
Two botanists
called machin

102
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,733
The william
johnston brothers...

103
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,567
Two of them.

104
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:41,568
No, four of them--

105
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,769
Pair of
identical twins.

106
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,838
And a couple of the
ken spinoza quads.

107
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,240
The other two
pulled out.

108
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,574
And, of course,
you two.

109
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,243
And none of these
are mountaineers?

110
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,477
Well, you two are.

111
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,546
And we've got
a brace of guides

112
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,114
Called jimmy blenkinsop

113
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:57,050
Because kiliman jaro's a pretty
tricky climb, you know.

114
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,051
Most of it's up

115
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,753
Till you reach
the very, very top

116
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,222
And then it tends to slope
away rather sharply.

117
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,057
But jimmy's put
his heads together

118
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,692
And worked out
a way up-- jimmy?

119
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,994
I don't believe
you've met.

120
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,595
Jimmy blenkinsop,
arthur wilson.

121
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,197
Arthur wilson,
jimmy blenkinsop.

122
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,232
Arthur wilson two,
jimmy blenkinsop one.

123
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,234
Jimmy blenkinsop one,
arthur wilson two.

124
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,235
Carry on, jimmys.

125
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,737
Don't worry
about the, uh...

126
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,005
We'll get him
up somehow.

127
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,740
Now, the approach
to kiliman jaro

128
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,142
Is, quite simply,
over the foothills.

129
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,911
And then we go
on after that

130
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,245
Up to set a base camp

131
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,649
Somewhere in the region
of the bottom of the glacier

132
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,951
When after the
glacier we'll find...

133
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,857
And of course, we have this
rather difficult climb...

134
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,409
You'll be leading
the first assault.

135
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,211
Well, I'm afraid
I shan't be coming

136
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,712
On your expedition, sir

137
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,815
As I've absolutely no confidence
in anyone involved in it.

138
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,820
Oh dear.

139
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:07,955
Well, how about you?

140
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,823
Well, I'm game, sir.

141
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,593
So are we.

142
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,232
And now for something
completely different:

143
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,235
A man with a tape recorder
up his brother's nose.

144
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,713
Thank you, thank you.

145
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,018
Have you ever considered
the advantages

146
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,654
Of owning a really fine
set of encyclopedias?

147
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,190
For only ten shillings.

148
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,624
George...

149
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:21,428
Louise, I told you never
to call me at the office.

150
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,178
Congratulations, sir.

151
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,380
You've just one
this lovely cupie doll.

152
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,116
Get off!

153
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,820
And get a haircut, you pansy!

154
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,257
Morning.

155
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,893
Ah, morning sir,
morning, morning.

156
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,761
I'll b-b-be with
you in a minute.

157
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:55,762
Oh, fine, fine.

158
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,262
Um, how... how do
you like it, sir?

159
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,030
Just short back
and sides, please.

160
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,765
How do you do that?

161
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,768
Just ordinary short
back and sides.

162
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,237
It's not a,
um, a razor cut...

163
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,273
Razor razor razor razor cut!

164
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,175
Blood spurt artery murder!

165
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,311
Oh, thank god,
thank god.

166
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,380
It's just,
uh... scissors.

167
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,115
Yes, yes.

168
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:51,285
You wouldn't rather have it
just combed, would you, sir?

169
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,486
I beg your
pardon?

170
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,688
You wouldn't rather
forget all about it?

171
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,723
No, no, no,
I want it cut.

172
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,258
Cut cut cut cut cut cut!

173
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,826
Blood spurt artery murder!

174
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,762
Hitchcock psycho blood damn it!

175
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,201
Right, so I'll get
e-e-everything ready.

176
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,669
In the meantime

177
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,972
Perhaps you'd fill
in one of these.

178
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,907
All right,
fine, yes.

179
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:17,544
Excuse me.

180
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:18,579
What?

181
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,147
Where it says
"next of kin"

182
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:21,515
Should i
put "mother"?

183
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,017
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

184
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:27,387
There we are.

185
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,389
Thank you.

186
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,293
Right.

187
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:34,294
Ha ha.

188
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:36,296
Ha ha.

189
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,395
There. finished.

190
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:09,796
I finished
cutting cutting

191
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,366
Cutting cutting cutting
cutting cutting your hair.

192
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,400
It's all done.

193
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,935
You haven't
started cutting it.

194
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,003
I have.

195
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,505
I did it very quickly,
your honor...

196
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,540
Sir... sir, sir, sir.

197
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,774
Look here,
old fellow.

198
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,676
I know when a chap's
cut my hair

199
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:23,744
And when he hasn't

200
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,946
So will you please
stop fooling around

201
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,080
And get on with it?

202
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,482
Yes... yes,
I will, sir.

203
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,284
I'm going to cut
your hair, sir.

204
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,819
I'm going to start
cutting your hair, sir.

205
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,289
Start cutting-- now.

206
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,726
Nice day, sir.

207
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,496
Yes, flowers could do
with a drop of rain there.

208
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,531
You see the match
last night, sir?

209
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,033
Yeah, good game,
I thought.

210
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,168
I thought hurst played
well, sir.

211
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,169
Beg your pardon?

212
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,138
I thought hurst played well.

213
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,040
Oh, yes, only one
who did, though.

214
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,042
Can you put your head
down a little, sir?

215
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,043
Oh, sorry.

216
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,580
I prefer to watch
palace nowadays.

217
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,582
Oh, sorry, was that your ear?

218
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,550
No, no, didn't
feel a thing.

219
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:04,785
Hey! what's
going on?

220
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,887
Yes, it is a nice
sport, isn't it?

221
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,388
It looks very
nice, sir.

222
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,258
It's exactly the same
as when I first came in.

223
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,259
All right!

224
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,460
All right,
I confess

225
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:14,995
I haven't cut
your hair.

226
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,230
I hate cutting hair.

227
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:19,433
I have this terrible
un-un-un-uncontrollable fear

228
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,801
Whenever I see hair.

229
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:21,935
When I was a kid

230
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,171
I used to hate the sight
of hair being cut.

231
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,639
My mother said
I was a fool.

232
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,241
She said the only
way to cure it

233
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,275
Was become a barber.

234
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,843
So I spent five
ghastly years

235
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,279
In the hairdresser's
training center at totnes.

236
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:35,582
Can you imagine
what it's like--

237
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:39,486
Cutting the same
head for five years!?

238
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,889
I didn't want to
be a barber anyway.

239
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,558
I wanted to be a lumberjack.

240
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,126
Leaping from tree to tree

241
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:49,263
As they float down the mighty
rivers of british columbia.

242
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:55,369
The giant redwood, the larch,
the fir, the mighty scots pine.

243
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,005
The smell of fresh-cut timber!

244
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,707
The crash of mighty trees!

245
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:04,144
With my best girlie by my side.

246
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:09,216
We'd sing... sing... sing!

247
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:11,685
I'm a lumberjack
and I'm okay

248
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,921
I sleep all night,
I work all day

249
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,523
<i>he's a lumberjack
and he's oka y</i>

250
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,926
<i>he sleeps all night

251
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,628
I cut down trees,
I eat my lunch

252
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,830
I go to the lavatory

253
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,200
On wednesdays I go shopping

254
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:29,036
And have buttered scones
for tea.

255
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,839
<i>he cuts down trees,

256
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,041

260

<i>he sleeps all night

261
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:47,054
I cut down trees,
I skip and jump

262
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,456
I like to press wild flowers

263
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,959
I put on women's clothing

264
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,528
And hang around in bars.

265
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:57,197
<i>he cuts down trees,
he skips and jumps</i>

266
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,600

<i>and he works

272
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,613
I cut down trees,
I wear high heels

273
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,015
Suspenders and a bra

274
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:20,220
I wish I'd been a girlie,
just like my dear mama.

275
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,156
He cuts down trees,
he wears high heels...

276
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,791
Suspenders
and a bra

277
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:25,826
A bra!

278
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:27,594
I wish I'd
been a girlie

279
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:30,364
Just like my dear mama.

280
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,599
Oh, bevis!

281
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,569
And I thought
you were so rugged.

282
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:41,275
"dear sir, I wish to complain
in the strongest possible terms

283
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,577
"about the song which
you have just broadcast

284
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:46,079
"about the lumberjack
who wears women's clothes.

285
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,981
"many of my best friends
are lumberjacks

286
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,983
And only a few of them
are transvestites."

287
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,452
"yours faithfully

288
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,788
Brigadier sir charles
arthur strong (mrs.)."

289
00:15:56,323 --> 00:16:00,093
<i>P.s. I have never kissed
the editor of the radio times.</i>

290
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:04,398
Well, I object to all
this sex on the television.

291
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,100
I mean, I keep falling off.

292
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:23,917
Well, I think television's
killed real entertainment.

293
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,887
In the old days,
we used to make our own fun.

294
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,222
At christmas parties

295
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:31,225
I used to strike myself
on the head repeatedly

296
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,761
With blunt instruments,
while crooning.

297
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,265
Only make-believe

298
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:41,235
I love you.

299
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,706
Only make-believe

300
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,175
That you love me.

301
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,010
Oh! ow!

302
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:53,413
Others find peace of mind...

303
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,889
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen

304
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:04,892
And welcome to the refreshment
room here at bletchley.

305
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,396
My name is kenny lust and
I'm your compere for tonight.

306
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,868
You know, once in a while, it
is my pleasure and my privilege

307
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:17,237
To welcome here
at the refreshment room

308
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:20,073
Some of the truly great
international artists

309
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,074
Of our time.

310
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,211
And tonight we have
one such artist.

311
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,779
Ladies and gentlemen

312
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,916
Someone whom I've always
personally admired

313
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,451
Perhaps more deeply,
more strongly

314
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:34,454
More abjectly
than any other performer...

315
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,192
A man... well,
more than a man, a god...

316
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,665
A great god whose personality is
so totally and utterly wonderful

317
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:47,467
That my feeble words
of welcome sound

318
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,437
Wretchedly and
pathetically inadequate.

319
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,975
Someone whose boots
I would gladly lick clean

320
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:57,444
Until holes wore
through my tongue.

321
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,216
A man who is so totally
and utterly wonderful

322
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:06,453
That I would rather be sealed
in a pit of my own filth

323
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,923
Than dare tread
on the same stage with him.

324
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,692
Ladies and gentlemen

325
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:17,698
The incomparably superior
human being, harry fink.

326
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,570
He can't come.

327
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:25,839
Never mind.

328
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:27,841
He's not all
he's cracked up to be.

329
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:30,244
Ladies and gentlemen

330
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:35,349
We give you ken buddha
and his inflatable knees.

331
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:47,160
Ken buddha, a smile,
two bangs and a religion.

332
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:50,664
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
for your further entertainment

333
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:54,134
Brian islam and brucie.

334
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,374
So, anyway,
I became a barber.

335
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,775
Oh, poor chap.

336
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:09,810
Yes, pity, really.

337
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,912
I always preferred
the outdoor life--

338
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,615
Hunting, shooting,
fishing

339
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,883
Getting out there
with a gun

340
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,818
Slaughtering a few
of god's creatures.

341
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,253
That was the life.

342
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,888
Charging about
the moorland

343
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,656
Blasting
their heads off.

344
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:28,682
I'm sorry, we don't
need you this week.

345
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:51,772
And now for something
completely different.

346
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:03,116
Would you... would
you mind terribly

347
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:07,120
If... if I held
your hand?

348
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:11,091
Oh! oh, no,
not at all.

349
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,528
Oh, iris, you're
so very beautiful.

350
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:18,232
Oh! oh, do you really mean that?

351
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:19,700
I do, I do, I do.

352
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,202
I think I'm beginning
to fall in love with you.

353
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:23,770
Oh, victor!

354
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,172
Huh! silly, isn't it?

355
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:27,674
No! no, not at all

356
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,110
Dear, sweet victor.

357
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:31,445
No, I didn't
mean that.

358
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,580
Only just us being
so close together

359
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:36,149
For so many months in
the soft-toy department

360
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:38,519
And yet
never daring to...

361
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:41,255
Oh! oh, victor!

362
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:42,856
Oh, iris!

363
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:44,992
Who can that be?

364
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,027
Oh, well, you try
and get rid of them.

365
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,563
Yes, I will,
I will, yes.

366
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:53,467
Won't be a moment.

367
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,668
I'll get rid of them.

368
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,137
Hello!

369
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,138
Hello?

370
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,139
Remember me?

371
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,140
Oh, no, I'm...

372
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:01,542
In the pub--
the tall, thin one

373
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:02,809
With the mustache,
remember?

374
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:03,844
No, I'm afraid...

375
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:04,845
About three years ago.

376
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:05,846
No, I don't,
I'm afraid.

377
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,080
Oh, blimey,
it's dark in here.

378
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:08,448
That's better.

379
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,450
Only you said we must have
a drink together sometime

380
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,852
So I thought I'd
take you up on it

381
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:13,954
As the film society meeting
was canceled this evening.

382
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,155
Yes, but, look,
to be frank

383
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:16,957
It is a little awkward
this evening.

384
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:18,592
Hello, I'm arthur,
arthur name.

385
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,227
Name by name
but not by nature.

386
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:22,262
I always say that,
don't i, vicky boy?

387
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:23,263
Really?

388
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,264
Is that your wife?

389
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:25,399
Uh, no, actually, but...

390
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,634
Oh, I get the picture.

391
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:30,070
Eh? well, don't worry
about me, vicky boy.

392
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:32,039
I know all about
one-night stands.

393
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:33,207
I beg your pardon!

394
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:34,241
Mind if I change
the record?

395
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:35,542
No, look, look,
we put that on.

396
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,610
Oh, here's a good one.

397
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:37,744
I heard it in a pub.

398
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:38,812
What's brown...

399
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,781
What's brown and
sounds like a bell?

400
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,049
I beg your pardon?

401
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:44,051
What's brown and
sounds like a bell?

402
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,687
Dung!

403
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:49,289
That's a good one,
that one.

404
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,290
I like that one.

405
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,959
There, I won't
keep you long.

406
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:54,995
Oh, that's better.

407
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:56,530
Now, don't worry
about me.

408
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:58,665
I'll wait here till
you've finished.

409
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:00,834
Who the hell is that?

410
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:01,869
Oh, I'll get it.

411
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:03,136
It'll be friends of mine.

412
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:04,771
I took the liberty
of inviting them along.

413
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:05,806
Look, we were
hoping to have

414
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,807
A quiet evening
on our own.

415
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,175
Oh, they won't mind.

416
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,943
They're very broad-minded.

417
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,546
Hello!

418
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:13,647
Good evening.

419
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:14,681
Oh, good evening.

420
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:16,583
My name is equator,
brian equator.

421
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:18,519
Like round the
middle of the earth

422
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:19,520
Only with an "l."

423
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:25,025
This is my wife, audrey.

424
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:27,427
She smells a bit, but
she has a heart of gold.

425
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:30,497
Well, there must have been
some kind of misunderstanding

426
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,498
Because this is not the...

427
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:32,533
Oh, who's that then?

428
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:33,534
What?

429
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,535
Who's the bird?

430
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:35,736
Well, I mean...

431
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:37,371
You got a nice pair
there, haven't you, love?

432
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:38,405
Come on, give us
a kiss.

433
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:43,343
Shut up, you silly bitch,
it was only a bit of fun.

434
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,711
Now, look here.

435
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:46,079
Big gin, please.

436
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:47,080
I'll get it!

437
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:49,416
Look, leave
those drinks alone.

438
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:51,118
And three tins of beans
for me, please.

439
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:53,654
I told you to lay off
the beans, you whore!

440
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,255
I only want three cans!

441
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:57,291
Button your lip, you rat-bag!

442
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:04,731
It was rather witty, wasn't it?

443
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:05,933
Where's my gin?

444
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,468
Who the hell's that?

445
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:11,505
Oh, why, uh, I took the liberty
of inviting an old friend along

446
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,508
As his wife has just passed away
and he's somewhat distraught

447
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,542
Poor chap.

448
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,046
I hope you don't mind.

449
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,849
Oh, my god, what
a simply ghastly place!

450
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,617
It's not too good, is it?

451
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:26,420
A pint of creme de menthe
for my friend.

452
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:30,424
Well, how are you,
you great poof?

453
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:31,892
Bit lumpy.

454
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:35,562
Ah, no wonder,
I was sitting on the cat.

455
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:39,266
I brought along this
simply gorgeous little man

456
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,435
I picked up at the odeon.

457
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:43,971
Is he sexy, then?

458
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:47,708
I had to bring the goat
and he's not well.

459
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:51,445
I only hope he don't
go on the carpet.

460
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:54,515
Come on, then, love,
drop them.

461
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,454
Blimey, she don't
go much, do she?

462
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:06,593
Oh! I wet them.

463
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:11,331
The goat's...
goat's done a bundle.

464
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,202
Nice to see you.

465
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,171
Look, get out, all of you.

466
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:19,673
Go on, get out!
get out! get out!

467
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,341
I beg your pardon?

468
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,776
I'm turning you all out.

469
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,444
I'm not having my house
filled with filthy perverts.

470
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:25,812
Now, look, I'm giving
just half a minute.

471
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,314
Then I'm going to call
the police, so get out.

472
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:30,117
I don't much like
the tone of your voice.

473
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,188
Right, let's have
a ding dong.

474
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,991
Ding dong! merrily on high

475
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:40,027
In heav'n the bells
are ringing...

476
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:43,230
Ding dong! verily the sky

477
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:46,200
Is riv'n
with angels singing

478
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:53,607
Glor-or-or-ia

479
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,043
Hosanna in excelsis.

480
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:57,244
<i>cuida...</i>

481
00:27:57,377 --> 00:28:00,347
<i>cuidado llamas!</i>
