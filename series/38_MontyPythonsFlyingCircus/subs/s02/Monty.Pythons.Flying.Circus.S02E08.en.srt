00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:06,282
Here is a preview of some of the
programmes you'll be able to see
coming shortly on BBC Television.

2
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:08,517
To kick off with there's variety...

3
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:12,842
Peter West and Brian Johnston star
in 'Rain Stopped Play',

4
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,722
a whacky new comedy series
about the gay exploits
of 2 television cricket commentators

5
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:21,003
with E. W. Swanton
as Aggie the kooky Scots maid.

6
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:24,956
For those of you
who don't like variety,

7
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:27,840
there's variety, with Brian Close
at the Talk of the Town.

8
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:29,878
And of course there'll be sport.

9
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:32,960
The Classics series return to BBC 2

10
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:37,160
with 26 episodes of
John Galsworthy's 'Snooker My Way'

11
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:41,681
with Nyree Dawn Porter
repeating her triumph as Joe Davis.

12
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:43,684
And of course there'll be sport.

13
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:45,326
Comedy is not forgotten

14
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:49,077
with Jim Laker in
'Thirteen Weeks of Off-spin Bowling'.

15
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:52,563
Jim plays the zany bachelor bowler
in a new series of 'Owzat',

16
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,997
with Anneley Brummond-Haye
on Mr Softee as his wife...

17
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:57,363
And of course there'll be sport.

18
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:01,397

21
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:12,323
On 'Show of the Week'
Kenneth Wostenholme sings.

22
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:15,485
And for those of you who don't like
television there's David Coleman.

23
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:17,878
And of course there'll be sport.

24
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,279
But now for something
completely different - sport.

25
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:40,597
 

26
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:45,767
 

27
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,602
God Blimey! Look what we've found!

28
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,401
It really is fantastic.

29
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:07,996
 

30
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:14,523
Gentlemen, from this single part
and months of painstaking research,

31
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:18,640
we have been able to accurately
reconstruct this entire beast.

32
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:23,680
 

33
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:34,756
Hello. On 'Archaeology Today' tonight
I have with me Professor Lucien Kastner
of Oslo University.

34
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,286
Good evening.

35
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:38,762
- How tall are you, professor?
- ... I beg your pardon?

36
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:42,118
- How tall are you?
- I'm about 5 foot 10.

37
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:45,683
And an expert in Egyptian tomb paintings.
Sir Robert... are you really 5 foot 10?

38
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:48,600
Funny, you look much shorter
than that to me.

39
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:52,877
Are you slumped forward in your chair
at all? Extraordinary.

40
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:57,046
Sir Robert Eversley, who's just returned
from the excavations at El Ara,

41
00:03:57,247 --> 00:04:00,478
and you must be well over 6 foot.
Isn't that right, Sir Robert?

42
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:01,881
Yes.

43
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:05,363
- In fact I think you're 6 foot 5,
aren't you?  - Yes.

44
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:08,726
Oh, that's marvelous.

45
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:11,919
I mean you're a totally different
kind of specimen to Professor Kastner.

46
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,322
Straight in your seat, erect, firm.

47
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:16,802
Yes. I thought we were here
to discuss archaeology.

48
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,237
Yes, yes, of course we are, yes,
absolutely, you're absolutely right!

49
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:22,280
That's positive thinking for you.

50
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:26,036
You wouldn't have said a thing like that,
would you? You 5 foot 10 inch weed.

51
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:30,803
Sir Robert Eversley, who's very interesting,

52
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,280
what have you discovered
in the excavations at El Ara?

53
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,963
Well basically we have found
a complex of tombs...

54
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,322
Very good speaking voice.

55
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:43,916
...which present dramatic evidence
of Polynesian influence

56
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,516
in Egypt in the third dynasty
which is quite remarkable.

57
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:48,957
- How tall were the Polynesians?
- They were...

58
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,442
Well, they were rather small, seafaring...

59
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:54,366
- Short men, were they... eh?
All squat and bent up?
- Well, I really don't know about that...

60
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,240
Who were the tall people?
Who's that very tall tribe in Africa?

61
00:04:57,447 --> 00:04:59,722
- Well, this is hardly archaeology.
- The Watutsi! That's it - the Watutsi!

62
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:02,680
Oh, that's the tribe, some of them
were 8 foot tall.

63
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,685
Can you imagine that. 8 foot of Watutsi!

64
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:10,085
Not one on another's shoulders, oh no
- 8 foot of solid Watutsi.

65
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:11,959
That's what I call tall.

66
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:14,761
- But it's nothing to do with archaeology.
- Oh to hell with archaeology!

67
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:21,517
Can I please speak! I came all the way
from Oslo to do this program!

68
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,843
I'm a professor of archaeology.

69
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,481
I'm an expert in ancient civilizations.

70
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:29,759
All right, I'm only 5 foot 10.

71
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:33,482
All right my posture is bad,
all right I slump in my chair.

72
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:36,401
But I've had more women
than either of you two!

73
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:39,565
I've had half bloody Norway,
that's what I've had!

74
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,839
So you can keep your Robert Eversley!
And you can keep your bloody Watutsi!

75
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:46,485
I'd rather have my little body...

76
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:50,441
my little 5-foot-10-inch body...

77
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:57,406
- Bloody fool.
Look what you've done to him.
- Don't bloody fool me.

78
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,282
I'll do what I like, because I'm 6 foot 5

79
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:04,086
and I eat punks like you for breakfast.

80
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,044
I'll get you for that, Eversley!

81
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:12,080
I'll get you if I have to travel
to the four corners of the earth!

82
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:17,004
 

83
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,798
 

84
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,396
 

85
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:27,525
 

86
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,081
The dig was going well that year,

87
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,677
We had discovered some Hittite
baking dishes from the 5th dynasty,

88
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:54,562
and Sir Robert was happier
than I had ever seen him.

89
00:06:54,767 --> 00:07:01,684
Today I hear the robin sing

90
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:07,564
Today the thrush is on the wing

91
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:13,399
Today who knows what life will bring

92
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,597
Today...

93
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:24,160
Why,

94
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:28,797
a Sumerian drinking vessel
of the 4th dynasty.

95
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,555
Today!!!

96
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:39,885
Catalogue this pot, Danielle,
it's 4th dynasty.

97
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,681
- Oh, is it... ?
- Yes, it's... Sumerian.

98
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:49,915
Oh, how wonderful!
Oh, I am so happy for you.

99
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:51,765
I'm happy too,

100
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:55,880
now at last we know there was a
Sumerian influence here in Abu Simnel

101
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,282
in the early pre-dynastic period,

102
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:02,480
2000 years before the reign of Tutankhamun,

103
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:09,760
Today I hear the robin sing

104
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:15,758
Today the thrush is on the wing

105
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:21,678
Today who knows what life will bring.

106
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,165
All right Eversley,
get up out of that trench.

107
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:33,880
Don't forget... I'm 6 foot 5.

108
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,199
That doesn't worry me...

109
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,557
- Kastner!
- Here, Lord.

110
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:40,879
Up!

111
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:48,723
- 11 foot 3!
- I'm so tall! I am so tall!

112
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:52,515
Danielle!

113
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:58,644
11 foot 6 - damn you! Abdul

114
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:02,240
15 foot 4! Mustapha!

115
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:04,918
19 foot 3... damn you!

116
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:20,400
 

117
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,965
And there we end this edition
of 'Archaeology Today'.

118
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:38,881
Next week, the Silbury Dig

119
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:43,000
by Cole Porter
with Pearl Bailey and Arthur Negus.

120
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:48,643
And now an appeal for sanity
from the Reverend Arthur Belling.

121
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:56,276
You know, there are many people
in the country today who, through
no fault of their own, are sane.

122
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,606
Some of them were born sane.

123
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,436
Some of them became sane
later in their lives.

124
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:08,038
It is up to people like you and me

125
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,325
who are out of our tiny little minds

126
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:15,436
to try and help these people
overcome their sanity.

127
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:18,076
You can start in small ways

128
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,846
with ping-pong ball eyes
and a funny voice

129
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:24,602
and then you can paint half of
your body red and the other half green

130
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,486
and then you can jump up and down
in a bowl of treacle going
'squawk, squawk, squawk...'

131
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:31,880
And then you can go 'Neurhhh! Neurhh!'

132
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,482
and then you can roll around on the
floor going 'pting pting pting'...

133
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:43,125
The Reverend Arthur Belling is Vicar
of St Loony Up The Cream Bun and Jam.

134
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,923
And now an appeal on behalf
of the National Trust.

135
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,998
Good evening. My name is Leapy Lee.

136
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:53,086
No, sorry.
That's the name of me favourite singer.

137
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,562
My name is Mrs Fred Stone.

138
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,918
No, no, Mrs Fred Stone is the wife
of me favourite tennis player.

139
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:02,517
My name is Bananas.
No, no, that's me favourite fruit.

140
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:09,041
I'm Mrs 'Nice evening out at the pictures
then perhaps a dance at a club and back
to his place for a quick cup of coffee
and little bit of...'

141
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:12,842
No, sorry, that's me favourite way
of spending a night out.

142
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:16,279
Perhaps I am Leapy Lee?
Yes! I must be Leapy Lee!

143
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:19,684
Hello fans! Leapy Lee here!
'Little arrows that will...'

144
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:22,160
Hello? ...

145
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:25,325
Evidently I'm not Leapy Lee.
I thought I probably wouldn't be.

146
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:28,837
Thank you, I'll tell them.
Hello. Hello, Denis Compton here.

147
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:32,244
No... I should have written it down.
Now where's that number?

148
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:35,007
I'm Mao Tse Tung...
I'm P. P. Arnold...

149
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:37,801
I'm Margaret Thatcher...
I'm Sir Gerald Nabarro...

150
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,842
Hello? Sir Len Hutton here.

151
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:44,005
Could you tell me, please ...
Oh, am I? Oh, thank you.

152
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:47,959
Good evening. I'm Mrs
What-number-are-you-dialing-please?

153
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,640
 

154
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:57,563
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

155
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,883
- Are you the registrar?
- I have that function.

156
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:04,279
I was here on Saturday,
getting married to a blond girl,
and I'd like to change please.

157
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:06,682
- I'd like to have this one instead please.
- What do you mean?

158
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,885
Er, well, the other one wasn't any good,
so I'd like to swap it for this one, please.

159
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,884
Er, I have paid. I paid on Saturday.

160
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:18,923
- Here's the ticket.
- Ah, no. That was when you were married.

161
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:22,645
Er, yes. That was when I was married
to the wrong one. I didn't like the colour.
This is the one I want to have, so
if you could just change the forms round

162
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:25,646
- I can take this one back with me now.
- I can't do that.
- Look, make it simpler, I'll pay again.

163
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:26,796
No, you can't do that.

164
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:31,080
Look, all I want you to do is change
the wife, say the words, blah, blah,
back to my place, no questions asked.

165
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,086
- I'm sorry sir, but
we're not allowed to change.
- You can at Harrods.

166
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,083
You can't.

167
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:38,604
- You can. I changed my record player
and there wasn't a grumble.
- It's different.

168
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:41,116
And I changed my pet snake,
and I changed my Robin Day tie.

169
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:42,636
Well, you can't change a bloody wife!

170
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:45,881
Oh, all right! Well,
can I borrow one for the weekend?

171
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:49,118
- No!
- Oh, blimey, I only wanted a jolly good...

172
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:53,555
All right, break it up.
What's your number, then?

173
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,837
- All right. Name?
- Cook.

174
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:05,439
- Next please. Name?
- Er, Watson.

175
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,444
- Mr Watson.
- Ah, no, Doctor.

176
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:10,480
- Ah, Mr Doctor.
- No, not Mr, Doctor.

177
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:13,360
- Oh, Doctor Doctor.
- No, Doctor Watson.

178
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:17,560
- Oh, Doctor Watson Doctor.
- Oh, just call me darling.

179
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,644
- Hello, Mr Darling.
- No, Doctor.

180
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:21,360
Hello Doctor Darling.

181
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,804
 

182
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,676
But at Wembley, play had resumed.

183
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:38,036
Meanwhile, nearby, the day
was just beginning

184
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:40,807
for Mugsy Spaniel, a convicted gangster
and well known swell guy.

185
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,165
- Thank you, dear.

186
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:49,523
Happy birthday, Muggsy!

187
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:58,080
Yes indeed, this was the work of
none other than Eggs Diamond, leader
of the notorious Chicken gang.

188
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:08,205
Dinsdale!

189
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:13,081
With the Chicken gang, a man's life was
not worth the paper it was printed on.

190
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:17,246
Already, there have been murders
commited here and here,
and the latest one right here.

191
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,277
He's right, you know...

192
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:25,086
The powerful forces Eggs had
loosed on the city
would be his undoing.

193
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:27,005
We turn now to the hideout.

194
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:40,039
These and other fantastic lies
are yours for the reading

195
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,078
in this beautifully-bound volume.

196
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:45,484
Buy now, suckers!
This is an ideal gift.

197
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:50,523
A must for all you out there
who long to sound clever
at your next cocktail party.

198
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:58,077
Ah, John. Allow me to introduce
my next-door neighbour.

199
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:01,836
John Stokes, this is A Snivelling
Little Rat-Faced Git. Ah!

200
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:06,604
Hello, I noticed a slight look
of anxiety cross your face for a moment
just then, but you needn't worry

201
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:10,766
I'm used to it. That's the trouble
of having a surname like Git.

202
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:16,078
We did think once of having it changed
by deed-poll, you know - to Watson
or something like that. 

203
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,881
But A Snivelling Little Rat-Faced
Watson's just as bad, eh?

204
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:22,161
- Yes, yes, I suppose so.
- Oh, that's my wife.

205
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,598
Darling!
Come and meet Mr... what was it?

206
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:27,525
Stokes - John Stokes.

207
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:31,117
Oh yes. John Stokes, this is my wife,
Dreary Fat Boring Old.

208
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:35,804
- Oh, er, how do you do.
- How do you do.

209
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:39,162
- Darling, there you are!
- Yes, yes, here I am, yes.

210
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:43,042
- Oh, is this your wife?
- Yes, yes, yes, this is the wife, yes.

211
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:47,000
Um darling, these, these are the Gits.

212
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,159
- What?
- The Gits.

213
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:52,121
Oh, heaven's sakes we are being formal.
Does it have to be surnames?

214
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,598
Oh, no, no. Not at all. No.

215
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:59,358
Um, no, this... this... this is
my wife Norah, er, Norah Jane,

216
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,478
Norah Jane Stokes.

217
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:05,638
This is Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Git

218
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:09,123
and this is his wife
Dreary Fat Boring Old Git.

219
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:13,639
I was just telling your husband
what an awful bore it is
having a surname like Git.

220
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,806
OH Oh well, it's not that bad.

221
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:19,636
You've no idea how the kids get taunted.

222
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:25,046
Why, only last week Dirty Lying
Little Two-Faced came running home
from school, sobbing his eyes out,

223
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:27,602
and our youngest, Ghastly Spotty
Horrible Vicious Little

224
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:31,197
is just at the age when taunts like
'she's a git' really hurt. Yes.

225
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,763
Do ... do you live round here?

226
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:39,925
Yes, we live up the road, number 49
- you can't miss it.

227
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:42,482
We've just had the outside
painted with warm pus.

228
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,446
- Oh.
- Yes. It's very nice actually.

229
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:48,037
It goes nicely with the vomit and catarrh
we've got smeared all over the front door.

230
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:52,280
- I think we ought to be going.
We have two children to collect.
- Oh, bring them round for tea tomorrow.

231
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:58,041
It's Ghastly Spotty Cross-Eyed's birthday
and she's having a disembowelling party
for a few friends.

232
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:03,037
The Nauseas will be there, and Doug and
Janice Mucus, and the Rectums from Swanage.

233
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:06,404
 

234
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:13,879
John! Allow me to introduce
our next-door neighhour.

235
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:17,318
John, this is Mr Watson.

236
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:21,361
Hello. I noticed a slight look
of anxiety cross your face
just then but you needn't worry.

237
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,957
I preferred the dirty version.

238
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,642
Well, I've been a hunter all my life.

239
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,236
I love animals.
That's why I like to kill 'em.

240
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,037
I wouldn't kill an animal I didn't like.

241
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:37,966
Goodday Roy.

242
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:42,002
Hank and Roy Spim are tough,
fearless backwoodsmen

243
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:45,199
who have chosen to live in a violent,
unrelenting world of nature's creatures,

244
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:49,480
where only the fittest survive.
Today they are off to hunt mosquitoes.

245
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,922
The mosquito's a clever little bastard.

246
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:56,204
You can track him for days and days until
you really get to know him like a friend.

247
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:59,524
He knows you're there,
and you know he's there.

248
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:01,399
It's a game of wits.

249
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:04,200
You hate him, then you respect him,
then you kill him.

250
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:07,285
Suddenly Hank spots
the mosquito they're after.

251
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:16,277
Now more than ever, they must rely
on the skills they have learnt
from a lifetime's hunting.

252
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:21,962
Hank gauges the wind.

253
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:26,479
Roy examines the mosquito's spoor.

254
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,286
Then ...

255
00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:49,723
It's a success.
The mosquito now is dead.

256
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:51,838
But Roy must make sure.

257
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:57,324
There's nothing more dangerous
than a wounded mosquito.

258
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:59,517
But the hunt is not over.

259
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:04,280
With well practised skill
Hank skins the mosquito.

260
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:07,399
The wings of a fully grown male mosquito
can in fact fetch anything

261
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:09,643
up to .8 of a penny on the open market.

262
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:19,916
The long day is over

263
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:22,925
and it's back to base camp
for a night's rest.

264
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,522
Here, surrounded by their trophies

265
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:31,276
Roy and Hank prepare for a much
tougher ordeal - a moth hunt.

266
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:36,117
Well, I follow the moth in the helicopter
to lure it away from the flowers,

267
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:38,886
and then Roy comes along in
the Lockheed Starfighter

268
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:41,806
and attacks it with air-to-air missiles.

269
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:46,598
A lot of people have asked us
why we don't use fly spray.

270
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:49,277
Well, where's the sport in that?

271
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:52,401
For Roy, sport is everything.

272
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:55,724
Ever since he lost his left arm
battling with an ant,

273
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:58,884
Roy has risked his life in the pursuit
of tiny creatures.

274
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,676
But it's not all work

275
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:08,880
and for relaxation they like
nothing more than a day's fishing.

276
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:19,876
Wherever there is a challenge,
Hank and Roy Spim will be there

277
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:23,920
ready to carry on the primordial
struggle between man

278
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,878
and inoffensive, tiny insects.

279
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:47,040
Oh, I've had such a morning
in the High Court.

280
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:50,400
I could stamp my little feet
the way those QC's carry on.

281
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:53,678
- Don't I know it, love.
- 'Objection' here, 'objection' there!

282
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,685
And that nice policeman
giving his evidence so well

283
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:58,878
beautiful speaking voice ...

284
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,282
- well after a bit all I could do
was bang my little gavel.
- You what, love?

285
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,997
I banged me gavel.
I did me 'silence in court' bit.

286
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:09,246
Ooh! If looks could kill
that prosecuting counsel
would be in for 30 years.

287
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,439
- How did your summing up go?
- Well, I was quite pleased actually.

288
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:15,957
I was trying to do my butch voice,
you know, 'what the jury must understand',
and they loved it, you know.

289
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:18,999
- I could see that foreman eyeing me.
- Really?

290
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,283
- Yes, cheeky devil.
- Was he that tall man
with that very big... ?

291
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,596
No, just a minute.

292
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:26,597
I must finish you know. Anyway,
I finished up with 'the actions of
these vicious men is a violent stain 

293
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:30,117
on the community and the full penalty
of the law is scarcely sufficient

294
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,317
to deal with their ghastly crimes',

295
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:35,917
and I waggled my wig! Just ever so
slightly, but it was a stunning effect.

296
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:40,563
Oh, I bet it was... like
that super time I wore that striped robe
in the Magistrates Court.

297
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:41,881
Oh, aye.

298
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:48,164
- Hello, Mrs Thing.
- Hello, Mrs Entity.

299
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:51,677
- How are you then?
- Oh, I have had a morning.

300
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:53,684
- Busy?
- Busy - huh!

301
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:58,603
I got up at 5 o'dock, I made myself
a cup of tea, I looked out of the window.

302
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:01,878
Well, by then I was so worn out
I had to come and have a sit-down.

303
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:06,080
- I've been here for 7 hours.
- You must be exhausted.

304
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:09,479
- Mm. Oh, have you been shopping?
- No, I've been shopping.

305
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:10,716
Funny.

306
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm worn out.
I've been shopping for 6 hours

307
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:16,037
- What have you bought, then?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

308
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,965
- A complete waste of time.
- Wicked, isn't it?

309
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,079
Wicked. It'll be worse
when we join the Common Market.

310
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:26,485
- That nice Mr Heath would never allow that.
- It's funny he never married.

311
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:29,724
- He's a bachelor.
- Oooh! That would explain it.

312
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:33,518
Oh dear me,
this chatting away wears me out.

313
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:38,084
Yes. I bet Mrs Reginald Maudling doesn't
have to put up with all this drudgery,

314
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:43,042
getting up at 5 in the morning,
making a cup of tea, looking out
of the window, chatting away.

315
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,362
No! It'd all be done for her.

316
00:22:45,487 --> 00:22:49,400
Yes, she'd have the whole day free
for playing snooker.

317
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:53,076
She probably wouldn't go through
all the drudgery of playing snooker,
day in, day out.

318
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,483
No, it would all be done for her.
She wouldn't even have to lift the cue.

319
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:59,075
She probably doesn't even know
where the billlard room is.

320
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:01,926
No, still, it's not as bad
as the old days.

321
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,323
Mrs Stanley Baldwin used to have
to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning

322
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:08,757
and go out and catch partridges
with her bare hands.

323
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:12,437
Yes... and Mrs William Pitt the Elder
used to have to get up at 3 o'clock

324
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,842
and go burrowing for truffles
with the bridge of her nose.

325
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:20,087
Mrs Beethoven used to have to get up
at midnight to spur on the mynah bird.

326
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:22,675
Lazy creatures, mynah birds...

327
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:27,835
Yes. When Beethoven went deaf
the mynah bird just used to mime.

328
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:32,123
- Ooh! What's happening?
- It's all right. It's only a flashback.

329
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:44,806
You don't fool me, you stupid
mynah bird. I'm not deaf yet.

330
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:46,997
Just you wait... ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

331
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,638
- Oh! Bugger...
- Shut up!

332
00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:53,316
Shut your beak. Gott in Himmel...

333
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,481
I never get any peace here.

334
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:05,364
- Ludwig!
- What?

335
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:09,321
- Have you seen the sugar bowl?
- No, I haven't seen the bloody sugar bowl.

336
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,166
- You know ... the sugar bowl.
- Sod the sugar bowl...

337
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:15,040
I'm trying to finish this stinking tune!

338
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:18,199
It's driving me spare ... so shut up!

339
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,166
No, no, no...

340
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,284
Ludwig, have you seen the jam spoon?

341
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:33,278
Stuff the jam spoon!

342
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:37,998
- It was in the sugar bowl.
- Look, get out you old rat-bag.
Buzz off and shut up.

343
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:41,877
- I don't know what you see in that piano.
- Leave me alone!

344
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:49,802
Ha! ha! ha! I've done it, I've done it!

345
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:54,680
Do you want peanut butter
or sandwich spread for your tea?

346
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:57,315
- What!!!!
- PEANUT BUTTER...

347
00:24:57,447 --> 00:25:01,884
- I've forgotten it. I had it! I had it!
- Do you want peanut butter
or sandwich spread?

348
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:05,636
- I don't care!
- Oooh! I don't know.

349
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,319
I had it. I had it you old bag.

350
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:19,042
Mein lieber Gott. What are you doing?

351
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:23,678
- What's that! What's that!
- It's the plumber!

352
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,677
Gott in Himmel, I'm going out.

353
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:33,318
Well, if you're going out don't forget
we've got the Mendelssohns coming for tea

354
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:35,722
so don't forget to order some pikelets.

355
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:39,676
Pikelets, pikelets. Shakespeare
never had this trouble.

356
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:42,039
You wanna bet?

357
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,805
Incidentally, it's ...

358
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:51,076
You're right. Oh, incidentally,
why not call him Hamlet?

359
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:55,084
Hamlet? I like much better than David.

360
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:58,483
Michelangelo! You can use David.
I won't sue.

361
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:01,037
Thanks, but I've had a better idea.

362
00:26:03,087 --> 00:26:05,078
 

363
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:07,482
- Michelangelo!
- Yes, dear!

364
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,167
- I've had another son.
- Oh, my life.

365
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,246
Composer?

366
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:16,326
Huh! I wouldn't wish it on my son.
He's a sensitive boy, already.

367
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:19,041
I'd rather he was a sewage attendant
or a ratcatcher.

368
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:22,287
 

369
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:23,601
 

370
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:34,006
Aha! Rats at 42a Kartoffelnstrasse.

371
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:38,006
- Hey Mitzi! I gotta go to Potato Street.
- Put your galoshes on.

372
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:45,318
Depressed by rats? Do mice get you down?

373
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:50,442
Then why not visit Colin Mozart's
Rodent Exterminating Boutique.

374
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,877
Rats extirpated, mice punished,

375
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:58,558
voles torn apart by Colin Mozart,

376
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:01,963
Munich's leading furry animal liquidator.

377
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:10,886
 

378
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:17,724
- Yes?
- Colin Mozart.

379
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:21,886
Oh, thank goodness you've come.
We're having a terrible time
with them bleeding rats. 

380
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:24,885
I think they live
in his stupid piano already.

381
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:30,366
Get out the bloody piano you stupid
furry bucktoothed gits! Get out!

382
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:40,005
Gott in Himmel!
Get your stinking tail out of my face.

383
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,236
 

384
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:49,200
Shut up!

385
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:56,802
So anyway, Beethoven was rather glad
when he went deaf.

386
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:10,998
Well, I was ever so glad they abolished
hanging, you know, because that black cap
just didn't suit me.

387
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:15,638
- Do you remember the Glasgow treason trial?
- Oh yes, I wore a body stocking
all through it.

388
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:20,682
- No, hen, with the party afterwards.
- Oh, that's right. You were walking out
with that very butch Clerk of the Court.

389
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:23,879
That's right. Ooh, he made me want
to turn Queen's evidence.

390
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:27,079
Oh, me too. One summing up
and I'm anybody's.

391
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:29,482
- Anyway, Bailie Anderson.
- Ooh, her?

392
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,679
Yes. She's so strict. She was on at me
for giving dolly sentences, you know,

393
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:34,605
specially in that arson case.

394
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,565
- What was the verdict?
- They preferred the brown wig.

395
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:41,566
Mm. I love the Scottish Assizes.
I know what they mean by a really
well-hung jury.

396
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,155
Ooh! Get back in the witness box,

397
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:46,045
you're too sharp to live!

398
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:49,000
Have you tried that new body rub JP's use?

399
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,721
I had a magistrate in Bradford yesterday.

400
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:54,919
Funnily enough I felt like one
in a lunchtime recess today.

401
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,880
But the ones I really like are
those voice over announcers

402
00:28:58,087 --> 00:28:59,679
on the BBC after the programs are over.

403
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:04,045
- Oh, aye, of course, they're as bent
as safety pins.  - I know, but they've 
beautiful speaking voices, haven't they?

404
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,886
'And now a choice of viewing
on BBC Television.'

405
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:09,766
'Here are tonight's football results.'
