1
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,683
A.J.

2
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,522
Jesus, Meadow, chill out.

3
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,042
Sukanya, what goes in
must come out.

4
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,253
And these people now being released
from prison are the same ones...

5
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,089
...who were jailed during
the Mafia crackdowns of the 1980s?

6
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,966
Seems like yesterday, doesn't it?

7
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,094
For years, we heard how law enforcement
broke the back of the Mob.

8
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,597
Well, they've served their time.

9
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,975
It's the old never-ending battle
against crime and corruption, Sukanya...

10
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,560
...to quote Superman.

11
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,813
So, what do you think is gonna happen
with this infusion of new blood?

12
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,983
We could be looking at a period
of violent power struggle.

13
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,569
They paint everything the worst,
these news people.

14
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,072
- How long until dinner?
- Any familiar names?

15
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,992
In New York, the only old-style boss
still in place is Carmine Lupertazzi.

16
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,996
He'll soon be rejoined by Angelo Garepe,
his former consigliore.

17
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,916
Also, Philip Leotardo,
long-time Lupertazzi captain.

18
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,836
- Can you help me here? Crush some ice?
- I'll be right there.

19
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,130
New Jersey's a better
case in point, Sukanya.

20
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,676
You've got Michele "Feech" La Manna,
released just this week...

21
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,553
...a man greatly feared
and respected in the '70s.

22
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,972
Amen to that.

23
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,059
Similar situation with Anthony Blundetto,
in that same crime family, the Sopranos.

24
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,187
- Let me see how he looks.
- Once known as Tony B., still is.

25
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,982
Twenty-eight years old
when he went away. A rising star.

26
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,027
Thought to be the central suspect in the
killing of Thomas Gilardi and his driver.

27
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,946
That's the best picture
they could find?

28
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,323
- He was a fox.
- Pipe down. We're trying to watch.

29
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,993
It's my house, Tony.

30
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,913
- What are you watching?
- Go call your brother for dinner.

31
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,126
- Bobby.
- Be nice to have him back, huh?

32
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,211
- Your cousin?
- Miss the shit out of him.

33
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,506
The older you are,
the more you're entitled to eat.

34
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,551
- Hi. Sorry.
- Where the hell you been?

35
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,179
- Your mother didn't send anything?
- She wasn't home.

36
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,432
Her and Aunt Ro
went out to dinner, I think.

37
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,017
Everybody sit.

38
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,936
Now, please.

39
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,482
This is great of you, Aunt Jan,
keeping the Sunday-dinner tradition going.

40
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,776
Can you get the roast out of the oven?

41
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:25,073
- Canned clam chowder?
- Go sit, goddamn it.

42
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,872
- Oh, shit.
- What?

43
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,498
My wedding ring.

44
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,251
- Go strap on the bag, Ton?
- Yeah.

45
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,838
Would you say this is an interesting point
in the history of the Mafia?

46
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,258
I'd say we're looking at a great year
for crime reporters, Sukanya.

47
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,218
Class of '04?

48
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,251
- Anthony.
- What?

49
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,465
I wanna say hello.
Can you stop a minute?

50
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,636
- How was dinner?
- Fine.

51
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,305
- What did you have?
- Roast beef.

52
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,810
- Did your father pick up his mail?
- No, he didn't come in. He was tired.

53
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,021
He said he just wanted to go to bed.
Listen, I'm trying to practice.

54
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,441
I see you didn't bring the Power Vac in
from the pool house like I asked.

55
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,320
Why does that have to be done? Grandpa
still has to lift it into his truck.

56
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,282
I don't want him to have to drag it
from all the way out back.

57
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,663
It's so nice to have a man
around the house.

58
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,665
You should have
thought about that before.

59
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,959
What did you say?

60
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,007
Go out and get that vacuum, now.

61
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,593
What did I just say? Go.

62
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:30,031
Mom! Mommy! Oh, my God.

63
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,201
Mommy, help. Mommy?

64
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,495
Mom.

65
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,374
Mommy.

66
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,543
A.J., be quiet, don't move.

67
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,381
Mommy?

68
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,177
Mommy!

69
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,222
- Get Dad's gun.
- It's all the way in the dining room.

70
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,100
Hey, go away! Go!

71
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,688
Hey! Get out of here!

72
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,817
Go!

73
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,335
- How was the olive loaf?
- You know what I like?

74
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,087
- I like the Gulden's Brown Mustard.
- Are you leaving?

75
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,008
Yeah, I got a overseas call
coming at home.

76
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,428
- Finish your sandwich at least first.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

77
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,939
Could be the same one
from Willow Drive.

78
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:48,777
God. The most densely populated state
in the country, and still this.

79
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,781
Gone. He went through your neighbors'
garbage, though, the Kalchiems'.

80
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,492
This has been going on all over.
If my son had been alone...

81
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,870
You're not gonna wanna put
your trash out until close to pickup time.

82
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,038
Now, you hear that?

83
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,916
Also, put ammonia or bleach
in the container and on the lid.

84
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,460
I posted a notice for your neighbors.

85
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,713
If this had been a category two,
injury or serious property damage...

86
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,633
...we could set traps, but not for this.
God.

87
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,219
You should've busted a cap in his ass
with Dad's rifle.

88
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,305
It's illegal to discharge firearms
within the borough limits, son.

89
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,100
- You're gonna call Dad, aren't you?
- No.

90
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,811
A great percentage of them
don't come back.

91
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,814
He does, call us.

92
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,443
Ohh, Ahh...

93
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,070
Do you have bird feed back there?

94
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,948
Duck food. Yes, my husband's.

95
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,952
It's probably what attracted the animal.
See, the corn's gone damp and aromatic.

96
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,288
- Tell your husband to put it inside.
- Right.

97
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,670
Setting up the equipment
is a complicated affair.

98
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,340
Video cameras and built-in recorders.

99
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,260
Then the car that he qualifi...

100
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,970
Hello.

101
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,098
I'm Dr. Lowenstein.

102
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,019
- Go back.
- What?

103
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,770
- Come on.
- You're kidding.

104
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,524
- No, go back. Please.
- Why don't you come in?

105
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,860
- I like Nolte.
- Why did you tell me that story?

106
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,779
I'm sorry. That's the wrong story.
Let's just skip it...

107
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,865
...and I'll try to think of a better one.

108
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,241
What's bothering you?

109
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,537
Global warming, acid rain, national debt.
Never even knew it was going on.

110
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,791
- Look at her nails. Totally real.
- Maybe you weren't paying attention.

111
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,045
Oh, let's face it, Lowenstein,
women are more devious than men.

112
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,379
My therapist was a woman.

113
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,382
Too bad you didn't get
all your talking done with her.

114
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,218
You expect a man
to be a tower of strength.

115
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,597
Then when it turns out he's got a few
weaknesses and some insecurities...

116
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,309
...what do you do? You turn around
and, goddamn it, you betray him.

117
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,397
- You feel that your mother betrayed you?
- Oh, God, I hate this Freudian crap.

118
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,234
It's not your job to listen to my problems.
If you don't mind, I'd like to go.

119
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,404
- You're free to leave anytime you want.
- Good.

120
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,577
- Goddamn shrink. Who was I kidding?
- What are you smiling at?

121
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,829
- I was a champion.
- Nothing. I don't know.

122
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,207
You have this goofy little look
on your face.

123
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,958
Come on.

124
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,920
Until Susan Lowenstein came along.

125
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,216
Her questions making me as dizzy
as her perfume.

126
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,855
- Jennifer Melfi?
- Yes?

127
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,128
So we open the fucking trunk.

128
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,966
This suffocating Russian cocksucker
pops up. He's still alive.

129
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,138
We lead him through the snow.
This asshole's shivering.

130
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:07,559
I mean, he's wearing fucking pajamas
and slippers in like 8-degree weather.

131
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,811
Hey.

132
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,021
- There he is.
- How you doing?

133
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,482
- Fellas.
- Hey, Ton.

134
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,485
Radio on the way in,
another fucking incident at the airport.

135
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,904
Fucking assholes.

136
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,323
I gotta make a couple calls.

137
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,077
Anyway, he starts running,
the Russian.

138
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,831
Boom! I'm telling you, the top of his head
came off like a fucking bad rug.

139
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,084
What a beating we had give this prick.

140
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,920
- Where is he now, you think?
- Who the fuck cares, right?

141
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,630
- Who the fuck knows?
- Poor bastard.

142
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,759
Never would have happened
if Paulie hadn't initially overreacted...

143
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,094
...but it's one for the books.

144
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,679
What do you mean, overreacted?

145
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,641
You choked him with the lamp,
or we could've got Silvio's scarole...

146
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,643
...without spending the night
in the open.

147
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,772
You let him jab you with the shovel.
Lets his guard down.

148
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,650
We would have caught up to the prick
if you didn't lose your fucking shoe.

149
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,571
Wait, you lost your shoe?
You didn't tell us about that.

150
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,450
- "Chrissy, don't leave me out here."
- You little cocksucker.

151
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,286
I covered your ass with Tony
about that whole thing...

152
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,330
...and never a word of fucking thanks.

153
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,875
Always playing that blood-relation card.
Tony's little favorite.

154
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,710
- Fuck you.
- What?

155
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,754
- Come on!
- Come on.

156
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,464
What the fuck?

157
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,309
That was a good story, damn it.

158
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,394
I'm telling you right now...

159
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,605
...it's finished with us.

160
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,858
- Goodbye, Dr. Melfi.
- See you next week.

161
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,827
- Hello.
- Like the flowers?

162
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,163
And, yeah, before you ask,
I am taking the medication.

163
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,915
How are you, Anthony?

164
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,044
- It's been a long time.
- I'm great, actually. You?

165
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,213
Thank you
for that beautiful arrangement.

166
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,423
I see you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

167
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,802
Well, you gotta have a sense of humor
in life, right? You taught me that.

168
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,096
And how is life?

169
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,848
Good, good.

170
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,935
Well, I'm separated, me and Carmela.

171
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,604
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't be.

172
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,691
Well, I always thought I saw
some good things there.

173
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,026
Two healthy kids. Other than that...

174
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,779
Look, the reason I called...

175
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,073
...I'd like you to have dinner with me.

176
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,034
Since we're not in therapy no more
and I'm a bachelor again.

177
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,370
That's very thoughtful of you.

178
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:37,083
Unfortunately, because of our prior
clinical relationship...

179
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,543
...I just can't do it.

180
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,297
- What, eat? You must be a toothpick.
- You know what I mean.

181
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,966
See, I knew you were gonna
say something like that.

182
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,468
I can't, Anthony, I'm sorry.

183
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,809
You know, I waited a respectable period
or whatever before making this call.

184
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,811
Well, then you realize yourself...

185
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,480
...there's something not quite right
about us dating.

186
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,234
No, I'm not undeterred by this.
We will talk again.

187
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,194
Thank you for the flowers.

188
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,156
- And the detergent.
- And the detergent.

189
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,492
- Of course, what's wrong with me?
- I don't know.

190
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,494
But we'll find out.

191
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,039
Leave it to Dr. Tony.

192
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,607
- What's the matter?
- The bear. Stay there.

193
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,621
Oh, right, lock the door.

194
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,333
What do you think, he's gonna wipe
his feet? He'll smash through the glass.

195
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:07,715
- Now, where is that guy's card?
- I don't know.

196
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,437
You have reached Fish and Game.
If you know the extension, press it now.

197
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,315
- Unbelievable.
- If not, press 0 for a directory.

198
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,068
Hello?

199
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,239
For hunting and fishing licenses, press 2.
For animal removal...

200
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,449
Did you get a letter
from my cousin in the can?

201
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,202
Yes, Officer Zmuida, hi.
Mrs. Soprano from North Caldwell.

202
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,287
We had the bear in our yard
the other night.

203
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,873
- What the fuck?
- Yes. It came back.

204
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,084
- Is anybody hurt?
- No, thank God.

205
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,586
- Property damage?
- No property damage I could see...

206
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,630
...but I didn't really
wanna go out there.

207
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,091
Oh, one of those eastern black bears?

208
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,927
- We can be up in about an hour.
- Yes. That would be great.

209
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,138
- Okay, we'll be here.
- All right. See you then.

210
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,931
Jesus Christ, when did this happen?

211
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,767
The first time, Sunday night,
and I saw it again just now.

212
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,895
A.J. didn't mention it to you when
you went to the game?

213
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,856
No.

214
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,899
I have to warn the Cusamanos.

215
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,318
They keep Esterhaz
chained up along the side there.

216
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,320
That bear will rip him to pieces.

217
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,830
Cusamanos weren't home.
Got the machine.

218
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,458
Well, I don't see Esterhaz.

219
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,296
Why didn't you call me
when this happened?

220
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,465
I called the cops.
They called Fish and Game.

221
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,052
What are you trying to prove? This isn't
Little House on the Fucking Prairie.

222
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,804
- Those thing are dangerous.
- Well, the ranger, whatever...

223
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,807
...said it was your duck food out there
that attracted it.

224
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,313
- I never heard of that happening before.
- Trapper Joe over here.

225
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,035
- We didn't find a spoor.
- I was just telling the gentleman...

226
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,288
...the animal still doesn't meet
the parameters for a removal.

227
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,582
So when somebody's leg is gone...

228
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,710
Problem is, it hasn't really
threatened anybody.

229
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,422
Sorry.

230
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,348
Whoa, hold on a minute.

231
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,851
You and your pal buy some new
lanyards for your whistles.

232
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,481
Well, we can't accept that.
And we don't have whistles.

233
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,358
Thanks, though.

234
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,034
Ranger Rick's a little light
in the Timberlands, huh?

235
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:45,164
Everybody's always gay with you.
He's a good-looking guy, that's all.

236
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,550
I already put the ammonia on the cans.
I told you.

237
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,197
Look, I came here
to give you your money...

238
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,075
...but this bear thing, though, I'm...

239
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,579
I'm worried.
You and A.J. here by yourselves.

240
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,207
What can we do? You want coffee?

241
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,837
- Last time it had a weird taste.
- The coffeemaker is shot.

242
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,923
- The heating element's corroded.
- That's not the problem.

243
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,261
You don't need another one of those.
Last month it was the upstairs toilet.

244
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,514
He goes down the street
to Willow Drive too.

245
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,100
Maybe he'll stay down there.

246
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,602
All right, look...

247
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,230
...you and A.J. check yourself
into a hotel until this blows over.

248
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,816
Here's 1200 extra
on top of our agreement.

249
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,277
- I'm not going to a hotel.
- Why not?

250
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,655
- I don't wanna break Anthony's routines.
- He'll get a kick out of it.

251
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,783
It's an adventure.
God knows he loves room service.

252
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,536
Yeah, I'll give him room service,
the end of my foot.

253
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,708
- What's with the attitude?
- Well, he's an asshole, that's what.

254
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,794
- So what? It's his age.
- Yeah, thank you, I know.

255
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,546
But you buy him too much stuff.

256
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,049
I think because you feel guilty
about the separation.

257
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,968
Excuse me. It wasn't my idea.

258
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,054
There is more than one way to ask.

259
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,974
- All right, could we please not?
- Spend $5000 on a set of drums.

260
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,270
SAT tutor, coffeemaker,
I gotta fight you tooth and nail.

261
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,857
All I said was I wanna see statements
from the tutor, or he doesn't get paid.

262
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,443
He's a college kid, Tony.
He's not set up for that.

263
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,904
You worried he's gonna soak you
for an extra pencil?

264
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,156
Oh, rim shot!

265
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,992
What I think, Tony,
is you're trying to make my life now...

266
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,286
...as hard on me financially as possible.

267
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,997
- Oh, it should be easy?
- Unbelievable.

268
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,458
What do think,
you're the only Catholic here?

269
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,462
I'm old school. I don't believe
in this separation shit and divorce.

270
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,091
Even if my wife was going after
some fucking immigrant.

271
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,470
Yet you are modern enough
to use a cell phone to call Italy...

272
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,306
...and every other fucking place
to threaten the guy's life.

273
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,602
Well, that's right. Certain people see him,
he's a dead man.

274
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,065
- He had coffee here, Tony, that's all.
- And now the coffeemaker sucks.

275
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,692
How do you like them apples?

276
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,948
You don't wanna stay at a hotel,
you suit yourself.

277
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,788
This is Anthony.

278
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:35,626
Could you call me
at 973-555-1299?

279
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:41,215
Thinking maybe I gotta come back.
You know, for therapy.

280
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,761
- Smells good, Feech.
- Yeah? You want a taste?

281
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,556
No, I'll wait.

282
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,893
No offense, kid, but don't look to me
like you do a lot of waiting.

283
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,647
- Just like his old man, huh?
- Lot of changes since you went away.

284
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,442
Twenty years, Madonna.

285
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,404
You know what the biggest change
for me is? Broads shaving their bushes.

286
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,199
I went over to Silvio's.
Like the Girl Scouts over there.

287
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,036
Think I'll let this simmer a bit.

288
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,204
Must be different in the can now.

289
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,707
Not like the old days. Fucking animals.

290
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,336
It's all about setting a precedent.

291
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:23,883
First day there, I walk in the mess,
and I'm wearing a puss, a fucking scowl.

292
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,135
I look around...

293
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,012
It's my nephew.

294
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,433
- Right in the middle of my story.
- There he is.

295
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,603
The man, the legend, Feech La Manna.

296
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,982
Hey, my God, look at you,
you big galoot.

297
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,236
What, did you go straight from the joint
to Earl Scheib? Look at this fucking tan.

298
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,946
Yeah.

299
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,532
You close the cellar door
when you came up?

300
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,452
It's like the Bowery Boys in here
with this house arrest.

301
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,081
- You got code words and secret passages.
- He's in the middle of a story.

302
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,041
When isn't he?

303
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,297
It's day one. I'm in the mess.

304
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:09,637
I look around, and I spot the biggest,
blackest motherfucker that I can find.

305
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,640
Everybody's looking at me.
And I walk right up to him and I say:

306
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,392
"What the fuck are you looking at?"

307
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,810
He says, "What?"

308
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:20,398
I said, "You heard me, motherfucker.
What the fuck are you looking at?"

309
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,484
And with that, I hit him,
right across the fucking coconut.

310
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,945
He goes down. I'm on top of him.
Everybody's around.

311
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,490
He gets some shots in.
Everybody's going fucking crazy.

312
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,119
The screws, this guy, everybody!
Motherfucker!

313
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:39,250
From that time on, nobody so much as
looks at me cross-eyed.

314
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,461
Well, welcome home, huh?

315
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,506
- Welcome home.
- Welcome home.

316
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,262
Reason I wanted to see you, Junior,
Tony too...

317
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,181
...now that I'm out,
I'd like to get back in the game.

318
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,018
- What did you have in mind?
- You know me, I'm an entrepreneur.

319
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:02,022
Get my shy going. Sports book.
Whatever you say.

320
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,988
Long as you don't
step on anybody's toes.

321
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,866
Me? I'm Fred Astaire.

322
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,540
Now, what's this Feech tells me?
You got a bear up there at the house?

323
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,334
What's it on, fucking CNN?

324
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,798
No, it's just that your wife's up there,
and the kids. Your ex-wife, whatever.

325
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,926
It's just that, wild animals,
they're dangerous. People talk.

326
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,970
What people? Who?

327
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,473
I don't know.

328
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,397
What am I supposed to do? Go up there
personally and set fucking bear traps?

329
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,357
We're separated, for chrissake.

330
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:59,455
- So where's the dinner at?
- I forget the name. It's in the car.

331
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,958
- Who's gonna be there?
- What, are you on the school paper?

332
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,086
Guys. It's business.

333
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,549
- You got any cash?
- Some.

334
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,468
Hand me my bag.

335
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,394
- That's all you got?
- It's like $400.

336
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,189
I'm low man tonight.
I gotta pay for everybody.

337
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,691
You know, this is fucking ridiculous,
Christopher.

338
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,903
Why should you get stuck all the time?
You should make Paulie pay.

339
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,405
What, I make the rules now?
Guy's a captain.

340
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,408
I know, but when he was in jail...

341
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,703
All I'm saying is,
if you get the extra responsibilities...

342
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,455
...you should get the benefits too.

343
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,417
You're right.

344
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,296
I'll say hello to the guys from you.

345
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,984
Benny, hi. Come on in.

346
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,195
Tony sent me. He says he wants
somebody stationed in the yard.

347
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,448
- He's worried the bear might come back.
- What? No, I don't want this.

348
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,826
Well, we'll switch off,
me and Paulie Germani.

349
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,997
- This is silly. I'm gonna call him.
- Actually, it's not that silly, Mrs. S.

350
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,333
If it was my family, I'd wanna know
there was a male at the house too.

351
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,586
What can you do about it
if it does come back?

352
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,839
Tony said to unlock the closet
and give me the shkupit, he called it.

353
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,842
- Oh, for God's sake.
- I mean, we'll call the Fish and Game too.

354
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,012
It's just... I'll have the weapon in case.

355
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,724
He's just worried about you, that's all.
And Anthony.

356
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,853
Well, okay. I don't know.

357
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:51,358
- You're very nice to do this.
- Nice got nothing to do with it.

358
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,695
Stay inside. You don't have to sit
out there like A Fistful of Dollars.

359
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,782
Tony said not in the house.
I got my little Sony in the car.

360
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,912
You want to eat?
We were just sitting down.

361
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,457
No, I'm good.
I just stopped at Tio Pepe's.

362
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,339
This frigging olive oil.
The food's drenched.

363
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,840
That's the reason it happened.

364
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,802
As far as fucking bears are concerned,
I say, get rid of them all.

365
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,888
They had their turn,
and now we got ours.

366
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,557
That's why dinosaurs
don't exist no more.

367
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,809
- Wasn't it a meteor?
- They're all meat-eaters.

368
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,188
- Meteor. Meteor.
- Take it easy.

369
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,066
Gentlemen, whenever you're ready.

370
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,240
- All right, are we set?
- Yeah, sure.

371
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,079
- What are you doing? You ready?
- I gotta make a pit stop.

372
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,710
- You forgetting something?
- You get it. I got the last one.

373
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,879
Here, baby.
Have some more cheesecake.

374
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:58,008
The other thing with bears is, if
you're ever chased by one, run downhill.

375
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,512
- Some reason, they can't do that.
- It's the moss.

376
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,597
They attack when you're
having your period.

377
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,933
No, no, that's jungle cats.

378
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,185
- So can we go?
- Hold your horses.

379
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,980
- What's going on? We ready or what?
- Yeah.

380
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,863
- Fine, I'll get it.
- Give me the fucking thing.

381
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,950
- I said, I'll get it.
- Enough. It's done.

382
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,181
- Eight hundred sixty dollars.
- What?

383
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,642
You heard me.
That's what you owe from last night.

384
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,147
You said you got it. I only got
like 100 bucks on me anyways.

385
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:57,276
Then get the rest by tonight,
or you start paying points.

386
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,660
- I'm thinking of going for the acupuncture.
- What, your shoulder again?

387
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,998
- Those long drives. It's already tender.
- Next time, we get you out there, Angelo.

388
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,334
After 18 years in the can,
I'm just happy to be outside.

389
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,503
What, they don't have a golf course
at Leavenworth?

390
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,591
Still a smart-ass, this one.

391
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,094
Carmine, you all right?
You barely touched your egg salad.

392
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,346
Too much gherkins.

393
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,474
- Smell that?
- What?

394
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,977
- Burning hair.
- I smell cut grass.

395
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,191
- Any word on your cousin getting out?
- Who's your cousin again?

396
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,611
- Tony Blundetto.
- Oh, yeah. Good guy. Right, right.

397
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,279
He was my best buddy inside.

398
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,949
- So you gonna give him a party?
- Take him home, get him laid.

399
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,203
What's the matter? Carmine?

400
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,996
- Carmine.
- Jesus Christ, Carmine!

401
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,041
- Call an ambulance.
- Is he breathing?

402
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,293
- Get that egg salad out.
- Hurry up!

403
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,224
- Lupertazzi residence.
- Carmine, it's John.

404
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,392
Hey, John boy. How's the weather?

405
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,313
Look, I got some bad news.
Your dad's had a stroke.

406
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,857
- Oh, my God. How bad?
- There's some paralysis.

407
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,360
It's too early to tell.
They're doing all they can.

408
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,570
- My mom there?
- I called her, she's on her way.

409
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,533
- We're over at St. Vincent's.
- Anything, John. Anything he needs.

410
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,868
I'm on the next plane.

411
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,079
Sad, this shit, huh?

412
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,836
Wonder if I could smoke in here.

413
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,423
You know, I haven't forgotten
our arrangement last year.

414
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,386
- You leaving me in the lurch like that.
- It was the right thing to do, John.

415
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,763
- Taking out a boss? Come on.
- Even still.

416
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,267
What do you want, an apology?
A fucking Whitman Sampler? What?

417
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,610
Boy, imagine if his fucking speech
is affected. Poor bastard.

418
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,500
So when you're up at the house,
who comes to visit? Anybody?

419
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,295
Mostly Rosalie Aprile, Sil's wife.

420
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:25,591
- Who calls on the phone?
- Most of the calls are for Anthony.

421
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,347
So?

422
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:22,689
Look, the real reason I'm here
is to confront you, in a positive way...

423
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:27,277
...about taking our relationship
in that other direction.

424
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,366
Why did you have to be underhanded?
I don't find that appealing, frankly.

425
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:36,536
I was gonna ask you out for coffee
or something, but I didn't think you'd go.

426
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,122
I'll pay for the hour.
That goes without saying.

427
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,540
Forget that.

428
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,835
I was listening to that guy on TV.
Dr. Phil?

429
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,755
And he was talking about
a similar situation.

430
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,800
And he said that you could
if you wanted to.

431
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,470
There's no set rules.
It's basically about malpractice...

432
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,473
...and you probably couldn't get sued.
That's not the point.

433
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,819
Look, I was thinking about
all kinds of moves.

434
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,487
Buy her a piece of jewelry.

435
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,741
Pay the guy to close down the restaurant
where she eats, hire a mandolin player.

436
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,996
This is the place where we've been
most honest with each other.

437
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,415
And that's the way I always liked it.

438
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:26,628
So that being said,
if you don't like me personally...

439
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,423
...or the cut of my jib
or my face or whatever...

440
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,593
...then the matter will end here,
and I will never ask you again.

441
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,806
You can be honest.

442
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:44,438
I like you, Anthony.
And, no, you have a very nice face.

443
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,357
- Working on the weight too, by the way.
- Good.

444
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:56,074
Explain to me, okay, why this is
a matter of such importance to you.

445
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,786
- There are plenty of women out there.
- You're different from what's out there.

446
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,581
Not to mention
being drop-dead beautiful.

447
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,668
My training teaches me
to go fairly quickly to the idea...

448
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,880
...that what you really want
is to come back to therapy.

449
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,382
Jesus Christ almighty.
Come on, will you?

450
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,969
Your marriage of 20-something years
has collapsed.

451
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,346
No doubt there are issues
with your children.

452
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,308
Why can't I do something
that's just for me for a change?

453
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,809
It would be for you.

454
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,982
Well, I want you. And not just
for the smart things you say.

455
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,902
I want... I want your skin.

456
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:36,281
I want your mouth. I want your eyes.

457
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:42,788
You project all these qualities onto me.
You don't know me.

458
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:47,084
This is what happens
between doctor and patient.

459
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,514
Don't do that.

460
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:18,281
Out of respect for this office.

461
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,914
Forget about the way that Tony Soprano
makes his way in the world.

462
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,625
That's just to feed his children.

463
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,879
There's two Tony Sopranos.
You've never seen the other one.

464
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,006
That's the one I wanna show to you.

465
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,511
- Hi.
- Hey. I wonder if I could use the W.C.

466
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,722
- Of course, come on in.
- Yeah, okay.

467
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,183
- Is it cold out?
- Yeah, a little.

468
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,935
But I got a fleece.

469
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:53,543
I know him. He'll just keep
coming back and coming back.

470
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,587
I had to let him down easy, I...

471
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,132
- You think it's worth telling the police?
- What?

472
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,134
Jesus, Elliot.

473
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:05,013
I don't wanna paint in somber tones here,
but the man is a sociopath.

474
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,557
Unpracticed in not getting
what he wants.

475
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:13,104
And now, since the therapy is kaput,
what use are you to him except for sex?

476
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:19,277
Thank you, Elliot. Your depth of feeling
is really quite extraordinary here.

477
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,823
All you could come up with was this
weak borscht about professional ethics...

478
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,786
...because you are worried about
how this thug will handle rejection.

479
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,625
You know, at first I did find him
a little sexy.

480
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,087
Dangerous alpha male.

481
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:42,509
But as year followed year,
the ugliness I saw, I heard...

482
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,847
- You kept him a long time, though.
- There's a mutual sympathy there...

483
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:52,352
...of some kind, I guess.
Maybe it's just the Italian thing.

484
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:07,534
- Sil said you were looking for me?
- Sit down.

485
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,750
- This about the Easter baskets?
- I don't even know what that is.

486
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,378
And to tell you the truth,
I don't wanna know.

487
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:22,048
What's this shit between you and Paulie?
You chiseled him out of a dinner?

488
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:26,052
- I chiseled him? He said that?
- I asked you a question.

489
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,389
Can I say something
in my own defense?

490
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,725
It's not right
that I have to pay all the time.

491
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,352
I've been paying for fucking years.

492
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,731
Are you done? Good.

493
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:41,067
You pay till I tell you
you don't have to pay no more.

494
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,652
And don't give me that face.

495
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,948
You know how many tabs, how many
dinners I picked up over the years?

496
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,242
Richie Aprile,
fat fucking Jerry Anastasia.

497
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,995
Those guys killed me at Benihana's.

498
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,540
And forget it, if they want a steak,
I put a new wing on Peter Luger's.

499
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:59,836
Brandy, cigars, champagne.
Could've bought a fucking plane.

500
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,088
I hear you, Ton,
but that was before inflation.

501
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,840
Whatever.

502
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:10,680
It's tradition. It's like in ancient times,
the samurais, they had these pages.

503
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,101
Young boys that did their errands,
washed their clothes, shit like that.

504
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,686
It's a sign of respect.

505
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:24,444
Why don't you cheer up? One day,
some kid will be paying for your dinners.

506
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:31,159
Atlantic City loves its oldies
on Oldies 98.3.

507
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:39,626
So the pope says, "Just one more thing.
She gotta have big tits."

508
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,586
Oh, man.

509
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,633
You okay, Ton?
You're being, like, a little quiet.

510
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,719
Yeah, yeah, I'm just...
I'm full, that's all.

511
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,306
Calm before the storm. Get him near
those crap tables, and look out.

512
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,102
Jesus, I'm stuffed. I can't remember
the last time I ate this much.

513
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,771
- Sure youse don't want no dessert?
- Not for me.

514
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,815
No, I'm good.

515
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,151
Thank you. Thanks.

516
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,237
Enjoy it, girls.

517
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,490
I've been enjoying looking at you
the whole night.

518
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,452
- Get some fucking glasses.
- We gotta go.

519
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,288
All right, I'll see you over
at the $100 table.

520
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,457
Yeah. Right.

521
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,799
Ton, you sure you're all right?
You got a big mus on.

522
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,057
It's a fucking broad. Believe that?

523
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,185
- Really? You mean?
- It's the real deal, I think.

524
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,312
No shit, huh?

525
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,359
The thing is, we got this
platonic thing going.

526
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,486
We have had for many years.

527
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,157
She thinks that's what it is,
but it's not.

528
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,659
And no amount of convincing
will change her mind.

529
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:00,999
- So she was a friend?
- Yeah.

530
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,045
They're wrapping up the lobster
for me to take to Ginny.

531
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,630
- We'll see you over there.
- Yeah.

532
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,511
- Anything else, gentlemen?
- We're good.

533
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,555
My friend here will take
the check, though.

534
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,559
Have a wonderful evening.

535
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:31,446
Eleven eighty-four. Oh, babe.
I gotta play that number.

536
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,241
I'm gonna go wash up.

537
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:46,419
I'll tell you, after a meal like that,
what I could use is a nice piece of ass.

538
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,631
Who knows, maybe I'll call down,
have them send one up to the room.

539
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,300
Why don't you just fuck yourself,
save a little money.

540
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,552
- What's your problem?
- Stop trying to bait me.

541
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,764
- You know what my fucking problem is.
- No. Why don't you tell me?

542
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,682
You want me to tell you? Fine.

543
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:05,104
Steaks, 3-pound lobsters, shrimp fucking
cocktails you made everybody get.

544
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,358
On top of everything else, you send
those skanks a bottle of Cristal?

545
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,236
I was being a gentleman.
You ought to try it some time.

546
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,531
Not to mention the lyonnaise fucking
potatoes you didn't even touch.

547
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,075
- What? I lost my appetite.
- Fuck you.

548
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,953
- Excuse me?
- You fucking heard me.

549
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,122
I'm telling you, I don't give
a fuck anymore who you're related to.

550
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,960
Go ahead, Paulie. Go for it.
Your big fucking moment!

551
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,463
- You little fuck.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

552
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,465
Was there a problem with the service?

553
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,635
- What are you talking about?
- You left me $16, sir.

554
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,763
- Perhaps you miscounted.
- There's 1200 bucks in there.

555
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,850
That's correct, and the bill was $1184.

556
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,478
Assuming you don't tip on tax
or alcohol, 15 percent...

557
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,605
I'm tapped out.

558
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,400
You think this job is easy?

559
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,403
- I have kids.
- Then go back inside before you get hurt.

560
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,489
- I have a goddamn family to support.
- Fuck off.

561
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,827
Yeah, right. Go piss it away at blackjack,
fucking assholes.

562
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,996
What'd you say?

563
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,835
What do you got to say now?

564
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,092
Chrissy, he's fucked up.

565
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,346
Don't have medicine
they're supposed to take, these assholes?

566
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,764
I don't know.

567
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,853
- He'll say we hit him with a brick.
- Still going, this asshole.

568
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,529
That's my money, Paulie.

569
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:12,398
- How's he doing?
- I love him so much, and I can't do shit.

570
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,030
We're all praying for him.

571
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,745
You know,
you were another son to him.

572
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,843
- Yeah?
- You get some sleep?

573
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,429
- A little. You know.
- Fucked up, huh?

574
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,392
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm not too worried about the cops.

575
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,018
Nobody knows us down there.

576
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,856
The reason I called,
let's bury the hatchet, you and me.

577
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:57,610
- All this bullshit with us.
- I know. I know, it's stupid.

578
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,781
Life's too short, Chrissy. You can't
waste it fighting with your friends.

579
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,908
Look what could've happened last night.

580
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,953
One of us could've got hurt,
or even killed, for chrissake.

581
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,162
I know.

582
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,416
You're special to me, you know.
Always have been.

583
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,793
You too, Paulie, to me.

584
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,423
- We'll split the tab.
- I'm sorry, Paulie.

585
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:23,177
I apologize too, kid.
I'll talk to you later.

586
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:38,276
When you say that,
you make me feel less than.

587
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,198
Next week, everyone.

588
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,085
Good luck.

589
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,840
- I'm going out of town next week.
- Okay.

590
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,885
- Good night.
- Bye.

591
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,934
Anthony.

592
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,355
- Hello.
- Hey.

593
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,983
A friend of mine had these.

594
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,613
I'll see you next week.

595
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,245
I was saying, a friend had these
and couldn't use them.

596
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:34,874
I figured, well, maybe we could.

597
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,462
Tickets. Bermuda.
Lodging at the Elbow Beach Hotel.

598
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,551
I turn down
a wonderful dinner invitation...

599
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,554
...and you think I'll go away with you?

600
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,724
Well, the guy couldn't use them,
and he gave them to me.

601
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,060
What do you want me to do,
throw them away?

602
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:00,399
Come on, I'm breaking out
the big guns here.

603
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,902
You're turning me into half a stalker.

604
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:11,619
Listen, Anthony, I'm...
I'm not going to go out with you, okay?

605
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:15,706
And it's not because you're unattractive
or I don't think I'd have a good time.

606
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,960
It's just something
I'm not going to do.

607
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,254
And I would like you
to respect my decision.

608
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:26,175
And just try to feel that
I know what's right for me.

609
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,388
Okay?

610
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:44,110
But it's not just
the psychiatric-ethic stuff, is it?

611
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:48,990
I wanna preserve the option for you that
you could come back to our work...

612
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,658
...if you wish...

613
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,411
...and that we could pick up
where we've left off.

614
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,790
- I don't think you get this. I want you.
- And that's very flattering to me.

615
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,960
- I'm not interested in flattering you.
- I know you're not.

616
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,671
All right, then what is it?
Okay? What is it?

617
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,967
Just help me understand it, okay?

618
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:18,978
You know, Anthony, during therapy, I...
I never judged you or your behavior.

619
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:23,649
- It's not the place of a therapist to do so.
- All right, I get all this. Go, go.

620
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:29,488
In a personal relationship,
I don't think I could sit silent.

621
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,326
About what?

622
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:41,250
- Our values are just very different.
- You don't like my values?

623
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,628
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

624
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,173
No.

625
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,637
Okay. Like what?

626
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,849
- It's getting late...
- No, no, no.

627
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,851
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

628
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:07,109
Well, you're not a truthful person.

629
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:12,698
You're not respectful of women.
You're not really respectful of people.

630
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,785
- I don't love people?
- Maybe you love them, I don't know.

631
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,497
You take what you want from them
by force or the threat of force.

632
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:24,877
I couldn't live like that.
I couldn't bear witness to violence or...

633
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,921
Fuck you!

634
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,884
You're a fucking cunt!

635
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,904
Ohh.

636
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:02,248
- How come Benny's not outside?
- He just got here. He's going out.

637
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,251
Where is he?

638
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,087
He's in your office,
on the phone with his girlfriend.

639
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,802
Hey, Ton, how's it going?

640
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,016
- You can take the night off. I'll spell you.
- No, no, no, Ton, that's all right.

641
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,144
- It's okay, really.
- I'll take over, okay, for tonight.

642
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:28,232
- Okay, well, night, Mrs. S.
- Good night, Benny. Thank you.

643
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:37,259
- You want coffee?
- No.
