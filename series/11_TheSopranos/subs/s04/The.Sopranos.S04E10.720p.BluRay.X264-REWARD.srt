1
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,851
Oh, there ain't no bear back there.

2
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,978
Fellas!

3
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,992
Well, the way I feel right now,
I'd like to meet a bear.

4
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,161
What would you do
if you did meet him?

5
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:05,749
Oh, that bear'd have just
as much a chance as this pork chop.

6
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,714
Where you boys all going?
It ain't over.

7
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,262
Somebody's gonna get something
they ain't expecting.

8
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,816
Have a bite...

9
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,127
Look out, here he comes!

10
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,972
- Where's Furio?
- He couldn't get a flight...

11
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,600
...out of Rome in time,
so I'm driving again today.

12
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,728
Come on in.
He'll be right down.

13
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,120
No coffee, I gotta go. Okay?

14
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,501
- What the hell'd you do to your hair?
- I cut it. What do you think?

15
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:36,173
We agreed you'd talk to me first if you
were gonna do something to your hair.

16
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,634
What do you think of it?

17
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,805
- It's short.
- Good, he eats his carrots.

18
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,061
- Makes you look younger.
- Benny's waiting for you.

19
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,815
All right. Come here.

20
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,362
You fat honey-dripper!
Come up with the rest of our money...

21
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,031
...or I'll strip the lard off your ugly...

22
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,826
Pretty.

23
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,664
Pretty, pretty.

24
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,375
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

25
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,170
Cosette? Come on, Mommy.

26
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,381
Let's go for a walk.

27
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,633
Cosette?

28
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,387
- Where's the dog?
- You shut the TV?

29
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,724
Where's the dog?

30
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,104
Oh, my God! Cosette?

31
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,523
- What?
- Christopher!

32
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,192
She's not breathing!
Her neck feels broken.

33
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,321
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God, she's dead!

34
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,368
- I fell asleep.
- What?

35
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,870
She must've crawled
under there for warmth.

36
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,248
Are you fucking crazy?

37
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,250
You fucking killed her!

38
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,460
I didn't kill her.
I must've sat on her.

39
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,880
Oh, jeez.
Oh, my poor baby.

40
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,551
I'm sorry. It was an accident,
for chrissake.

41
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,847
She shouldn't be on the furniture.

42
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,933
It's because you were fucking high,
Christopher.

43
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:15,772
You and your fucking smack.
Fuck! And lifestyle.

44
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,566
I'll get you another dog.

45
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,609
I don't want another dog.

46
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,282
Four in the side.

47
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,659
One up the ass.

48
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,541
So nobody's heard from Ralph?

49
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,461
I'm starting to worry, Ton.

50
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,672
- I'll call him again.
- Try the gay man's choir.

51
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,300
I read they were having tryouts today.

52
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,303
Three ball, far corner.

53
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,221
Son of a bitch!

54
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,765
Hey, Chrissy.

55
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,850
Where you been?

56
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,687
This was in the mail
for you outside, Tony. UPS.

57
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,482
- What's going on?
- He's calling Ralph.

58
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,068
Leave a message and leave
your phone number.

59
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,363
With my schedule, I cannot
look up phone numbers.

60
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,156
Answering machine again.

61
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,992
You're up, T.

62
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,661
How you doing? Feeling all right?

63
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,706
Me? Yeah. Great.

64
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,092
Oh, fuck.

65
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,220
What's that, Ton?

66
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,807
That's Tony and Ralph's horse,
Pie-O-My.

67
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:38,438
Where you going?
Ton? It's your shot.

68
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,524
What are you doing?

69
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,902
That's a forfeit. That's our money.

70
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,579
- Bing.
- Get rid of that fucking picture.

71
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,332
- What, you don't wanna...?
- You hear me? Burn it!

72
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,585
I never wanna see
the fucking thing again!

73
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,695
What?

74
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,758
What's with Ralph?
Fucking Bermuda Triangle?

75
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,970
This shit with his kid.
He's probably down in the bunker.

76
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,765
I'll tell you,
if I didn't know better...

77
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,520
- We're off the record here, Albert.
- We're off the record?

78
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,647
It's Tony.

79
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,319
What? Am I wrong?

80
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,988
Honestly, I don't know.

81
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,534
Take a leak.

82
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,126
This is bad, my friend.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

83
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,837
I wouldn't piss on this Ralph
if he was on fire.

84
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,924
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?

85
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,885
If it can happen to him,
it can happen to any of us.

86
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,055
And what's next? You get clipped
for wearing the wrong shoes?

87
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,683
What can you do? Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.

88
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:44,606
Exactly my point. If Tony did do this,
whack Ralph, over a fucking horse...

89
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,902
...that guy'd be the first guy on line
to pull his fucking plug.

90
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,467
- Tony.
- Ronnie, hey.

91
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,887
I think Justin recognized me
a few minutes ago.

92
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,935
Thank you.

93
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,155
Come in, come in. He's getting dressed.

94
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,033
I'll wait in the car.

95
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,663
Well, welcome back.

96
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,040
I bring presents.

97
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,876
Really? That is so sweet.

98
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:52,257
Also, for the grownups, I bring some
of my uncle's wine, but it's come later.

99
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,259
I just made some coffee. You sure?

100
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,971
Thank you, but I wait in the car.

101
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,279
What's the matter with you?

102
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,658
I'm sad for my father.

103
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,619
All right, but you gotta get over it.

104
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:11,294
So I unwrap the paper,
and there she is...

105
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,965
...with her head held high
and her ears perked up.

106
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,177
And there I am smiling.

107
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,847
What happened then?

108
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:31,648
Still, I gotta be the sad clown
for my friends, my family.

109
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,233
You know, a brave front.

110
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,653
I've heard you describe yourself
this way.

111
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,863
The sad clown.

112
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,865
I've never seen it.

113
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,077
Carmela also painted
a very different picture.

114
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,745
What do you mean?

115
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,165
Volatile, punching the walls...

116
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,086
...compulsive, gorging on food.

117
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:57,006
Kind of a far cry from the seltzer bottle
and bicycle horn.

118
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,550
Well, I'm sorry.

119
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,678
Maybe you'd like Carmela to be in here
if I'm so obnoxious.

120
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,557
What I'm trying to establish is
your response to sadness...

121
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,976
...is usually rage, not humor.

122
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,228
You two don't have
to trouble yourselves...

123
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,980
...because I doubled my dosage.

124
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,608
I don't want you taking 80 milligrams
of Prozac.

125
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,778
You kick it up to 80 for a week,
10 days...

126
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,906
...just to pull back on the stick,
get the nose up...

127
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,827
...then you duck back down to 40
before the limp-dick thing sets in.

128
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,122
One, that's ineffective.

129
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,834
Two, it's not a treatment for grief.

130
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,132
Let's get back to Pie-O-My.

131
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,177
It's sad that you've lost something
that you love.

132
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:47,557
- That being said, it is a horse.
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

133
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,978
The only other time you've
become this emotional in here...

134
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,646
...it was those ducks.

135
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,150
That was different. That was a whole
different thing. They were ducks.

136
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,780
Is it different? You haven't grieved
in this way for people.

137
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,823
Your mother, your best friend.

138
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,326
Can't I just be sad for a horse...

139
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:11,372
...without some touchy-feely-
Freudian-shit component to it?

140
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,835
When it was the ducks, it embodied
feelings of dread about your family...

141
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,087
...that something terrible
was gonna happen.

142
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,590
It's just the miserable way she died.

143
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,676
It just makes me wonder
what kind of toilet world we live in.

144
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,304
Friend of the family, little boy...

145
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,516
...shot with an arrow,
cuts off the flow of blood to his brain.

146
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,810
- Oh, no.
- Thirteen years old!

147
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,771
He's gonna live, but he's
never gonna be right.

148
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,606
How awful for the parents.

149
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,233
Yeah.

150
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,738
My nephew, I love that kid
like I love my son.

151
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,535
But I think he's got a drug problem,
heroin.

152
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:53,248
And it kills me just to say it because
I got so many hopes tied up in this kid.

153
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,707
This is Christopher.

154
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,211
And this 9/11 shit. I don't know,
this shit that's going on everywhere.

155
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,755
It's like some asshole is stalking
the human race.

156
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,509
Anthony, do any of your associates
think about any of this?

157
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,262
I don't know. We don't talk about it.

158
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:20,233
I know it's ridiculous, but I feel like the
Reverend Rodney King Jr., you know?

159
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,068
"Why can't we all just get along?"

160
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,989
- What's ridiculous about it?
- Come on. Don't jerk me off.

161
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,117
This is me you're talking to.

162
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,246
You've caused much suffering yourself,
haven't you?

163
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,381
My wife prays to God.

164
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,427
What kind of God does this shit?

165
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,556
How about Carmine Lupertazzi?

166
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,559
Christopher talk about a dinner
with him and Tony last July?

167
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,019
Nope.

168
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,438
What's the matter, Adriana?

169
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,773
You and Christopher arguing?

170
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,526
It's a stressful time
right before a wedding.

171
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,612
A lot of guys get cold feet.

172
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,615
He's fucking stoned on H
all the time, okay?

173
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,660
There. You happy?

174
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,914
You know, we put you guys
on the mailing list for Hazelden.

175
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,918
That rehab shit? That's where all those
brochures are coming from? From you?

176
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,713
Convince him he needs help,
that he should be in rehab.

177
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,888
Look at you with that little face.

178
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:46,903
These flat screens, I'll tell you,
no glare, high definition.

179
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,614
I was watching On the Waterfront
down at Sears.

180
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,117
Karl Malden's nose hairs looked
like fucking BX cables.

181
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,790
Voice mail again.

182
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,628
Chrissy, we're down here
waiting for the TVs.

183
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,254
Let me ask you something.

184
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,716
The other day, T with that picture.

185
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,594
He looked like he was gonna cry.

186
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,765
And still no word from Ralph.

187
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,269
Where the fuck is this kid?

188
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,955
What do you want around here?

189
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,083
- Can you do an eighth of scag?
- Five hundred.

190
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,293
Yeah, wrap it up.

191
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,045
Get the fuck out the car, bitch!

192
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,381
Motherfucker, you know who I am?

193
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,591
Who the fuck is this?

194
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,055
You know who the fuck I'm with?

195
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,183
You ain't no fucking cop,
that's for sure.

196
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,561
The fuck you gonna do with that?

197
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,855
Stick it up your mother's twat!

198
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,159
Oh, goddamn it.

199
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,077
What?

200
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,206
Piece a shit, the cork,
it got stuck in the bottle.

201
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,917
- Homemade crap.
- That somebody cared enough about...

202
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,337
...to carry all the way
from the old country for you.

203
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,093
What a fucking week.

204
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,430
I talked to Ronnie, asked her
if she's even heard from Ralph.

205
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,976
Little fucking kid's got
a respiratory infection now.

206
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,898
She just heard about Pie-O-My.
She's sick about it.

207
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,944
Hello? We're talking
about Justin here.

208
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:56,199
Sorry, I was thinking about my mother,
her skin condition.

209
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,626
Oh, my God. Did I forget
to take that out?

210
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,795
What's wrong with you?

211
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,506
Anyway, Ma, Dad's right.

212
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,675
It's not a bad drive. It's interstate
all the way up to Boston.

213
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,053
If you don't wanna
accompany me, fine.

214
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,138
Your sister can come up from Florida.

215
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,224
Come on, she's not gonna do that.

216
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,142
Of course I'll go.

217
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,189
Did she tell you, Hugh?
My horse died.

218
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,108
Pie-O-My.

219
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,944
- Oh, that's too bad.
- God, this wine.

220
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,987
There was a fire at the stables.

221
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,449
She had to be destroyed.
You should've seen her.

222
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,326
String beans, Hugh?

223
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,791
Oh, my God.
Baby, what happened?

224
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,168
He got jacked by some spics.

225
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,379
They took his ride,
his fucking watch too.

226
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,965
Jesus Christ, the Cartier?

227
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,219
Christopher, you're bleeding.

228
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,264
- Stop touching it.
- Oh, my God, baby.

229
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,474
Listen, you think I could get
some money?

230
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,143
What?

231
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,272
- Who are you?
- Eddie. From down the park.

232
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,815
He's good people, Adriana.

233
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,985
I took him home. He was fucked up,
but I straightened him out.

234
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,779
- He owes me 30 bucks.
- Get the fuck out of here.

235
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,573
- What?
- Adriana.

236
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,867
Get out of my house.

237
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,204
- Don't stiff me on this, man.
- Get out!

238
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,208
What's the matter with you?
Guy's my friend.

239
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,460
That's your friend?

240
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,218
Hazelden? What's this?

241
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,512
It came for you, in the mail.

242
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,848
Recovery?

243
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,811
You put me on a mailing list
for junkies now, huh?

244
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,317
Where do you get your balls, huh?
Where?

245
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,082
Oh, oh! What are you doing?

246
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,835
What? Sil said torch it.

247
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,798
A classy piece like this?

248
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,635
Horse with the trees, wooden frame.

249
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,803
Twenty-five to 30 G's at a minimum.

250
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,766
Yeah, I think it was Tony said he
wanted it burnt, Paulie, specifically.

251
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,102
- Put it in my car. I'll take it home.
- All right.

252
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,022
It'd be an honor to hang his picture
in my house.

253
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,192
Tony, can you come down here, please?

254
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,444
What?

255
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,030
What's the matter?

256
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,955
- What happened?
- Your nephew.

257
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,499
Christopher did this?

258
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,044
He hit you? What for?

259
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,630
- What's the difference, Tony?
- He was high.

260
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,675
Little prick. I'm gonna wring
his fucking neck. Where is he?

261
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,052
He's been using drugs.
Heroin.

262
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,057
Yeah?

263
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,310
- Who's this?
- You called me, maricón.

264
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,813
- Where's Christopher, asshole?
- Fuck your mother.

265
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,399
Oh, his car was stolen
by some Puerto Ricans.

266
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,944
They took his cell phone too.
I don't know what to do.

267
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,655
I already packed a suitcase
for my aunt's in Daytona.

268
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,366
Take it easy. Don't do something
you're gonna regret.

269
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,368
Three weeks before their wedding.

270
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,371
Maybe he needs to be in rehab.

271
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,165
You can hire someone to do
an intervention, apparently.

272
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,544
Girls, come on. We're a family here.

273
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,047
What, I gotta spell it out for you?

274
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:48,306
Take it easy. Let me figure out
how to handle this.

275
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,684
Please, don't hurt him.

276
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,020
Come here, honey.

277
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,175
At this stage, the fighters are getting
closer and closer...

278
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,680
Why am I always having to come here?

279
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,518
Fur, hi.

280
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,395
Carmela.

281
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,356
Anthony, how you doing, man?

282
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,232
Did we come at a bad time?

283
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,694
The decorating ideas.

284
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,238
Do you wanna come in?

285
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:54,705
- I'm sorry for the mess.
- Oh, please, this is nothing.

286
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,709
So there is a page
from Metropolitan Home.

287
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:03,005
Now, wait till you see how a mirrored
backsplash can amplify a room.

288
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,343
You want something,
something to drink?

289
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,428
We gotta go.

290
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,972
If you got a cup of coffee.

291
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,896
He loved that little man, by the way.

292
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,191
Gobbetto. He's good luck.

293
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:27,029
Not that he remembered to thank you.
And Meadow loved that book.

294
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:31,117
You know, I feel bad.
I didn't give you something.

295
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:35,246
I bring something, but I forgot it
when I left that morning.

296
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,503
Balsamic vinegar, 35 years
from my sister's husband's family.

297
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,589
Live in Modena.

298
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:54,890
So aside from your dad, was it
wonderful being back in Italy?

299
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,352
Oh, it was wonderful, yeah.

300
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,564
Go home, see your friends, your family.

301
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,941
I gotta be honest.

302
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,986
It was not so nice.

303
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,863
I don't belong there no more.

304
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,116
- No?
- Something change.

305
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,784
Maybe me.

306
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,162
What do you mean?

307
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,290
I'm like a visitor in my hometown.

308
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,001
Life went on without me.

309
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,211
There is nothing there for me now.

310
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,963
No special someone?

311
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,467
I feel strange to live here also.

312
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,136
Maybe I should never have come
to America.

313
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,722
You've made such a nice life
for yourself, though.

314
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,558
You've got a wonderful home,
a girlfriend.

315
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,727
- No.
- No? What do you mean, no?

316
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,562
Jessica?

317
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:50,070
I try to talk to her,
but there is no communication...

318
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,991
...like with some people,
you know what I mean?

319
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,913
That's what love is built on.

320
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,080
Si.

321
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:07,046
So why did you come back?

322
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,591
You said you'd take me to CompUSA,
so I could get a new Magic Stick.

323
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,343
And I will.

324
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,888
Yeah, well, I got stuff to do.
I told you.

325
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,309
Well, I better get going.

326
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,604
Thank you very much for the vinegar.

327
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,328
Hello?

328
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,585
Where's Bronco?
She jump ship already?

329
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,963
She's in hospital for a while.

330
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,340
- Cyst.
- Yeah?

331
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,636
Where's the old fart?
I gotta talk to him.

332
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,265
It's his afternoon nap.
You want me to wake him?

333
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,518
No, give him a while.

334
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,605
Want some wine?

335
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,775
From Furio's uncle in Italy?

336
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,242
He says they had a lot of sun
in this year.

337
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,578
Salute.

338
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,626
It needs ice.

339
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,843
I'm gonna watch the Bloomberg.

340
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,229
- What's all that?
- I'm making a website for my business.

341
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,774
- You know how to do that?
- No cable.

342
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:55,070
I'm going to pay somebody
35 bucks an hour?

343
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,698
I stuck, I call Bill.

344
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,284
You got married yet?

345
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:04,204
Maybe when he gets back
from Port St. Lucie.

346
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:08,000
The baseball spring training for his Mets.

347
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,171
That Bill's a lucky man.

348
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:18,010
You Russians, you got all the angles.
You come over here, you bust your ass.

349
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,679
People are people.

350
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,434
Well, look at you. You got
every excuse to be in the bottle...

351
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,396
...and here you are designing websites.

352
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,315
What do you mean? What excuse?

353
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,778
- Well, your...
- No, what?

354
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,615
Come on, you know, that...

355
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,784
My leg.

356
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,661
Of course.

357
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,372
I don't think of it right away.

358
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,960
There are worse things.

359
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,630
Countdown timer
with automatic shut-off.

360
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,383
Simply put your food in,
set the timer and walk away.

361
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,177
Your new George Foreman Grill
will tell you exactly...

362
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,514
...when your food is grilled
to perfection.

363
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,724
This grill does all the work for you.

364
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:09,520
With my exclusive 20-minute
digital countdown timer with auto...

365
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,398
Heroin? You got only one option.

366
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:17,528
A dog you love catches rabies, you
put her out of its misery, Anthony.

367
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,740
Salute.

368
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,628
So, what do I do, Uncle Jun?

369
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,674
The feds get him in this condition,
who knows what he's liable to say?

370
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,301
You go on trial like me,
you won't sleep at night.

371
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,430
All the more reason to clean him up.

372
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,685
Still, he's a...

373
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,604
He's a major liability.
If it were anybody else...

374
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,610
Reminds me of people's feet.

375
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,576
I don't know if I can do
that other thing.

376
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,870
Dominic Palladino,
you remember him?

377
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,955
B and E guy, a real juicer.

378
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,126
Well, he's in AA now.
I thought maybe I'd give him a call.

379
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,129
They can treat this shit nowadays.

380
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,549
Me with the competency hearings.
You with the head shrinkers.

381
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,093
This one in rehab now.

382
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,769
I was so upset when he didn't bring me
a present back from Italy.

383
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,854
He got something for A.J.
and for Meadow.

384
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,858
He gave me some vinegar,
but I don't think it was meant for me.

385
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,235
It must've meant something
that he felt bad.

386
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,946
Carmela, you sound
like you're 15 years old.

387
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,032
I say I'm helping him decorate.

388
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,951
I bring A.J. with me.
Now even he smells a rat.

389
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:52,331
Carmela, if Tony suspects one iota,
you know what'll happen to Furio.

390
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,667
These guys are living
in a different century.

391
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,544
It didn't stop you.

392
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,421
Steve at the gym?

393
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,258
I felt so guilty all the time,
the lies and the sneaking.

394
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:07,638
It took Jackie going in the hospital
to get me to stop.

395
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,431
We haven't slept together yet.

396
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,308
You're not fucking him?

397
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,436
So this isn't really real.

398
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,897
It is real.

399
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,816
We communicate.

400
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,443
He looks at me like I'm beautiful.

401
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,363
He thinks I'm interesting when I talk.

402
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:29,743
Just those few minutes when we
see each other, I live for those.

403
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,540
I feel like my life is slipping through
my fingers, that I will never be happy.

404
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,292
If you haven't slept with him yet, don't.

405
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,879
And don't go over there anymore.

406
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,936
We're all here?

407
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,355
Good afternoon.

408
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,233
For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Dominic...

409
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,486
...and I'm an alcoholic and an addict.
Don't forget "scumbag."

410
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,031
As some of you obviously don't know...

411
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,368
...I've also been in recovery now
going on four years.

412
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,122
I joined AA in prison,
and frankly, it saved my life.

413
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,835
Okay, now, we're all here today
because we have one thing in common.

414
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,255
Not only do we share a certain
background and culture...

415
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,967
...we also care about Chris and wanna
help him with his heroin addiction.

416
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,763
Now, any one of you guys been involved
in an intervention before?

417
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,149
We caught our daughter
smoking pot once but...

418
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,318
- Not really. No.
- No problem.

419
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,613
An intervention is
a nonjudgmental confrontation.

420
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,408
A "care-frontation," we call it.

421
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,661
What I need from you guys
is to make a list of specific times...

422
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:59,291
...where Christopher's drug use
impacted on you directly.

423
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,753
For example... Adriana, is it?

424
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,963
You might say something like this:

425
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:09,468
"Christopher, last Monday you came
home from work high and belligerent...

426
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,763
...and you were
physically abusive to me."

427
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,057
What if he's high when we try
to talk to him?

428
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,852
Then we wait till he's sober. At
my first intervention, Steven Patrano...

429
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,772
...waited 10 hours for me to sober up.
Your first?

430
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,149
In 1997, I suffered a relapse.

431
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,528
As in heroin addiction, alcoholics
suffer a fairly high recidivism rate.

432
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,407
Great. So he's taking advice
from a two-time loser.

433
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,827
There are no losers in recovery.

434
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,373
Actually, I never really met Ralph's kid.

435
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,084
I saw him once from a distance, though.

436
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,795
Handsome boy.

437
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,632
He's got a long struggle ahead of him,
that's for sure.

438
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:53,261
Doctors, rehab, physical therapy.

439
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,142
I think I'm gonna have
the medallions of veal.

440
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,367
What's up you make me late for a table
at Tavern on the Green?

441
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,161
- How's the real-estate business?
- Excuse me?

442
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:22,624
You know, HUD, Garside Street,
you, Ralph, Zellman.

443
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,378
Zellman tell you this?

444
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,965
No, Carmine doesn't know
anything about this yet, Tony.

445
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,135
I'm giving you an opportunity
to cut a deal and make it right.

446
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,097
Last time, Frelinghuysen Avenue, I cut
you in out of friendship, but it's over.

447
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,225
You got nothing coming to you.
You or Carmine.

448
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,979
You sure you wanna go
down this road, Tony?

449
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,043
How much to paint a different suit
on him, change his face a little?

450
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,046
- Pardon me?
- Why throw it away?

451
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,589
A stronger chin maybe?

452
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,759
I was thinking like those paintings
in the courthouse.

453
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:17,804
Something classy, you know,
like a Revolutionary War general.

454
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,849
Napoleon and his horse.
That kind of thing.

455
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,643
He's rather portly to be Napoleon.

456
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,981
Not Napoleon exactly, like Napoleon.

457
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,237
Sit down, sit down, sit down.
Relax.

458
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,910
What's going on, Ton?

459
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,498
I think I know what happened
to Ralph, and if I'm right...

460
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,375
...he ain't coming back.

461
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,173
- It was New York.
- Johnny Sack?

462
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,300
What was it? The fat joke?

463
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,260
I'm sure that didn't help.

464
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,971
Carmine.

465
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,641
This HUD thing, they wanted
a piece of it.

466
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,478
I think they confronted Ralph,
things went sour.

467
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,481
- What'd he say, John?
- Wasn't what he said so much...

468
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,567
...as what he didn't say.
We're talking about New York.

469
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,321
Before we do anything,
in terms of payback...

470
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,492
...you go to your people.
I want a full investigation.

471
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,995
Nobody makes a move
till we know what happened.

472
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,831
You understand?

473
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,294
What the fuck?

474
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,134
- What's going on?
- Have a seat.

475
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,178
Christopher, hey, I'm Dominic.

476
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,847
I know you don't know me but...

477
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,891
Yeah, you're the guy who broke
into Stew Leonard's that time.

478
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,686
You stole all those pork loins.

479
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:51,606
Yeah, but that's not why I'm here today.

480
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,151
We're here to talk
about your drug problem.

481
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,528
What?

482
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,655
Jesus Christ, you fucking kidding me?

483
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,158
Sorry, baby, please.

484
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,993
No, fuck this shit.

485
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,037
You were told once. Now, sit down.

486
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,373
Sit down.

487
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,889
Ma? Jesus.

488
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,563
Christopher, this won't be easy
for any of us.

489
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:36,067
But I want you to know that we're here
today because we care about you.

490
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,486
What was this, your idea?

491
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,573
All we ask is that you listen.

492
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,535
Adriana, you wanna begin?

493
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,961
Christopher, I love you very much.

494
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,173
My only dream is that we have
a happy life together.

495
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,468
The last few months,
things have got very bad with us...

496
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,179
...because of you using drugs
all the time.

497
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,598
You're high all the time,
and I can't take it.

498
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,142
Be specific, hon.

499
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,564
When we first started going out,
we made love all the time.

500
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,735
- Now, because of the drugs...
- Jesus, is this fucking necessary?

501
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,695
Go ahead, Adriana.

502
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,823
You can no longer function as a man.

503
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,328
Last week when I came home to learn
you'd killed our dog...

504
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,455
...that was the final straw.

505
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,706
Wow.

506
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,710
You killed the dog?
What'd you do that for?

507
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,879
- It was an accident.
- What, was it barking?

508
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,465
He sat on her while he was high.

509
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,760
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- I fell asleep.

510
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,845
She got suffocated or something.

511
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,934
Are you done, Adriana?

512
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,148
- Silvio.
- You killed little Cosette?

513
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,859
I ought to suffocate you,
you little prick!

514
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,737
Tony, we're going in order. Silvio.

515
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,031
When I came in to open up
one morning...

516
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,701
...there you were with your head
half in the toilet.

517
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,787
Your hair was in the toilet water.
Disgusting.

518
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,581
- I told you I had the flu.
- I said my piece, Chrissy.

519
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,583
Great. I can't even defend myself?

520
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,335
No one's attacking you, Chris.

521
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,504
Look, it doesn't change anything.

522
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,757
But I can verify that he was sick
for a little while.

523
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,927
This thing with the dog,
how can you not see it on the chair?

524
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,389
- You're getting emotional.
- I know what it's like to lose a pet!

525
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,522
I happen to know that you were high
at my mother-in-law's wake.

526
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:42,152
You were talking nonstop
for 20 minutes, nothing but gibberish.

527
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,404
My mother's wake.

528
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,073
Jesus Christ.

529
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,705
Paul? You wanna read
your statement?

530
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,876
I don't write nothing down,
so I'll keep this short and sweet.

531
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,211
You're weak. You're out of control.

532
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,048
You're an embarrassment to yourself
and everybody else.

533
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,800
- Oh, listen to you.
- Guys, guys, whoa, whoa.

534
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,011
We said, nonjudgmental.

535
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,638
Fuck that. Let him take his medicine.

536
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,558
Seriously, Paulie, you wanna talk
about fucking up?

537
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,310
- Watch it, Chrissy.
- What?

538
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,437
I thought we're being honest here.

539
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,398
You got some balls, you know that?

540
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,776
All of you.

541
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,987
You wanna talk about self-control?
How about you, Sil?

542
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,616
Fucking every slut working in the place
with a wife and kids at home.

543
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,743
- Guys, guys, whoa, whoa.
- Christopher!

544
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,705
Or you, Paulie. Remember last winter
in the woods with the Russian guy?

545
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:39,959
- Christopher, I am fucking warning you!
- There he goes, Mr. Type A Personality.

546
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:44,172
We're talking about you killing yourself
with drugs, not my fucking personality!

547
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,257
- That's right.
- I'm gonna kill myself?

548
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,094
The way you eat
you'll have a heart attack by 50.

549
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,096
- Paulie!
- You're talking to the boss.

550
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,224
Good, maybe someone will smack
some goddamn sense into him!

551
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,060
Great, my own mother.
Fuck you, you fucking whore!

552
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,647
- Son of a bitch!
- Oh, my God!

553
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,610
Guys, guys, please! Come on!

554
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,572
Get him off!

555
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,995
Excuse me. How's he doing?

556
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,747
I'm a relative.

557
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,000
He slipped off the kitchen counter
spraying for ants?

558
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,378
Well, he was wearing socks.

559
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,880
Are you aware that he has
a drug problem?

560
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,966
Really?

561
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:32,720
The man has a hairline skull fracture.
We'll admit him, keep him overnight.

562
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,557
One minute.

563
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,396
- Give us a minute, okay?
- Okay.

564
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,616
Does it hurt?

565
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,828
They gave me some aspirin.

566
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,833
Well, enjoy it, because it's the last
fucking drug you're ever gonna take.

567
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,255
- I'm sorry, T. I...
- Shut the fuck up and listen to me.

568
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,717
You're my nephew, Christopher.

569
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,303
And I love you.

570
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,805
That's the only reason
you're alive right now.

571
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,933
If it were anybody else, anybody...

572
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:23,229
...they would've had their intervention
right through the back of their head.

573
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,483
You and me, we're close.

574
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,985
We've done a lot of things
for each other.

575
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,946
That cop shot my father.

576
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,617
I know what you're telling me.
I'll never forget that.

577
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:40,288
This is how you repay me. I gotta worry
if you'll flip over a nickel bag of powder.

578
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,665
- No, Tony, never.
- You lied to me.

579
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,084
I told you, you were the future
of this family.

580
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,796
I gave you that responsibility.
And you looked me in the eye...

581
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:53,259
...and you accepted it.
And you were fucking high.

582
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,136
Tony...

583
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,388
Shut up.

584
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,809
Tomorrow morning you go with Patsy
up to this rehab place in Pennsylvania.

585
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,895
You're going in. You're staying in.

586
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,981
You'll go to every session,
and you'll keep your mouth shut.

587
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,528
Now, if you need anything,
anything at all...

588
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:17,242
...Patsy's gonna be half a mile away
from you in a motel.

589
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,830
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you? Huh?

590
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,167
- Do you understand?
- Tony, I'm sorry.

591
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,299
How did I fucking get to this?

592
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,186
Oh, so he comes again.

593
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,854
Brought some pastries.

594
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,148
- Is he taking a nap?
- Yeah.

595
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,902
- Is he driving you to drink?
- I can drive myself.

596
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,127
Salute.

597
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,262
- I needed that.
- What's the matter?

598
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:23,224
Spent a long time in the hospital
last night.

599
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,395
The shit that goes on down there.

600
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,192
I wasn't expecting no visitors.

601
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,374
How about those Mets?

602
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,669
Don't start with me and those Mets.

603
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,887
You know, I was thinking about you.

604
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,306
Oh, so you're drunk already.

605
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,808
No, I was just thinking
about the way you are.

606
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:10,730
How you always have this little smile,
like you got your own private joke.

607
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,320
You don't talk much, do you?

608
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,869
Well, I wish I knew your secret.

609
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,457
Lose a leg and start making websites.

610
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:34,295
That's the whole purpose for people
like me, to inspire people like you.

611
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,966
Jesus, no offense.

612
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,552
That's the trouble with you Americans.

613
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,472
You expect nothing bad
ever to happen...

614
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,934
...when the rest of the world expect
only bad to happen.

615
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,686
And they're not disappointed.

616
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,896
Well, that's a fucking grim outlook.

617
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,233
You have everything,
and still you complain.

618
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:59,487
You lie on couches and bitch
to your psychiatrists.

619
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,031
You got too much time
to think about yourselves.

620
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,867
Sounds like me, all right.

621
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,246
You're not so bad.

622
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,415
You have many fine qualities.

623
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,459
You are big and strong...

624
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,004
...full of life, mischief.

625
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:21,134
I have always feel
positive towards you.

626
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,806
You should see yourself now.

627
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,975
In the shadows there...

628
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,769
...with the smoke all around you.

629
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:36,941
You're beautiful.
You remind me of that movie star...

630
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,068
Irina is beautiful.

631
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,112
Greta Garbo.

632
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,967
- May I help you?
- Yeah... Christopher Moltisanti.

633
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,972
Brad to reception.
Your 1:00 client is here.

634
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,479
- So you call me later?
- No phone calls for the first two weeks.

635
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,148
House rules.

636
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,110
I'll write.

637
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:06,280
I was thinking of keeping
a journal anyway.

638
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,909
Get it published maybe
under my pen name.

639
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,328
Chris.

640
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:16,082
Brad Miller. Congratulations.

641
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:20,753
You got here, dude.
That's the hardest part.

642
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,422
I'm gonna have to search your bag.

643
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,640
- Cigarettes are okay, right?
- Cigarettes are fine.

644
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,976
They're encouraged
for patients who smoke.

645
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,436
But, Chris, no chocolate allowed.

646
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,273
No caffeine or substances
containing caffeine.

647
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,987
All set?

648
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,624
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

649
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,898
So when's Bill coming back?

650
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,610
Next week.

651
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,780
Well, I'll be busy for a few days...

652
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,950
...but see you when I can.

653
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,994
I think it's not a good idea.

654
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:40,625
- What do you mean?
- Maybe I call you, but I don't think so.

655
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,003
- You didn't like it?
- I like it, very much.

656
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,505
But, Tony, come on.

657
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,216
You're a nice guy,
but I got my own problems.

658
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,636
I don't want all the time prop you up.

659
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,682
What, are you fucking kidding me?

660
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,524
- What you doing?
- I didn't expect you so soon.

661
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,112
Tell my uncle I'll talk to him later.

662
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,899
Carmela.

663
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,487
Carm!

664
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,626
Lowe is not a, you know,
98-, 99-mile-an-hour guy.

665
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,422
Driven out to deep left field!

666
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,675
Giving chase is Henderson.
On the wall!

667
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:42,348
See you! An opposite-field home run
for Jason Giambi.
