1
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,019
"Italy was relieved
today upon learning...

2
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,604
...that the country's
high court...

3
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,817
...had ruled that influence
peddling is not a crime.

4
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:54,655
Said Franco Ferrarotti,
an Italian sociologist:

5
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,365
'Essentially the judges
are saying

6
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,783
what everybody believes.'

7
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,494
He was referring to
raccomandazione,

8
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,620
the Italian custom...

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,082
...of seeking special treatment
from people in power.

10
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,711
'This is our version
of the Protestant ethic, '

11
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,296
Mr. Ferrarotti said.

12
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,424
The case concerned a clerk
of a civil court in Potenza...

13
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,928
...who was jailed for promising
to speed up someone's trial.

14
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,140
Evidence showed that he received
88 pounds of fish...

15
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,309
...in return for his
assistance."

16
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,715
Hello? Yeah, she's here.

17
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,551
She's on duty today.

18
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,179
The same, undercover.

19
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,514
Yeah, let me have
her call you back.

20
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,767
Deb, it was your mom.

21
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,413
You complain about your paper
on ethnicity.

22
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,832
Here's interesting stuff.
It's your background.

23
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:15,254
We're from Potenza? I thought we
were "Nabolidaboli" or whatever.

24
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:19,007
Napoletani. But this is
about Italy as a whole.

25
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,426
The squirrels eat
that bread I put out

26
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,428
for the ducks
or somebody sweep it up?

27
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,264
I do know
that Meadow stepped in

28
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,057
some soggy bread
in her bare feet.

29
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,643
You should've heard it.

30
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,561
What's that?

31
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,313
The New York Times

32
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,648
that your friend
here has delivered to him...

33
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,234
...every day at school
for social studies...

34
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,278
...then doesn't read.
I find them in his room.

35
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,446
Make a go of it
at that new school.

36
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,991
You got no idea what we
had to do to get you in.

37
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,119
There is no reason you shouldn't
pass social studies.

38
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,454
You passing social studies?

39
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,957
You just reveal
your own ignorance.

40
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,710
It's only been five days.
We didn't get grades yet.

41
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,964
I what? I reveal my own what?

42
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,559
Look at that.

43
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,147
Now he's reading.

44
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,866
- Hey, everybody.
- Where's Furio?

45
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,912
How you doing, Ton?

46
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,081
A.J.,
finish getting dressed.

47
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,208
- You want some coffee?
- No.

48
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,668
Has Furio got that bug again?

49
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,837
Tony likes
to mix it up, you know.

50
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,339
Different cars.

51
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,680
- What, the Caprice?
- No, he's turning off.

52
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,308
Take me to my uncle's doctor.

53
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,604
Furio called me. He's going
to the fucking track today?

54
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,357
So, what about it?

55
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,734
I don't know. I'm driving again
all of a sudden.

56
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,445
I gotta explain why I want
you with me this week?

57
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,947
- God forbid you explain.
- That's right.

58
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,033
Now you're gonna get
fresh about it.

59
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,243
I'm just saying,
I'm glad to do it.

60
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,621
Oh, I'm glad you're glad.

61
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,255
Your father was
like a mentor to me.

62
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,674
- Right.
- A standup.

63
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,594
You ask anybody.
Your old man was a legend.

64
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,390
He single-handed hunted down
that New England crew.

65
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,643
Brought the war home
to them up there.

66
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,939
Another Chevy.

67
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,403
It's nuns.

68
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:48,073
Might be undercover feds,
but I doubt it.

69
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,254
He must be colicky.

70
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,052
I think he likes
your hair better that way.

71
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,519
Mr. Soprano.

72
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,772
- There she is.
- You be good, now. Don't start.

73
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,983
You ought to see my finish.

74
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,028
You know, you get sued for talk
like that nowadays.

75
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,447
Cancel my appointment.

76
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,948
Let me die
if a man can't voice...

77
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,450
...to a beautiful woman

78
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,034
the zephyrs
blowing through his mind.

79
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,911
My God, will you listen
to him today?

80
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,623
Go in there now and strip down
to your shorts.

81
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,959
You see, now?
I'm not gonna touch that line.

82
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,463
Too much class. But as
for that lovely laugh line...

83
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,339
Come on, handsome, we're busy.

84
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,301
Give me that cheek, right here.

85
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,553
I surrender.
Do with me what you will.

86
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,180
Okay.

87
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,475
The doctor will be
with you both.

88
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,527
So, what'd you wanna
see me about?

89
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,988
My trial starts a week from
Tuesday.

90
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:10,989
You'll beat it.

91
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,199
Melvoin's good.

92
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,743
We have to change our
arrangement.

93
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,666
Which arrangement is that?

94
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,169
These lawyers are taking
my internal organs.

95
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,338
A million bucks
for this trial,

96
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,006
Melvoin and Hirshorn
are charging.

97
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,175
And that was bad enough.

98
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,719
They put this Harvard kid on,
this lackey.

99
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,012
I don't know
what the fuck he does.

100
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,223
And then they just
decided we needed

101
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,517
audibility experts
to testify you can't...

102
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,393
...definitively state
what people

103
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,395
are saying
on the government tapes.

104
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,772
I could fucking tell them that.

105
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,775
Yeah, well, those guys,
they got sound graphs and shit.

106
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,110
Fifty grand the cocksuckers
are charging.

107
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,279
Plus the minimization expert,

108
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,323
plus the fucking
monthly expenses.

109
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,825
Fucking Lexus fees,
the xeroxing.

110
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,828
An entire forest must have given
its life in Xerox paper...

111
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,997
...just for this
one fucking trial.

112
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I said to Mel,

113
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,959
"Can't we just
at one meeting

114
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,043
all read
from the same paper?

115
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,088
- Pass it around?"
- Our split stays the same.

116
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,135
You kept me in place as boss
to take the heat off you.

117
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,972
My legal problems
let you go strutting

118
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,723
around like a gabavreesch
two years.

119
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,893
- There you go.
- Ten points.

120
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,062
I got medical bills too,
Anthony.

121
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,730
I got cash-flow problems
of my own.

122
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,067
A one-time hit, 50, 75 grand
to cover the audibility expert.

123
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,027
I got two kids
in private schools.

124
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,445
Goddamn it!

125
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,239
Get your shy running right.

126
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,534
That's what you should be
focused on.

127
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,757
Would you like to try some
kielbasa? Kentshire Farms.

128
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,843
- Sure.
- Nitrate free.

129
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,310
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I like Versace's dinnerware...

130
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:07,188
...but stamping your face
on every plate. The ego!

131
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,942
Look who's here.

132
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,571
My God,
what are you doing home?

133
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,158
I gotta get this out of my car.

134
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,451
Is that for us?

135
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,455
You're in a good mood.

136
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,458
Want me to fix you a plate?

137
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,877
Will you shut
that pocket rat up?

138
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,837
You wanna say
hello to Danielle?

139
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,297
Not really.

140
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,798
I should go, anyhow.

141
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,010
Enjoy your wine.
Don't listen to his bullshit.

142
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,887
I gotta get up early tomorrow.

143
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,805
No matter
how much the john offers?

144
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,848
Pig.

145
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,186
This is beautiful.

146
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,105
Where'd you get it?

147
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,482
You said
you were gonna go, go.

148
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,485
- I gotta get some sleep.
- I should go.

149
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,491
Froze to death
in that mall today.

150
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,743
They go crazy
with the air conditioning.

151
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,287
So when am I gonna
see you again?

152
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,330
I'll call you.

153
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,998
Okay, sweetie.

154
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,710
Some of those bags
look like Gucci.

155
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,963
He gets that stuff all the time.
His cousin's a liquidator.

156
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,591
- Bye.
- See you.

157
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,264
- You are so fucking rude.
- I had a horrible goddamn day.

158
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,934
She's over here
all the time lately.

159
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,604
Tony still acting all mean?

160
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,148
Cosette, quiet.

161
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,775
Fucking asshole.

162
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,777
Ever since
I questioned his judgment...

163
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,654
...on some Ralphie-Jackie Jr.
problem.

164
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,366
Like he's fucking infallible,
Pope Tony XXIII or some shit.

165
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,702
Now he starts in
with my father...

166
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,078
...so I can be compared all
negative.

167
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,871
- Jeez.
- You never know.

168
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,207
I could be on the endangered
species list.

169
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,002
- Chrissy!
- Gonna get high?

170
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,296
Maybe I'll just smoke some.

171
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,591
Stonato. That's more addictive
than shooting.

172
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,219
I don't do it
every fucking day now...

173
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,303
...like some people.

174
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,056
I'm just chipping.
I got it under control.

175
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,975
Chrissy, Tony loves you.

176
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,812
Why would he have you made
if he didn't depend on you?

177
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,107
He could depend on me.

178
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,570
When the fuck have I ever not
been there 100 percent.

179
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,837
Want some?

180
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,632
Can I talk to you a minute?

181
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,597
Turn this off?

182
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,058
Turn it down.

183
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,564
I'm worried, Tony.

184
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,067
- About my weight?
- About money.

185
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,653
So you're getting
less allowance than usual.

186
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,821
I told you, it's temporary.

187
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,490
Super Bowl last year,
we didn't lay enough off.

188
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,576
No, it's not just that.
I'm worried about you...

189
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,702
...about the future...

190
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,704
...me and the kids
if something happens to you.

191
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,666
- I don't provide for you?
- Now.

192
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,502
I saw Angie Bonpensiero today.

193
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,213
She was handing out
free Polish sausage...

194
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:00,922
...at the supermarket.

195
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,716
Don't start with that.
I supported her long enough.

196
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,511
Who is gonna support
your children and me?

197
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,388
If, God forbid,
something happens to you.

198
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,430
That's the point.

199
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,725
Sil? Paulie?
That is frightening.

200
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,019
You'll be taken care of.

201
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,650
Say, that was real pretty.
Go on, play some more.

202
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,819
Now, why don't you play
something I...

203
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,868
You're set in perpetuity.

204
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,452
There's money in
overseas accounts.

205
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,162
I don't have the serial numbers.

206
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,539
You'll have them then.

207
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:40,420
Not now. For your own benefit.
So you're not an accomplice.

208
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,716
Jesus, Carmela, I been busting
my pick all day...

209
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,385
...to bring home the money
you're concerned about.

210
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,596
I thought maybe
I could have a sundae...

211
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,055
...and zone out
in front of the TV...

212
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,435
...because, A, you're right,
my job is extremely stressful...

213
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,233
I am talking about some simple
estate planning, Tony...

214
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,067
...that's all.

215
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,321
My cousin, Brian Cammarata,
helped lots of people...

216
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,864
...set up
trusts for their kids...

217
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,865
...begin asset allocation...

218
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,075
I gotta
spell this out for you?

219
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,453
I can't declare
X amount of my income.

220
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,205
Your consulting fees
from Barone Sanitation you do.

221
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,292
We file a tax return to justify
the house, the cars.

222
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,086
We could be putting aside some
to start a portfolio.

223
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,296
Stocks?

224
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,256
You gotta be high
in the corporate structure...

225
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,591
...to make that work.

226
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,969
We don't have those Enron-type
connections.

227
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,220
Bonds, then.

228
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,430
There are these things
called REITs...

229
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,389
...that Brian told me about.

230
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,600
Bonds? Where's the capital
for that?

231
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,019
In the Caymans
or under the mattress...

232
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,271
...or wherever you put it
at zero growth.

233
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,230
The money stays.

234
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,941
With what's going on
in the world?

235
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,818
- There's always an excuse.
- There's no cash in this house.

236
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,905
Not since our last bust.
Check the vents.

237
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,283
And I provide for my children.

238
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,451
Yes, Tony, you do.

239
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,621
But I don't know
how because you won't tell me.

240
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,039
Let me tell you something.

241
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,749
Or you can
watch the fucking news.

242
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,918
Everything comes to an end.

243
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,305
Good morning, Ton.

244
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,810
- They over there?
- I was able to reach everybody.

245
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,646
What the fuck you doing?

246
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,440
- What, Ton?
- You're wasting fucking ice.

247
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,733
Oh, it's mostly melted.

248
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,277
- You gonna argue with me now?
- No, Ton.

249
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,904
You don't have to see
the monthly statement.

250
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,823
We're losing money.

251
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,658
No, Ton, you're right. I don't.

252
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,035
Think that shit grows on trees?

253
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,580
Ice? No, I don't.

254
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,165
What, are you getting
cute with me?

255
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,125
No.

256
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,086
I think you are. You're getting
an attitude on you.

257
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,672
I'm not.

258
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,343
Ice, Ton,
when it hangs around...

259
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,053
Hey, Georgie, be quiet.

260
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,888
But it gets watery.

261
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,558
It dilutes the drinks,
especially Scotch.

262
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,685
Jesus Christ.

263
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,687
Here, throw it all away now.

264
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,605
Waste it all,
fucking John D. Rockefeller!

265
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,192
Waste it all! Motherfuck, huh!

266
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,699
Conserve!

267
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,884
Where were you?

268
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,934
I wanna know
why there's zero growth...

269
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,687
...in this family's receipts.

270
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,233
Where's the fucking money?

271
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,778
You're supposed to be earners.

272
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,946
That's why you got
the top-tier positions.

273
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,158
Each of you, go to your people
on the street, crack some heads.

274
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,119
Create some
fucking earners out there!

275
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,419
The guy. We talked about this
over at the other place.

276
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,174
With the guy, the councilman.
What the fuck happened to that?

277
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,801
- It petered out.
- It petered out?

278
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,553
- It died on the vine.
- It died on the vine?

279
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,473
It died on the vine.
The guy, he moved or something.

280
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,061
Oh, nobody knows what the fuck
I'm talking about?

281
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,858
We hear you, Ton.

282
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,198
My uncle...

283
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,077
...the boss of this family,
is on trial for his life.

284
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:45,957
And what you people are kicking
up there is a fucking disgrace.

285
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:51,170
You know how much lawyers cost?
A major RICO like his?

286
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,006
I'm the only one supporting him.

287
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,593
This thing is a pyramid,
since time immemorial.

288
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,137
Shit runs downhill.

289
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,055
Money goes up.
It's that simple.

290
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,474
I should not have
to be coming here...

291
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,102
...hat in my hand...

292
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,147
...reminding you about
your duty to that man.

293
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,525
And I don't wanna hear
about the economy!

294
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,527
I don't wanna hear it.

295
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,904
Sil, break it down for them.

296
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,031
What two businesses
have been...

297
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,243
...recession-proof
since time immemorial?

298
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,996
Certain aspects of show business
and our thing.

299
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,332
Now, that's it.
That's all I gotta say.

300
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,794
Frankly, I'm depressed
and ashamed.

301
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,730
Is that what your coach laid out
for you as a training breakfast?

302
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,824
The shelf in the garage is
still loose.

303
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,493
You went down in the garage?

304
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,454
I'm gonna go check it out.

305
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,582
You said you'd get up early,
come to church with me...

306
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,084
...and go online and register
for your classes.

307
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,045
I'll miss Grandma-and-Grandpa
dinner too.

308
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,756
There's a back-to-school party
for Hadley.

309
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,437
Those boring Sunday dinners.

310
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,940
Can one of my
new friends eat over?

311
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,858
Aunt Ro and Uncle Ralph
will be here too...

312
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,860
...but I'm sure we can fit.

313
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,447
- Not gonna lay out, Dad?
- It's too cold.

314
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,534
Ralphie and Ro are coming
out here today?

315
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,451
I thought we got that...

316
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,245
...straightened out
months ago.

317
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,788
And it's not "Uncle" Ralph.

318
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,957
I asked you about inviting them
the other night...

319
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,667
...and you said, mmm.

320
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,794
I must've been focused
on something else.

321
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:42,133
Yeah, well, it's Ro's birthday,
and she's very down.

322
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:53,019
Anthony, I ever tell you
about the time I had a Harley?

323
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,273
- Whoa, cool.
- Seventy-four Shovelhead.

324
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,400
I could blow off Porsches
on that thing.

325
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,193
Not my dad's Boxster.

326
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,653
- What's your name?
- Matt.

327
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,322
Matt, no offense...

328
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,825
...but your dad's Boxster
is a Porsche with panties.

329
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,160
He knows what I'm saying.

330
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,079
I mean, that's for the Hamptons,
the Boxster.

331
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,790
I'm talking Turbo Carrera.

332
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,500
One time I'm alongside this...

333
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,127
...Turbo
with doctor plates.

334
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,130
We come off the line,
he's got this big Jew grin.

335
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,174
- You're not Jewish, are you?
- Half.

336
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,675
He knows it's all in fun.

337
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,010
We hit the intersection...

338
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,678
...Passaic Avenue
and New Dutch Lane.

339
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,888
We're doing 110.

340
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,683
Right through the light.
He wasn't grinning then, boy.

341
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:37,063
I look back.
He's white as false teeth.

342
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,232
Jason Mingelli's parents
let him get a YZ250.

343
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,525
You get on that bike...

344
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,195
...I'll cut your legs off
before the bike does.

345
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,529
I had the high handlebars.

346
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,366
Bruce Dern, don't you got
somewhere to be?

347
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,910
I gotta hit
the little boys' room.

348
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,578
You guys need some help?

349
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:57,333
In my day there was a motorcycle
called the Vincent Black Shadow.

350
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,628
- Boy, did that thing take off.
- The hoods all drove those.

351
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,881
They beat you up that time,
you remember, on City Island?

352
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,591
He'd just gotten
out of the Navy.

353
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,344
I think
he weighed 105 pounds.

354
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,554
Did you see any action in World
War II?

355
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,389
A little bit.

356
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,557
I was stationed in Nova
Scotia...

357
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,310
...but I'd caught
diverticulitis...

358
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,645
...the weight loss
she's talking about.

359
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,980
Oh, my God, you're eating.
I'm so sorry.

360
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,440
Don't worry, come in.

361
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,733
Absolutely.
You want something?

362
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,276
No, thank you.

363
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,070
I came to borrow
the samovar...

364
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,364
...for my cousin's baby shower.

365
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,408
This is my friend,
Danielle Ciccolella.

366
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,618
This is Christopher's cousin,
Tony.

367
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,911
Tony.

368
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,163
How you doing?

369
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,708
His cousin, Carmela.

370
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,212
- This is a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

371
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,424
- Where you from, Danielle?
- Whippany.

372
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,802
- Want some anisette?
- No, thanks.

373
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,220
This thing needs polishing.

374
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,643
- There's a bathroom downstairs.
- It's me, Janice.

375
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,565
- There's a bathroom downstairs!
- I know.

376
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,947
- What?
- What are you doing?

377
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,199
Nothing.

378
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,119
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I knew it.

379
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,413
Go ahead, you can do that.

380
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,130
How's Ro doing down there?

381
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,425
Very quiet. You know,
it's to be expected.

382
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,137
They got her on medication.
I don't think it's helping.

383
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,973
"Ah, Bartleby! Ah, humanity!"

384
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,435
Danielle,
did you see the loggia?

385
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,147
That loggia was
my daughter's idea.

386
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,733
Nice, huh?

387
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,027
Danielle,
come check this out.

388
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,616
Wait, Ralphie.

389
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,163
Oh, come on.

390
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,541
- What?
- What are you doing to me here?

391
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,558
I was stationed in Nova Scotia.
Well, I told you that.

392
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,103
Anyway, there was
nothing for them to do...

393
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,271
...in Nova Scotia.

394
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,274
Great seafood,
but other than that...

395
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,085
It's a lot of cracked corn.

396
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:46,877
All the ducks...

397
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,921
...they've flown south
for the winter.

398
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,757
So I'll be ready
for next season.

399
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,343
Thanks.

400
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,388
Red Suburban. I'll be over
at Italianissimo.

401
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,396
Good news
about the Esplanade.

402
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,439
The legislature
voted to refund...

403
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,941
...the special Newark
Development District...

404
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,735
...along Frelinghuysen north
from the Museum of Trucking.

405
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,863
Because of the vote,
Omni will put up a hotel...

406
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,116
...with a galleria
on the first floor.

407
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,242
Word came down yesterday.

408
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,577
A galleria?

409
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,580
Fifty stores selling sneakers
and turnip greens.

410
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,583
It's a demographic imperative.
Hoboken's maxed out.

411
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,252
Your Prada people are already
moving to Down Neck.

412
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,629
Where are they gonna go next?

413
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,258
My old man had a piece of
the garbage transfer station...

414
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,260
...in lower Manhattan
in the '70s.

415
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,636
Now, people told him...

416
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,222
...start buying up the abandoned
buildings around here.

417
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,932
But he couldn't see it.

418
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,809
And now it's Tribeca.

419
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,770
Tell you, Tony, I'm borrowing
money myself...

420
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,564
...to grab up parcels along
Frelinghuysen...

421
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,190
...through a shell company.

422
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,984
A private citizen like you?

423
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:56,030
Who's gonna quibble with
patriotic entrepreneurism?

424
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,284
My uncle has property down
on Frelinghuysen.

425
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,080
Mr. Soprano.

426
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,881
Oh, boy.

427
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,593
Right there.

428
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,554
I'm gonna be busy the next
couple months. But after that...

429
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,932
...what would you say,
me and you.

430
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,644
Una bella giornata to that city
called Atlantic.

431
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,022
I have many dear friends there.
I could show you quite a time.

432
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,692
- Thank you, but I don't gamble.
- With me it's never a gamble.

433
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,486
You know,
today is my last day.

434
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,820
Where are you going?

435
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,863
Back to school.

436
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,992
Anyway, I'll come say goodbye
when you're done here.

437
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,331
Excuse me.

438
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,960
All the fucking luck.

439
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,088
So, what is it today?

440
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,173
It's becoming clear to me...

441
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,717
...Murf can't run my operations
while I'm in court.

442
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,844
He's starting to forget things.

443
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:01,929
His words.

444
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,473
Sometimes there's food on
the front of his shirt,

445
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,517
the poor bastard.

446
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,187
I'm gonna move Bobby up.

447
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,066
- I think it's a good choice.
- I wasn't asking. I'm telling.

448
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,945
- So you know who to talk to.
- Bobby know yet?

449
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,738
Well, I think
we should bring him in here.

450
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,825
He's gonna be
a very happy man.

451
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,248
Thought you were
at the beauty parlor.

452
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,709
I'm gonna get
the last of the tomatoes.

453
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,586
Yeah, they were good
last night.

454
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,255
A little late in the season
for ducks, no?

455
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,300
Well, not necessarily.
The ones from upper Canada...

456
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,511
...this is the south to them.

457
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:49,995
Speak.

458
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,873
I have a collect call
from Mr. Walters.

459
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,792
Okay, operator.

460
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,959
John?

461
00:29:56,044 --> 00:30:01,298
- Oh, right on time.
- It's all I got, pal, time.

462
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,342
What the fuck happened out
there?

463
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,636
Didn't Tony tell you? Sil?

464
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,095
They just mentioned
in passing...

465
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,681
...you were doing the county
book in Youngstown.

466
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,768
They didn't have
long to talk.

467
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,687
Hello?

468
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,147
Let me first say...

469
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,483
...I can't tell you
how touched I was...

470
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,860
...when my nephew told me
you wanted me to call.

471
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,905
Anthony only talks to me
through middlemen.

472
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,782
So, what'd they pinch you for?

473
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,828
Gun charge. I drove out
to visit Lenny Scotise.

474
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,206
Don't know if you know Lenny.
We used to have that club in...

475
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,415
Doesn't matter.

476
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,209
Anyway, my first night here...

477
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,710
...we drive out to visit...

478
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,838
...Dean Martin's
birthplace in Steubenville.

479
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,173
Cops pull us over
for no left blinker.

480
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,510
Long story short? They find
a piece under the seat.

481
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,512
Fucking.38.

482
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,596
Turns out it was used...

483
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,098
...in an unsolved murder out
here...

484
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,349
...from eight years ago.

485
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,935
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah.

486
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,188
- So, what can I do to help?
- You're too much. Nothing.

487
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,065
The lawyer said
they'll keep us here...

488
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,191
...as long as they can...

489
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,944
...until they make their case
or somebody cops to it.

490
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,905
- Keep your dick up.
- Well, I... Leave that!

491
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,117
Don't touch that.
My program's coming on.

492
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,413
John, love you, babe.
Don't let me rot, now.

493
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,759
- Hello?
- I gotta work tonight.

494
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,555
- I see.
- You see. You see what?

495
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,181
You're so concerned
about our finances...

496
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,559
...where do you think
it comes from?

497
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,603
Well, be careful driving home.

498
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,615
There he is. Here's to Newark's
newest hotel, huh, Ton?

499
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,456
Anything else with the Esplanade
I should know?

500
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,999
No.

501
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,084
It's the girls
from Icelandic Air.

502
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,086
Oh, come on in.

503
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,176
Hey, how are you?

504
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,512
All right, let me get
the fuck out of here.

505
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,182
- How's Junior?
- He's gonna be all right.

506
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,392
Tell him he's in our prayers,
et cetera.

507
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,728
I'll be sure and let him know.

508
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,229
One other thing, though.

509
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,607
John said he went
to a cookout at your house.

510
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,485
- Yeah.
- A don doesn't wear shorts.

511
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:31,615
All right, Carmine, come on.
Elevator's here.

512
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,039
- So where are you girls from?
- Reykjavik.

513
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, you do,
and you'll clean it up.

514
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,011
- Christopher!
- Yo. Yeah.

515
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,221
Let's go.

516
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,025
What's up, T?

517
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,467
- You have a good time tonight?
- All right.

518
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,344
Learn anything?

519
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,638
Like what?

520
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,223
Anything.

521
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,851
You had a sit-down
with two bosses.

522
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,228
You got a real hard-on for me,
that's all I know.

523
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,106
- Oh, you think so.
- It's fucking obvious.

524
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,567
Take the parkway.

525
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,652
You know, for all the things...

526
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,738
...there are to eat
on this island...

527
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,907
...your breadfruit,
mangoes, papayas...

528
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,243
...not to mention
the fish in the sea...

529
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,412
...there's no question
about us surviving.

530
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,164
We could go on here for years.

531
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,374
And I mean years.

532
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,668
Where you going?

533
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,757
Get that.

534
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,636
Hello.

535
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,849
Who did?

536
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,145
Oh, they did?

537
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,856
I'll tell him.

538
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,443
Tell me what?

539
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:17,072
- That was Melvoin.
- So it was Melvoin.

540
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,783
The fuck is this, Mother May I?
Go ahead! Tell me!

541
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,120
He just had a call
from some source of his.

542
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,455
Dr. Schreck's office
isn't safe to talk at.

543
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,417
The FBI had an undercover
in there since January.

544
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,128
Or D-day or something.

545
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,799
The agent's been pulled
to testify at your trial.

546
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,184
All right, pull up over there.

547
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,706
Who's that? Bobby Bacala?

548
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,000
See over there?

549
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,340
Guy in there killed
your father.

550
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,136
What the fuck
are you talking about?

551
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,140
Barry Haydu.

552
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,768
Detective lieutenant
in the Clifton Police Force.

553
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,146
Retired today.

554
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,733
That's his retirement party.

555
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,659
Everybody always told me
it was a fucking cop.

556
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,161
I thought he was dead.

557
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,288
My mother can't even
talk about it.

558
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,373
Did the hit for Jilly Rufalo.

559
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,250
He and your old man
were in the can together.

560
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,920
Jilly stabbed your
old man's cellmate to death.

561
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,088
So when your
old man got paroled...

562
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,673
...he tracked down Jilly.

563
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,050
Took out his eye so bad...

564
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,594
...he couldn't
even put a glass one in.

565
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,055
Loyal, your old man.

566
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,392
That's what I heard.

567
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,394
Some guy's eye.

568
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:16,024
They hit my dad right outside
my house, right?

569
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,527
He was bringing home
a crib for me?

570
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,780
Yeah.

571
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,867
Well, no, he was
outside the house...

572
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,244
...but he wasn't
carrying a crib.

573
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,037
He had a bunch of TV trays.

574
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,916
Could've been
a crib just as easily.

575
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,419
That rat fuck was
in uniform then.

576
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,589
Gambled like
you wouldn't believe.

577
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,092
He did it on contract.

578
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,718
Could've been
a crib just as easily.

579
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,222
So how come
he's still fucking walking?

580
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,225
Because he's been useful.
But he's outlived it...

581
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,520
...as of his cute little
ceremony this afternoon.

582
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,482
Is that him?
With the sombrero on?

583
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,277
No, you can't tell from here.

584
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,072
But maybe. Maybe it... Yeah.

585
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,408
Yeah, probably.

586
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,958
Here.

587
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,547
Nice house, apparently.
They say he paid cash for it.

588
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,258
Good luck.

589
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,139
Questions?

590
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,230
Kill the dome light.

591
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,246
That's the lamest plan
I ever heard.

592
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:39,918
It is not a lame plan.
We got it all worked out.

593
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,379
We got the time to place
everything!

594
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,421
It's lame.

595
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,216
Magnum, why are you being
so negative and hostile?

596
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,010
I wanted the biggest drug dealer
in the Midwest...

597
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,346
...and he's a dangerous
criminal...

598
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,182
The fuck is this?
You're cleaned out.

599
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,017
There's nothing
to rob in this place.

600
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,938
Well, there's this.

601
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,066
Okay.

602
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,820
You know I'm a police officer.

603
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:12,158
Engraving on this watch says
you retired, today.

604
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,246
Well...

605
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,333
...every little bit helps.

606
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,338
Rough divorce, huh?

607
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,259
She must be a real vile twat.

608
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,596
Hope she didn't pass it on
to your daughter.

609
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,890
Listen to me.

610
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,394
It's not too late
to cut your losses.

611
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,020
Unlock me, give me the weapons.

612
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,399
I promise you I will do whatever
is in my power to help you.

613
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,403
Maybe. Let's come back to that.

614
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,993
You remember Dickie Moltisanti?

615
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,995
- No.
- No?

616
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,831
Is that what you said?

617
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:04,210
- Was he a friend of yours?
- He was my father.

618
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,674
Steak san, Newport fries.

619
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,011
Scrambled eggs,
no oil, tomato slices.

620
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:31,070
So are you mentally prepared
for this promotion?

621
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,114
Oh, yeah.

622
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,620
How's that steak?

623
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,247
- It's okay.
- Yeah?

624
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,001
- Hon?
- Yeah?

625
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,670
Another steak san
over here, rare.

626
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,714
Coming up.

627
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,176
No, because it's...

628
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,471
It's a lot of added
responsibility.

629
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,849
I think it should've
happened sooner.

630
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,562
How's your family doing,
you know...

631
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,024
since the tragedy
with your dad?

632
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:12,362
- Rough on my mother.
- Yeah, yeah, well...

633
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,491
How old is she now?

634
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,077
She's 69.

635
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,707
Mom really went downhill
after the World Trade Center.

636
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,962
You know, Quasimodo
predicted all this.

637
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,506
- Who did what?
- All these problems.

638
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,675
The Middle East,
the end of the world.

639
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,635
Nostradamus.

640
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,054
Quasimodo's the Hunchback
of Notre Dame.

641
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,223
Oh, right. Notredamus.

642
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,434
Nostradamus and Notre Dame.

643
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,563
It's two different things
completely.

644
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,945
It's interesting, though,
they'd be so similar, isn't it?

645
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:58,241
And I always thought,
"Okay, Hunchback of Notre Dame.

646
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,159
You also got
your quarterback...

647
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,411
...and your halfback
of Notre Dame."

648
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,745
One's a fucking cathedral.

649
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,164
Obviously, I know.
I'm just saying...

650
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,916
...it's interesting,
the coincidence.

651
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,544
What, you gonna tell me you
never pondered that?

652
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,004
The back thing
with Notre Dame?

653
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,214
No.

654
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,765
Look, I don't know who told you
I had anything to do...

655
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,267
...with the death
of your father...

656
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,436
...but their information
is faulty.

657
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,772
Or they are deliberately
not telling you the truth.

658
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,940
Are you inferring...

659
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,276
...that you didn't
take cash from Jilly Rufalo...

660
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,863
...to whack my father while he
was carrying a TV tray...

661
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,655
...for me to watch TV?

662
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,451
I don't know
anybody named Rufalo.

663
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,621
You're being set up!

664
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,750
He's lying to you,
whoever he is!

665
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,878
It wouldn't make
any difference.

666
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,588
What do you mean?

667
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,591
- He wants you dead.
- All right, look, look, look.

668
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,594
I got a boat.
It's a Sea Ray 230.

669
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,637
It's almost brand-new.

670
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,181
I didn't kill your father,
but you could...

671
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,309
You don't want
a cop-kill on your head!

672
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,811
And what if they won't pull
over, T.C?

673
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,398
I'm not gonna take
on a limo in this car.

674
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,151
- No problem.
- I'm sorry!

675
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,403
- Pull over to the side.
- I'm sorry.

676
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,156
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

677
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,200
What are you gonna do?

678
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,452
Honk the horn.

679
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,454
Pull over! Police!

680
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,916
Police? In a Ferrari?

681
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:44,305
Freeze. Don't move a muscle,
or I'll put a bullet through it.

682
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:49,352
Special Investigator Finaday,
you're under arrest.

683
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,853
What's the charge, officer?

684
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:56,234
Speeding, reckless driving,
endangering another vehicle.

685
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,861
And impersonating an officer.

686
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,488
How you think it's going?

687
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,242
Oh, it couldn't be better.
You two are terrific.

688
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,994
Soon as they come
through the door...

689
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,163
...we're gonna nail them.

690
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,707
Freeze!

691
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,625
Oh, shit.

692
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,879
I missed my game, again.

693
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,381
Fucking loser!

694
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,591
Now Reese'll have to lead
the guys to victory.

695
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,009
- Who's Reese?
- Kenneth Reese!

696
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,679
He was my backup quarterback at
the Academy...

697
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,596
...and he's been waiting...

698
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,557
...for a chance
like this since 1963.

699
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,808
He got it because of you.

700
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,893
More than 12 hours. Ted?

701
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,230
Amy, in Pennsylvania tonight,
two men were shot and killed...

702
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,482
...in what was described
as a brazen...

703
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,984
...but successful armored-car
robbery.

704
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,195
Three accomplices escaped
with $800,000...

705
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,572
...while one of the dead men...

706
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,532
...Denis Lynch of Freehold,
New Jersey...

707
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,284
...was said by police
to have ties...

708
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,785
...to organized crime
families...

709
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,787
...both in that city
and in New York.

710
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,581
The street where the robbery
took place...

711
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,958
...was littered
with bills from...

712
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,588
- You smell gas down here?
- It's always like that.

713
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,340
He had
the pipes checked?

714
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,302
Oh, I thought
I heard something.

715
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,095
Is he up?
I need to talk to him.

716
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,680
I brought him a steak.

717
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,348
You can put it with his
eggs like he likes.

718
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,850
Actually, your wife's here.

719
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,643
She's making him
something to eat.

720
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,854
Karen. Something happen?

721
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,483
We had some
bad news last night.

722
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,651
Are you just gonna stand there?

723
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,196
No, the feds had
an undercover agent...

724
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,531
...in Dr. Schreck's office.

725
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,664
Uncle Jun.

726
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,542
- Hey, Karen.
- Fucking Grand Central Station?

727
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,253
Junior, my kids, huh?

728
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,589
You're right. Sorry, dear.

729
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,549
I brought my bar of soap.

730
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,468
What time they call you?

731
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,803
We had a little scare.

732
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,971
Thought it was
the shunt in his heart.

733
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,766
He passed some gas,
and he seems better.

734
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,559
Why don't you go on Joe
Franklin...

735
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,770
...tell the whole
Tri-State area?

736
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:00,358
- Dad, Dad.
- Not now.

737
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,777
Look, I heard what happened.

738
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,656
It's bad, but it's not worth
getting yourself sick over.

739
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,535
- I told you just sit down.
- He doesn't have cable.

740
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:15,998
Actually, we're gonna go.
Okay, Jun, you got everything?

741
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,501
Thank you, dear,
you've been wonderful.

742
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,128
- Bye, Karen.
- I'll see you.

743
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,421
- Come on.
- See you, kids.

744
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,591
- Goodbye, Karen.
- Be good.

745
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,012
Must've been
that piece of tail.

746
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,311
Now, look, she...

747
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,398
She probably reported the
meetings...

748
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:44,026
...who was there,
all that shit.

749
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,362
As far as conversations,
what could she hear?

750
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,905
You better hope nothing...

751
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,909
...because you were involved in
every fucking one.

752
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,414
How could you fall
for that flirty shit?

753
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,624
That's the point.

754
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:05,089
Get the hell out of here.
I wanna talk to my uncle.

755
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,887
Forget about that for a minute.

756
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:14,056
That shit about
your legal expenses.

757
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:18,561
I been thinking, and okay...

758
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,480
...maybe I can give you
some relief.

759
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,774
What?

760
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,986
You got that empty garage over
on Frelinghuysen Avenue.

761
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,947
You been trying to sell it.
I'll take it off your hands.

762
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,240
The fuck you gonna do
with it?

763
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,285
I don't know.
I'm trying to help you out.

764
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,746
How much?

765
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,123
Hundred thousand.

766
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,920
- Who gives a fuck anyway?
- Hey, come on.

767
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,005
I was led around
by the nose, Anthony.

768
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,716
You're right, a young cooze
smiled at me...

769
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,718
...and birds started chirping.

770
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,928
The time was...

771
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,971
...my instincts would've
never failed me like that.

772
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,807
So, what are you now,
the Amazing Kreskin?

773
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:57,934
What did I tell her?

774
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,728
Did I say anything
could be used against me?

775
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,730
I don't know.

776
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,815
Bullshitting, singing.

777
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,110
Atlantic City, Jesus Christ.

778
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:12,490
I'll be sitting right across
from her in the courtroom.

779
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:23,292
All right, come on,
have something to eat.

780
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:29,048
I'm an old man, Anthony.

781
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,885
An old man
that's going to trial.

782
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,514
Not much else to say about me.

783
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,535
I'm a little depressed.

784
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,957
- And you were on vacation.
- Can you describe the feelings?

785
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,168
I mean, things are good.

786
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,588
Especially with Carmela.

787
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,676
Oh, but then she starts ragging
on me about the future.

788
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,886
How she's worried.

789
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,180
And what's gonna happen to them
if I'm dead.

790
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,349
And buy bonds
and all this shit.

791
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,561
A lot of people are feeling
vulnerable.

792
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,689
But on the other hand,
she's right.

793
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,190
Not that I'd ever
tell her that.

794
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,359
Why not?

795
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,987
Then she'd wanna know
where's the money, how much...

796
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,406
Don't you want Carmela
to be taken care of?

797
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:39,285
She is. Anyway, she's right.
That's the point.

798
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,538
Over the last couple years
I been doing a lot of thinking.

799
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,789
And?

800
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,791
My uncle snapped it into focus.

801
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,794
What's he, 72 years old.
What's he got?

802
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,546
Fucking shitty house in
Belleville...

803
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,797
...and a bunch of
legal bills...

804
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,509
...that'd make you gargle Drano
if you had them.

805
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,012
I've analyzed it.

806
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,347
There's two endings
for a guy like me...

807
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,725
...a high-profile guy.

808
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:06,228
Dead or in the can,
big percent of the time.

809
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,231
- You never talk this frankly.
- Even with this terrorism...

810
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,359
...the government has resources.
As far as legal bills...

811
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,819
Anthony.

812
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,280
- What?
- Why don't you give it up?

813
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,951
You didn't let me finish.

814
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,746
There's a third way
to wrap it up.

815
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,582
You rely only on family.

816
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,250
Not many men could survive...

817
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:32,254
...without the love and support
of their wife and children...

818
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,466
No, no, no, I'm talking
about business.

819
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,635
You trust only blood.

820
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,348
A friend of mine...

821
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,767
...a guy whose name
you would know...

822
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,769
...stayed out of the can
and in charge...

823
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,770
...living in Florida...

824
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,146
...till he was 81 years old...

825
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,066
...because he only gave
orders through his son.

826
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:57,196
No other conversations that
could come back in testimony.

827
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,866
- His son?
- No, no, not A.J.

828
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,869
What I've been dealt is
my nephew.

829
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,373
He's gotten his
act together, the kid.

830
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,626
And over the last
couple of months...

831
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,919
...I started the process...

832
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,921
...of bonding him to me
inseparably.

833
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,800
- How?
- Well, that we can't get into.

834
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,136
Didn't your uncle do
that with you?

835
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,140
You said his life is
like a desert.

836
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,015
I'm 42.

837
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,976
I'm already more successful
than my uncle ever was.

838
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,979
You've seen my house.

839
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:35,317
Anthony, why are you
telling me this?

840
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,951
I don't know.

841
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,120
Guess...

842
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,831
...I trust you.

843
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,001
A little.

844
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,945
Hey, Mom.

845
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,531
What the hell
are you doing here?

846
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,200
You scared me to death.

847
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:27,077
Just stopped by to see
how you're getting along.

848
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,788
You ever do anything like
a normal person?

849
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,207
There is a bell.

850
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,461
So how you been?

851
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,962
Fine.

852
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,175
- How's Connie's kid?
- He's huge.

853
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,053
Jesus!

854
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,348
That's Jason?

855
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,518
He has a weight problem already,
eight years old.

856
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:55,022
She never had him baptized.
She thought she knew everything.

857
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,233
Actually, I was hoping...

858
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,777
...you'd make me one of
your fluffernutters.

859
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,616
It's fucking mouthwash.

860
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,992
Leave me the fuck alone,

861
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,787
you come over here
for that shit.

862
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:19,088
What's that on the table?
Daddy's Navy picture?

863
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,007
You ever miss him?

864
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,094
When he was in prison?

865
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,013
Or since he's been dead?

866
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,267
I don't know.

867
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,941
Did I saddle you
with a stepfather?

868
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,704
I don't have any peanut butter.

869
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,956
I haven't kept it
since you left.

870
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,875
I can't make you
a fluffernutter.

871
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,877
Want French toast?

872
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,629
No.

873
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,966
I gotta go.

874
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,515
- Ade sends her love.
- Right. Say hello.

875
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,435
And you watch that Baileys.

876
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,853
I'll give you
a shot in the head.

877
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,688
- Look who's talking.
- What?

878
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:20,065
Never mind what.
