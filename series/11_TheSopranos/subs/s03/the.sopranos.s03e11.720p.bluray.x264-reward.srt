3
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,150
Hello?

4
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,209
- Hello?
- Ls Tony there?

5
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,753
No, I'm sorry, he's not.

6
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,966
Who's calling?

7
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:54,634
<i>This is Mrs. Washington, from
the high school, for little Anthony.</i>

8
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,473
Mrs. Washington?

9
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,308
From your son's school?

10
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,939
Hello?

11
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:08,106
Tony, it's me. I'm sorry to call you.

12
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,610
<i>I know we are broken up,
but my religious medal...</i>

13
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,497
I think I lost it.
I think it's on The Stugots.

14
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,907
Oh. Okay.

15
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,375
Who is on the boat with you?

16
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,296
I'll be sure and tell him. All right.

17
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,791
- Your son okay?
- Attendance shit.

18
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,680
- Two weeks, not even a kiss hello?
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry. Yeah.

19
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,896
- How was Morocco?
- Great.

20
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:54,243
Listen, that phone call,
it was an old girlfriend.

21
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:58,656
She wasn't from the school?
My God, she sounded so convincing.

22
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,497
- I'm just trying to be honest.
- Yeah? Why'd you lie?

23
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,503
- I didn't wanna piss you off.
- It's about you?

24
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,415
What? I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

25
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:14,134
No, you didn't wanna piss me off,
meaning you'd have to deal with me...

26
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:18,346
which is more about sparing you
than my fucking feelings!

27
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,480
Merry Christmas.

28
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,948
Let's go with the satin finish.

29
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,243
Excuse me.

30
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,791
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

31
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,507
You know that Russkie, Valery,
works for Slava?

32
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,467
He owes Sil five grand.

33
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,804
<i>For that other thing.
I need you to pick it up.</i>

34
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,641
- Why don't Sil go?
- He's dying from the flu.

35
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,229
- I didn't hear you.
- He's sick, he's got the flu!

36
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,394
I'm taking my mother
to Social Security.

37
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,363
So you do it after. Guy's at Fairlawn.
327 Dexter Avenue, number six.

38
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,620
- I don't know why we deal with them.
- Guess?

39
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,657
<i>- They</i> make us money.
- Thank you.

40
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,750
And the family's well?

41
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:30,290
- I'm concerned about our daughter.
- What's the problem?

42
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,457
She's dating a boy.

43
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,299
The son of some friends
of the family, actually.

44
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:42,685
I mentioned him to you. I guess I'm
not as optimistic as I once was.

45
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,313
She was dating a different boy,
an African-American?

46
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,517
They broke up.
He broke it off with her.

47
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,775
Believe that?

48
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:55,405
- You gave him little choice.
- I'm the reason she's with Jackie?

49
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,613
If you hadn't been so mean to him...

50
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,699
maybe she might not be
with this one.

51
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:13,465
I find it very interesting that you
can talk about this without rancor.

52
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,180
Actually, we haven't been arguing
as much lately.

53
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,388
It's the therapy.
We're learning how to communicate.

54
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:30,482
Eighteen, double word score,
that's 36.

55
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,062
No Spanish.

56
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,654
- Spanish?
- "Oh-blee-kay"?

57
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,485
Oblique.

58
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:42,244
Indirect? Not straightforward?
Come on, you're in college.

59
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,279
I'm not an English major.

60
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,307
- As in, "How about giving me some?"
- Jackie, I'm sick.

61
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,473
I know. I'm only kidding.

62
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,391
Unless you want to.

63
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,363
- Jackie.
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

64
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,742
- Wanna do some X?
- I'm already taking NyQuil.

65
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,625
- Tired?
- Yeah, actually, I am kind of wiped.

66
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,796
- Mind if we finish this tomorrow?
- Okay.

67
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,133
You're burning up.

68
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,473
I'll come by tomorrow
and bring you echinacea.

69
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,721
You're leaving?

70
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,142
I gotta let you get some sleep.

71
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,534
The Russians? They're not all bad.

72
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:10,917
Cocksuckers moved nuclear warheads
into Cuba, pointed them right at us.

73
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:15,750
That was real? I saw that movie,
I thought it was bullshit.

74
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,131
Who is it?

75
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,459
KGB.

76
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,381
Open up.

77
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,397
We didn't wake you, did we?

78
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,108
Or the other 30 people
who live here?

79
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,780
- You want?
- Little early, no?

80
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,662
TV, stereo, DVD.

81
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,215
- What's this?
- Universal remote.

82
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,502
Universal remote.

83
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:08,014
Probably wiped your ass barehanded
till you came here.

84
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:12,053
- So, Valery, you got Silvio's money?
- Fucking Silvio.

85
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,679
Watch it, comrade.

86
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,894
Money is on entertainment center.

87
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,776
- Better not be any rubles in there.
- Put remote on docking station.

88
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,696
- What?
- Universal remote.

89
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,949
Put it down on docking station.

90
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,210
Listen to this prick giving orders.

91
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,167
You got some balls, my friend.

92
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,964
OOPS.

93
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,424
- Paulie.
- What? It was an accident.

94
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,470
You want to fuck here, cocksucker?
You come to my house...

95
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,556
What did you call me?

96
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,821
Paulie!
Paulie, where the fuck are you?

97
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:43,564
- What the fuck? What'd you do?
- What, did I have a choice?

98
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,401
He's dying.

99
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,574
Cracked his windpipe.
That's it for him.

100
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,112
Are you a fucking doctor?
What are we gonna do?

101
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,373
Pull the car around.

102
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,557
"I'm feeling very sheepish."

103
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,989
About the other day.

104
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,071
I had no right to even
answer your phone.

105
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,031
It's all right.

106
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,826
I'm sorry I lied.

107
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,997
- Gonna open it?
- Yeah.

108
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,600
- It's beautiful.
- It's from Morocco.

109
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,226
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

110
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,986
Now I feel like a jerk.
I got nothing for you.

111
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,862
Of course you do.

112
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,337
No. I gotta see who this is.

113
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,518
I gotta take this.

114
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,105
- Yeah?
- Ton. It's me.

115
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,901
We saw that guy, but we had a problem.
It got a little physical.

116
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,198
You were just supposed
to pick up the money.

117
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:58,487
We did, but he started giving us
some shit. Prick sucker-punched me.

118
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,745
<i>Hang on.</i>

119
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,703
- What?
- Hang on.

120
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,463
Where are you now?

121
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,459
<i>Rest stop, Garden State.</i>

122
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,596
Where's the guy?

123
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,257
- With the luggage.
- Are you kidding?

124
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,767
- You're breaking up, I can't hear you.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

125
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,931
It got bad. We had no choice.

126
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,398
I'm meeting Slava later.
What do I say to him?

127
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,609
<i>It's okay. Nobody was around.</i>

128
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,107
What do you wanna do?

129
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:44,078
Use your judgment, but whatever
you decide, do it away from me.

130
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,794
<i>- All right.
Motherfucker!</i>

131
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,425
- That was a big waste of water.
- It was just some work shit.

132
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,722
You got time for lunch?

133
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,471
You are my lunch.

134
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,057
I gotta get back.

135
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,513
How about dinner?

136
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,024
What do you got in mind?

137
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,109
Nine o'clock, my house.
You like London broil?

138
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,774
Yeah.

139
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:27,622
- We could dump him down the shore.
- It's too light out, we should wait.

140
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:33,798
- Got a Roy Rogers over there. Hungry?
- First things first, Chrissy.

141
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,835
I'm just saying.
I didn't eat breakfast.

142
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,049
Most important meal.

143
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,682
- Hi.
- How you doing?

144
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,480
- Let's go to Pine Barrens.
- That's South Jersey.

145
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,394
It's perfect.
It's fucking deserted down there.

146
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,779
Take him in the woods,
dig a hole, end of story.

147
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:01,034
And fucking snow all over the ground?
That's some hard shit.

148
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,617
I got a shovel I use
for digging the car out.

149
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,874
Best part is, we'll be 20 minutes
from A.C.

150
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,911
We get a room, freshen up,
some blackjack.

151
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,624
Fuck that, I gotta eat.

152
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:17,634
We'll go to Morton's, have a steak.
So the day won't be a total loss.

153
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,008
Things with you and Carmela
seem to be going well.

154
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,098
It's the therapy.

155
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,031
Now look, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

156
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,369
I'm seeing somebody.

157
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,747
A patient of yours.

158
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,956
Gloria Trillo.

159
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,459
Why Gloria?

160
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,671
Why not? She's smart,
she's sexy, she's Italian.

161
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,759
- Italian?
- You stick to your own kind, you know.

162
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,096
<i>What is this, West Side Story now?</i>

163
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,268
Do you think having met her
in therapy is significant?

164
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,558
Maybe she reminds me of you.

165
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,275
Okay.

166
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,856
How?

167
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,364
Smart. Sexy. She's Italian.

168
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,861
She's actually nothing like you.

169
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,572
Well...

170
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,494
maybe a little.

171
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,247
- Who else?
- You both got great legs.

172
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,254
- Keep joking.
- Don't get jealous.

173
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,086
It's your fault we met.

174
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,834
The scheduling mix-up?

175
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,301
Point is, she makes me happy.

176
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,510
Does she seem happy to you?

177
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,642
When she's with me.
And you know what? So am I.

178
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,446
Is lying to Carmela in therapy
the best thing for your panic attacks?

179
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,657
Things are good between us,
you said so.

180
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,571
It's predicated on a lie.

181
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:16,165
Predicate it on my ass, what's the
difference? I'm content, I'm relaxed.

182
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,251
Bottom line is, I'm a better
husband and father.

183
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,256
You wanna know the truth,
as much as I love my wife...

184
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,137
being with Gloria
makes me happier...

185
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,971
than all your Prozac
and your therapy bullshit, combined.

186
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,688
- What do you think?
- I think we should have ate.

187
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,653
Cocksucker's still alive!

188
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,733
Look at this.
He chewed through the tape.

189
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,322
Fucking piece shit!

190
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,581
- I'll put one in your head.
- Fuck your fucking mother!

191
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,169
Get the shovel, Chrissy.

192
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,938
Freezing out here.

193
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:08,572
Don't you know better than to wear
pajamas in the middle of winter?

194
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,079
- Think this is far enough?
- It'll do.

195
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,586
- What the fuck you doing?
- You think we're digging the hole?

196
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:25,089
That's right, shithead. Get to work.

197
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,502
I know the ground's hard,
but give it some Siberian action.

198
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,671
Cocksuckers. I'll kill you both.

199
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,675
Shut up.

200
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,057
You think the cold bothers me?!

201
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,308
I wash my balls with ice water!

202
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,896
This is warm.

203
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,186
You American pieces of shit!

204
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,898
- What's he saying?
- Who gives a shit?

205
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,987
Keep digging-

206
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:57,372
Not that it matters now, but we didn't
come to your house to kill you.

207
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:03,499
That mouth of yours, you gotta learn
to shut the fuck up.

208
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,622
So how far is it to Atlantic City?

209
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,597
Motherfucker!

210
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,729
Fuck!

211
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,958
What the fuck?

212
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,260
- I got him, didn't I?
- Yeah. Fuck!

213
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,592
Maybe he's stunned.

214
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,356
- How bad is it?
- Couple of stitches.

215
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:17,902
We'll finish him and cover him
with snow. You see where he went?

216
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:22,414
He's gotta be close.
Half his head's probably hanging off.

217
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,167
There's some blood over there.

218
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,718
Where is this prick?
Sure I hit him in the head?

219
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,255
Yeah, fucking positive.

220
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:42,143
I don't see any more blood.
It's like the trail just ended.

221
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,414
- You gonna be home for dinner?
- Yeah.

222
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,375
All right, I'm going to the market.

223
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,916
Maybe it's like cutting off a chicken's
head, how they keep running.

224
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,088
Fucking believe this?

225
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,924
- Hello?
- Where you been?

226
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,095
- The Pine Barrens.
- Did you wrap the package?

227
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,516
Not yet. We were about to.
We had a little problem.

228
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,309
What problem?

229
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:35,988
The package hit Chrissy
with an implement and ran off.

230
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,316
I thought you said it was...

231
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:42,487
<i>We thought it was. It's complicated.
We're looking for it.</i>

232
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:46,829
- I can't hear you, you're breaking up.
- We're looking for it!

233
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,744
<i>- I used to get sciatica...
- Could survive?</i>

234
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,503
The package?

235
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,049
- Could the package survive?
- Ton?

236
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,336
Is there any way the
package could survive?

237
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,175
No, T. No fucking way.

238
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,887
<i>- -It's my life,
and I'll live it any way I please.</i>

239
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,097
- Cocksucker!
- What?

240
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,106
I'm meeting with Slava! I could be
walking into a fucking buzz saw!

241
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:14,060
T? T? Hello?

242
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:15,941
Fuck!

243
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:21,072
- What'd he say?
- He's worried about this Slava asshole.

244
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,409
We're working with him, but you
wonder what Tony's got going.

245
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:30,122
- None of our fucking business, is it?
- I'm a fucking captain.

246
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:34,422
- Got a match? My lighter's in the car.
- Mine too.

247
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,048
I'm not dressed for this shit.

248
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,724
- He's gotta be dead by now, right?
- How could he not be?

249
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:51,648
Fuck it, let's just go.
Squirrels will eat him anyway.

250
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,651
- Where'd we park?
- Back there, half a mile or so.

251
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,483
You sure?
I thought we looped around.

252
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:04,494
Four years in the Army, kid. We just
follow our own footprints. Come on.

253
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:27,392
Wait a minute. We walked in a circle.
How's that fucking possible?

254
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,428
All right, let's reason this out.

255
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,564
We drove south,
and the sun's setting there.

256
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,817
- What use is that?
- We know our direction.

257
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,652
- Yeah, but we're still fucking lost.
- We're not lost. Stop getting cunty.

258
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,447
Slava.

259
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,074
Tony.

260
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,206
Come in. Come in.

261
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,298
My daughter, llana.
Say hello to Mr. Soprano.

262
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,299
- Hello.
- How you doing?

263
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,711
Go to drugstore, buy some candy.

264
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,801
Beautiful girl.

265
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:15,394
Brilliant student. One day she goes
to Harvard in Massachusetts.

266
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,149
Maybe.

267
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,861
Family.

268
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,450
Nothing is more important.

269
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,987
That's why you gotta plan ahead.

270
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,748
- There's 200 in here.
- Okay.

271
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:39,915
Same drill. To Isle of Man.
Four days, clean as whistle.

272
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,549
We drink.

273
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,434
So where's your friend, you know?

274
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,980
Valery?

275
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,478
Who knows?

276
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,480
- He gave Silvio the money? I told him.
- Don't know, I wasn't there.

277
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,572
<i>Salut.</i>

278
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,035
That's you and him, ain't it?

279
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,758
He was like brother to me.

280
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,220
Closer than brother.

281
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,057
But now he's tragic figure.

282
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:36,520
- What do you mean?
- The alcohol, the drugs.

283
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,726
Disgrace to his family.

284
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,600
He breaks my heart.

285
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,156
Well, maybe you could send him to AA.

286
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,362
In Chechnya, he saves my life.

287
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,834
You're...

288
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,882
very emotional.

289
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,556
I would do anything for him.

290
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,765
Take it easy, we'll find it.

291
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:24,060
I'm dizzy.
My fucking head is killing me.

292
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,153
<i>- Hello?
- It's a bad connection. I'll talk fast.</i>

293
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:36,114
The guy is some ex-commando. He killed
16 Chechen rebels single-handed.

294
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,159
T? T, that you?

295
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,293
Goddamn it.

296
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,206
- I didn't hear what you said.
<i>- I'll</i> talk fast.

297
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:49,878
The guy you're looking for killed
16 Chechen rebels single-handed!

298
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,217
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah, <i>nice,</i> huh?

299
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,510
He was with the Interior Ministry.
He's a Russian Green Beret.

300
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:03,607
This guy cannot come back
to tell this story. You understand?

301
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,103
- I hear you.
<i>- I'm serious, Paulie.</i>

302
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,113
Ton? Ton, you there?

303
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,567
Goddamn! Fuck!

304
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,568
Call me back!

305
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:22,459
You're not gonna believe this.
He killed 16 Czechoslovakians.

306
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,620
The guy was an interior decorator.

307
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,423
His house looked like shit.

308
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,808
Didn't you hear it? Twig snapping.

309
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:50,696
You said yourself I hit him in the
head. Fucking Rasputin, this guy.

310
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,031
See?

311
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,873
Come on, he's running.

312
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,631
OH!

313
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,967
Fuck!

314
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,219
Fucking cunt!

315
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,266
Paulie, come on, I think I got him!

316
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,117
If we were trying,
we wouldn't have come close.

317
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,912
I lost my shoe.

318
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,722
- Hello?
- It's me. How you feeling?

319
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,386
- Like shit. When you coming?
- I gotta get my mom's car inspected.

320
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:08,349
- At night?
- The only time my friend can do it.

321
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,611
- I'm so bummed. I really miss you.
- Can you do it tomorrow?

322
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:17,570
I can't. My morn needs the car, and
I gotta move Dov's shit out of here.

323
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,156
I'll call you later, okay?

324
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,367
Yeah, okay. Bye.

325
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:58,987
This is no fucking joke here.
I could lose a foot.

326
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:02,824
- It's numb, huh?
- What the fuck you think?

327
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:09,122
How could we be lost like this?
We're in New Jersey!

328
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,378
South Jersey!

329
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,874
- We should eat some berries.
- You nuts?

330
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,921
Shit like that could be poisonous,
you don't know. Come on.

331
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,013
- What?
- What the fuck is that?

332
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,101
Looks like a truck.

333
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,647
AH 1

334
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,105
There's fucking gravel
under this snow!

335
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,200
Back wheels are gone.

336
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,211
Thank you, God.

337
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,793
My ears feel like they'll fall off.

338
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:59,335
Fuck your ears!
Get me something for my foot.

339
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,304
OOH.

340
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:11,392
Jesus, that prick really brained me.

341
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:16,690
Gotta sit with my foot under my thigh.

342
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,272
Use my own body heat.
That's the trick.

343
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,783
- What if he's not dead?
- He's fucking dead.

344
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,452
I know, but 16 Czechoslovakians...

345
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,418
He's trained for this shit.
It's like Die Hard shit.

346
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,716
It's supposed to snow later this week.

347
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,509
- Know the weather in Mexico?
- Chili today, hot tamale?

348
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,392
You heard it before?

349
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,178
It's an old joke.

350
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,312
Egon Kosma said he made it up.

351
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,984
- What's the matter, you're not hungry?
- Late lunch.

352
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,590
Could be him out there, stalking us.

353
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,926
With what, his cock?

354
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:32,470
Think about it. If he's alive, he's
unarmed and bleeding like a sieve.

355
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:37,267
He's in the woods, in his pajamas.
It's the fucking Yukon out there.

356
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,608
- Probably thinks we left.
- If he's alive, which he ain't.

357
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,072
- What's that?
- A Nathan's bag.

358
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,833
Fuck, there's some ketchups and shit!

359
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,835
- Clean?
- I don't know, they were in a bag.

360
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,838
They're a little halfway frozen.

361
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,001
- Fuck it. Give me some.
- Here.

362
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:19,267
Not bad. Mix it with the relish.

363
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,479
It's Nana and Grandpa.

364
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,523
What are you doing here?

365
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:32,493
- Three hours at the eye doctor.
- Glaucoma. I may need an operation.

366
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,372
Oh, my God.

367
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,371
Come on, sit down.

368
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,334
- Do you want to eat?
- Who could eat, after news like that?

369
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,669
Hold on, I'll make some coffee.

370
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,969
Hello?

371
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,927
It's me.

372
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,762
Where are you?

373
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,015
We're still here.

374
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,100
<i>And?</i>

375
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,145
- No good.
- That's really fucking great.

376
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,731
That language, is that necessary?

377
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,362
<i>Listen, Ton, we're really lost.</i>

378
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:12,866
We've been walking around for hours.
I lost my shoe. We found an old truck.

379
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,998
I don't know what
you're talking about!

380
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,158
- How <i>about some advice?
- What?</i>

381
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,827
How about some advice?

382
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,213
Stay there till the morning
and find this guy!

383
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,463
<i>We're trying.</i>

384
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,093
<i>- Goddamn fucking phone!
- Thanks, Ton. Thanks a lot.</i>

385
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,886
<i>- Oh, I should be happy about this?
- No, it's just...</i>

386
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:38,395
Sometimes your nephew don't think
before he acts. That's all I'll say.

387
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,602
- I thought the guy punched you.
- He did.

388
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,350
It's just...

389
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,315
We'll talk later.

390
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,827
You're having coffee, right?

391
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,333
My father has glaucoma.

392
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,595
<i>It's Jackie, leave a message.</i>

393
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,307
It's me again.

394
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:21,139
You said you were gonna call.
Where the hell are you?

395
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,907
Hi, Ambujam. I'm really sorry,
I need to borrow your car.

396
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,265
If I wanted to be treated like shit,
I'd get married.

397
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,846
Sorry.

398
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:04,314
- Something came up.
- Dinner is fucking ruined.

399
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,769
Well, we'll go out.

400
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,740
Anywhere you want.

401
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,988
Come on, don't be like that.

402
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,156
Inconsiderate prick.

403
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,575
I said I was sorry.

404
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,292
Family shit.

405
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,754
Couldn't be avoided.

406
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,133
Let me make it up to you.

407
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,175
You were supposed to be here
three hours ago.

408
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,309
I know, but I'm here now, aren't I?

409
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,188
HMM?

410
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,848
This is fucking bullshit!

411
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,352
It was Silvio's money,
he should have got it himself.

412
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:29,775
Cocksucker got the sniffles,
and we're stuck out here?

413
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,563
- You shouldn't have hit him.
- I shouldn't have been there!

414
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,275
It's an insult Tony gives me
this shit.

415
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,443
Yeah, blame Tony now.

416
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:45,453
You had to hear him on the phone
before, talking to me like a child.

417
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:48,209
You know the money I made for him?

418
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,587
Or his old man before him?

419
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,248
He's living like a fucking king.

420
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:57,760
And now all I hear about
is cocksucker Ralphie.

421
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,765
I'm going to sleep.
Let me get some of that carpet.

422
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,395
I been working on a plan.

423
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,023
A Plan?

424
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:19,066
We're in a truck. It had to get here.
There's gotta be a road out.

425
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:24,121
- It stops at those trees.
- Give me your shoes. I'll get help.

426
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,657
Fuck you! You're not leaving me.

427
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,246
- Don't trust me?
- It's pitch dark.

428
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,832
What's your plan?
Eat ketchup packs?

429
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:36,000
- We should have gone to Roy Rogers!
- I should have fucked Dale Evans!

430
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,682
- What are you doing?
- Calling Tony.

431
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:48,471
- You're gonna piss him off.
- Fuck him. We'll die out here!

432
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,273
Dumb fuckers.

433
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,616
<i>- Yeah'?
- It's me.</i>

434
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,576
- What now?
- What now?

435
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,959
<i>Chrissy's bleeding,
and I'm freezing to death!</i>

436
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,164
Take it easy!

437
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,422
I'm through taking it easy!
We're starving!

438
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,541
<i>- What do you want me to do?
- Come get us!</i>

439
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,679
- You don't even know where you are!
<i>- Exit</i> 12.

440
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,805
- What?
- Exit fucking 12!

441
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,968
- Pike's Hollow, or some shit.
- Pike's Hollow.

442
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:32,890
There's a dirt road. We're parked
a mile in, near picnic tables.

443
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:37,106
- When I <i>find the</i> car, <i>then what?
- I don't know, yell.</i>

444
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,781
<i>We're in a truck. That dirt road
might be the same one we're on.</i>

445
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,738
Put my nephew on the phone.

446
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,657
Here.

447
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,871
Yeah, T?

448
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,874
- Are you all <i>right?</i>
- My head's killing me.

449
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,412
- I <i>can't hear.</i>
- My head hurts! I got a concussion.

450
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,669
All right, just stay calm.

451
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,301
- Bring food, all right?
- Some fucking shoes too!

452
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,671
All right, hang in there.

453
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,685
I gotta go.

454
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,349
- What, are you kidding me?
- It's an emergency.

455
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,278
- What do you want?
- You think I'm a whore?

456
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,653
Just calm down.

457
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,191
You'll just come over and fuck me?

458
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,485
I don't got time for this shit.

459
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,871
Now you're gonna leave?
You lowlife shit! Here!

460
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,248
Take your fucking dinner!

461
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,847
I fucking hate you!

462
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,822
I know he's cheating on me.

463
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,533
I could hear it in his voice.

464
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:11,204
Car inspection? It's bullshit.

465
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,210
What if he's not, though?

466
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:24,002
Doing this would make me as bad
as he is. Maybe we should go.

467
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:34,223
Hey. Sorry I had to wake you.

468
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:38,849
Fucking chemo. I'm awake
throwing up half the night anyway.

469
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:43,562
- Did you call Bobby?
- He's on his way.

470
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,612
- What have you been eating, steak?
- No.

471
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,493
I don't know.

472
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,404
I need to borrow a shirt.

473
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,118
- You want some tea?
- No.

474
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,768
Fuck this!

475
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,429
Where you going?

476
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:23,769
It's not bad enough you wake me,
I gotta get my balls broken too?

477
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,063
Go with my nephew. Do what he says.

478
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,994
I gotta change my shirt.

479
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,374
I got my limits too, Junior.

480
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,331
Be strong.

481
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,980
Yeah, of course I did.

482
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,059
- I can't believe this.
- Why are you here?

483
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,775
- I loved you.
- Who the hell are you?

484
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,860
- Fuck you, bitch.
- What?

485
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,866
- Don't ever call me again!
- Meadow, wait.

486
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,372
Yeah, you better leave, bitch!

487
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,338
What the fuck?
That's Tony Soprano's daughter!

488
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,590
Oh, what do I care, asshole?

489
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,089
Fucking bitch.

490
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:31,924
Damn it!

491
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:41,055
You really know about this shit?
You know, the woods and hunting?

492
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,439
My dad and me used to go every year.

493
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,440
Sorry I laughed at you before.

494
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,526
It's all right.

495
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,858
Hey, one time we went hunting...

496
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:59,285
we saw a sign that said,
"Bear left." So we went home.

497
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,296
I appreciate you
taking care of my uncle.

498
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,297
Yeah, I know.

499
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,890
- He really loves you.
- Come on, that old prick?

500
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,644
I'm serious.
He talks about you all the time.

501
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,523
I know you had your problems,
but, I don't know...

502
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,652
I wish he was my uncle sometimes.

503
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,118
What time is it?

504
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,165
4:30.

505
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,879
Where the fuck is he?

506
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,597
- What are those, Tic Tacs?
- I just found them.

507
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,060
- I didn't know I had them on me.
- Give me some!

508
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:10,110
- There ain't no more. I ate them.
- I'm dying here!

509
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,362
Then fucking die already.

510
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,490
- Where you going?
- I'm eating those berries.

511
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:19,448
- I'm telling you, they're poison.
- At least I won't die hungry.

512
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,351
You sure this is it?

513
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,605
Pike's Hollow.
A mile in, by the picnic table.

514
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,607
Where's their car?
Maybe they left.

515
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,645
No, they wouldn't leave
without calling.

516
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,563
Let me try him again.

517
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,373
Tony?

518
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:10,332
<i>Paulie... Bacala... We'll be...</i>

519
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,713
Ton, I can't hear you.

520
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,877
Motherfucking cocksucker!

521
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,842
That Tony? What'd he say?

522
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,469
I don't know.

523
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:36,650
Do that by your window,
I don't wanna smell your piss!

524
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,064
Fuck you.

525
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,857
- What?
- You heard me.

526
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,072
Don't make me pull rank.

527
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:48,163
Fuck you. Captain or not, now we're
just two assholes lost in the woods.

528
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:51,168
Do yourself a favor
and go back to sleep!

529
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,500
- Why, so you can choke me?
- What?

530
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,581
Think I'm stupid?

531
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:58,672
I heard you on the phone trying
to blame this on me.

532
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,669
What?

533
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,090
You fucked up,
now you're worried about Tony.

534
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,886
When I sleep, you'll choke me
so he has your version.

535
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,521
Choke you right now, you fuck!

536
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,273
I'll leave you,
you one-shoe cocksucker!

537
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,729
Put it down.

538
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:18,396
You know how fast I run,
I'll leave you in the dust!

539
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,032
The shit we been through,
you think I'd kill you?

540
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,909
Yeah, I do.

541
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,093
Promise you won't leave me here.

542
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,976
I'm not gonna leave you.

543
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:02,858
Paulie! Christopher!

544
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,612
What do you think?
What should we do?

545
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:13,501
There's nothing we can do. We'll wait
till it's light, then we'll head in.

546
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:28,508
101. Let's get some fluids in you,
we'll send you home later.

547
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,604
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

548
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:37,141
She was out all night.
I couldn't stop her.

549
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,935
It's over.

550
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,316
He was cheating on me.

551
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,106
Holy shit.

552
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,906
We drove out to Jersey
and I caught them together.

553
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,069
She was a real whore too.

554
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,410
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

555
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,752
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have pressured him.

556
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,164
You are better off without him.

557
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,300
He was cute.
But he was really boring.

558
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:06,588
You don't know what it's like
to grow up where we did.

559
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:11,260
- Whatever, Med. He was such a drip.
- No, he wasn't! He was great!

560
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,163
<i>Bruno Mag“ over here.</i>

561
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,602
Which way? What do you think?

562
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,735
Don't matter to me.
I ain't stopping till we hit cement.

563
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,252
A lot of strange people
used to live in these woods.

564
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:24,499
Jackson Whites,
these weird-looking albinos.

565
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:30,513
Paulie! Christopher!

566
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,268
First place I hit is Denny's.

567
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:40,728
I know. Get like five
of those Grand Slam breakfasts.

568
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,108
Shit!

569
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,445
What's the matter?

570
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,487
Fucking thing's loose already.

571
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,917
Motherfucker!

572
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,384
What are you doing?
What if we need the bullets?

573
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,802
That's no deer hunter.

574
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,933
Paulie! Christopher!

575
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:35,323
- Tony! Over here!
- Over here!

576
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,953
Paulie! Christopher! Where are you?

577
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:45,170
Over here, Tony!

578
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,143
Thank fucking God!

579
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,054
You guys all right?

580
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:07,568
- What the fuck you shooting at?
- Nothing. Never mind.

581
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:12,653
- Jesus Christ, look at you two!
- All night in this fucking hellhole.

582
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,451
All right, come on.

583
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,577
Come on, easy.

584
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:39,763
- This the spot?
- Yeah, but my fucking car's gone.

585
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,475
- You sure this is where you left it?
- Positive.

586
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,059
Is the heat on?

587
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,531
Jesus Christ, I can't feel my toes.

588
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:00,242
- You got any blankets?
- No, sorry.

589
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,372
Turn up the heat, huh?

590
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,626
I can't believe it.
I fucking loved that car.

591
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,507
- Probably kids.
- What if it was the guy?

592
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,754
You got the money?

593
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,257
It was in the car.

594
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:25,643
- That's all I asked you to do.
- Sorry. It couldn't be helped.

595
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,898
Guy fucking lunged at us.

596
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,732
Listen, Ton, I know I fucked up. But...

597
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:38,651
It's okay, really. Just forget it.

598
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,249
What do you think?
Wanna look for this guy?

599
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,290
You tell me. Is it worth it?

600
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:52,047
I hit him in the head, Ton.
I saw it with my own eyes.

601
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:57,010
- Could this fuck make it out alive?
- Hard to say.

602
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:00,139
Flesh wound, maybe.
Head shot, I don't know.

603
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,550
On the other hand,
anything's possible.

604
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:12,314
You're a captain,
what do you wanna do?

605
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,823
Fuck it. Let's go home.

606
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,492
All right.

607
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,371
But let's be clear on this right now.

608
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:36,168
This guy crawls out from a rock,
he's your problem.

609
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,429
You deal with Slava, you take
the heat, you pay the price.

610
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,464
<i>Capisce?</i>

611
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,347
Fine.

612
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,632
You got mayonnaise on your chin.

613
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:20,674
- What?
- Mayonnaise! Mayonnaise!

614
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,960
Something's fucked up here.

615
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:57,919
One minute she's fine,
the next she's a fucking lunatic!

616
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:02,636
I asked you whether or not
she seemed like a happy person.

617
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:06,719
By that I'm supposed to know
she'd throw a roast beef at my head?

618
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,433
Read into things however you choose.

619
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,112
Why does everything gotta be so hard?

620
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,986
I'm not saying I'm perfect,
but I do the right thing by my family.

621
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,411
Doesn't that count for anything?

622
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:39,749
We should discuss what attracted
you to Gloria in the first place.

623
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:42,509
Oh, we been through that already.

624
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,262
And Irina before her.

625
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:51,894
Depressive personality, unstable,
impossible to please.

626
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,813
Does that remind you
of any other woman?
