1
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,441
<i>... a guy that really understands
you people. And that really frightens me.</i>

2
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,108
<i>Hey, while there have been some turnover
in the elite teams of last year...</i>

3
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,118
<i>one thing remains consistent,
the Eagles.</i>

4
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,496
<i>The Cowboys have remained
fairly healthy this year...</i>

5
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:57,585
- Come on, don't answer it. You just got in.
- I have to. It's football season.

6
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,334
Oh, come on. There is no game tonight.

7
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,041
- Paulie, what's up?
- Forget that betting.

8
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,379
- I was making cheese dogs for you.
- Why, what's going on?

9
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,464
Okay.

10
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,140
All right.

11
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,934
I'll be there.

12
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,932
Chrissy!

13
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,725
Plus it was a bitch
getting off of work tonight.

14
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,025
- Adriana, I think this could be it.
- What?

15
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,482
He told me to look sharp and
meet him at Modell's in half an hour.

16
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,697
He told me to shine my shoes.

17
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,247
Oh, my God. Christopher!

18
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:40,662
Find me a shirt and tie to go with this. Not the camellia.
Paulie's got one just like it.

19
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:45,215
I can't believe it. I mean,
I knew it would happen, but...

20
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,545
So now can we get out of here, you know?
Get a big loft, maybe?

21
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,637
- You're giving notice today.
- You wish.

22
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,560
The wife of a made guy doesn't hostess.

23
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,768
I'm so proud of you.

24
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,445
- I love you, Christopher.
- You better.

25
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,003
- What?
- I don't know.

26
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:29,836
You getting called like this and
going off all happy. I worry, that's all.

27
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,930
You've seen too many movies.

28
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,942
- How you doing, kid?
- Good.

29
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,695
No, no, no. Ride up front.

30
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,152
Where we going?

31
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:00,241
You look good. Shoot your cuffs.

32
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,251
Where we going, Sil?

33
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,259
Here he is.

34
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,267
So this is it.

35
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,596
All right.

36
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,855
He sat on one ass cheek
the whole way over!

37
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,313
- Too many fucking movies, that's his problem.
- Bullshit, I sat funny.

38
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:36,406
All right. Let's get started. Come on.

39
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,751
All right, finish up over there.

40
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,703
All right, you know
why we're here.

41
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,507
So if you've got any doubts or
reservations, now's the time to say so.

42
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,256
No one will think any less of you.

43
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:58,515
Because once you enter this family,
there's no getting out.

44
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,390
This family comes before
everything else. Everything.

45
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:07,604
Before your wife, and your children,
and your mother and your father.

46
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,981
It's a thing of honor.

47
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,314
And God forbid, if something happens
and you can't earn...

48
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,233
we'll take care of you,
because that's part of it.

49
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,321
If you got a problem,
you just gotta let somebody know.

50
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,874
This man right here,
he's like your father.

51
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:30,039
It doesn't matter if it's with
somebody here or on the outside...

52
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,380
you bring it to him, he'll solve it.

53
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,676
You stay within the family.

54
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,972
All right, give me your hand.

55
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,328
Okay.

56
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,287
That's St. Peter, my family saint.
Now, as that card burns...

57
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,959
so may your soul burn in hell
if you betray your friends in the family.

58
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,966
Now rub your hands together like this
and repeat after me.

59
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,177
- May I burn in hell...
- May I burn in hell...

60
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:30,061
- ...if I betray my friends.
- ...lf I betray my friends.

61
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,104
Congratulations.

62
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,250
Beautiful.

63
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,977
- My fucking heart's still pounding.
- You been doing good with the sports book.

64
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,811
- Yeah, it's been good.
- I'm gonna give it to you, my boy. It's yours.

65
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:16,316
- I was wondering what it was gonna be.
- You're a made guy now.

66
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,695
It's your turn to make some real money,
and I get to relax a little.

67
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,738
Your only problem in life now is you give me
10 points of your take every settle-up day.

68
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,657
Other than that, you got no problem.

69
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:34,292
My only problem in life? I gotta kick
my points to that man over there.

70
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,920
And onward goes this thing of ours.

71
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,469
When you think of all the headaches
most human beings have in life...

72
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,383
ours are all boiled down to only one.
Not a bad deal, huh?

73
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,183
You got it.

74
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,683
Only thing, there's a six-G
minimum every week.

75
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:56,235
I gotta get something out of this. But six
grand, that could be a lot or a little.

76
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,904
Depends on you, and how
much you grow the business.

77
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,530
I love you, Paulie.
We're in it together now.

78
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,237
I love you too, kid.

79
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,161
Anything on the Riverfront
Esplanade project in Newark?

80
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,498
My guy says the matching funds
are this close.

81
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:22,507
The development agency, they added plans for
a Newark Museum of Science and Trucking.

82
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,881
More cement. More everything.

83
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,018
Answer the fucking thing.

84
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,354
So you feeling okay?

85
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:38,026
Oh, you mean about my mother?
Well, I mean, what're you gonna do?

86
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,734
- You pick up the pieces and go on.
- I meant your spells.

87
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,690
They're not spells.

88
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,117
How do you know about that in New York?

89
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,412
Everybody knows.
There's nothing to be ashamed of, Tony.

90
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,116
- For chrissakes, Julius Caesar was an epileptic.
- I'm not an epileptic.

91
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:57,204
Whatever it is, you gotta take care of yourself.
It's your health.

92
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,131
- Is the psychiatrist helping?
- Oh, you know about that too.

93
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,759
So what?
There's no stigmata these days.

94
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:07,263
My kid saw a shrink. He got
court-ordered for that thing with his wife.

95
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,593
- They're very happy now.
- Whatever happened to privacy?

96
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:15,101
Our family's been doing our Jersey business
a long time with the Sopranos.

97
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:21,438
In a peaceful and profitable way. And I
wanna keep it like that. Take care of this.

98
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,945
- All right, Carmine.
- Why fuck around? Be a better friend to yourself.

99
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,619
I will.
I appreciate your concern. Really.

100
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,460
<i>Jayne was determined to bust
into the business, so to speak.</i>

101
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,419
<i>Hollywood folklore has it that she
called Paramount Pictures and said:</i>

102
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,589
<i>"My name's Jayne Mansfield
and I wanna be a movie star."</i>

103
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,429
<i>Nowadays you get a dial tone.
But back in 1954...</i>

104
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,312
You got a phone call
from some young kid.

105
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,980
- Drew. Asked when you were coming home.
- How'd he sound?

106
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,107
Like he was about 15 years old.

107
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:09,819
- Wait. Is that your so-called fiancé?
- He's 19, actually, and he can go all night.

108
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,290
When are you going back to Seattle,
Janice?

109
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,419
It depends on how long it takes
to settle Ma's estate.

110
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:26,673
Estate? A falling-down house
and some old-lady underwear.

111
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:31,848
- Sad, isn't it? What it all comes down to.
- Janice, you know how much we love you.

112
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,847
And you know how much
we love having you around.

113
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:40,308
But there's a whole big house over there.
And I know you want maximum value.

114
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:47,106
So maybe for security reasons, or so it don't
fall into disrepair, you could stay there.

115
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,781
I been thinking the same thing.
I just don't wanna push Svetlana out.

116
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,908
Yeah, well, I talked to her. She's
moving out tomorrow, maybe the next day.

117
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,709
- Really?
- Yeah.

118
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,961
Great.

119
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,755
I better go pack.

120
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,329
Jesus Christ. Let me come around.

121
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,907
How you doing, Roy?

122
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,377
Congratulations.

123
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,798
Hector, large Old Blue Eyes for this
gentleman. Soft drinks of choice.

124
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,796
Look.

125
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,933
- Take away Tony Soprano, he's a zero with shoes.
- He's wearing a stripe now.

126
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,763
- My uncle Richie was gonna...
- Yeah, but he never did.

127
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,450
- Chris. My propers.
- Dino.

128
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,779
Hey, Benny.

129
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,285
Congratulations.

130
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,797
- When'd you get out, Benny?
- D.A. tossed it. The witness bailed.

131
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,467
- So, Jackie, how's Rutgers?
- Fuck that. I'm dropping out.

132
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,796
Come on. "Boola Boola."

133
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:38,554
We were just talking about our former
alma mater. They got the coffeehouse.

134
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,479
It's a pure cash operation.
And the beauty part is...

135
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:47,025
I mean, who's gonna stop you?
Kids? Campus security?

136
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:51,150
What are you telling him about that?
That's ours.

137
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,449
- Watch where the fuck you're going!
- Kiss my ass!

138
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,123
Take that shit outside!
Don't disrespect the pizza parlor.

139
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,373
- Fucking asshole! I know where you live!
- You hear what I said?

140
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,761
Yo, it was good talking to you, Chris.
Keep Dino in mind.

141
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:20,092
I don't wanna sound like an asshole, but I
can't be seen in a place like this anymore.

142
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,857
All right.

143
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,240
This has gotta start showing results
or end.

144
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,662
Now, I talked to a business associate,
a man I respect, about these panic attacks.

145
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:44,366
Enough fucking around.
Enough money in your pocket.

146
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,418
What's the story here?

147
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:53,292
The latest treatment of Panic Attack
Syndrome is a three-pronged approach.

148
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,625
So it's a syndrome?

149
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,213
Medication to treat the depression,
psychotherapy...

150
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,220
and cognitive behavioral therapy.

151
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,971
We've got you on medication.

152
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,771
If you feel you're ready,
you could see a behaviorist.

153
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:12,653
- You mean talk to somebody else?
- You seem unhappy with my approach.

154
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:18,115
If you're really ready to commit
to mental health, I say great.

155
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,240
Let's get going, I'm ready to help.

156
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,328
But we'll have to delve deeper. Focus.

157
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,411
This latest incident, for starters.

158
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,507
All right. Fine.

159
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,056
My daughter brought home a black.

160
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:46,269
They were on the couch, watching TV.
Snuggling.

161
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,103
And?

162
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:57,819
And she went upstairs, and I had a
frank conversation with Buckwheat.

163
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,950
You know? I told him to stay the fuck
away from my daughter.

164
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,155
And she came downstairs and they left.

165
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,449
And then you had the attack?

166
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:15,299
Well, no, not right then. I went to the kitchen
to fix a sandwich, I opened the cabinet...

167
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,968
I saw a box of Uncle Ben's rice.
Boom!

168
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,887
I see. The rice logo.

169
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:27,970
The first onset of hyperventilation,
that occurred upon seeing the rice?

170
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:36,269
No, no. I was taking the <i>capocollo</i>
and shit out of the fridge.

171
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:42,200
I'm thinking when you first came here,
the panic attack with ducks...

172
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,325
as I remember it,
you were grilling meat, weren't you?

173
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,657
The memory on you.

174
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,995
- Sausages, wasn't it?
- Sausages. Steaks. Yeah.

175
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,666
<i>Let's get back to that capocollo.</i>

176
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:02,721
I gotta take that. My busy season.

177
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,387
Yeah?

178
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,593
Fifty?

179
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,520
That's pretty rich for one game.

180
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,516
All right. If he's good for it, take it.

181
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,103
But keep me posted on Duke-Wake Forest.

182
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,230
All right.

183
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,323
Sorry.

184
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,243
Where were we?

185
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,619
The connection between
your anxiety attacks and meat.

186
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,373
Right.

187
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,416
What was it again?

188
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,132
Closing Ohio State, guys.
They're kicking off.

189
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:47,136
- Who you like? Iowa?
- No difference, as long as it pays out.

190
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,427
Chris, fuck. Oregon vs. USC?

191
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:54,390
See, I told you we should have
fucking laid off some of that action.

192
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:59,398
Spread's 11. Oregon's down by 12,
they're on the 45-yard line, no timeouts.

193
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,981
Oregon's got an
All-American fucking field-goal kicker.

194
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,567
Why didn't somebody tell me?

195
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,490
<i>- See'?
- And it's good!</i>

196
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,706
<i>Forty-three yarder.</i>

197
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,786
USC, that spread could've opened at 18,
fucking top-10 team!

198
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,839
Even so, we should have laid off some
of the action. Paulie did it all the time.

199
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,457
You see him here?

200
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,760
What's the matter with you people?
You deaf? Answer the fucking phones!

201
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,222
- Minor setback, that's all.
- Oh, yeah?

202
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,483
- The frost is on the pumpkin.
- Supposed to warm up again.

203
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,110
Good football weather.

204
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,446
Mom said to tell you she's
waiting for the meat.

205
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,275
- Did Jackie Jr. show yet?
- I don't know.

206
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:53,035
- Little fuck promised his mother he'd be here.
- Watch your language in front of my kid.

207
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:59,375
Probably keeping a booth warm
at the O.F., him and Dino Zerilli.

208
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,633
What's Jackie Jr. doing? I promised his old
man I'd try to keep him out of this shit.

209
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,807
- He's the heir apparent.
- Not this kid.

210
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,102
Do me a favor. You watch
out for Jackie, okay?

211
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,476
You ought to turn that one link there.

212
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,313
Little setback, huh?

213
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:28,153
Ro, your kid's late.
He's being rude, he should be set straight.

214
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,112
He'll be here. I paged him.
Honey, the poor kid lost his dad.

215
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,539
I lost mine when I was 6.

216
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,835
Ralph had to drop out in the 11th grade
to raise his brothers and sisters.

217
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,254
You'd never know it.

218
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,506
I'm Satan to this kid,
just because I'm in love with his mom.

219
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,881
- What are we talking about?
- Hey, A.J. The cheerleaders. Any hotties?

220
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,558
There's no cheerleaders
for freshman ball.

221
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,264
These are Mario Batali's string beans,
with Parmesan.

222
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:09,111
- You are very late, young man.
- It's me.

223
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,317
- Meadow! Hi, babe.
- Who is it?

224
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,575
- It's Meadow. What are you doing?
- Nothing. What's going on there?

225
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,954
- Well, Sunday dinner.
- Yeah?

226
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,583
- You wanna talk to your father? He's outside.
- Burning a cross?

227
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,966
I'm not sure I know what you're driving at,
but I know now is not the proper time.

228
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,054
<i>- Here, your brother wants to talk to you.
- No,</i> I <i>don't.</i>

229
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,224
- Hello?
- Hey. What's up?

230
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,894
- Everybody's here. It's really boring.
- Is that Jackie?

231
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:43,145
It's not him. It's Meadow from school.

232
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,444
Hold on, call waiting. Hello?

233
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,612
- My mother there?
- Yeah. One minute.

234
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,284
Aunt Ro? Yeah, I gotta go.

235
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,861
Thank you.

236
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,244
- Jackie, where are you?
- I can't make it.

237
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:04,454
- We're all waiting. You promised.
- Fuck it.

238
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,264
The way he talks to me...

239
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,977
You know what? I'll bring it up to Tony,
maybe he'll talk to him.

240
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,485
Paulie?

241
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,505
What time is it?

242
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:53,508
That's almost all of it. Warren
probably told you about Oregon-USC.

243
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,346
- This is unacceptable.
- It's $4000, Paulie.

244
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,012
<i>- I'll</i> have the rest in a couple days.
- I thought I made myself clear.

245
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,976
Fucking college ball.
But I learned a valuable lesson.

246
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm not running a school here, kid.

247
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,320
Paulie, this is me.
You know I'm good for it.

248
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,654
Don't fucking drag in our friendship.
This isn't about that. You work for me.

249
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,331
- Yeah, I want to...
- Just shut your mouth and listen.

250
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,408
I'll give you a few days...

251
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:29,248
but it'll cost you another two G's
as a reminder not to fuck it up.

252
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,878
I make myself clear?

253
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:37,719
And don't give me the malocchio.
I'm not the one with the short bag.

254
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:53,067
Any word from your Ivy Leaguer?
And how's Carm with the empty nest?

255
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,571
What empty? Meadow's always home
with laundry or hauling food out.

256
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,369
All that talk, she didn't go far.

257
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,540
We created too nice a home life.
They don't wanna go out in the world.

258
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,213
But, hey, if they're closer to us than we
were with our parents, is that bad?

259
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,719
- What time is it?
- I'm here, aren't I?

260
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:25,349
- Out of respect to my father.
- I gotta make two phone call.

261
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,647
Sit down.

262
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,741
- You want something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

263
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,703
That's too bad. I said lunch meeting.

264
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,623
You want a drink?

265
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,086
Lose the glasses.

266
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,723
I'm gonna say a few things.

267
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:09,310
I'm gonna say some bad words,
and you're just gonna have to deal with it.

268
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,688
Now, I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking I clipped your uncle.

269
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:18,148
On the one hand, you'd be a shithead to
believe me when I told you I didn't do it.

270
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,483
But I didn't.

271
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,325
And I got some bad news for you.
Look at me.

272
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,081
Look at me.

273
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,788
- Your uncle was a rat.
- No fucking way!

274
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:37,626
Sit down. Sit down. Sit the fuck down.

275
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:46,301
Your uncle was a rat, and now he's
in the Witness Protection Program.

276
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:53,191
- That's my father's brother you're talking about.
- I'm a member of your family, almost.

277
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,820
You think I'm the only one
that knows this about Richie?

278
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,026
You ask anybody. This hurt all of us.

279
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,207
Jesus Christ.

280
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,631
Your dad and me,
you know how close we were?

281
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:23,679
He never wanted this for you.
He wanted you to be a doctor.

282
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,719
Give me a fucking break.

283
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:31,054
Let me tell you something. Besides the
money, doctor's a very powerful position.

284
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,934
I'm no doctor.

285
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,484
You know how hard you have to work
to get your MD'? How many years it takes?

286
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:42,191
I was even thinking maybe osteopathy, but I
don't think I have the grades for that even.

287
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,402
You're not gonna drop out of Rutgers,
are you?

288
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:50,452
No. But those fucking premed courses
almost killed me.

289
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,457
I only did it because my dad was sick.

290
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:57,380
But you should know,
he never wanted this life for you.

291
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:02,210
And I'll tell you something.
I don't want it for my son either.

292
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,510
Hut!

293
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:10,560
Come on! Let's go, I wanna see
you hit them! Get off the ball!

294
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:21,354
Fourth and three and this <i>cetriolo</i>
is going for it? With that offensive line?

295
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,860
And why's my kid still
sitting on the bench?

296
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,444
The coach will let him in. Freshman rules,
they all get to play one quarter.

297
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,871
Pucillo in for Sposato!

298
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,745
Hey, Pucillo played already! Put my kid in!

299
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,835
It's the rules.

300
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,254
Hut!

301
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,465
I told you they wouldn't make it.

302
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,515
Are you fucking crazy, ref?
Are you fucking crazy? What?

303
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,176
What did you say? No!
Come here and say that to me!

304
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,604
- Romano. The periodontist.
- Get off the field, you asshole!

305
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,932
I'll rip your fucking heart out!

306
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,986
- Look. Anthony's going in.
- All right, A.J.!

307
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,159
Okay, defense, 41 stack.

308
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:12,989
- A.J.! Stick them, baby!
- Stick them! Do it!

309
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,450
- Fumble!
- Fumble!

310
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,214
Up! Up! Everybody up! Wait, get up.

311
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,934
Red ball.

312
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:54,489
It's A.J.! Yeah!
Yeah! Good job, A.J.!

313
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,040
Good job, good job. Yeah!

314
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,161
Hey! Hey!

315
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,622
That's my son.

316
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:09,215
You got a nose for the ball,
and that can't be taught.

317
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,014
The defensive lineman, you gotta
have leverage and footwork.

318
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:18,221
I remember staying after practice every day,
hitting that sled till my shoulder was raw.

319
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,435
But then you gotta reward yourself.

320
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,939
So I'll take you to Stewart's
and buy you some dogs.

321
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,111
I just wanna go home.

322
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,316
You should be riding high after what
you did on the field today. Come on!

323
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,744
Wanna play some Nintendo? You and me?

324
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,914
When are you gonna throw that
thing out the freaking window?

325
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:41,620
- Why?
- Well, all right. Play Nintendo.

326
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,207
Okay, let's go to Stewart's.

327
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,625
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

328
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,478
<i>- Yeah?
- I need you home, Tony, for dinner.</i>

329
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,027
- Now? It's our busiest season.
- I know.

330
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,983
It's important with Meadow gone that we not turn
into a family who eats standing at the counter.

331
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,117
All right. I'll be there.

332
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,411
<i>Pass</i> the potatoes, please.

333
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:24,503
Anthony? The potatoes?

334
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,086
- Sorry.
- Every night.

335
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,636
Go ahead. Pour yourself another glass.

336
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,557
You need good bones
for those open-field tackles.

337
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,476
So...
How was everybody's day today?

338
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,182
Busy.

339
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:53,616
So Nana was asking me today
where you might wanna go to college.

340
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,658
- I don't know.
- West Point.

341
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,287
- West Point?
- Yeah, that's what you said.

342
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,206
- No, I didn't.
- You did. You were sitting right there.

343
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:07,379
- You said either Harvard or West Point.
- No way I'd ever have said that. I'd never get in.

344
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:16,050
- Can we eat with the TV on?
- No.

345
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,638
I gotta take that. It's my busy season.

346
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,188
- Yeah?
- Mom there?

347
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,611
Hey, how are you?

348
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,654
Is Mom there?

349
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,984
- Yeah, she's here. How's school?
- Fine.

350
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,240
Is Mom there?

351
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:46,293
- Is that Meadow? Can I talk?
- Yeah, you can have her.

352
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,042
Hello?

353
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,254
Did you hear what happened
to Bobby Capodianco?

354
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,223
I feel bad. Taking your old room.

355
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,732
Don't worry about it.
You're all settled in.

356
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,984
You could sleep in your mother's room.

357
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,566
- Pass.
- Won't be for long.

358
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:24,453
Bill's children going to live with their
mother, end of week. I stay with him.

359
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,831
A few days is not a problem.
I'm glad I can help you out.

360
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:36,465
God knows my brother used to sleep
like a fucking dead man in there.

361
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,431
I'm sorry about how I behaved
at the cemetery.

362
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,135
Janice. I cannot give records back.

363
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,395
I wish you'd reconsider.

364
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:52,978
I know Livia left no will,
but possession is 9/10 of law.

365
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,563
Let's not descend into that.

366
00:30:55,854 --> 00:31:00,360
Feeling in me is,
she is not here to ask.

367
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:05,243
I know. I'm sorry.
Just this is an emotional issue for me.

368
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,792
I thought that if we had the chance
to talk one-on-one...

369
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:13,748
I could make you understand
how much those records mean to me.

370
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,593
Just promise me you'll sleep on it.

371
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,780
it was that bird!
It was that fucking bird in the window!

372
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,121
It was a coincidence.

373
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:51,327
I was making good jack at that betting parlor! I
was in the zone. Now everything turns to shit?

374
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:56,883
The bird thing is if it's in the house, flapping around.
And that's death, not bad luck.

375
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,928
- Will your mother loan me the money?
- She's still paying for her hysterectomy.

376
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,088
Where's that fucking bracelet I got you?

377
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:08,352
Why don't you get rid of
that stupid fucking Range Rover?

378
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,929
I'm sorry.

379
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,777
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

380
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:50,344
Janice! Janice! Janice!

381
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:02,155
Janice? Janice!

382
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,112
Fucking whore.

383
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,121
May she burn alive.

384
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,043
<i>Hello.</i>

385
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,804
Hello, it's Svetlana.

386
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,300
That slut sow stole my leg.

387
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:35,686
- The fuck is this? You owe me $300!
- I ain't using. Chris, I got mugged...

388
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,142
That's it! I want my money!
I want my money!

389
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,695
Fuck!

390
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,137
- Janice call yet?
- No.

391
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,426
Hello, Tony.

392
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:18,099
- How have you been?
- What is she doing here?

393
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:23,229
She brings old leg.
Piece of shit, made in Russia.

394
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,282
I have losted weight,
cannot wear it no more.

395
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,201
Only an hour, then starts to hurt.

396
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:34,782
- I'm getting married. Did you know?
- You told me.

397
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:41,588
- Wish you all the best.
- She put into my Sprite three Halcyon.

398
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,669
I miss you so much, Tony.

399
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,673
Why don't we just stick to the subject?
Your cousin's missing a leg.

400
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:52,633
$20,000. That's how much it cost,
leg she took.

401
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,562
Flex foot, latest technology
with vertical shock pylon.

402
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,810
Plus, calfskin boot.

403
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,026
Kenneth Cole.

404
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:10,364
You don't even want to talk to me anymore.
I don't see why we can't be friends.

405
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:15,410
You know what? I don't even know what I'm
doing here, except you worked it this way.

406
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,411
- We could have talked about this on the phone.
- I'm sorry, Tony.

407
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,496
It's not your fault.

408
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,419
Look, I'm sorry about your leg.

409
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,885
I'll reach Janice.

410
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,223
- Janice put any food in there?
- No, but I have orange juice.

411
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,601
Plus there are two Miller Genuines.

412
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:41,557
And your mother's meat delivery
still is coming every week.

413
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,140
<i>Southern California vs. Notre</i> Dame.

414
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:27,069
<i>We're in Indiana, where we have
a perfect football afternoon.</i>

415
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,691
- See you next week.
- Thank you.

416
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,488
Talk about good timing.
I was just gonna call you, Johnny.

417
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,275
Ch, yeah?

418
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:41,917
- Someplace we can talk in private?
- I'm kind of busy.

419
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,370
Gonna call.

420
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,713
Now you're busy.

421
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:51,510
- Something I could get you, Junior?
- No, I'm good.

422
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,927
It'll just take a minute.

423
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:01,641
Anthony, I told you
to wait in the car!

424
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,103
Listen to your old man, Anthony.

425
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,576
So, what were you gonna call me about?

426
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,323
I don't got it.

427
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,535
Weasely son of a bitch!

428
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,835
You got payments you can't make,
you come see me, work out a plan.

429
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:28,629
- I swear, I got a vendor owes me $300.
- Shut the fuck up!

430
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:34,345
Your wife's weekly order's all ready.
It's gotta be $30 worth of meat there.

431
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,263
Capocollo, chops
and a beautiful standing roast.

432
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,889
You gonna backtalk me?
Junior, get him over here.

433
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,891
No, wait, please!
What are you gonna do?

434
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,193
Anthony, what did I fucking tell you?!

435
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,996
What, your father never cut off
anybody's pinky?

436
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,830
That's traumatic for anyone
to witness, much less an 11-year-old.

437
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,710
Actually, it wasn't.

438
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,219
It was a rush,
if you wanna know the truth.

439
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,346
- You want me to delve?
- Go on.

440
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,615
Dinner's ready.

441
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,993
Come here.

442
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,034
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

443
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:03,183
What you seen today, Anthony,
a very sad thing.

444
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:08,480
You disobeyed your old man,
and I ought to give you the belt.

445
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,558
But I gotta say that...

446
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:18,733
a lot of boys your age would have
run like a little girl. But you stayed.

447
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:25,155
I know you like Mr. Satriale.
We all do. He's a lovely man.

448
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:29,167
The man is a gambler.

449
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:34,373
He got over his head in debt.
He owed me money and refused to pay.

450
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,128
He avoided me.

451
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:42,093
That's why you should never gamble,
Anthony.

452
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,682
What was I supposed to do?

453
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:54,269
That's my livelihood.
It's how I put food on the table.

454
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,859
You should never gamble, Anthony.

455
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:06,538
Johnny, dinner's ready! Anthony!
Janice, turn that off.

456
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,453
Let this be a lesson to you.

457
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,878
A man honors his debts.

458
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,923
Beautiful cut he sent.

459
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,256
You like it standing
with the bone in, Lee?

460
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,258
Look at those juices.

461
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,280
Go, Wayne Newton.

462
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,637
Can I have the end piece?

463
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,883
Johnny, let's eat while it's still hot.

464
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:15,307
You bet, baby. The lady loves her meat.

465
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,207
Four stitches. Ruined dinner.

466
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:37,208
- This was your first panic attack?
- Fainted, that's what my old man called it.

467
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:41,462
Obviously, we've finally touched
on something here.

468
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:46,843
What you witnessed that day,
where the meat came from.

469
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,099
And your mother's great pleasure in it.

470
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,393
It was the only time
she'd be in a good mood...

471
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,938
when the weekly meat delivery
from Satriale's showed up.

472
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:59,609
Or Fusco, the vegetable man, maybe.

473
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,521
Probably the only time
the old man got laid.

474
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,774
- Probably.
- Pretty sick, huh?

475
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,201
Getting turned on by free cold cuts?

476
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,114
Do you think that your mother
questioned why the meat was free?

477
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,495
The meat that was going
into her children's mouths?

478
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,922
I don't know. I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna think about any of this shit.

479
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:27,133
I'm sure it was too much for you then
too. That's why you short-circuited.

480
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:32,934
Puberty. Witnessing not only your
mother and father's sexuality...

481
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,980
but also the violence and blood
so closely connected...

482
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,642
to the food you were about to eat.

483
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,899
And also, the thought that someday...

484
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:48,324
you might be called upon
to bring home the bacon.

485
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:52,449
- Like your father.
- All this from a slice of <i>capocollo?</i>

486
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,742
Kind of like Proust's madeleines.

487
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,543
- What?
- Marcel Proust.

488
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:04,966
<i>Wrote</i> a <i>seven-volume</i> classic,
<i>Remembrance of Things Past.</i>

489
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,092
He took a bite of a madeleine.

490
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,886
It's a kind of tea cookie
he used to have as a child.

491
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:17,472
And that one bite unleashed
a tide of memories of his childhood...

492
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,522
and ultimately of his entire life.

493
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,603
This sounds very gay.
I hope you're not saying that.

494
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,688
No.

495
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:33,537
Understanding root causes will make you
less vulnerable to future episodes.

496
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,577
My fucking head is swimming here.

497
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:42,288
We're gonna have to stop.
It's a lot to process.

498
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,716
But we've made real progress today.
Good work.

499
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:52,681
And I'd really like you to write down
any thoughts or associations.

500
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,469
You see the left tackle?

501
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:01,352
He fakes inside,
and then gets a spin move on the guy.

502
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,605
Now he's charging the quarterback.
See?

503
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,983
- I thought the tailback had it.
- You gotta keep your eye on the ball.

504
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,898
The ball. That's what it's all about.

505
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,193
- Okay, I'm going.
- Where?

506
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:18,032
I gotta bring Med her biking shoes,
she's been missing my braciole.

507
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:21,792
- Can I come?
- Hey, we're watching the game.

508
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,088
I like going to the city.
I can catch the game in the car.

509
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,250
It's nice he wants to visit his sister.

510
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:33,172
- You're right. I'll get my shoes.
- Why don't you watch your game?

511
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,053
What, I shouldn't go now?

512
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:40,474
A.J., why don't you bring this stuff
out to the car?

513
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:51,822
This is about Sambo, right?
I'm paying for that goddamn college.

514
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:56,824
I don't know what's going on. But if you wanna
make a big scene at your daughter's new college...

515
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:01,158
then comb your hair and come right along.
Embarrass her.

516
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,790
Alienate her. Or better yet, cut her off.

517
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:09,545
Let her drop out and go to a state
school. Or maybe move back in here.

518
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:18,384
I was just trying to protect her from herself.
And I'll do that till the day I die.

519
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:26,482
I'm not gonna tell you you can't come.
She's your daughter.

520
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,814
I'll probably watch the game.

521
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:53,342
Come on, find the open man!

522
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,012
You gotta throw the ball.

523
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,673
Let it rip, already!

524
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:05,267
<i>Garcia handing off
at the 40-yard line across to the 43.</i>

525
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:09,476
I got your favorite
Santa Barbara olives.

526
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,695
Leave me the fuck alone.

527
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:24,833
Chicken shit cocksuckers. Go for the touchdown.
I need another five points to cover the spread.

528
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,413
Hi. Pardon me.

529
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,667
Here she is. Come on. Meadow!

530
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,549
We're here.

531
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,139
- Hi.
- Hi.

532
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:44,140
- This is my mom and my little brother, A.J.
- Hey.

533
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:48,314
- Dad didn't come?
- No, he didn't. Did you want him to?

534
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,901
- Noah, would you mind?
- Noah told me what Dad said to him.

535
00:46:56,105 --> 00:47:01,327
- It's out in the open, so fuck this.
- Let's watch the latrine-lip.

536
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,784
Oh, well, what'd Dad say?

537
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:09,745
Anthony, would you go downstairs and wait for me?
I would like to talk to your sister.

538
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,757
- Oh, I know what he said.
- Go.

539
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:21,552
I'm always being sent away.
Why do I bother going anywhere?

540
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,019
- What did your father say?
- Like he didn't tell you. Please.

541
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,854
- Well, believe what you like...
- He called Noah things that are so ugly...

542
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,856
I can't even repeat it.

543
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:40,032
- You're right. There's no excuse.
- He's lucky I didn't punch his fucking lights out.

544
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:44,453
- Because you're a civilized person.
- So this was gonna be a big drama?

545
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,703
You wanted your father to come here for what?
To subject your friend to this again?

546
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,544
Wait. So I'm in the wrong?

547
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,997
The rest of the world
should work around...

548
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:59,044
his racist, retrograde,
fucking-asshole personality?

549
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:04,223
He comes from a place and a time
where he thinks it's in your best interest.

550
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:08,018
New Jersey? The third millennium?

551
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,642
Noah, I'm sure you must know
what I'm talking about.

552
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:14,776
Coming from a racially-mixed marriage
must have been a difficult burden.

553
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:19,443
Don't slam his family background.
Look what you wound up in!

554
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,742
Noah, would you excuse us a moment?
I want a word with my daughter.

555
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:27,197
I'm not going anywhere
unless she wants me to.

556
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:31,167
It's okay. I'll be up in a little while.

557
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,815
I would hate to think you're airing
your family's business in public.

558
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:02,653
Noah's not stupid.
It took him a while, but he caught on.

559
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:05,076
But he keeps his opinions to himself.

560
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:10,081
Unlike some people,
he's brilliant and sensitive.

561
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,954
I'll keep my mouth shut.

562
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:16,163
Anything I say to you
or your father will just fuel this.

563
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,419
I'm not gonna stop seeing Noah.

564
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:25,763
I put your helmet in there and your padded shorts.
Though I'd rather you not bike in the city.

565
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,513
If you must know, I'm going to
Litchfield, Connecticut...

566
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:35,603
to the weekend home of Noah's
parents' friends, who work at NBC.

567
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,745
But Hegel is talking about...

568
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,350
- Svetlana, get out here!
- Oh, hi.

569
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,557
You must be the famous Bill.
It's moving day, huh?

570
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:22,521
Oh, I didn't think you would have
the nerve to show your face to me.

571
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:27,529
- Why? What happened? What's wrong?
- Don't bullshit me. Where is my leg?

572
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:32,284
- Your leg? Oh, yeah, where's your...?
- I know you took it.

573
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,287
That's preposterous.
What possible use would I have for it?

574
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:40,247
Because you think that will make me
give records back, but you are wrong.

575
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,958
If you see some karmic connection
between your taking my mother's records...

576
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,424
and the disappearance of your leg, wow!

577
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:52,134
The records return, and so does
the leg. I can see how you got there.

578
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,144
I don't know how you can
live with yourself.

579
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:58,063
Bill, don't waste breath.

580
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:02,735
This cunt is gonna be sorry
she ever fuck with me.

581
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:10,076
You better hope you have all your shit
because I'm calling the locksmith.

582
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,917
Doc. Where's Dino?

583
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,291
- They got him for possession.
- Shit.

584
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,579
What do you care?

585
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,588
He mentioned that job over at Rutgers.
A coffeehouse.

586
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:31,093
Coffeehouse, shit. We were gonna
jack a benefit concert there tonight.

587
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,350
- Jewel and Amnesty International.
- You know the details?

588
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,682
- Can you make it work without Dino?
- It was my fucking idea.

589
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,364
I know this must be hard for you, Anthony.

590
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:56,664
Your sister off at college,
you here at home all by yourself with us.

591
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,117
But it won't be for long.

592
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:02,920
Pretty soon, you'll be heading
off to college yourself.

593
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:07,133
- I don't think I'm gonna go.
- What, college? Of course you will.

594
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,049
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

595
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:16,180
There's so many people there,
all smarter than me. A bunch of freaks.

596
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,056
What?

597
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,733
You're not excused!

598
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:29,814
- You're punished!
- He's all right.

599
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:42,160
Under no circumstances move this car
or your life will not be worth shit.

600
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:45,167
- Get me Jewel's autograph.
- You're a good kid.

601
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,333
I'll bring you her underpants.

602
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,935
- All goes in there, no one gets shot.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

603
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:15,659
- You're robbing a benefit concert.
- Is that all there is?

604
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,286
I'll fucking blow your head off!

605
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:21,745
- Most people used student cards.
- Hey! What's going on, you?

606
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,868
Say one word on that fucking thing
and you're dead!

607
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,058
Hit it!

608
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,003
There's your money.

609
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:16,337
- You ought to hit a tanning salon.
- I had a late night.

610
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:21,763
You gotta give that shit a rest.
A man needs his seven hours to keep sharp.

611
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:27,189
This was work. Little Jackie hyped us
to a score at Rutgers, not bad.

612
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,484
What's the matter, Chrissy?
Tell Uncle Paulie.

613
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:34,780
This being made isn't like I thought.
A lot of responsibilities.

614
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:38,988
- Fucking A. What did you think?
- You're only as smart as the week's lines.

615
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,697
One false move and you spend your time
chasing it, instead of making money.

616
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:46,455
Welcome to the NFL, rookie.
Go home, get some sleep.

617
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,127
Tomorrow's a new day.

618
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:03,513
Sorry I'm late. I had to make a few stops.

619
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:08,064
- Have a smelt.
- No.

620
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,107
We had a very good week
this week, boss.

621
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:16,109
- How's our little friend doing?
- He had a few knocks...

622
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,444
but it came out all right.

623
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:21,360
Wait'll he hears the policy
on newly-made guys.

624
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,697
They're subject to strip search
for wires and shit.

625
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,203
He'll love that.

626
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:32,163
He had to augment his kick with a stickup
at Rutgers tittle Jackie put him onto.

627
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,669
Jackie Aprile?

628
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,011
- He did the thing in the papers?
- Don't worry. He was only the wheel man.

629
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:44,889
- I told Christopher to leave him the fuck out.
- I'm just telling you what I know.

630
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:03,364
Don't be too hard on Chrissy.
He's having a hard enough time as it is.

631
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:06,869
Yeah, but what's wrong with the kid?
When's he gonna grow up?

632
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,201
- Where's Soprano?
- Here.

633
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:16,633
Guys, take a good look at Soprano here
and remember his performance last week.

634
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:21,554
Soprano's on the sidelines three whole quarters, waiting.
But does his mind go soft?

635
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:25,223
No. Does his fire go out? Heck, no.

636
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,268
When the call came,
he brought his A game.

637
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,563
This young man may have a big future.
He may be a leader.

638
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:36,731
And that's what it takes. And that's
why I'm naming him defensive captain.

639
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:45,327
All right! All right. So let's hit
those showers, one thought in mind...

640
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,497
Soprano! Soprano, you all right?
