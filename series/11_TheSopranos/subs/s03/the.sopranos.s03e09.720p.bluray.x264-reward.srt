2
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,486
Anybody home?

3
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,406
Hello?

4
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,871
- What's this?
- What's this?

5
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,559
Oh, my God. Tony.

6
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,305
Here, allow me.

7
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,895
Happy birthday.

8
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,481
Ohhh.

9
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,826
Opps.

10
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,501
What?

11
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,844
- Look at the ring your father gave me.
- I already saw it.

12
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,381
I was gonna wrap it,
but it's wasteful.

13
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,516
Thank you, young man.

14
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,890
The Matrix. l haven't seen it yet.

15
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,442
Right up her alley.

16
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,644
Hello?

17
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,775
Happy birthday, Mama.

18
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,528
What are you doing here?

19
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:15,655
- Nice to see you too.
- Sorry, I'm just surprised to see you.

20
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,204
See what your father got me?

21
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,460
Big ring.

22
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,547
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God. So many gifts.

23
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,342
"A day of pampering
at the Bella Donna Day Spa."

24
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:38,011
It's in Soho. It's awesome.
Massage, mud treatment, everything.

25
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,730
We can go together.
I put it on your credit card.

26
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,192
- Twelve years. This club was nothing.
- Give him a drink.

27
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,866
- What do you drink, Rocco?
- Johnny Black.

28
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,619
- This place was a shithole.
- You could use some help.

29
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:01,784
- Make this place into 21st century.
- Yeah, it's permanently 1987 in here.

30
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,044
Goddamn Vikings.

31
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,789
Nobody misses the extra point.

32
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,918
That's all he had to do.
One little kick and now I'm ruined?

33
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,387
No bitch to me.

34
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,674
Bet with your head, no over it.

35
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,769
You're still a partner.
You got a problem?

36
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,191
- One, two, three.
- Happy birthday

37
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,902
I'll get it.

38
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,407
- Did you invite a stray dog?
- You short of food?

39
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:40,031
- Sorry I'm late.
- We didn't know you were coming.

40
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,414
- Meadow said it's Carmela's birthday.
- It's nice of you.

41
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,999
- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. DeAngelis.
- Jackie.

42
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,460
- Have you heard the good news?
- We met Thanksgiving.

43
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,882
- Happy birthday.
- You didn't have to.

44
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,636
I'll put it on ice in a minute.
Thank you, sir.

45
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,347
Come on. The wax is melting here.

46
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,526
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

47
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,481
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

48
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,943
<i>Happy birthday, Carmela</i>

49
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:22,247
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

50
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,539
I heard you got made
defensive captain.

51
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,335
I have two recovered fumbles.
Almost scored with one.

52
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:38,889
Excellent. I played linebacker
for Boonton. I was All County.

53
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,808
- Wow.
- Maybe we could work out together.

54
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:46,017
Sure. You should come to the game
Tuesday. It's the last one.

55
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:50,101
- We were supposed to play last month.
- I'll be there.

56
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,521
I wanna come too.
My brother's football game.

57
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,908
No champagne.
The Lord doesn't want us to drink.

58
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,909
- Didn't Jesus drink wine?
- He was Jesus. We can't compare.

59
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,454
Who invented these things?

60
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,715
Mom, can I sleep at Egon's
if I'm in bed by 1?

61
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,253
I got one for you
for when you're at the market.

62
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,638
Lights out by 1, in bed by 12.

63
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,450
Be careful.

64
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,954
- I smell fish.
- We're near the ocean.

65
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,457
Now I smell piss.

66
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,552
Okay.

67
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,891
- What?
- It's yours.

68
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,810
What is?

69
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,317
The Lollipop in Long Branch.
This is your club.

70
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,908
I'm a partner here, me and Furio.
We'll be silent.

71
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,243
You'll be the owner/manager.

72
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:29,041
You book the bands, find the talent,
whatever you want to do. It's yours.

73
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,503
Oh, my God.

74
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,126
I can't believe it.

75
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:44,674
You'll make this place the biggest
Jersey club since the Stoned Pony.

76
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:50,104
Thank you, Christopher.
I'm so excited.

77
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,652
- Can we change the name?
- Whatever you want, baby.

78
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,483
This is Rocco. He works for you.

79
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,248
The ring looks beautiful on you.

80
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,959
It is gorgeous.

81
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,885
- Anything you need to tell me?
- About the ring?

82
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,054
I don't know.

83
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,396
- You didn't buy that little car.
- The Mercedes?

84
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:38,815
- I'd look like a douche bag.
- Jean calls those mid-life crisis cars.

85
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,104
What the fuck does she know?

86
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,785
<i>- Is this 1726 Pearl Avenue?</i>
- No.

87
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:55,206
<i>- Is Pearl Avenue in this neighborhood?
- L don't know.</i>

88
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,539
<i>Do you know a man
by the name of La Fong?</i>

89
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,291
Hello? Hey, Ro.

90
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,261
No, Jackie took Meadow to the movies.

91
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,639
He said not late.

92
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,724
All right. Fine.

93
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,988
What?

94
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,736
I'm not thrilled about this thing
with Jackie and Meadow.

95
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,201
I think she came home
so they could go out.

96
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,168
So what? He's a good kid.
Comes from good stock.

97
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:41,503
He's on his best behavior. I don't
picture Meadow with someone like him.

98
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,796
Someone like him?

99
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,386
He's one of us.

100
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:51,471
Were you happy when she was with
Jamal Ginsberg, the Hasidic homeboy?

101
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,181
Scraped through that
by the skin of our ass.

102
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,313
I just don't want her to miss
any opportunities.

103
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,813
She should be at the museum
in her free time.

104
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,694
Not watching TV.

105
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:11,328
You'd rather she look at soup cans
than be close to home?

106
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,037
I don't know.

107
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,581
Well, you talk to her,
and I'll talk to Jackie Jr.

108
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,581
Here's your Edgar Allan Poe paper.

109
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,960
- You did it already?
- No problem.

110
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,544
Thanks.

111
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:34,427
I would've done it. I was gonna do it.
I just couldn't get through the books.

112
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,979
I never should've took
Literature of Obsession.

113
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,189
I owe you big time.

114
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,728
Thanks.

115
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,037
- How can I repay you?
- I don't know.

116
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,374
Why don't you surprise me?

117
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,746
<i>On your mark, get set, go!</i>

118
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,256
- I kicked your ass.
- You cheat.

119
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,800
Oh, my eye.

120
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,474
There's too much chlorine.
I swallowed some water.

121
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,811
- You girls see me?
- Yeah, you were cheating.

122
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,612
I'm fucking starving.

123
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:32,610
Hey, guys! We got Mr. Goodwin's
office open. Check it out.

124
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,579
Let's go for it.

125
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,840
Hey, everybody.

126
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,429
Shit!

127
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,690
All right! Come on, let's go!

128
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,440
Don't cut your feet!

129
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,364
<i>- Hey, it's Sunday morning and...</i>
- Good <i>morning.</i>

130
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,074
- Hello.
- Morning.

131
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,290
- Did Jackie call?
- He's with your brother.

132
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,224
So I've been thinking about a car.

133
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,397
- I knew I'd get hit up on this trip.
- You buy sapphires...

134
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,190
but a student has to take the bus?

135
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,868
What do you need a car for?

136
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,456
It'd be nice to hop in a car
and come have dinner with you.

137
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,582
They steal cars in New York.
Parking is impossible...

138
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:11,755
- The bus gets you here in 45 minutes.
- I'm not asking for anything fancy.

139
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:16,842
- Could've had a car last year.
- Eric's car? Is that a sick joke?

140
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,634
His father's now
in a mental health facility.

141
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,472
See how this semester goes.
You have a lot of work to do.

142
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,440
Concentrate on that.

143
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,816
I am concentrating on that!
Christ, you're a broken record!

144
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,819
- Take it down a notch.
- God.

145
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:39,410
We wanna make sure you take
advantage of all the city offers.

146
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,988
Culturally, socially...

147
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,619
educationally.

148
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,006
Right before the snap,
the ball is still.

149
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:57,258
But the qb's eyes can tell you
whether he'll <i>pass</i> or hand it off.

150
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:02,475
It happens in a split second.
But you can learn what his habits are.

151
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,307
Once you know these habits,
he's fucked.

152
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,106
Hey.

153
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,770
Good morning.

154
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,771
- A.J., try what I told you.
- I will. Thanks, Jackie.

155
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,667
The wall of pride.
What kind of animals...?

156
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,468
They didn't steal anything.
They just did a number on the place.

157
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,470
They left this.

158
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,818
You make this pizza?

159
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,448
- Who made this?
- We're asking you.

160
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,906
This your store logo, sir?

161
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,576
- That's my box.
- It was at a crime scene.

162
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,831
My pizza never hurt nobody.
You no find any bacteria here.

163
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,338
Kids broke into the high school.
They left this.

164
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:22,639
- Tell me who, I'll kick their asses.
- I got it, Pop.

165
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,888
That's a custom job.

166
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,141
Meatball, pepperoni, sausage
peppers, onions...

167
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,182
- ...extra mozzarella...
- This pie fit a pattern?

168
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,401
- Anyone order this regularly?
- Only one.

169
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,395
- Who?
- I'd rather not say.

170
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:41,908
- Tell me! I find these bastards!
- Pop, go in the back. Go ahead.

171
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,613
- Sir.
- Yes, officer?

172
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:48,540
Word to the wise. Technically,
you're an accessory after the fact.

173
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:53,912
I cannot believe this.
Do you know how serious this is?

174
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,422
Do you?

175
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,592
- Answer me right now.
- Yes.

176
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,045
- Yes, what?
- I know it's serious.

177
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,051
So why did you do it?

178
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,016
- I don't know.
- Why did you do it?

179
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,850
Do you hate the school
or have a problem with someone?

180
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,772
- No.
- Then why?

181
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,228
It just happened.

182
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:19,688
We went in as a goof.
Someone threw something in the pool.

183
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,576
A couple of guys started
throwing stuff in. We just did it.

184
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:29,786
And if they were jumping off a bridge,
would you just do that too?

185
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,866
No.

186
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,704
What are you doing here?

187
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,378
- Answer your father.
- I got sent home.

188
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,338
Why?

189
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,213
Why?

190
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,057
I got in trouble.

191
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:52,471
Your son broke into his school
and vandalized the pool.

192
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:57,525
- How do you vandalize a pool?
- They threw stuff in, broke things.

193
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,353
- Why'd you do that?
- Screwing around.

194
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,155
On your mother's birthday?

195
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:08,203
- It wasn't. It was after midnight.
- What are you, fucking stupid? Huh?

196
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,705
- So you're suspended?
- I don't know.

197
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,286
This is serious.
He may be expelled.

198
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,540
- What'd they say?
- Nothing. They sent me home.

199
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,090
- You have to go see the principal.
- On your mother's birthday.

200
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,340
They're gonna call you.

201
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,469
Just when everything
was going good, huh?

202
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,926
You're gonna miss the big game.

203
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,600
You're screwing everything up.
Your football career down the drain!

204
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,480
- Wow.
- There it is.

205
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,566
- Beautiful ring.
- I know.

206
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,821
- Gorgeous, Carm.
- I want you ladies to try this.

207
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,657
Mozzarella? I was gonna
get the hot <i>antipasto.</i>

208
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:59,712
It's not mozzarella. This is burrata.
I had it flown in from Italy.

209
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,754
It's more subtle than mozzarella,
with a nutty flavor.

210
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,006
- Thanks.
- I'm not big on nuts.

211
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,180
A little pepper? Carm, on your half?

212
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,890
Crisp beans and smooth cheese.

213
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,440
- No, I'm fine.
<i>- Buon</i> appetito.

214
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,857
Tastes like mozzarella
and string beans. You have it, Carm.

215
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,908
<i>I want the hot antipasto.</i>

216
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:35,866
I'd like to make a toast. To the
friendship between our two children.

217
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,790
I'm happy to see my son
spending time with Meadow.

218
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,751
She'll be a good influence on him.

219
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:48,845
- You did a great job. She's wonderful.
- Well, thank you. Salute.

220
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:56,182
It's nice to see our families united.
Like with Ralphie.

221
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:01,312
He goes on and on about Tony.
He's happy to be getting closer to him.

222
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:06,146
- Ralph is a real find, hang on to him.
- It was tough at first.

223
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:11,326
I was afraid everyone was gonna think
that I didn't mourn Jack enough.

224
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,155
Oh, Artie!

225
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:21,040
He's under a lot of stress.
I hear Charmaine hired a lawyer.

226
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,916
Divorce?

227
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,334
It's funny, but you think, you know...

228
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:32,885
the men in our lives have been,
you know what, and we stay together.

229
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,221
And here's Artie, a regular guy,
hardworking...

230
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,012
<i>his marriage is in the pisciatoio.</i>

231
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:44,184
- You can push a man only so far.
- True. Very true.

232
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:58,115
If you wait inside for me,
I'll be in there in a second. Okay?

233
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,162
Hello.

234
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,796
- Who's the douche bag?
- He buys a new 600 for me every year.

235
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,885
- This was last year.
- Nice.

236
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,180
You been shopping?

237
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,350
It's for you.

238
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,493
- It's very beautiful.
- So are you.

239
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,700
What are my chances
of kidnapping you for the afternoon?

240
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,124
- I'm closing on a car.
- Come on.

241
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,127
Let Hans and Franz do the paperwork.
I'm going nuts thinking about you.

242
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,463
I've gotta work.

243
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,354
- Trabajar?
- Come on...

244
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,816
I'll take you anywhere you want.

245
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:12,526
The Pierre, Sherry Netherlands.
Come on, anywhere you wanna go.

246
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,318
You wanna go to the zoo?

247
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,530
- The zoo?
- Yeah.

248
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,205
- I try to get there once a year.
- We'll go.

249
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,545
I'll call you.

250
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:40,509
Amazing thing about snakes is that
they reproduce spontaneously.

251
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,013
What do you mean?

252
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,937
They have male and female
sex organs.

253
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,853
Somebody you don't trust,
you call a snake.

254
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,442
How can you trust a guy who can
literally go fuck themselves?

255
00:21:54,772 --> 00:22:00,370
Don't you think that expression came
from when the snake tempted Eve?

256
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,705
Hey, snakes
were fucking themselves...

257
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,707
long before Adam and Eve
showed up, T.

258
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,471
- How you doing?
- All right.

259
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,518
Hey, Jackie, thanks for coming by.
How are you?

260
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,476
Have a seat. Want something to drink?

261
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,940
- What are you having?
- Red wine.

262
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,606
<i>- I'll</i> get some slices. Want anything?
- Yeah, get me the usual.

263
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,610
- Jackie, you want something?
- No, thanks.

264
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,752
- You're taking Meadow out tonight.
- Yeah.

265
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,589
- Where?
- A place called Chez Josephine.

266
00:22:54,206 --> 00:23:00,179
They have live piano music.
Harry Connick Jr. used to play there.

267
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,799
A friend of mine is the bartender.

268
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,511
- Don't you two got class?
- She's got a 2:00. I'm off.

269
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,893
How many days off they give you
at Rutgers?

270
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,568
I got class three days a week.

271
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,279
Listen...

272
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,573
I think you're a good kid.

273
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,993
You show respect
and come from a good family.

274
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,570
Thanks.

275
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,289
As far <i>as</i> my daughter goes...

276
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,000
you know I want the best for her.

277
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,545
I'm gonna be very protective over her.

278
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,040
- You understand, right?
- Of course.

279
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:41,596
If you wanna spend time with her,
I want the best from you in school.

280
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,715
- Yeah, right. I know it...
- Shut up.

281
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,888
Listen to me.

282
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:53,145
I know I've been saying this to you
all along, but now it's different.

283
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,269
- Understand?
- I just got an A on a paper.

284
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,691
You did?

285
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:03,614
Edgar Allan Poe. Good writer,
what a fucking nut job.

286
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,914
He's the guy who did all
the Vincent Price shit, right?

287
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:12,327
He smoked opium and married
his cousin. He was from the Bronx.

288
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,247
- So you got an A, huh?
- I'm doing good, Tony.

289
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,004
Let's keep it that way.

290
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,797
- Keep your father in mind.
- I will.

291
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,347
Listen...

292
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,978
here.

293
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,191
- Have some dessert on me.
- That's okay.

294
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,564
Take it.

295
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:43,449
- Don't keep her out too late.
- I won't. Thanks, Tony.

296
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,005
Welcome, everybody,
to opening night at Crazy Horse.

297
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:03,428
I'm excited to have, from U-Dub,
our very first band.

298
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:08,425
Please welcome the Miami Relatives!

299
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,684
- What do you think?
- What?

300
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,433
- What do you think?
- I can't hear a word you say.

301
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,231
Tony and Sil couldn't make it,
but this is from us. Congratulations.

302
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,784
- Do you like the band?
- What?

303
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,199
How do you like the band?

304
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:26,632
- Matush, you don't got the Maseratis?
- Versace. You try it yet?

305
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,172
No, I liked the Maserati.

306
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:34,473
- Try the Versace, you won't be sorry.
- All right, give me four.

307
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:39,349
- What's up?!
- Come on. Let's go. Out.

308
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,145
I got friends here, man!
Let me call my man Carlo!

309
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,983
I see you here again,
I'm gonna crack your head.

310
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,822
Call Carlo!

311
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:03,547
You have to wonder
what they're thinking.

312
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:08,469
They're thinking, "Madonna,
you guys ever smell yourselves?"

313
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,054
You're probably right, huh?

314
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,594
Except for you.

315
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:17,345
What you got on
even a baboon would love.

316
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,848
The eyes are innocent.

317
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,901
Like a baby's.

318
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,529
Yeah, he could innocently
maul you into ten pieces.

319
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,034
Usually they just engage
in what's called threat behavior.

320
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:36,580
Because they did their mauling.
Now they just give the look.

321
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,830
<i>Malocchio.</i>

322
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:44,498
You know why they're primates?
They groom each other.

323
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,090
That I like.

324
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,129
What's this?

325
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,052
It's a Tibetan talisman
for protection.

326
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,928
I knew it. I knew there
had to be something.

327
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,434
What?

328
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:06,064
- What's wrong? It's a Buddhist symbol.
- My sister was a Buddhist.

329
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,982
- She's a wack job.
- I see, so I gotta be a wack job too?

330
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,860
It is a little wacky.
What's wrong with Catholicism?

331
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,993
Which you fucking practice
every fucking day, I'm sure.

332
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:22,626
So I pray a little,
and I meditate in the morning.

333
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:27,790
It clears my mind and my heart
for the day.

334
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:32,796
A Buddhist selling $150,000 cars.

335
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:38,560
Life is suffering.

336
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,772
But the Buddha preached participation
in the sorrows of the world.

337
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:48,861
You make a sale, you don't make
a sale, it's a tiny little thing.

338
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,126
- What's so funny?
- You came here.

339
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,170
- What, the zoo?
- I said zoo and you came.

340
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:11,126
What's this, a fucking head-trip now?
Huh? Nice.

341
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,926
Sort of.

342
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,551
- I don't like that.
- You're very sweet.

343
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,759
You came.

344
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,934
I'm crazy about you.

345
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:29,860
- You know that, don't you?
- I never met anybody like you.

346
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:40,412
Okay, class, come this way.
Stay together, kids. Come on.

347
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,453
We're gonna see some tigers.

348
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,630
- Do you take your kids to the zoo?
- Yeah.

349
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,423
And now we're here.

350
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,294
See you later.

351
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,467
- Who was that?
- My hard-on.

352
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:07,890
Between the Buddhism
and talk about the family, poor you.

353
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,773
Let me see if it's really gone.

354
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,692
You lie.

355
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,465
- You know snakes can fuck themselves?
- Give me your hand.

356
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,757
Oh, Jesus Christ.

357
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,251
- Don't move.
- What?

358
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,294
See...

359
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,213
if you...

360
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,083
can not...

361
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,267
So, what happened?

362
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:37,272
He was at the Crazy Horse
and some zip told my man:

363
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,439
New management, new rules.

364
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,825
So I asked around. I heard about
some guy, Multi-something.

365
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,621
Some guy in the Soprano family
was running things. I go, "Whoa!"

366
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,039
- Chris Moltisanti.
- Yeah.

367
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,708
I know Chris.

368
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,797
- What's your name again?
- Matush.

369
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,221
Normally I would never get involved
with a stranger.

370
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,516
If Carlo here is vouching for you...

371
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,645
- I'm willing to make an exception.
- Thank you.

372
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,609
What'd I tell you?

373
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:22,275
- You know who my father was?
- The golfer? U.S. Open?

374
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,739
Chris and me are associates.
You got nothing to worry about.

375
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:32,163
I'll call Carlo in a couple days.

376
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,708
Meeting over.

377
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:40,634
Verbum Dei has a zero tolerance
policy in cases of vandalism.

378
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:44,255
It demands the expulsion
of the offending student.

379
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,215
I told him.

380
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,343
- You see?
- Having said that...

381
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,938
In this case,
after much deliberation...

382
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,812
we decided upon
a suspended sentence.

383
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,900
This has been arrived at...

384
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:02,652
based on his academic performance.
And his involvement in sports.

385
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,320
- His academic performance?
- He's brought his GPA to a C-minus.

386
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,664
- What is the punishment?
- We suggest and hope...

387
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,874
it's meted out parentally.

388
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:17,124
- So it's not exactly zero tolerance.
- Each child is special.

389
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:22,759
- That's a principle of this school.
- Well, what about detention?

390
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,509
A lawsuit forced us
to eliminate detention.

391
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,804
- He's off the football team, right?
- No.

392
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,142
Studies at Harvard
have shown that boys...

393
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:41,605
have success in avoiding pitfalls
when they remain involved in sport.

394
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,866
You better wipe that smile
off your face.

395
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,237
I told him he'd be off the team.

396
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:54,208
- You know, now you're kind of...
- Undermining the...

397
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:59,584
It's not only skill Anthony has shown
on the field, it's leadership as well.

398
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:06,512
We feel it's against his interests to
sever his relationship with the squad.

399
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:11,517
- Well, if you think that's best.
- However...

400
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:16,438
I can't say this strongly enough.
If there is one more infraction...

401
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:22,357
the sentence will go into effect
and Anthony will be expelled.

402
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,199
- Do you understand this, Anthony?
- Yes.

403
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:31,529
- You completely sold us out in there.
- What'd I do?

404
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,115
They're not punishing him,
and you went along.

405
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,992
I suggested detention.

406
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:41,543
That was a charade so the football
team can win the big game.

407
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,918
We've been waiting for years
for him to get off the couch.

408
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:50,597
We should keep this in the family.
He ain't getting off that easy.

409
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:54,385
Overall it's been a good two weeks.

410
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:58,313
- What about the nightmares?
- None.

411
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:05,779
I had a dream where I lit
the big torch at the Olympics.

412
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,116
- What do you think that represented?
- Well...

413
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,990
work has been good.

414
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,121
My sales are way up.

415
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,954
And my performance
has been commended...

416
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,211
by Mercedes-Benz USA
with a plaque.

417
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:26,213
- What's going on with your social life?
- Nothing.

418
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,178
Right now.

419
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,474
But it's okay.

420
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:42,232
What I'm going to say is a little
delicate, but I think it's important.

421
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:47,233
When you called me last week
to cancel, I heard a man's voice.

422
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,447
My car broke down.

423
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,497
It could've been the mechanic.

424
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,749
I see.

425
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:11,632
- I'm offended you put it that way.
- Offended? Why?

426
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,803
Well, I don't pay you
to be under your surveillance.

427
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,019
How dare you?

428
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:24,817
You came to me after attempting
suicide over the breakup with Barry.

429
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:29,154
I ask you because
you're under my care.

430
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,862
It's unprofessional
to confront me this way.

431
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,115
Suicide is something
I take very seriously.

432
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,624
The doctor in the ER said
it was only suicidal ideation.

433
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:44,874
- Is he trained to give those diagnoses?
- My car broke down.

434
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,122
Fine.

435
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:52,211
<i>- I'll</i> believe you.
- Thank you.

436
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,010
- To the Crazy Horse, <i>buona</i> fortuna.
- Salute.

437
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,061
Club business ain't easy, I tell you.

438
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:09,903
With the Bing, everybody only sees
the glitz and glamour.

439
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,356
Nobody knows what goes into it.

440
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,529
There's a lot to deal with, I know.

441
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,578
See, it's one thing to have a bar.

442
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,619
When you're dealing
with performers...

443
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:27,125
I don't care if it's music, tits,
fire-eaters. It's a whole other game.

444
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:32,376
Ultimately you're relying on them
to get the customers in...

445
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,048
and spend money.

446
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,141
All right. I'll take it upstairs.

447
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,435
- Jackie, how are you?
- All right.

448
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:56,407
- How you doing?
- Somebody's sitting there.

449
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,955
7 and 7 and whatever my friend wants.

450
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,210
I'm good.

451
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,499
- Just 7 and 7.
- Okay.

452
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,292
Congrats on the club.

453
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,217
I admire your progress
since you got your button.

454
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,054
I wanted to have a sit down
with you about a friend.

455
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,559
- When did you wanna do this?
- Now.

456
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,142
Now's okay to chat,
not a sit down.

457
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:36,612
This friend was moving X at the club,
and he got thrown out on his ass.

458
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,442
And?

459
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:45,123
I wanted to ask you, as a favor, to
let him keep a little action going on.

460
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:51,918
- You get a piece of what he does.
- X is federal territory now.

461
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,710
- I don't want it in my club.
- It would mean a lot to me.

462
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:01,348
You've got a lot of balls.
Did you hear what I said?

463
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,679
What'd I say?

464
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,894
- No.
- End of chat.

465
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,104
Okay, thanks.

466
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:35,086
- It's all taken care of.
- Thanks, man.

467
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:40,592
You just can't do it in the club. Have
your customers meet you outside.

468
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:46,222
- Outside where?
- Use your car. Or their car.

469
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,976
Find an alley...
I gotta think it all out for you?

470
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,602
That's gonna make things harder.

471
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:57,904
This all happens for a good reason.
Beyond anything you could know.

472
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:06,364
In time, everything will be revealed.
You'll be back inside. Don't worry.

473
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:11,293
If that's the way it is,
that's the way it is. I'll see you.

474
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,163
Aren't you forgetting something?

475
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,164
What?

476
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,256
I'm looking out for you here.
I gotta eat too, right?

477
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:24,006
Yeah, sure. I'll take care of you.

478
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:28,343
- I'll be by every Sunday.
- Cool.

479
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:41,899
Your father and I
discussed your punishment.

480
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,401
You're grounded for a month.

481
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,537
No Nintendo, no DVDs,
no skateboards.

482
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,035
- No computer.
- I use it for school.

483
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,042
- Get the typewriter.
- Dad threw it out.

484
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,630
Then use a pen.
It worked for Einstein.

485
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,551
And you're gonna work your ass
off around here.

486
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,053
- Okay.
- You got no choice.

487
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:09,552
- Go to the garage and organize it.
- Jackie Jr. did that the other day.

488
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,605
See what I'm saying about him?

489
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,605
Take a lesson from Jackie
and get your act together.

490
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,939
Kid's pre-med at Rutgers,
he finds time to help out.

491
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:25,780
- And you're going to clean the gutters.
- What gutters?

492
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,327
- On the roof.
- Where?

493
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,329
- On the edge. They collect water.
- What?

494
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,744
- Don't get smart!
- I don't know.

495
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,335
The drainpipes for the rain?

496
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,413
Come here.

497
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,716
- Very good. A lady of discerning taste.
- Come on!

498
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,387
- I told you once.
- Jackie said <i>as</i> long as I stay...

499
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:53,808
- Don't fucking name-drop me!
- We're gonna take a walk.

500
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,064
Well, right arm's still good. No?

501
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,940
You think that's funny?

502
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,568
Sorry.

503
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:11,697
- Tell me what happened.
- I did like you said. I stayed outside.

504
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,908
You must've disrespected them
or something.

505
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,581
I didn't do fuck!

506
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,005
Did you mention
that I sat down with Chris?

507
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,091
They didn't give a shit.

508
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,920
I don't think they like you.

509
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,632
I gotta pee.

510
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,560
Can you give me the thing?

511
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,817
Get the nurse to help you.
That's what they get paid for.

512
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,939
Maybe she'll be fine
and give you a cheap thrill.

513
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:57,580
Hello? Kelli! Hey, hon!
It's your sister. Yeah.

514
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,419
Now this is the most crucial part.

515
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,797
You put the pasta back in the pot.
You add a little gravy...

516
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,715
And a little butter.

517
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,596
Then...

518
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,138
you put the fire back on...

519
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:19,605
- ...for 45 seconds, stir it up nice.
- 45 seconds?

520
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:25,104
Yeah. That way the macaroni absorbs
the gravy instead of just coats it.

521
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,697
This is for flavor.

522
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,902
- I need a favor.
- What?

523
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:36,247
I need a piece. I mean,
I don't need one. But...

524
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,157
you know.

525
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,341
- Anything you wanna tell me?
- No.

526
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,213
It's just I think it's time I,
you know...

527
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,559
- What are you looking to get?
- What do you suggest?

528
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,846
Me, I like to know the motherfucker's
gonna work.

529
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,641
And a .38...

530
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,571
it'll never jam on you.

531
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,656
Plus it's small.

532
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,823
If you want to make a point,
go with something bigger.

533
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,701
It's not for intimidation.
Just in case.

534
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,501
Yeah, I'd go with the .38.

535
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:26,293
You can have this one.
I got another one under the bed.

536
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,336
How much I owe you for it?

537
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,302
Get out of here.
Your money's no good.

538
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:38,222
Macaroni's ready!

539
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:06,838
I just wanna tell you
that I don't expect anything from you.

540
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:11,502
Well, kindness. That's it.

541
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,885
Okay.

542
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:25,315
You really are in love
with yourself, aren't you?

543
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,686
What do you mean?

544
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,189
Conceited?

545
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,567
Self-centered.

546
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:40,413
"Okay." I mean there's a bunch
of alternates you could've said.

547
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:46,081
You deprive yourself of nothing.

548
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,390
You think I'm vain?

549
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,679
I think you're wonderful.

550
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:29,754
And her name is G...

551
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:50,100
My accounts
are in bad neighborhoods.

552
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,439
I know why you lie.

553
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,736
But you don't have to.

554
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,036
Can I hold it?

555
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,921
It's heavy. Is it loaded?

556
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:23,099
Nothing more useless
than an unloaded gun.

557
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,890
There you go.

558
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,891
Mr. Waste Management.

559
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,815
Come here.

560
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:49,455
I mean, we're paying the school,
we're buying a service.

561
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,456
If it's their opinion that he
shouldn't get treated too harshly...

562
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,549
You gotta listen
to the experts, right?

563
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,841
What else is going on,
how was the rest of your week?

564
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,760
To be honest? Very good.

565
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,347
- Why is that?
- Well, that's how life is, I guess.

566
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:15,940
Sometimes good. Sometimes bad.
Things come, things go.

567
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:23,239
- How is it between you and Carmela?
- She was moody, now she's herself.

568
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,112
Maybe it was coming here.

569
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,830
Possibly.

570
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,452
- Well, you do look happy, I must say.
- Yeah.

571
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,086
- Went to the zoo.
- The zoo?

572
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:46,766
You know, sometimes you gotta get
away, stop and smell the gorilla shit.

573
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,593
Good to be in nature.

574
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,645
- And the zoo made you happy.
- Yeah.

575
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,440
I think a lot of it's because of you.

576
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,196
You put a lot of time into me.

577
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:07,913
- Now it's paying off.
- The progress you make is up to you.

578
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,916
And how honest you are
with yourself and me.

579
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,710
Well, I am improving.

580
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:19,124
You have to participate
in the suffering of the world.

581
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,305
Your thoughts have
an Eastern ﬂavor to them.

582
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,930
- I lived in Jersey my whole life.
- I mean Eastern...

583
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:34,977
in terms of Asian,
like Buddhist or Taoist...

584
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,899
Sun Tzu.

585
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,853
I told you about him.

586
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,616
We have to stop now.

587
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,486
All right.

588
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,584
This is the co-pay I owe you
from last month.

589
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,918
Well, you gave me too much.

590
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:05,049
Well, I gave you a little extra
for the good results this week.

591
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,509
- I can't accept it.
- Give it to charity.

592
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:12,056
You better get your phone.
I'll see you next week.

593
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,894
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

594
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,192
- Hi, Jason.
- How are you?

595
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,986
- I hate all of them.
- Who?

596
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,111
My patients.
Lying to me, full of shit...

597
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:30,619
with no concern for what I do
or the position they put me in.

598
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,039
- I just hate them.
- Fuck them. Quit.

599
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,871
Right now that doesn't sound
like a bad idea.

600
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,081
I'm sorry.

601
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,426
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

602
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,672
I need to buy a couple
of expensive books.

603
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,613
Hey, Ton, how's it going?

604
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,461
- How you doing?
- All right, let it roll.

605
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,608
I don't want no teammates.

606
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,478
- Tony?
- How you doing? Huh?

607
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,022
- Are you up?
- No.

608
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,485
Take a hit.

609
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:51,734
Hit me.

610
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:56,789
- You shouldn't have listened to me.
- I would have hit anyway.

611
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,166
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

612
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,378
- What are you doing here?
- You're here.

613
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,831
- What?
- I was at a bachelor party.

614
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:08,627
- I got dragged here.
- This is what we talked about.

615
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,508
- Get your money and get out.
- Sorry.

616
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:14,807
- I don't wanna see you here again.
- You won't.

617
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,842
Smarten up.

618
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,274
Good morning.

619
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,737
- New earrings?
- I treated myself.

620
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,537
- They match.
- I almost bought a matching necklace.

621
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,667
Some restraint.

622
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,540
- Although Christmas is coming, so...
- Maybe.

623
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,967
- Any cannolis left from yesterday?
- Answer that question yourself.

624
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,467
Meadow still here?

625
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,265
Jackie took her to see Aida.

626
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,307
- "I eat her"?
- It's the Elton John musical.

627
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:13,070
I have to say, you were right, Tony.
Jackie Jr. has really surprised me.

628
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:18,450
He's been a gentleman. He takes
her to the city, he's great with A.J.

629
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:23,038
So long as she does good in school,
things could be a lot worse.
