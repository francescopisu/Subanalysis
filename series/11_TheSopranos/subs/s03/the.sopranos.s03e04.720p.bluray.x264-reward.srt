3
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,694
Ton, will you get that?

4
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,238
- Hello.
- Tony, it's me.

5
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,991
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

6
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,245
Why are you calling here?
You know who could answer this phone?

7
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:04,129
Please. You're so conceited.
Do you think I want to call you?

8
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,966
I think you're drinking and dialing.
I can smell the Stoli from here.

9
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,925
Yell to your sister, not to me.
My poor cousin...

10
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,476
<i>has not had her prosthetic leg.</i>

11
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,520
- What do you want me to do?
- Tony, please.

12
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:22,147
I miss you so much.
Can't you come over here?

13
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,479
Don't you ever call here again.

14
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,369
- Didn't you see my favorite patient?
- Tomorrow.

15
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,039
- How's that going?
- Let's not, Richard.

16
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,789
- I wish you hadn't taken him back.
- I took you back.

17
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,793
I see the synergy.
Treat him, we start seeing each other.

18
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,466
- Richard, Richard.
- No, seriously.

19
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:50,513
If you want to know, he had
a breakthrough last week.

20
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:55,718
- What? Through somebody's jaw?
- You're right, I'm wasting my time.

21
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,813
Better I boycott with
the Italian American Foundation...

22
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:05,440
and save the world from
what is it this week? Gangster?

23
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:11,238
The very idea ABC would even think of
producing that stereotypical goombah fest.

24
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:16,823
Richard, we are an advertisement for
the American experiment. We did great.

25
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,412
I'm fed up with people assuming I'm a
thug because my name ends in a vowel.

26
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,207
Undershirts, yelling.
Hollywood gives these sociopaths...

27
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,089
the tragic grandeur of Al Pacino.

28
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,717
He's an expert at this.
The guy's conning you.

29
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,810
Condescend to me, Richard.
It gets me so hot.

30
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,520
Tell me about this breakthrough.
You said he's alexithymic.

31
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,226
Nothing will get through.

32
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:50,114
Not if it threatens that straw house he's built
inside his head to shelter his criminality.

33
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:55,444
It concerns me you don't see this.
Pink-slip this guy. He's dangerous.

34
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,872
I'll pink-slip you if you don't
get the chicken in the oven.

35
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,954
Is that new?

36
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,882
- Looks good.
- Did you bring your log?

37
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:15,005
- My log?
- Remember? You were to keep a record.

38
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,678
I asked you to write down any feelings...

39
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:22,020
of anxiety or memories
of past anxiety attacks.

40
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,141
My parents and the pork store. I know.

41
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,148
That was... it was interesting.

42
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,190
Have you thought at all about that?

43
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,449
- How do people find the time?
- To get well?

44
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:46,503
Look, my mother's dead.
I haven't had a panic attack since.

45
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:51,588
You've gone months without them before.
The conflicts that cause them...

46
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,342
and your depression are
buried deep inside you.

47
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,059
- Are you happy?
- Am I happy?

48
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,100
That's not even...

49
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:11,487
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't bring the list.

50
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,404
I'll bring it next week.

51
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,326
Will you ever think about
bringing your wife into this?

52
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,707
In here? Carmela?

53
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,957
You're the one who wanted to take
a more proactive approach.

54
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,289
That's not in the future.

55
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:36,883
Let's talk frankly.
You demanded more of me. Fine.

56
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,349
- But you're not trying.
- I know.

57
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,930
<i>The past.</i>

58
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,646
But shit happens in my daily
life that needs attention now.

59
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,150
I got some genuine concerns, you know.

60
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,779
About my son. He shies away
from anything that requires effort...

61
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,611
and I think he picks
that up from me.

62
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,207
He's in football now. Carmela's as
guilty about this as I am.

63
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,624
She indulges him.

64
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,753
Richard was right.

65
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,921
I've been charmed by a sociopath.
Why didn't I listen?

66
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,422
Why do you think?

67
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,176
Why did I reject a good man like Richard
in the first place?

68
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,600
If you think about my life,
it's so textbook.

69
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,223
Marry a man 10 years my senior.

70
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:31,059
Of course Richard's gonna be
protective and patriarchal.

71
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,152
Then I reject him for being just that.

72
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,648
There's nothing wrong
with wanting to be safe.

73
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,198
I know Richard's right.
I should get Tony Soprano...

74
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,661
Shit.

75
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:49,286
I always thought it was that
other guy. Little Augie Aprile.

76
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,506
- I can't believe I revealed his name.
- Why did you?

77
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,511
Does Richard know who he is?

78
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:04,725
I think he saw it in my Day-Timer.
That's why he's been so adamant.

79
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,936
Because Soprano is very high up.

80
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,314
If he was some button man
you wouldn't treat him?

81
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,687
Please, with the terminology.

82
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:19,907
You know psychotherapy is limited
in the treatment of anxiety disorder.

83
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:25,453
You've medicated Soprano and helped
him gain what insight he's able to absorb.

84
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,158
It's time to send him
on to a behaviorist.

85
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,264
Janice!

86
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,239
Janice.

87
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,698
I was cleaning up.

88
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,206
When did you change the locks?

89
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,244
The minute that Ukrainian dye-job
was out the door.

90
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,005
Don't mess with the Russians, Janice.

91
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:21,673
She can have her leg when
she returns Ma's record collection.

92
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:27,258
- You would've done the same thing.
- I'm getting calls from her cousin.

93
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,726
Miss Carburetor Works of 1987?

94
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,351
Don't fuck with me on this.
Give back the leg.

95
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:38,443
Tony, those records are yours too.
It's sad that you don't care.

96
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:43,240
Those old albums...
They're a window into Ma's soul.

97
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,656
In fact, I'm making a documentary.

98
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,241
World War ll generation's music,
exemplified by Ma.

99
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,545
Who are you kidding?
You're gonna sell them on the Internet!

100
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,456
- I have work to do.
- Cleaning the cellar.

101
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:04,086
Good luck finding gold. You'd make
more money working a real job.

102
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:10,427
Like the minute I'm out you won't have
contractors tearing apart the walls.

103
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,351
Oh, Janice.

104
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,158
EH-EH-EH.

105
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:34,075
You finished? I wanna meet my bud at
the gym, we're gonna spar.

106
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,415
You got a girlfriend?

107
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:44,840
You know who's turning into a little
mink, though? Meadow Soprano.

108
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,803
Look at him perk up.

109
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,758
- I've known her since we were kids.
- Speaking of the royal family...

110
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,343
I heard you did a stickup with Chris.

111
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,143
I wanted to fly to South Beach.
Mom wouldn't pay.

112
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,770
Don't worry. I'm won't tell her.

113
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,439
Look, kid...

114
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,485
I'm trying real hard here.

115
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,025
I know it's tough on you.

116
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,613
- I'm the guy that's dating your mom.
- Dating?

117
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,956
Don't get fucking filthy about it.

118
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,710
Anyway this...

119
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,253
This was a good idea she had,
us going out to dinner.

120
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,961
Not that one conversation
ever solved anybody's problems.

121
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:32,341
I'm only here so I don't have
to hear her bitching and crying.

122
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,349
The gym, huh?

123
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,269
Mind if I make a stop first?

124
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,702
My brother is out.
He said you knew.

125
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,873
I get the bad-tempered one.

126
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,458
Bashir said that this
payment could be late...

127
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,880
because we had truck problems.

128
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,674
Three of them needed new hydraulics.

129
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,095
- Nobody talked to me.
- He said you approved.

130
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,261
You're collecting on my routes.
You gotta pay me.

131
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,934
They're only your routes
because you say they are.

132
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:21,398
You wanna question New Jersey business
practice that goes back 70 years?

133
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,233
Hey!

134
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,444
What is this, Ralphie?

135
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,530
I ought to stick a shish kebab
up your ass.

136
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,239
Why do you provoke me?

137
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,828
This young buck.

138
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,492
He'll fuck your wife until she moans.

139
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,706
- You fucking wop. You began it.
- What did you call me?

140
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,591
- Bringing my wife in this!
- Put it down!

141
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,634
- Mister, come on!
- Hey!

142
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:51,878
OW!

143
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,218
- Get the fucking bat!
- Let go!

144
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,351
- You all right?
- Asshole!

145
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,805
School this prick.
In the breadbasket!

146
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:07,110
Good, kid. Introduce him to his desk.

147
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,448
Take an anger management course.

148
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,242
Fucking racial slurs.

149
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,361
Why you doing this to me?

150
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,412
That's what you get for using
a baseball bat.

151
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,920
Let's go, kid.

152
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:54,658
- Yeah?
- Ginny. It's Tony Soprano.

153
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,372
What's wrong with me? I'm a mess here
with the moving. I'll get John.

154
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:07,663
John! John, get down here!
You got company!

155
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,507
Look who's here.

156
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,090
- The guinea welcome wagon.
- This is for you.

157
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,889
Carmela's bringing something nice to
the housewarming for Ginny.

158
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,439
This is the Great Room.
I don't see what's so great.

159
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,729
It's mediocre. We got a
living room right over there.

160
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,821
I didn't know you were moving.

161
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,201
Ginny wanted to be near her sisters,
you know, and the schools out here.

162
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,665
We were with Carmine.
You never mentioned this place.

163
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,084
It's not his favorite subject.

164
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,205
It's what, half an hour,
40 minutes over the bridge?

165
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,174
Why didn't you say you were moving?

166
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,885
- Why?
- I gotta find out second hand?

167
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,926
You care?
You working in a tollbooth?

168
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,679
Besides, I already got
the condo in Point Pleasant.

169
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,430
- You should have told me.
- I'm telling you now.

170
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:11,359
This is a place to live. I got no
intention of sticking my beak in.

171
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,112
I mean, there's our family
and then there's the Soprano family.

172
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,076
Don't I get to see the rest of this?

173
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,029
You can help me unstick
this rain bird.

174
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,207
I'm a stranger in
a strange land out here.

175
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,634
Look at this pair.

176
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,018
How many Neapolitans
to screw in a light bulb?

177
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:50,015
There's only candles in Naples.
The cardinal controls that racket.

178
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,893
That's a good one.

179
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,190
<i>Use</i> it <i>on your paesans.</i>

180
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,775
We don't have those bulb jokes.
They don't translate.

181
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,703
Tony, I go get a cappuccino.

182
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,076
Two thousand of that is mine.

183
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,409
Sand monkey on 17 is
holding out on us.

184
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,664
- So you put his brother in an ambulance?
- He said a bad word.

185
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,009
Why would you take Jackie's kid
on something like that?

186
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,930
He's got to know how it works.
Kid's got a chip on his shoulder.

187
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,341
<i>23</i> and still living at home?

188
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,435
So he can keep an eye on
the prick that's banging his mom.

189
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,683
No matter how nice I am,
he still hates me.

190
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,357
I got a daughter that age.
It's all a mystery.

191
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,653
Amen.

192
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,157
Being a parent,
that's the hardest job.

193
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,610
It's harder than this other shit.

194
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:49,120
- Like my first marriage and my kid...
- I got news you're not gonna like.

195
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,544
- I'm putting our friend in <i>as</i> captain.
- What?

196
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,375
No.

197
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,178
- Fucking Gigi, are you shitting me?
- I'm sorry.

198
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:11,101
This shit with the Arab?
I went too far. I'll take care of it.

199
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,772
This isn't the first.

200
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:18,399
At least tell the truth. You want your
own there to spy on the Aprile crew.

201
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,981
Yeah. But I shouldn't have to.

202
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:25,577
You got bad tendencies.
I sympathize because I do too.

203
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,656
You partnering with
Joe Brooklyn on shit at the port.

204
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,081
A bum decision.

205
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,377
The bottom line speaks.
I'm earning my <i>ass</i> off for you.

206
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,916
It's my decision.

207
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:42,674
Jesus Christ, Ton.
I eat dinner at your house.

208
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,379
This is business.

209
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,309
See? Turned it off.

210
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,152
I've been thinking about
your course of therapy.

211
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,105
You're the doctor.

212
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:08,282
You're ready to move on to
behavior modification therapy.

213
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,992
What's that mean?
Talk to somebody else?

214
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,917
Is this because of what
happened last time?

215
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:23,381
Look, I'm sorry. But like you said,
it's hard to think about that stuff.

216
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,134
- It took how long to even remember?
- I realize that.

217
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:31,935
You know, you're unbelievable.
I ask you to get serious in here.

218
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,104
When it gets hard,
you pawn me off on somebody else.

219
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:44,565
I'm just introducing the idea.
Something for you to think about.

220
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:50,157
I'm going to bring in things for you
about behavior modification therapy.

221
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,667
Yes, he was here earlier today.

222
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,997
Yes, we talked about
behavior mod, but...

223
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,299
Maybe you could.

224
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,887
Listen, I told you
I would discharge him...

225
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,682
and I will, in my own good time.

226
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:17,852
I'm going into the garage.
I'm gonna lose you. See you later.

227
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,613
Shut up. Don't turn around.

228
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,200
I said, shut up. I got a knife.
I'll cut you, bitch.

229
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,538
AH!

230
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,911
Help!

231
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,124
- Get off!
- Shut up!

232
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,589
- I'll give you all my money.
- Get in!

233
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,225
"No!
- Shut

234
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,136
- Get the panties off.
- Stop!

235
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:01,024
- I'm gonna fuck you, bitch!
- No!

236
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,021
Please! No!

237
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,616
You fucking bitch!

238
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,625
Stop it!

239
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,181
She's almost done.
We just need a few more swabs.

240
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,986
- For God's sake, Jen.
- Richard.

241
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,735
You're gonna be all right.

242
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,988
I thought that I broke my leg...

243
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:01,789
but it's just really
badly sprained.

244
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,042
Jesus. Oh, God.

245
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,215
Bastard.

246
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,594
- Did they tell you they caught him?
- Thank God.

247
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:16,345
We nabbed somebody with the
description not far from the scene.

248
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,553
He's denying it,
but he had her Palm Pilot.

249
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,892
Says he found it.

250
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,984
This is Detective Piersol.
She's been great.

251
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,321
- There's no way to describe this.
- Of course.

252
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,113
- The son of a bitch. Who is he?
- Jesus Rossi.

253
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,162
- Rossi?
- Lives in Elizabeth. 28, no priors.

254
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,741
- That's an Italian name.
- Am I missing something?

255
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,795
The girl said he was a Puerto Rican,
that's all.

256
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:50,382
- I just wanna take a shower, okay?
- We'll be done here soon.

257
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,088
All right.

258
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:53,753
Mom!

259
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,511
- Jason.
- Jesus, Morn.

260
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,722
What did these lousy fuckers do?

261
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,270
I'll be all right.

262
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,190
I'm gonna kill these fuckers.

263
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,684
- Jason.
- Fuck it, Dad!

264
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,613
You know the world is a sewer!
Nothing but a sewer!

265
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,567
It's animals out there running wild!
They're winning!

266
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:19,200
The police caught the man that did it.

267
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,577
I want five minutes with that asshole!

268
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,830
She doesn't need to hear it.

269
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,394
Why don't you go outside and
settle down? I'll be right out.

270
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,747
Go ahead.

271
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,386
<i>- Hello?
- May I speak to Anthony Soprano?</i>

272
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,556
He's not available now.
Who's calling?

273
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:47,854
This is Jennifer Melfi.
Is this Mrs. Soprano?

274
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,731
<i>Yes, it is. How are you?</i>

275
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:54,530
That's why I'm calling,
to cancel his appointment.

276
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,529
He'll be disappointed.
Nothing serious, I hope.

277
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,740
A car accident, but I'm fine.

278
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:05,200
I hope they had insurance.
You weren't hurt, I hope?

279
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:10,709
My knee got the worst of it. But I'll
be up and about in a couple of days.

280
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,632
I'll tell him.
You stay off of it.

281
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,130
Who ate the cake?

282
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,132
<i>Thank you, I will.</i>

283
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,180
Thank you for giving him the message.

284
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,510
That's gotta be some marriage.

285
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,684
Hello, Kate? This is Jennifer Melfi.

286
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:32,644
I know talking on the phone upsets you,
but I need to cancel our appointment.

287
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,366
- Tell him what?
- That was your therapist.

288
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,654
Why don't you just announce
it on WFAN? Go find some dust!

289
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,792
She was in a car accident.
She has to cancel.

290
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:52,292
- She all right?
- She was okay. She hurt her knee.

291
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:56,751
Her knee? Really? What happened?

292
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,757
I don't know. She didn't say.

293
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:07,012
I hope she don't need stitches.
Stitches on the knee never heal right.

294
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,096
Can leave a very bad scar.

295
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,693
Any knee injury can be very serious.

296
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,815
You can get arthritis for
the rest of your life.

297
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,905
- Ask Joe Namath.
- No, thanks.

298
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,285
Listen, last time...

299
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:35,544
she mentioned that maybe
you would come into my therapy.

300
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:41,471
Give your perspective on
the panic attacks and kind of...

301
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,142
our home life. Whatever.

302
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,641
Sure.

303
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,687
But not now. She's sick.

304
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,532
- They call yet?
- No, not yet.

305
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,993
I thought they'd call by now.

306
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,461
They said they'd call when
they want us to come down.

307
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:20,336
Look, I'm gonna call them.
Where's that detective's card?

308
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,214
They said they'd call.
I don't want to bother them.

309
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,843
I'm not gonna let you just wait here.
I'm gonna call them.

310
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,977
Hello. Hi, Detective Piersol?

311
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,103
I'm on hold.

312
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,828
She is? Then maybe you can help me.
This is Dr. La Penna.

313
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,530
I'm calling for Jennifer Melfi.

314
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,288
The rape. Right, Detective Piersol
was gonna call...

315
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,834
when you were ready
for us to come down.

316
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,047
What? Why not?

317
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,421
What's going on?

318
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,050
- Why? That's ridiculous.
- What happened?

319
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,552
It isn't Piersol.
She's moved.

320
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,508
She never said anything.

321
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,812
You just let him go?
Are you fucking crazy?

322
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,523
Yes, I do need to use
this kind of language!

323
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,609
- I don't care if you're sorry.
- Richard.

324
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,445
Fine, you do that.

325
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:26,196
You haven't heard the end of this.
I'm contacting my attorney. Asshole!

326
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,454
- What?
- Chain of custody was mishandled...

327
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:34,534
- ...so they let him go.
- They let him go?

328
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,170
Somebody misplaced
the evidence kit or something...

329
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,294
I don't know what they did,
those idiots!

330
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,170
Is he just out until the trial?
I can identify him.

331
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,722
It's a legal thing. I think they
just have to let him skip.

332
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,186
That's impossible. You misunderstood.

333
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,396
Give me the phone.

334
00:25:56,597 --> 00:26:01,068
- I told you what he told me.
- Before or after you cursed at him?

335
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,902
- Give me the phone. I'll call them.
- All right. I'll call.

336
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,993
Detective Lindheim, please.
Yes, I'll hold.

337
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,915
Now it's not even the same cop.

338
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:27,178
Hello. Dick La Penna again. I want to
apologize for losing my temper.

339
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,389
Could I please have the phone?

340
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,136
Just a second.

341
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,602
Hello? I'm sorry, I don't
understand what's going on.

342
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,565
I don't know what you people did,
but I can identify him.

343
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:57,041
I don't know what to say. I'm stunned.

344
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:08,048
They had to let him go...

345
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,342
because they fouled up
the chain of custody.

346
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,470
What am I gonna do?

347
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:18,145
You're gonna have someone
escort you to your car.

348
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:23,272
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what the counselor told me.

349
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,695
Deserted garages are
where attacks happen.

350
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:31,488
You think this is my fault.
Do you blame me for what happened?

351
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,329
I told you to call security
when it's late.

352
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,782
It wasn't late.

353
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,536
- This isn't doing any good.
- Let me tell you something.

354
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,667
If I hadn't have been on the
phone with you...

355
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:48,797
maybe I would've seen
that guy in the stairwell.

356
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,512
- What?
- You and your hard-on about my patient!

357
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,015
So it's my fault?

358
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,310
You should've seen your face...

359
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,937
when you heard that that shitbag
that raped me had an Italian name.

360
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,525
You're the one who told
them he was Puerto Rican.

361
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,982
What difference does it make?

362
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,613
Are you so ashamed
of your background...

363
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:18,706
that any misdeed by an Italian
somehow damages your self-esteem?

364
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,871
This is so misdirected.

365
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:25,079
The whole fucking world's
about your self-esteem.

366
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,540
Or maybe you don't have enough.

367
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,758
Jennifer, come on.

368
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,298
Fuck you, Richard.

369
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,966
Jen!

370
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,146
How's Ralphie? With you over him?

371
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,603
He busts balls.

372
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,407
He played like it was his idea
for me to be Aprile crew captain.

373
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,861
What is he gonna do?
Tony cut off his cazzi.

374
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:01,119
Very prudently. Not that you
ain't gonna hear more later.

375
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,998
Most of the conversation
was about Johnny moving.

376
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,918
Ginny told Gabriella
she needs a big house.

377
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:12,126
Ginny Sacrimoni?
What she needs is her own zip code.

378
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,680
Jersey's a small state.
She moves in, she could tip it over.

379
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,757
I like something to grab onto.

380
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,345
You grab onto her,
your hands will disappear.

381
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:26,932
- She's so fat, her blood type is Ragu.
- When she goes camping...

382
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,809
bears hide their food.

383
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,567
When Ginny hauls ass,
she's gotta make two trips.

384
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,651
Two guys could fuck her at
the same time and never meet.

385
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,576
Johnny!

386
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,156
- Fuck who?
- What?

387
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,866
What's so funny?

388
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,998
Nothing. We're just talking
about a girl.

389
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,046
Is that all you do,
is talk about cooze?

390
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,544
When we're not planting potatoes.
Welcome. You wanna drink?

391
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,637
I mean it.
You don't keep up with events?

392
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,474
- What?
- It's all over 1010 WINS.

393
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:04,220
It's right there in front of you.
Turn it up.

394
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:09,980
<i>After years of planning and delays,
there's good news for Newark.</i>

395
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,609
<i>Coming from the Passaic River where
Assemblyman Ronald Zellman...</i>

396
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:19,489
<i>held a press conference to
announce the release of $25 million...</i>

397
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,954
<i>in state and federal funds.</i>

398
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,407
25 million.

399
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:30,122
<i>The time has come to return Newark
and its waterfront to its past glory.</i>

400
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:35,172
<i>By the year 2003, this long-neglected
stretch of riverfront...</i>

401
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,926
<i>will be alive with condominiums,
film studios and public parks.</i>

402
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,925
<i>A self-perpetuating revenue base.</i>

403
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,396
<i>The $100 million Newark Museum
of Science and Trucking...</i>

404
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:53,023
<i>will serve to make this the
attraction of the area and beyond.</i>

405
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,948
This fucking busted valise,
he's worth every cent of his cut.

406
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,776
Fucking dry wall contracts alone.

407
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,028
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

408
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,632
Jen, can I come in?

409
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,682
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,396
I'm just so frustrated.

411
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,057
We both are.

412
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:36,896
I just want to go find that bastard
and kill him with my hands.

413
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:41,905
And I could and I would. But I can't.

414
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:46,197
They'd put me in jail,
that's how things are.

415
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,948
I know.

416
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,676
- You said Satriale's at 1.
- So now you know how it feels.

417
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:04,719
I know why I'm here and I apologize.
I won't let it happen again.

418
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,433
Don't step in that, that's
my mother's flowers.

419
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,847
Let's go.

420
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,061
<i>I asked you to
watch out for Jackie, Jr.</i>

421
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,690
I said, "Don't let the kid
get involved in this."

422
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,365
I hear about a joint,
and Jackie's a part of it.

423
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:30,996
He only drove. I said I was sorry.
Let me tell you, he was an asset.

424
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,792
He pissed on the car seats,
but he handled himself very good.

425
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,624
You listening?
Leave him out of it.

426
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,969
<i>He begged me for a taste.
He's the heir apparent.</i>

427
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:47,346
<i>I don't want him mixed up in this.
I promised his old man.</i>

428
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,224
- But it's all right for me?
- I didn't say that.

429
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,271
What did you say? The life's good
for me, but not for Lord Fuckpants?

430
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:01,856
Look, he's not suited to it.
He's not like you. Like us.

431
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,901
Kids today, they're bored,
they're spoiled.

432
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:13,249
- I promised his old man.
- What? You promised him what?

433
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,414
I don't know.

434
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,543
I was his best friend.

435
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,255
Don't bust my balls.

436
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,674
I gotta go make a stop in Nutley.

437
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,932
Come here.

438
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,560
I love you.

439
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,105
You're a good boy.

440
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,619
Lord Fuckpants? Whose moniker is that?

441
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,083
I'm not sure it is a moniker.

442
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,788
Hi. Come on in.

443
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:39,499
Jesus. What's the other guy look like?

444
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,934
That must have been some accident.
What happened?

445
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:58,935
Someone ran a stop sign on
Eisenhower Parkway.

446
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,519
- It was one of those things.
- I know a woman with one leg.

447
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,270
Terrible thing.

448
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:11,948
Last time we met we talked about
getting you into behavioral therapy.

449
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,914
I brought a couple of things
for you to look at.

450
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:23,460
"Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway."
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

451
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,636
The title leaves something
to be desired.

452
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,892
It's okay, it's just your...

453
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,264
It's okay. I'm sorry. Sorry.

454
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,892
You want me to...?

455
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,567
- It startled me, that's all.
- Maybe you came back too soon.

456
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:51,025
- It's better for me to be busy.
- Right.

457
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,243
I'm okay. Really.

458
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,921
And I appreciate your concern.

459
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,265
That's what's wrong with the world.

460
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,477
An innocent person is minding
their own business...

461
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:22,439
and some fucking asshole comes out
and smashes into them.

462
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,855
- You can't control everything.
- You can get pissed off.

463
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,949
And then what? Lose control?

464
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,070
You direct your
anger where it belongs.

465
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,995
You have panic attacks.

466
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:43,623
Panic occurs when feelings of anger,
revenge, whatever, overwhelm you.

467
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,214
That's where behavioral therapy
comes in.

468
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:51,089
It can teach you to control
those triggers.

469
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,966
How do you get people
to do what you want?

470
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,894
You tell your mother it's
hers anytime she wants it.

471
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,607
- How was your cousin's shower?
- It sounded like a bunch of screaming.

472
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,732
I wondered whose Z24 was in
the driveway. You get a car?

473
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,521
Yeah.

474
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,907
Where did I put the sleeves
to that samovar?

475
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,952
- You want anything? A Coke?
- No, I'm set, Ton.

476
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,083
I heard Ralph Cifaretto
got passed over.

477
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,077
You heard about what? Who?

478
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,914
I'm saying that was probably smart.

479
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:33,294
- He's kind of a cool guy...
- That's none of your concern.

480
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:37,093
You were going to college.
I hear shit from Chris?

481
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,972
- You didn't talk to Chris. Shit.
- That's right.

482
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,012
I promised your dad.

483
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,687
Don't make this hard.
I got a son to bust my balls.

484
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,605
I'm home!

485
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,277
Ma?

486
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,407
Hey, Jackie. What are you doing here?

487
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,326
I'm waiting for you.

488
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,655
What? No hello?

489
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,788
I need $200 to put in
my student account.

490
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,165
We haven't talked for weeks.

491
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,999
I look forward to total
independence, believe me.

492
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,882
African-Americans go to Columbia.
Some are my friends.

493
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:20,807
My <i>ass.</i> On my couch, watching TV
with his shoes off with you?

494
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,138
Meadow, when did you get here?

495
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,320
See you. Say hi to your mom.

496
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,106
Come into the city, we'll do sushi.

497
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,942
I won't say anything.

498
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,244
You just remember
what we talked about.

499
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:51,380
I'll have a chicken avocado wrap,
no dressing. And a Coke.

500
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:55,251
One number three,
dressing on the side.

501
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,627
Thanks.

502
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,910
Excuse me. Wait a minute.

503
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,948
Let go of me! Let the fuck go of me!

504
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:12,252
- We don't wanna continue. Give us leg.
- What leg?

505
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:16,207
Don't do this to me.
Don't push me to edge. Repent!

506
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,759
Motherfucker, do you know
who my brother is?

507
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,462
- Mother, what did you say?
- Mother...

508
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,227
Those records were all I had of my
mother. What could they mean to her?

509
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,027
- Are you people really so callous...?
- Fuck you. You are callous.

510
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,990
AH!

511
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,652
Oh, my God! Help me, please!

512
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,490
AH!

513
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,424
I felt such a sense of relief.

514
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,060
I felt safe for the first time
since it happened.

515
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,562
Empowered.

516
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,691
The vending machine?

517
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,312
My guilt for putting myself
in harm's way.

518
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,862
I read about that too,
that honeymooner...

519
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,327
who rocked a vending machine
and it fell on him and killed him.

520
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:57,784
The dog though, I don't know.

521
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:02,957
The forbidden part of your psyche,
murderous rage.

522
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:07,423
Yeah, but at first I thought
he was after me.

523
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,508
The door said, "Danger."

524
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:17,145
Actually, no, it said, "High Voltage.
Call NJGE Before Digging."

525
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,643
"Jersey Gas and Electric."

526
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:23,610
- Was Richard anywhere in all this?
- No.

527
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,905
Oh, my God. The dog.

528
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,400
- What?
- A rottweiler, Elliot.

529
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,407
Big head. Massive shoulders.

530
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:38,625
Descendent of the dog used by
the Roman armies to guard their camps.

531
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,751
- I didn't know that.
- Digging?

532
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,502
Who do I dig with?
And who's dangerous?

533
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:49,677
Who could I sic on that son of a bitch
to tear him to shreds?

534
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,505
OH.

535
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,925
Let me tell you something.

536
00:43:55,174 --> 00:44:00,647
No feeling has ever been so sweet
as to see that pig beg...

537
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,266
and plead and scream for life.

538
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:07,862
Because the justice system
is fucked up, Elliot.

539
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:12,242
Richard's got his attorney
looking into this at $300 an hour.

540
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,158
Meanwhile, that
employee of the month cocksucker...

541
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:20,117
is back on the street,
and who's gonna stop him? You?

542
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,753
Jennifer...

543
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:29,383
- Civilization...
- Don't worry.

544
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,675
I'm not going to break
the social compact.

545
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:38,928
But that's not saying there's not a
certain satisfaction in knowing...

546
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:43,728
that I could have that asshole
squashed like a bug.

547
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:45,520
If I wanted.

548
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,404
What happened?

549
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,624
Janice?

550
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,465
I can't drive.
And they broke three ribs.

551
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:15,089
What did I tell you? I told you
not to mess with those people.

552
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,467
I was supposed to be married
at this point.

553
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,469
- Yeah? So?
- The man I loved died.

554
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,937
This is all I fucking need.
Thanks, Janice.

555
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,023
- What?
- What do you mean?

556
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,576
They slapped my sister around.

557
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,996
I have to get payback.
It's always something.

558
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:44,163
Every time I hear your voice,
I know it's gonna cost me.

559
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:49,248
Time. Money. You never do anything
to simplify my life.

560
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:55,679
I stole a woman's prosthetic leg.
When did I get like this?

561
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,973
- You really wanna know?
- When Richie died.

562
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,686
Till that time, I was functioning
at a very high level.

563
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:09,108
There's only one trajectory for me.

564
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,401
Really?

565
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,240
- God.
- You see what I mean?

566
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:20,494
All this soul-searching,
it's always on my dime.

567
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,618
I've hit bottom, Tony.

568
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:30,422
But it's odd because
I feel born again in the Lord.

569
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:32,919
HMM.

570
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:37,129
And I prayed to God
and I asked him...

571
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,886
to forgive Svetlana
for what she's done.

572
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:48,481
We've been here before. With Vishnu
and Richard-fucking-Alpert...

573
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:52,606
and the Coyote Spirit.
You know what it always spells?

574
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:57,699
Trouble for the rest of us.
So put your fucking clothes on.

575
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,240
Seriously. I gotta get out of here.

576
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:06,912
I give myself up utterly
and totally to God.

577
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,328
If this is the bottom.

578
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,837
If not...

579
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,047
You can go now.

580
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,627
Billing needs to see you.
Follow the blue line.

581
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,852
Carmela.

582
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,736
- Gorgeous <i>as</i> ever.
- My God, this house.

583
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,150
You already got one.

584
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:44,992
Move to Jersey, but maybe take
a little bit of a halfway step?

585
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,914
Fucking wife of mine.

586
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,582
Gentlemen.

587
00:47:55,873 --> 00:48:00,595
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

588
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,014
<i>He's obsessed</i> with <i>Gladiator.</i>

589
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:08,095
Come on, it's a great fucking film.
"Strength and honor."

590
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:12,482
Scotch and soda. Long as you're
on the way to the bar.

591
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,145
Ball breaker.

592
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,315
J & B, right, Ton?

593
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,734
T, what do you think
a place like this...

594
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,738
- ...set John back?
- Who gives a shit?

595
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,741
Landscape alone's gotta be
100, 150 G's.

596
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:29,745
- To keep up this lawn...
- Property taxes. Gotta pay those.

597
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:30,996
Taxes.

598
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,249
Use the money to
fix air traffic control?

599
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,418
We should fight terrorism.

600
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,426
How about that stampede in
Zimbabwe? Soccer game.

601
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,133
No assigned seating. Always a problem.

602
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,986
You're not using the cane anymore.

603
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:15,332
Been making my list.

604
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:21,087
Even bought a little notebook.

605
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,378
Good. That's good.

606
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:32,054
I've been thinking about your behavior
therapy idea. You got a point.

607
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:37,483
I could use some help with a few
things. if they can help me there...

608
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,314
I should go there.

609
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,565
No.

610
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,070
You sure about that?
Because the last couple of times...

611
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,911
I've been getting the feeling
that you're giving me the boot.

612
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:00,206
OH!

613
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,091
What's the matter?

614
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,502
Hey, come on.

615
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,549
What did I do?

616
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,048
Come on, huh?

617
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,889
Hey, Hey. HEY-

618
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,768
Come on.

619
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,643
Now, what did I do? What's the matter?

620
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,478
Tell me. What's the matter?

621
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,772
Go sit over there.

622
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:26,858
We'll do this.

623
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,034
Go.

624
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:34,536
It's just my knee.

625
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,634
It's okay. Go on.

626
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,513
What?

627
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,017
I mean, you wanna say something?

628
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,571
No.
