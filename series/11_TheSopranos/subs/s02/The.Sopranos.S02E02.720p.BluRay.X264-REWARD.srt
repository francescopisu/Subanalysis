1
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,468
Three weeks to let me visit?

2
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,514
Be careful. These motherless fucks
listen to everything.

3
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,102
A nephew's visiting his uncle,
who loves him.

4
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,854
I got nothing to say.

5
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,940
So many tragedies to those
close to you, huh?

6
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,611
Don't be so smart. Things could
have gone the other way, nephew.

7
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,321
Yeah, but they didn't.

8
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,201
What's this shit I'm hearing
about your heart?

9
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,372
This problem you and me had...

10
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,625
...your mother had nothing
to do with it.

11
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,004
- She's dead to me.
- She's a sick woman.

12
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,008
Who are you kidding?
It kills you that people are talking.

13
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,428
That an old woman
made an ass out of you.

14
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,724
Not half so bad as certain rumors
floating around about you.

15
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,395
How Tony Soprano fluffs his mother's
pillow so she can get her sleep.

16
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,274
- Who said that?
- Want to make this nonsense disappear?

17
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:17,196
Make peace with her. No bad blood.
It'll be good for all of us.

18
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,655
No fucking way.

19
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:25,037
Tell Bacala to come out of his hole.
I want to see him tomorrow.

20
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,830
What for?

21
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,671
Black men industrialized the North,
but we still fight for jobs.

22
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,048
That's right!

23
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,303
Over 25 joint-fitters on this site,
not a black man to be found.

24
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,890
- Tell it, reverend! Why?
- I'll tell you why.

25
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,936
Black joint-fitters have been
shut out of the unions.

26
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,729
Yeah! That's right!

27
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,274
Out of work while their
white joint-fitter...

28
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,609
...fills his stomach.

29
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,656
My father put his life on the line
for this country.

30
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,824
Come on up here, Papa.

31
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,746
Somebody help my papa on up here.
This is my papa!

32
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,874
Fought in World War II,
against tyranny.

33
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,295
Came home to establish
his own tabernacle.

34
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,132
But when he came home... I said,
when he came home...

35
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,552
...he had to fight a different
kind of war all over again!

36
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,889
Talk to them, Papa! Talk
to the people, Papa!

37
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,648
Since then, we have spilled
our blood in Korea...

38
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,441
...Vietnam and Iraq.

39
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,948
Every time, I say, "Sweet Jesus,
let them do right when they get back."

40
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,701
But somebody forgot to tell the Man.

41
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,956
- You know what I mean!
- Tell him, reverend!

42
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,125
Oh, yes, I'm gonna tell him!

43
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,587
I'm gonna tell him, no more cutting
us out of the dream!

44
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,797
No more!

45
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,091
- No more!
- No more!

46
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,426
No More!

47
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,763
You hear that, Mr. Massarone
Brothers Construction?

48
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,641
No more!

49
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,185
- Somebody tell me what we want!
- Jobs!

50
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,979
- When do we want it?
- Now!

51
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,522
- What do we want?
- Jobs!

52
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:18,984
Hey, Med!

53
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,946
I'm gonna visit "She who
can't be named." Want to come?

54
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,574
Grandma? You mean like now?

55
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,911
I'd really like to, but I gotta study
my French. Stupid verbs.

56
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,580
No biggie.

57
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,124
Hey! I want to talk to you.

58
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,047
What were you doing with that sign?

59
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,718
- I wanted to talk to you about that.
- I'm selling Ma's house, understand?

60
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,220
Now put the sign back in the ground!

61
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,306
End of discussion! Period!

62
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,475
You're so left-brained.

63
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:56,813
The house is still for sale.
The agent still has a listing.

64
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,566
What was the sign doing in your car?

65
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,612
- Don't try to deny it!
- I'm trying to save a little money.

66
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,614
Do you remember Cathy Fiola?

67
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,158
She was in my class,
with the birthmark.

68
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,496
- What about her?
- She's in real estate and charges...

69
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,582
...three percent commission.
That's half, Tony.

70
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,878
Thousands of dollars.
Maybe Ma could use it.

71
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,922
Yeah? Fuck her!

72
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,885
Next time you disappear,
park that piece of shit on the street!

73
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,512
This isn't a hotel!

74
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,062
We're out of cran-apple.
Is plain apple okay?

75
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,274
Oh, sure, doll. Oh, honey?

76
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,320
Could you get me some
strawberry ice cream?

77
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,365
They can't expect me to eat
this tapioca.

78
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,409
I'll see what I can do.

79
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,954
She cracks me up.

80
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,457
Well, I can't believe it.

81
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,168
It's my daughter from California!

82
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,213
- Seattle, Ma.
- Would you like some of my tapioca?

83
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:08,135
- Good morning.
- Oh, you reek of cigarettes. Ugh!

84
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,556
Look at you, all dressed, out of bed.

85
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,476
Yeah, but you see my hand?
It's all black and blue...

86
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,063
...where they stuck in the needle.
It's how you get better.

87
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,609
You don't care.
You weren't here five minutes.

88
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:30,490
I went to the city for a few days.
I'm pitching my self-help video.

89
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:35,704
"Lady Kerouac," or, "Packing for
the Highway to a Woman's Self-Esteem."

90
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:40,792
You could never stand it here.
You could never stand yourself.

91
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:45,755
- And that's why you ran away.
- Let's not go there today, Ma.

92
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,175
You think it was easy for me?

93
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,345
- You don't know how your father was!
- What do you mean?

94
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,141
Nobody knows!
Nobody knows what I went through.

95
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,976
What about Daddy?

96
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:05,066
One thing I could tell you.
It would kill him to see me now.

97
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,320
Here's your ice cream.
Then we can take our walk.

98
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,156
Leave me alone, please.

99
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,993
Open the window and just
push me out.

100
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,747
- I can't take this anymore.
- Mrs. Soprano, what's wrong?

101
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,291
- What happened?
- She just started crying.

102
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,585
You! I know why you're here!

103
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,879
You don't fool me for a second!

104
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,841
- You want to take my house!
- Ma!

105
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,511
You don't know
what goes through my mind.

106
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,724
- Well, that's for fucking sure!
- Someday, I hope you have children...

107
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,353
...and they treat you like this.

108
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:47,817
- I gave my life to my children.
- This is bullshit.

109
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,991
Talk to me.

110
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,412
These activists, they're killing me.
They're picketing my place 24-7.

111
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,206
Three days I'm down.

112
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,251
- Who?
- A hard-on, Reverend Herman James, Jr.

113
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,420
"Not enough minorities
doing the joint-fitting."

114
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,216
- That's under my uncle's jurisdiction.
- I know.

115
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,844
But you could talk to him,
maybe send some guys down...

116
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,430
...and make it uncomfortable
for these people.

117
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:21,226
- Like you did, with your unions.
- It's gonna cost you.

118
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,521
You're already raping me
with those no-show jobs.

119
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,692
You're not such a citizen
when you want a bid to go your way.

120
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,360
Take it easy.

121
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,365
I'll see what I can do.
In the meantime, call animal control.

122
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,951
Watch you don't get followed
meeting me.

123
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,009
You're late.

124
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,680
Bobby Baccalieri,
the last man standing.

125
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,892
- I'm not saying nothing.
- Don't want to get in trouble.

126
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,855
A lot of funerals in your corner
of the world, huh?

127
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,983
Fucking our boost, what, you refinance
your house?

128
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,777
Look at me, not the floor.

129
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,783
Talk to that bald cocksucker
who calls himself my father's brother.

130
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:23,246
Tell him I'm gonna let him keep on
earning. Subsistence level.

131
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,625
He'll be able to pay his lawyers.

132
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,753
Let me say for him, thank you.

133
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,717
You're gonna hear some high-end shit.
And A: I hope you understand it...

134
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,013
...and B: I hope you keep it
between this room and Junior.

135
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:45,018
If you don't, they're gonna find
pieces of you in different dumpsters.

136
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,312
I inherited Junior.

137
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,983
You got no reason to talk to me
this way. I always liked you.

138
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,986
Bullshit.
But we'll assume you do now.

139
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,367
Tell my uncle he gets to keep 5%.
5% of his shy...

140
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,495
...the sports betting.
Same with the coke.

141
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,915
The Joint-Fitters Union,
it's all his, okay?

142
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,959
Listen. This is very important.

143
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,129
He also gets to keep his stripes.

144
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,550
As far as the feds are concerned,
they've got the boss in jail.

145
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,969
Hearing different creates confusion.

146
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,721
Got it.

147
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,058
As far as the rest of everything
that Junior owned...

148
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,893
...it's now mine.

149
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,357
I'll get this to him, Tony.

150
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,234
That's it.

151
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,536
"To the victor belongs the spoils."

152
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,790
Get out of here before I shove
your quotations book up your fat ass!

153
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:59,050
Mr. Bompensiero, is your wife
here to drive you home?

154
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,553
Skip.

155
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,435
Skip?

156
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,361
- How we feeling?
- Fucking great.

157
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,031
He's gonna be out of it
for an hour or so.

158
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,494
It went great. You'll feel the
difference in your back in a few days.

159
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,872
Buzz me when he feels ready to leave.

160
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:34,169
Yeah, we'll buzz you, honey.
Buzz. Buzz. Buzz...

161
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,508
My back don't feel one iota different.

162
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,095
It'll take a couple of days
for the steroids to kick in.

163
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,222
I gotta get in my Jacuzzi.

164
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,850
Too much stress in your life, Sal.

165
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,896
- Tony doesn't know you're back yet?
- Jesus Christ, no.

166
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,898
I didn't go see him yet.

167
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,401
- You're all alike.
- We've seen guys drag their dicks.

168
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,822
Take advantage of the government's
generosity, playing both ends.

169
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,158
Will you give me a window over here?

170
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,119
He's already suspicious.
I gotta be careful.

171
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,163
Altieri ate the pill for you.

172
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,708
Any suspicions went to the grave
with Jimmy Altieri.

173
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,129
- I've known Tony 30 years, now this?
- Spare me, okay?

174
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,173
You been on our tit since '98.

175
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,802
Chauffeur to and from the doctor
that we found for you.

176
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,305
We let you back on the street.
We want results.

177
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,225
He tried to suffocate his own mother.

178
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,145
His own uncle wanted him whacked.

179
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,273
You said he's been shitting on you
for years.

180
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,777
- I know what I said.
- Plus he's been crying to a shrink.

181
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,403
You don't owe him dick.

182
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,449
Don't take a bullet for a yuppie
who thinks you're his errand boy.

183
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,957
Your Honor, this man should not be
released for medical reasons.

184
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,210
Every time we get an elder
Mafioso incarcerated...

185
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,213
...we get the same bag of tricks.
Your Honor.

186
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:05,093
I take offense at the characterization
of my client as a Mafioso.

187
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,221
Mr. Soprano has not been found
guilty of anything.

188
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,182
- He's awaiting trial for allegations.
- Noted.

189
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,644
With all due respect to the state's
medical facilities...

190
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,898
...in his condition,
Mr. Soprano has every right...

191
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,818
...to seek the best medical care
he can afford.

192
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:26,614
Mr. Soprano has a benign illness.
A few clogged arteries, Your Honor.

193
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,909
I'm leaning towards releasing
this man from lockup.

194
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,580
Unless you can demonstrate
a serious flight risk.

195
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,749
Mr. Soprano.

196
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,587
If I approve this, you will
be under house arrest.

197
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,505
You understand this concept?

198
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,340
Not really.

199
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:49,554
It means that you must remain
in your residence. You cannot leave.

200
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,725
Except for doctor's appointments,
food shopping.

201
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,729
Your Honor, the government asks
for an electronic bracelet.

202
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,983
Your Honor, while we certainly agree
to house arrest...

203
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,861
...we are asking that Mr. Soprano...

204
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:09,073
...not be further persecuted
for yet-to-be-proven allegations.

205
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,036
He shows no prior arrest since 1968.

206
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:17,749
He pays his taxes and he's a veteran
of the Second World War.

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,587
Mr. Soprano, do you have any problem
with wearing an electronic bracelet?

208
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,173
It sounds like Nazi Germany to me.

209
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,969
Obviously you need
a history lesson, sir.

210
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,388
I don't think that we, you and I...

211
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,558
...should let our shared sorrow
or biases...

212
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,310
...enter into this, judge.

213
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,687
He's wearing a bracelet...

214
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,566
...to avoid any risk of flight.

215
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,460
- Who are you?
- Jesus, you scared the shit out of me.

216
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,338
Jesus ain't got nothing
to do with it.

217
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,590
What do you want?

218
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,385
I'm looking for your son.
Is he around?

219
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,054
- You a friend?
- Is he around?

220
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,556
He'll be back here soon.

221
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,936
Well, come on in.

222
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,700
You were a good-looking guy
back then.

223
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:39,330
Still am. Still got the same teeth
as in that picture.

224
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,999
Oh, yeah?

225
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:46,879
Go ahead and laugh. That picture
was taken 57 years ago.

226
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,548
So that makes you...

227
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,467
- Old.
- Come on. How old are you?

228
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,762
- 75.
- Add eight more and you got it.

229
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,682
83.
Get the fuck out of here!

230
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:02,061
- What do you want with my son?
- Gotta discuss a little business.

231
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,147
If you say so.

232
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,567
So you're 28 years old
when World War II starts.

233
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,986
That's a little long in the tooth.

234
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,033
In '43 they was taking everyone,
no matter how old or ugly.

235
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:20,955
They even took a fat boy I knew.
He was already 34.

236
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,167
Wasn't no good to nobody,
except he could cook.

237
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,503
I swear he was more dangerous
with that...

238
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,797
...stove than he was with that rifle.

239
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,175
You ever watch the History Channel?

240
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,053
- Television?
- No, the History Channel.

241
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,057
I think you'd like it.
They even do a lot of that Bible shit.

242
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,518
Only shit in the Bible came out
of Pharaoh's ass...

243
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,812
...when Moses parted the Red Sea.

244
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,150
Parted the Red Sea, praise his name.

245
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:53,654
Never underestimate a man's
determination to be free.

246
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,874
I'll come back at another time.

247
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,724
Break it, you pay for it.

248
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:35,404
If I'd known you were getting out, I
wouldn't have talked to that calzone.

249
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,573
He gave me the message.

250
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,412
Well, don't fucking pout.
Be grateful I'm letting you earn.

251
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,125
What's on your mind?

252
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,711
How'd you swing this?

253
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,134
- Dr. Schreck, he's Monty's kid.
- The bookie's son is a cardiologist?

254
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,514
- It's not bad.
- Feds can't bug your doctor's office.

255
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,225
Lets me use this place sometimes.

256
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,978
To conduct business.

257
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,689
You hear about Massarone Construction?

258
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:14,360
Bacala is taking care of it.
They know he speaks for me.

259
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,073
- It's gotta go 60-40, my way.
- Did you do what I asked?

260
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,785
- What did you ask me to do?
- You know, make peace.

261
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,415
Listen, that's enough with that shit.
That woman is dead to me.

262
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,541
You let it go!

263
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,795
Why? She's my brother's wife.
She doesn't realize half the time.

264
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,464
Let's put our cards on the table.

265
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,218
I heard the tapes the feds made
at Green Grove.

266
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,889
So she's crazy half the time.
Which half did you listen to?

267
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,351
The half that makes no sense, or
the half that played you like a child?

268
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,898
Nobody played me. She didn't know
she was setting you up to get popped.

269
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,319
That's right! Your uncle
isn't as dumb as you think!

270
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,905
You and that miserable fuck, Altieri.

271
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,741
All of my capos
meeting behind my back!

272
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,744
Now you let sleeping dogs lie, okay?

273
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,538
I have my reasons.

274
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,876
I'll tell you one dog you left
barking, that fucking Freddie Capuano.

275
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:16,130
That motherless, money grubbing
little son of a bitch that runs a...

276
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,507
The guy who owns Green Grove?

277
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,135
He's like an old lady, going around...

278
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,347
...telling Soprano business
to anybody who'll listen!

279
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,516
He's the one saying you tried
to whack your mother.

280
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:32,647
Even implied that me and her...
That hairpiece motherfucker!

281
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,619
Did everybody take a vow of silence?
Got anything to report?

282
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,538
I gotta write a report
on DNA for biology.

283
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,707
Isn't that interesting?

284
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,794
I just saw, on Inside Edition...

285
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:59,006
...how there will be no more
unknown soldiers because of DNA.

286
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:04,387
- They can identify all casualties.
- Pass me some more of that macaroni.

287
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,600
Tony, I know you don't like
to talk about her but...

288
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,520
...that woman is impossible.

289
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,108
She's a complete narcissist.
I mean, "me, me, me."

290
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,821
Really, kudos. You are a saint.

291
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,615
You're right, I don't want
to talk about it.

292
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,492
You talking about Grandma?

293
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,331
She pushes those buttons.
She's a big baby, you know?

294
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,047
Excusez-Moi.

295
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,133
Tony.

296
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,012
This is my house.
How many times I gotta say it?

297
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,681
Thank you, II Duce.

298
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,934
Got something to say,
"the little girl who might...

299
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,479
...want to use one of those cars
in the next 100 years"?

300
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,733
It's my fault, Med.

301
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,944
I was insensitive to his feelings.

302
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,531
Thank you.

303
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,952
You see that?
See how easy that was?

304
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,830
So, Mr. Delegated Power of Attorney...

305
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,874
...have you given it any thought?

306
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:19,003
Can my girlfriend have the listing?
To the house?

307
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,797
As long as it gets sold...

308
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,258
...I don't give a fuck who lists it.

309
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,097
- What did one prick say to the other?
- You see that?

310
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,059
You see what happens with you
cursing at the dinner table?

311
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,937
Thanks. It's hard to find people
over 25 to drive with.

312
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,482
Don't tell them you drove me
to buy pot. Which should be legal.

313
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,903
Only thing that works for my hands.
Med, wasn't that a stop sign?

314
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,323
I hate the way he talks to you.
It's so obnoxious.

315
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,077
He's insecure. He's afraid
to leave New Jersey...

316
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,789
...and threatened by freedom.
It's too pathetic.

317
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,250
How about Grandma in that center?

318
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,920
I'm dying to go see her, but
I've had so much homework...

319
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,299
...plus community service I have
to do to get into a good college.

320
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,552
I bring food to homeless shelters.

321
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,554
You know Grandma pretty well?

322
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,264
I guess.

323
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,890
What is she into?

324
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:59,728
- I don't know. Negativity?
- But seriously.

325
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,732
There must be something.
Isn't there anything she likes doing?

326
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,528
My dad used to find her these
old records, these sisters.

327
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:14,034
Oh, the De Castro Sisters, right.

328
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,745
The Andrew Sisters would've
been too easy.

329
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:21,834
- He'd take her that Mario Lasagna guy.
- I hated that shit.

330
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,681
Your glasses will be ready
on Thursday.

331
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,975
Oh, Thursday, that's good.

332
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,644
Did you see me on TV?

333
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:45,232
- You were on TV? What show?
- The evening news.

334
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,236
Oh, yeah, that. What about it?

335
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,239
Well, how'd I look? Be honest.

336
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,494
You looked, you know, like you.
You looked good.

337
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,039
I didn't like the way I looked.

338
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,545
Maybe I should get new frames,
what do you think?

339
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,380
What's wrong with them?

340
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,720
- How much did those frames cost?
- Insurance pays.

341
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:18,224
- I never see the bill.
- Nice country.

342
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:23,103
- I got cataracts.
- My father told me, "Never get old."

343
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,855
I should've listened.

344
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,106
Yeah.

345
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,113
A Chinaman goes to see the eye doctor.

346
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,952
Doctor says, "I see the problem."
Chinaman says, "What?"

347
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,038
Doctor says, "You have a cataract."

348
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,500
The Chinaman says,
"No, I have a Rincoln Continental."

349
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,754
You don't get it?

350
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,590
I get it. He drives a Lincoln.

351
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,176
What?

352
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,921
Excuse me, where's the men's room?

353
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,756
Left, through the doors.

354
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,412
You're awake.

355
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,167
What, what is that?
That music.

356
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,795
Non Ti Scordar Di Me, Pavarotti.

357
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,547
Did you bring it?

358
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,760
I remember how much you liked
a good tenor.

359
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,388
Remember when we saw Mario Lanza
on TV?

360
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,683
You and me and Daddy on the sofa...

361
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,313
...watching Ed Sullivan.
We never missed a Sunday.

362
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,939
Oh, my God.

363
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,025
My children!

364
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,527
Music has charms, Ma.

365
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,154
Thank God, huh?

366
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,692
I think it's time for you to
start considering salads.

367
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,736
What do you mean?

368
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,446
What do I mean?

369
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,824
I mean, get off my car before
you flip it over, you fat fuck.

370
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,411
Junior wants to know when.

371
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,956
Tomorrow morning.

372
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,959
We're short a few guys,
so make sure you're there.

373
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,923
Consider it exercise.

374
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,017
Fat fuck?

375
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,270
Look in the mirror sometime,
you insensitive cocksucker.

376
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,610
Tony, we're sitting down!

377
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,029
Ma, DNA, it's invisible...

378
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,491
...but guess how many nucleotides
per strand?

379
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,658
Just tell her.

380
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,287
- A hundred million.
- Wow, that's amazing.

381
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,790
She knows when we eat.

382
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,959
Don't be setting a plate for her
if she's not here.

383
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,130
Anthony, Jr., want to do the honors?

384
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,844
Bless us our Lord,
and the gifts we are about to...

385
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,013
Hello! Oh.

386
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,643
Good. You guys started without me.

387
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,730
And bless us our Lord, amen.

388
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,444
Janice, if you're gonna be late,
call. Or you're not gonna eat.

389
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,280
Don't send me to bed hungry, Daddy.

390
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,953
Everybody, guess who passed
her driving test?

391
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,164
- She learned from the best!
- Hey, go, girl!

392
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,334
- Congratulations.
- I was nervous, parallel-parking...

393
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,628
...the guy had a clipboard and stuff.

394
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,798
Oh, wow, fascist martinet.

395
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,679
Salsice, Janice?
Oh, I forgot, you don't eat pork...

396
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,557
...in that way.

397
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,227
Oh, I get it.

398
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,730
There's nothing to get.
She's a vegetarian.

399
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,288
I miss the fireflies out West.

400
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,876
That's why I moved out here.

401
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,629
A little bit of nature.

402
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,470
Ever drive by Jimi Hendrix's house
in Seattle?

403
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:45,986
You know, Tony, I know it's not
your favorite subject, but...

404
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,281
...we had some really great news
about Ma today.

405
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,868
Her therapist says
she's making great strides...

406
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,413
...and soon they'll release her.
How can she make strides...

407
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,584
...when nothing's wrong with her?
It's called FaceSaving Therapy.

408
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,587
The patient believes
they're in therapy.

409
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,926
Medicare's not gonna pay for it
if it's not real, would they?

410
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,262
And the taxpayer foots the bill.

411
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:17,684
It's not much longer now.
But she's gonna need a place to stay.

412
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,561
She's out on the street.

413
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,191
- Tony, it is her house.
- Dead people don't have houses.

414
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,943
Daddy bought that house.

415
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,325
Tell you what...

416
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,411
...take her back to Green Grove.

417
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,705
What? The nursing home?

418
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,751
- "Retirement community."
- I don't have that kind of money!

419
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,090
Fuck you.

420
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,847
- What do we want?
- Jobs!

421
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,724
- When do we want them?
- Now!

422
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,728
Should've seen that blimp's face
when I told him he had to be here.

423
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,480
Bacala's always been lazy.

424
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,066
You can't get nobody good anymore.

425
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,568
They're either on drugs
and compromised...

426
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,737
...or young and don't listen.

427
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,239
Please.

428
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,658
It's all "me, me, me."

429
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,620
I hope you don't feel that way
about me. It's just this back.

430
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,539
You've done plenty.

431
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,166
You paid your dues.

432
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,259
- Tony Soprano.
- Yeah.

433
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,470
- What the fuck?
- Hey, Tony!

434
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,139
This is what I mean.

435
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,395
Am I supposed to be seen here?
Idiots!

436
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,024
- Shit!
- Now we look like jerk-offs.

437
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,692
- What do we want?
- Jobs!

438
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,402
- When do we want them?
- Now!

439
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,112
- What do we want?
- Jobs!

440
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,822
- When do we want them?
- Now!

441
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,700
Get out of the way!

442
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,077
- When do we want them?
- Now!

443
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,205
We want to talk to the foreman.

444
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:06,001
- Talk to the foreskin?
- You a wise-ass motherfucker.

445
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,337
Keep your mother off the streets
and I won't fuck her.

446
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,849
Come on! Come on!

447
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,019
Do not bow down, brothers and sisters!

448
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,523
Motherfucker, come on!

449
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,947
Do not bow down!

450
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,533
Hi, Ma!

451
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,204
Oh, Nicholas Antonelli.

452
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,540
"Dead at age 73,"
of heart failure.

453
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,501
MMM...

454
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,379
Ma, you're gonna be getting
out of here soon.

455
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,173
Want to go home?

456
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:54,800
Home?

457
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,885
Back to the house.

458
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,054
My house?

459
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,639
Uh-huh.

460
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:04,101
No, I don't think so.
I'll go back to the other place.

461
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,688
The nursing home? No, that's for
people who don't have anybody.

462
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,984
It's not that bad. And they give
you fresh towels every day.

463
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,403
Barbara said you hated it.

464
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,449
- But it's too much trouble.
- No, Ma, you can't go back there.

465
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,661
- Why not?
- Because.

466
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,040
Because it's dangerous there.

467
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,584
What are you talking about?

468
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,794
The owner...

469
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,671
...is missing.

470
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:37,259
Mr. Capuano.
They suspect foul play. Yeah.

471
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,103
Ma? Ma, you okay?

472
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,068
Nurse! It's my mother.

473
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,323
What is it?
What's the matter?

474
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:05,328
Are you okay, Mrs. Soprano?
Take a deep breath.

475
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,122
Breathe.

476
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:11,001
- Why do they make cookies that way?
- You scared me, Ma.

477
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,296
Would you just stop it?
Stop it.

478
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,758
Just give me a minute!
Go, go, stop hovering!

479
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,308
This may be a good time to talk
about this.

480
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,977
There's no emergency provision
on file.

481
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,480
I tried to talk about a DNR,
and she got very agitated.

482
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,233
- DNR?
- Do Not Resuscitate.

483
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:39,196
It's to save the family anguish
and decisions at a difficult time...

484
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,741
...when there is no quality of life.
Janice!

485
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,411
Where are my glasses?
I can't find the tissues!

486
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,580
Janice?

487
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,751
I'm sorry, Tony, but the hospital
needs a decision on this.

488
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,838
- Auxiliary B, what the fuck?
- If you have power of attorney...

489
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,506
...you have to act like one.

490
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,218
Who gives a fuck, DNR, no DNR?

491
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:02,844
Okay, great.

492
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,514
What if she's in a coma and has to
live on tubes and machines...

493
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,683
...because you won't sign a DNR?

494
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,187
What? When she's a vegetable
she's not gonna care!

495
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,398
To deprive your mother
of a place to live.

496
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,486
To deprive me of my chance
to make peace with my mother.

497
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,280
You know what? Take her.
You can have her.

498
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:26,701
The two of you in that house deserve
each other. It's worth watching.

499
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,788
It'll be like
"Whatever Happened to Baby Janice?"

500
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,623
I'll give you your DNR!

501
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,963
Mom, I can't find the keys.

502
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,632
Keys to what? To the car?

503
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,678
You got a license to drive, not
carouse around on a school night.

504
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,597
I was going to take Anthony
to visit Grandma.

505
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,767
You said we could visit.
You can drive if you want.

506
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,353
Now you want to visit Grandma?

507
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,105
Can we, Mom?

508
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,569
No funny business.
You go to the hospital and back.

509
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:07,200
The level of trust in this family!
Check the mileage if you want. God!

510
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,541
Go ahead, I'll be back later.

511
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,127
- Where are you going?
- Hunter's upstairs.

512
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,461
That's not fair.

513
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,339
- I'm just gonna say hello.
- I'm telling.

514
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,552
And I was gonna let you drive
in the IBM parking lot this Sunday.

515
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,155
Look who's here!

516
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:49,451
Anthony, come over here!
Give your Grandma a kiss.

517
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,368
Oh...

518
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,911
Ah...

519
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,206
I thought you were Janice.

520
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,502
She comes over every day
to play pinochle with me.

521
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,923
Daughters take better care
of their mothers, that's why.

522
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,134
She's home, I think.

523
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,973
You didn't ride over here on your
bicycle in the dark?

524
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,892
No, Meadow drove me.

525
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,811
Meadow? Well, where is she?

526
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,439
- I don't know.
- She's another one.

527
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,983
They don't care about you, Johnny.

528
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,612
No, they stick you away
and forget you ever existed.

529
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,030
I guess.

530
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,449
Oh, have a torrone.

531
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:33,870
- I don't like those Italian candies.
- Oh, go ahead. Take one.

532
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,920
He's not even washing his hands.

533
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:48,385
You know, Louisiana food
isn't really spicy, it's well-seasoned.

534
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,470
Don't they season everything?

535
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,849
Absolutely. So, what we're gonna do
is, I got a little cayenne pepper.

536
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,102
Grandma, what's DNR?

537
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,438
- Who?
- DNR, it's initials. Like...

538
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,399
...I did a report on DNA...

539
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,902
...but Dad and Aunt Parvati
was talking about your DNR.

540
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,029
So is that, like, similar?

541
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,575
Aunt? You mean Janice? Janice?

542
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,037
- They were talking about me?
- About your DNR.

543
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,375
Cause that's what's confusing.
Like, DNA, everybody's got that.

544
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,378
She thinks I should have a DNR?

545
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,755
Or that Dad should give it to you.

546
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,216
Because, what if you went into a coma?

547
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,429
But DNA doesn't prevent comas,
does it?

548
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,683
I don't know.
I gotta do this report by Monday.

549
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,692
Very good, Livia. That's perfect.

550
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,986
I know my alphabet.

551
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,531
Guess what, Ma?
I got great news.

552
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,786
Tony's not gonna sell the house.

553
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:00,081
When you're released,
we're gonna take you back home.

554
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,626
- Really?
- Yeah.

555
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,879
I'm gonna live with you.

556
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,256
Why?

557
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,135
So you can "not resuscitate" me?

558
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,344
So I can what?

559
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,141
I've seen that movie
with Richard Widmark.

560
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,977
- Movie, Ma?
- Oh, Mrs. Soprano.

561
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,562
No, take this one.

562
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,440
She gets her ballet shoes...

563
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,110
...she sells them and takes
the money to Newark...

564
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,113
...and she buys amphetamines.

565
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,741
She was a child then.

566
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,369
I think you should live
with your daughter, Mrs. Soprano.

567
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,665
I think I'm gonna leave
all my money to you, honey.

568
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,960
What are you talking about, money?

569
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:51,007
I've gotta catch up on some charts.

570
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,094
Janice...

571
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,014
...what did I tell you last week?

572
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,184
Where did I put my money?

573
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:06,356
You know this is very important.
I must have put it somewhere.

574
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,401
Come on, Settimia.

575
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:17,075
You don't fool me.
I know what you're thinking about.

576
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,244
My name's Janice.

577
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,705
Janice, Ma. You named me.

578
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,333
It's something else
you threw away of mine.

579
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,590
Are you sure...

580
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,760
...I didn't say where
I put that money?

581
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,930
Let's not worry about that.

582
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,474
Let's just get you better...

583
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,603
...so you can go home
and I can take good care of you.

584
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,523
And if it's there...

585
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,191
...we'll find it.

586
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,714
Your sister's cunt!

587
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:28,563
- That was wonderful, reverend.
- You call us if you need anything.

588
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,064
Thank you.

589
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,191
Good night.

590
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,120
What's all this?

591
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,623
My father has passed away.

592
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,416
I was just talking to him.

593
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:52,128
He lived well.
God blessed him with longevity.

594
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,466
What are you gonna do?
We all will have our time.

595
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,470
My father didn't know about
our business arrangement.

596
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,432
- He wouldn't have approved.
- I got that feeling.

597
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,522
- And your parents?
- Pop's been gone for years.

598
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,982
Mom?

599
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:17,362
She's still around.
She's too miserable to die.

600
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,948
That generation's almost all gone.

601
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,204
When the last one goes, we become
the old folks at the family functions.

602
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,666
What are you saying?
We're still kids.

603
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,334
Don't you believe it, Tony.

604
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:35,922
When the last one dies, it signals
the start of the last stretch for us.

605
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:40,301
Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking
to go anytime soon, it's just...

606
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,306
Just feels funny now, being...

607
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,600
...an elder.

608
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,236
Your end of the demonstration bust-up.

609
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:04,867
Your guys went a little too far.
Rasheen almost lost an eye.

610
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,203
Yeah? How'd you do overall?

611
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,456
Massarone gave me five no-shows.

612
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,084
- Two and a half each.
- Three-two.

613
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:17,630
It should be 3-2, my way.
I gotta kick upstairs to Uncle Junior.

614
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,217
- Two and a half each.
- All your guys are in on this shit.

615
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,971
People find out I'm making money
on their blood, it's my ass.

616
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,725
- Hell, no. Three-two.
- I'll think about it.

617
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,605
What about the asbestos
removal project at the school?

618
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,983
Just waiting to see who gets the bid.

619
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,986
All right.

620
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,614
Hey, rev.

621
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,452
Sorry about your old man.

622
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,711
Hello?

623
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,924
He did? Where is he now?

624
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,556
Hello?

625
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,768
- Oh, you're home!
- How dare you call here.

626
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,312
I called now on purpose.

627
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,773
I know Johnny's at work.

628
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,066
"Anthony," your son, Anthony.

629
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,860
He harbors resentment...

630
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:25,281
...against me, and to this day
I don't know what I did.

631
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,449
I'm hanging up.

632
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,534
I just want you to know...

633
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:32,413
...what pennies I have
I leave to the children.

634
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,291
Your children and Barbara's children.

635
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,003
I raised three children of my own.

636
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,924
I did a pretty good...
pretty good job on two.

637
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:47,720
- They are all unhappy.
- Sure, you listen to that Janice.

638
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,806
Be very careful.

639
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,141
She's a real snake in the grass.

640
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,101
She has no work ethic.

641
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,228
Why is that?

642
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,647
If anything happens to me...

643
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,609
Hello? Hello?

644
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,236
Oh.

645
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,371
Where is he?
Did you call an ambulance?

646
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,457
- I don't need no fucking ambulance.
- See?

647
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,295
Yeah, sure. Look at you.

648
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,966
- We're going to the emergency room.
- Fuck that. I'm all right.

649
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,385
Why not go down there and make sure?

650
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,308
Uncle Jun?

651
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,317
Hey, you still here?

652
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,821
No fucking ambulance.

653
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,992
I'll drive you. Bacala will come.

654
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,911
- Yeah, sure.
- We'll all go.

655
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,289
Help me up.

656
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,416
Can you walk?

657
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,211
- I think he broke his hip.
- Aw, fuck you!

658
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,754
Hold on a minute.

659
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:08,509
I'll be okay.
Give me a minute to catch my breath.

660
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:15,892
All right.

661
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,229
What are you doing?

662
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,440
What do you want, a piggyback?

663
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,442
Get the door.

664
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,569
Anthony!

665
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,822
Don't let me go to my grave
with this guilt.

666
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,867
Listen, you old prick.
You're not going anywhere.

667
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,162
Make things right with your mother.
Please.
