1
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,068
While you slept, we found out
Hunter got into Reed.

2
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,196
- Sayonara!
- Can't you be happy for Hunter?

3
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,574
It's her first choice.
She'd die if she didn't get in.

4
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,952
Why do you think everything
has to do with me?

5
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,328
Because you didn't get in.

6
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,248
Anthony! Nobody is hearing
anything for months.

7
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,126
Hunter took early acceptance
to find out early.

8
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,670
That meant she could only
apply to one college.

9
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,839
Your sister has a lot of options.

10
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,301
Such as: Bowdoin, Holy Cross,
Georgetown...

11
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,428
Georgetown is a reach for me.

12
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,681
They'd be crazy not to want you.

13
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,267
If I can get in,
I can get into Berkeley.

14
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,144
- Over my dead body.
- There are more...

15
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,939
...Nobel Prize winners in the
San Francisco area than anywhere.

16
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,316
Nobel Prize for what? Packing fudge?

17
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,281
You know that you can go anywhere
you want to go to college.

18
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,366
But I'm not gonna pay for Berkeley.

19
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,660
I want to go to Harvard or West Point.

20
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,705
You may get to see them on TV,
but that's about it.

21
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,124
To go there you gotta crack the books.

22
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,474
Stockings, Chris.
How many do you gotta sell...

23
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,685
...to pay the nut on this place?

24
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,062
How can I express how little
I give a fuck?

25
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,690
Sh! What's that?

26
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,318
Fucking rent-a-geek.

27
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,987
Want me to cave the rest
of your head in?

28
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,992
All right, that's bent enough.
Get the crowbar, pop the plate.

29
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,205
Without fail, every time
we're on a job...

30
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,290
The adrenaline affects everybody
differently.

31
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,710
Big Pussy Bompensiero,
he started out as a cat burglar.

32
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,422
One time he left a load so big,
cop thought a bear did it.

33
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,300
Bompensiero started off
chipping safes like this?

34
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,929
Until he stepped up for Soprano
during the unrest of '83.

35
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,932
Back then when you did something,
you got recognized.

36
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:49,353
When your time comes, you either
step up or you look for a new career.

37
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,605
Selling stockings door-to-door.

38
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,865
The Profile Toner is a wonderful,
affordable...

39
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,744
...easily used alternative
to undergoing facelift surgery.

40
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,539
The Profile Toner is great for
any age and body type...

41
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,418
...even for those hereditary
conditions you've given up on.

42
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,962
Carm...

43
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,965
Why don't you take a Xanax
or something?

44
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,095
What is this obsession with Berkeley?

45
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,972
Is she trying to get away from us?

46
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,516
Absolutely. That's her job.

47
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,184
Yeah, go ahead, laugh.

48
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,813
What if she gets into Berkeley
and not into Georgetown?

49
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,192
She's in the National Honor Society.

50
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,444
Don't be naive, Tony. Please.

51
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,072
How do you think Hunter
got into Reed?

52
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,576
Her uncle, that's how.
Him and his wife are graduates.

53
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,329
That's the only way that
freak's gonna get in.

54
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,498
Second baby boom.

55
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,209
Great SAT scores.
It's not enough anymore.

56
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,546
It's all who you know
or how many buildings you give.

57
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,798
What do you want me to do?

58
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,321
- He here?
- Hey!

59
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,949
Someone leave a cage open
at Turtleback Zoo?

60
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,745
Sit down, for chrissake.

61
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,456
I want to talk to you
about Beansie Gaeta.

62
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,208
- He may never walk again.
- Never say never.

63
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:40,672
No, say never. He's a shopping cart,
from here on out.

64
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,633
He gets home from rehab soon,
poor fucker.

65
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,720
- You should help him out.
- Help him out?

66
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,890
You should build him a ramp
for the wheelchair.

67
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:54,770
You know, make the place,
whatchamacallit? Handicap accessible.

68
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,980
Maybe when I'm there
I'll fuck his wife.

69
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,733
Come on.
You're a fucking captain now.

70
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,402
So exert some pressure.

71
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,739
Call that nephew of yours,
Vito, and the other one.

72
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,908
They're in the building trades.

73
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,578
- Wait, are you fucking serious?
- Richie, it's a gesture.

74
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,958
- The man has a lot of friends.
- You're out of your fucking minds.

75
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,254
Don't take that attitude, Richie

76
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,256
You're gonna build Beansie a ramp.

77
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:30,180
I'll build a ramp up to your ass,
drive a Lionel up in there.

78
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,941
Jeannie, hi!

79
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,859
You're putting your roses to bed?

80
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,320
Carmela, hi.

81
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,697
I haven't seen you at spinning class.

82
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,367
I rang the bell,
you weren't home, either.

83
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,203
- Really?
- The other day, I am at the mall...

84
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,915
...I see you on the escalator,
and I'm yelling, "Jeannie!"

85
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,753
Then I realized it was your sister.
Now, didn't she go to Georgetown?

86
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,339
Georgetown Law.
Georgetown Law Review.

87
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,927
Regional secretary of the Georgetown
Alumni Association of Short Hills.

88
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,430
Because my Meadow
applied to Georgetown.

89
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,391
I hope and pray to Jesus
that she gets in.

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,270
She keeps talking about Berkeley.
Madonna, Berkeley!

91
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,023
College already, huh?
They get big so fast.

92
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,900
Oh, God, is that the time?

93
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:28,280
Jeannie, I need to ask you a favor.

94
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,032
I wonder if you'd ask your sister...

95
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,161
...to write Meadow a recommendation.
Is that too much?

96
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,746
But she doesn't really know Meadow.

97
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:41,084
But you do. You could give her the
transcripts, which are excellent.

98
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,255
Her paper on the melting ice cap
made me cry, it's so poignant.

99
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,926
- It was published in the Caduceus.
- My sister's so busy. That's all.

100
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,597
If there's any way you could
find your way to helping me out.

101
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,144
I'll ask her.

102
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,481
Thank you, Jeannie.

103
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,983
I'll let you get back to your plants.

104
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,653
Good, Good, Good.

105
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:13,533
That's it. Push up. Now, bracing
yourself on the bedside hand...

106
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,703
Richie.

107
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,082
- Could you excuse us for a moment?
- No.

108
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,709
Are you all right, Mr. Gaeta?

109
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,089
He's fine. He's so proud,
he won't accept some friendly concern.

110
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,636
Just stay right out in the hall.

111
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,142
What do you want?

112
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,811
Why don't you kill me, you cocksucker?

113
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,191
- Christ, look what you did to me.
- Whose idea was the ramp?

114
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,860
- What ramp?
- The fucking ramp.

115
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,490
If you need help, I'll fucking
help you, you understand?

116
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,202
- You talk to me.
- I don't want jack shit from you.

117
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,749
Okay. I'll leave.

118
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:09,047
But if you go crying
to Tony Soprano one more time...

119
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,299
...if you open your mouth...

120
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,721
...I'm gonna send your arms
where your legs are.

121
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,822
- Liz, I gotta see Adriana.
- She's not here.

122
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:38,201
- Let me in, I gotta talk to her.
- You are not welcome in this house.

123
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:43,248
What the fuck, Adriana! I'm sorry.
How many times I gotta call?

124
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,251
Go! I hate you!
I never want to speak to you again!

125
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,627
I'm calling the police.

126
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,798
Don't be like that. I love you.
I'm going crazy. I miss you.

127
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,801
- I'm dialing 911.
- Why should I listen to you?

128
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,305
So you can dump more wine
in your soup and embarrass me?

129
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,516
- Give me the phone!
- Go in the other room!

130
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,684
Ow.

131
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,145
- I want to marry you.
- What?

132
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:09,941
I mean it, Adriana. I love you.
I want to marry you.

133
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,569
- Got you a ring.
- Don't listen to him.

134
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,529
He's jerked you around for years.

135
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,407
- You're wasting your whole youth.
- Ma...

136
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,578
Open it.

137
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,080
I bet it was in Zane's window
this morning.

138
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,499
I bet there's bits
of broken glass in it.

139
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,168
Ma, would you leave us alone?

140
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,671
Adriana, I hear you sobbing
in your bed at night.

141
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,131
Ma!

142
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:39,929
When you get hurt next time,
this door is closed to you.

143
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,939
Oh, my God.

144
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,736
- Christopher.
- It's three carats.

145
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,784
The guy said you could bring it in
and have it sized if it's loose.

146
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,912
Oh, Christopher.

147
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,917
He had The Mummy before it was
in the theaters.

148
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,338
Look, we're wondering
why the squirrels went quiet.

149
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,384
Oh, this nephew of yours,
what a ball-breaker.

150
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,843
I told him about the tapes.

151
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,804
Yeah, these are the real...

152
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,556
...Hollywood quality
broadcast movies.

153
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:28,937
None of that time-coding bullshit,
blurry pictures those Nigerians sell.

154
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,190
- Oh, you're in on this?
- Ten thousand units.

155
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,402
- What's Johnny Sack say about that?
- Fuck New York.

156
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,449
Better run before
your wife gets home.

157
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,703
I can't be seen associating
with known felons.

158
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,248
What's your excuse for hanging out
with this undesirable?

159
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:53,545
The terms of my house arrest allow me
to do my grocery shopping.

160
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,133
Don't put handprints on the finish!

161
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,094
Last arugula raab from the garden.

162
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,555
Don't drench it in oil this time.

163
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,891
He likes to mop with his bread,
it's not my fault.

164
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,062
What brings you to an English-
speaking neighborhood?

165
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,898
Fucking winghead came to see me.

166
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,859
Paulie?

167
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,447
He said I gotta build a fucking ramp
on Beansie's house.

168
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,409
- Yeah, I know.
- Wait, this was your idea?

169
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,456
Jesus Christ, Tony.
Is this how you spend your time?

170
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,958
Beansie Gaeta would still
sell nickel bags...

171
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,545
...on Jefferson Avenue if it
wasn't for Jackie.

172
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,756
Build Beansie the ramp.

173
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,092
Terrible accident that kid had.

174
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,263
Yeah, it's done.

175
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,557
Come on, come here.

176
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,519
I got something for you.

177
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,447
- What's this?
- What's this? It's the jacket!

178
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,908
- The jacket?
- The jacket...

179
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,578
...I took off Rocco DiMeo.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

180
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,164
Toughest reputation
in Essex County.

181
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,833
Didn't come back after
I finished with him.

182
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,961
- He later died of Alzheimer's.
- Oh, yeah?

183
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,673
- Try it on.
- It's your fucking jacket.

184
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,677
You love this jacket. You and my
brother would've killed for it.

185
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,472
Silk lining. Fine Corinthian leather.

186
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,142
Nobody believed with my size I could
carry this jacket.

187
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,353
But with a belt, it was like Rommel.

188
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,771
It's a...

189
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,315
...nice jacket.

190
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,901
It's a beautiful jacket.

191
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,778
But it's yours to have now.

192
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,113
- Why?
- I gotta let go of the past.

193
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:49,494
Like the Tao says, you gotta shut
one door before another one can open.

194
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,916
Was that so hard to do? You did it.

195
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:03,258
That's it. That's it. Oh!

196
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,177
Huh? Perfect.

197
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,305
You look like Robert Evans over there.

198
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,565
Thanks.

199
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,619
Is that all Tony said?
Did he say anything else?

200
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,579
What do you want him to do?

201
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,458
Give you a kiss? He said
nice swag, and where's his end?

202
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,044
To kick up to Tony Soprano
will be an honor.

203
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,462
He the man.

204
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,799
Thought you said I was the man.
He the man, who the man?

205
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,593
Are we not men?

206
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,187
Oh, listen. Tony's cut from this
thing and that one...

207
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,565
...comes out of your end.
That's how it is in the beginning.

208
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,276
Dues concept. We're down with it.
Right, Gis?

209
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,779
I laid out my take on
the diamond for Ade.

210
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,575
Adriana La Cerva.
There's one hottie!

211
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,787
She loves me and these are
her childbearing years.

212
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,580
Don't see myself getting married.

213
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,626
I get all I need, and I can
hire somebody to wash and iron.

214
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,753
Yeah, I could see that.

215
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,172
No more burritos before work.

216
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,972
Look at this place. Can you
imagine spending day after day here...

217
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,306
...year after year?

218
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,679
- Can I help you?
- Mrs. Gaeta?

219
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,431
- We're here for the ramp.
- Ramp?

220
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,932
For your husband.

221
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,143
You from Outreach at Saint Erasmus?

222
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,894
We're also supposed to...

223
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:06,482
...alter the toilets and widen the
doorways and so on...

224
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,526
...to make the house accessible.

225
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,028
Who sent you here?

226
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:15,324
- Richie Aprile.
- Richie Aprile?

227
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,494
We'll be done before Beansie's
home from the hospital.

228
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,328
Get out of here.

229
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,749
I don't want anything to do
with that man after what he did.

230
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:30,548
She's got problems, but I'm not gonna
tell Richie this isn't getting done.

231
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,813
- Richie.
- Tony.

232
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,650
Rich, this is Matthew Bevilaqua
and Sean Gismonte.

233
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,236
- From West Orange.
- I'm back to Drinkwater.

234
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,696
It's good to meet you.

235
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,450
My cousin Louis worked with you
in the prison sign shop.

236
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,703
Oh, yeah. Lou. 5'8," about 225.

237
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,915
I'll take them to Uncle Joey's
to look at IROCs.

238
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,417
They asked if they could come
and say hello.

239
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,711
You been doing things for
Christopher Moltisanti?

240
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,381
- This and that.
- The attitude on that camel-nose fuck.

241
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,176
He lays his hand on my niece again...

242
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,928
...I'm gonna tear him apart.

243
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,472
- Camel-nose.
- You can't make that shit up.

244
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,224
What are you talking about?

245
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,060
I just did. Ever notice,
he's the only guy...

246
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,730
...who can smoke in the rain
with his hands on his back?

247
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,650
That nose is a natural canopy.

248
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:37,657
- The kid has his good points.
- I know. He's my homie.

249
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,952
- Your what?
- He lives up near me.

250
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,079
Why didn't you say that?

251
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,750
If you talk like a melanzane,
I'll send you to slip-and-fall school.

252
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,002
Fellas, come on. Times up, let's go.

253
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,213
Richie, it was good meeting you.

254
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,259
If there's ever anything you can do
for me, let me know.

255
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,934
- Hi.
- Oh, my God. Did we have a lunch?

256
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,271
- I'm rushing to a deposition.
- I was in the neighborhood.

257
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,108
- Downtown Newark?
- I think I goofed, Joanie.

258
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,610
I don't know how I got
into this conversation.

259
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,864
But Carmela Soprano, from next door,
trapped me...

260
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,702
...into asking you to write her kid
a recommendation to Georgetown.

261
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,788
- The gangster's wife?
- I'm sorry.

262
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,417
She blind-sided me in the back yard.
What was I supposed to say?

263
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:33,379
That I'm busy, which I am.
That I don't even know the girl.

264
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,175
Come on, you met Meadow.
Fourth of July, at our barbecue.

265
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,970
That's not what I mean.
You can't expect me to do this.

266
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,183
It's just a letter.
Bruce just wrote one to UVM.

267
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,685
You do it all the time!

268
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,189
Gangsters, on the Georgetown campus?
I don't think so.

269
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,482
Oh, spare me the elitist bullshit.

270
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,068
- They're neighbors!
- Have you lost your mind?

271
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,237
Carmela asked me, Joan.

272
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,948
Are you frightened?
What are they gonna do?

273
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,826
Put you in cement boots over
an application?

274
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,371
It's not that. It's about manners.
What will I say?

275
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,499
I'm writing a letter
for someone else, which I am.

276
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,670
A wonderful Dominican boy from
the projects, with a 5.2 average.

277
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,923
I have a reputation to protect.

278
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,261
- I knew you wouldn't do it.
- You want to be a doormat forever?

279
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,223
Just deal with it, Jeannie, okay?

280
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,229
It's no trouble at all
to add two more.

281
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,231
Especially with Ms. Meadow missing.

282
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,069
Don't be silly. We dropped by to get
Ma's furniture from the basement.

283
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,239
- "Ma," now?
- Hugh, sit with me and Anthony.

284
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,908
Let Janice's friend sit at the foot.

285
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,077
Grandpa, after dinner, Hot Wheels?

286
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,370
Ooh.

287
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,288
Something smells good.

288
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,667
It's much cozier this way.
The more the merrier.

289
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,046
This is what it's all about.
Friends, family.

290
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,965
It's what I missed all those years.

291
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,384
You are always welcome, Richie.

292
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,094
I hope you're hungry for roast.

293
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,888
- Let me help.
- Ma, sit down. Janice, sit.

294
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,266
Everything's under control.

295
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,521
Oh, Janice, sit. Really, sit.

296
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,357
- Hey, how's the jacket?
- What jacket?

297
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:20,152
I gave your little brother
a beautiful leather jacket.

298
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,447
- You still liking the jacket?
- It's terrific.

299
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,617
Excuse me, I gotta get the Ginzu.

300
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,953
- What jacket?
- With the belt.

301
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,125
Where's my knife?

302
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,378
I want to compliment you
on your behavior out there.

303
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,130
I want him where I can see him.

304
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,258
That's what we mean
when we say "family."

305
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,641
I'm sorry. I know I'm late.

306
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,686
Said you could stay overnight,
not miss dinner.

307
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,272
I said I'm sorry.
You could've paged me.

308
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,191
- Any mail yesterday?
- It's where it always is.

309
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,569
But go set yourself a place,
we have company.

310
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,536
What happened to this?

311
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,290
- Hello?
- Carmela? Hi.

312
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:18,169
- It's Jeannie Cusamano.
- Oh, hi! Hi, how are you?

313
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,672
Listen, Carmela.
I spoke to my sister about the letter.

314
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,676
And she's sorry, but she just
can't do it. I'm sorry.

315
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,720
She can't? Why not?

316
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,057
Because she already wrote a letter
for someone else.

317
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,602
A wonderful Dominican man
from the housing projects...

318
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,313
...with a 5.2 average and...

319
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,525
...crack-addict mother,
and cerebral palsy.

320
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,322
What does that mean?
She can't send two?

321
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,325
Did you think to ask one of
the priests at church?

322
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:53,287
A letter from Father Intintola would
mean more, I bet.

323
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,164
Especially at Georgetown.

324
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,667
I gotta go. Bye. Good luck!

325
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,755
Who was that?

326
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,093
- Can't send two what?
- It's nothing.

327
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,977
Joan, I don't want to interrupt you...

328
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,606
...but a Carmela Soprano is here.
You're kidding.

329
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,609
She's not in your Day-Timer.
Want me to handle it?

330
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,405
Oh, Christ. Send her in.

331
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,533
Excuse me.

332
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,536
Joan, hi. Is this a bad time?

333
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,705
Always. Come on in.

334
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,709
- Ricotta pie with pineapples.
- Oh, well.

335
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,296
I was in the neighborhood.
My mother's foot surgeon is here.

336
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,006
Thank you.

337
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,969
Listen, I think I know
why you're here.

338
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:55,307
My sister told me you want me to write
a letter to Georgetown for Fielder?

339
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,060
- Meadow.
- Oh, sorry.

340
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,895
But I just can't do it.

341
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:05,234
I thought you would at least want to
look at her grades and SAT scores...

342
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,736
...and teacher comments
before you decide.

343
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,656
She'd be a wonderful
addition to Georgetown.

344
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,451
Then the admissions officers
will see that.

345
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,456
I'm not sure that's true. The sad
fact is, that's not enough these days.

346
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,334
I'm sorry, Carmela.
But I can't do it.

347
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,670
I don't think you understand.

348
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,631
I want you to write that letter.

349
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,760
- Excuse me?
- I want you to write the letter.

350
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,930
- Are you threatening me?
- Threat? What threatening?

351
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,392
I brought a pie, and a transcript
so you could write...

352
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,270
...a letter for my
daughter to Georgetown.

353
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,607
- I'm an officer of the court.
- A lawyer.

354
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,195
Don't make me beg here.

355
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:54,116
I've written my last letter of
support for this academic year.

356
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,745
How about this? You could
write a letter to Georgetown...

357
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:01,457
...about discovering it
wasn't that person's first choice...

358
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,668
...and that he was using
Georgetown as a backup.

359
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,462
I'm not telling you what to write.

360
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,091
Oh, I left my mother
in the car with that foot.

361
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,677
Thanks for this.

362
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,358
Ask the kid to fix me a burger.

363
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,693
- Holy fuck. Shit.
- It's him.

364
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,822
- We should've said hello.
- Or asked him what time it was.

365
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,744
Think we should go in?

366
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,496
Wait, you got...

367
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,873
- How do I look?
- Good.

368
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,501
Your hair...

369
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,846
- Hi, Tony. How the fuck's it going?
- How you doing?

370
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,350
Matt Drinkwater. Bevilaqua's nephew.
Sean Gismonte.

371
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,270
Friends of Christopher.
Worked the card game.

372
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,021
I know. How you doing?

373
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,774
That dancer, Destinee out there?

374
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,527
I'd like to break my dick off
in her ass.

375
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:28,085
Chrissy spoke to us about it.
We should give you a taste from...

376
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,713
Jesus Christ, you stupid
shit-eating twat.

377
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,048
You ever hear of wiretaps?

378
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,429
- Look what you did.
- You made me do all the talking.

379
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,140
You always do that.
You get all quiet...

380
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,726
...you leave me hanging in
the fucking wind.

381
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,356
What's so important you make
a man late for the first post?

382
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,108
We heard from Gia Gaeta...

383
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:55,988
...your nephews ripped up the house
and then haven't been back there.

384
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,116
I needed them to do work
on Janice's mom's house.

385
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,786
Which, all do respect,
is also your boss's mother's house.

386
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,415
- Gentlemen.
- Ton, these guys...

387
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,585
...won't shut up about this ramp.

388
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:15,174
Richie, relax, sit down.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

389
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,811
Where's the jacket?
You're not wearing the jacket.

390
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,314
It's in the car. You want it back?

391
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,109
I gave Tony a jacket I took
off Rocco DiMeo.

392
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,156
Cocksucker had a reputation as being
the toughest guy in Essex County.

393
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,701
He didn't come back when
I got through with him.

394
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,580
We did an interview.
She was the first celebrity...

395
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,166
Carmela?

396
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,293
Oh, hi.

397
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:52,544
Hi.

398
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,962
Jean, hi. Come on in.

399
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:58,801
Your plate. My sister said
the ricotta pie was delicious.

400
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,469
The family loved it.

401
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,472
She also said she reviewed
Meadow's transcripts...

402
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,351
...and she was knocked the fuck out
by those recommendations.

403
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,145
She wrote a terrific letter
to Georgetown.

404
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,065
That's wonderful. Do you have a copy?

405
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,694
No, but I'll get you one. No problem.

406
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:21,073
Thank you so much.
Jean, you are a wonderful friend.

407
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,579
Did I tell you how impressed Joan
was with Meadow's transcripts?

408
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,498
You did, thank you.

409
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,884
Howie T, bro,
blood's flaying on the mix.

410
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:46,724
We ought to score some Vegas,
kick the fucking bass up on this TV.

411
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,520
What the fuck was that?

412
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,297
Fuck! It's that zip Furio
and somebody.

413
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,341
Fuck, let him in before
he kicks the door down.

414
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,148
- Furio, right?
- We're here for the money.

415
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,985
- Money?
- The boss's money.

416
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:44,907
Oh, the money. Okay, yeah, sure.
Sean, get out Antonio's money.

417
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,370
Bella televisione.

418
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,873
HDTV Compatible.

419
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,836
You guys want something to drink?
Beer?

420
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,338
Just the money.

421
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,140
Ten percent, right? $7500.
It's all there.

422
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,269
Give me $1000.

423
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,564
One thousand more?

424
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,150
- Chris said 10 percent.
- One thousand dollars.

425
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:25,364
I can't believe this. You're
ripping us off. This is bullshit.

426
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,080
Come on, hurry up.

427
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,846
These two suck each
other's cocks.

428
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,597
What'd you say to him?

429
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,226
Have a nice day.

430
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,745
Jesus-fucking-Mother-of-Christ,
Christopher.

431
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:21,670
- You want one?
- No, I'll have a puff of yours.

432
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,301
- Man.
- I know.

433
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,017
If I knew it was gonna keep
getting better...

434
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,728
...I would've asked you
to marry me sooner.

435
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,813
Like it wasn't always good?

436
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:40,939
Ow.

437
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,278
- Christopher?
- What?

438
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:51,491
Nothing. Just, I love my ring.

439
00:31:56,664 --> 00:32:01,084
T was right. He set me straight,
that shit he said to me:

440
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,713
"No more distractions. Focus.

441
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,634
No drugs. Eye on the prize."

442
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,677
I'm back on track, Adriana.

443
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,972
I'm rededicating myself right
down the line.

444
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:21,480
- I don't know why we always fight.
- My fault. I don't express my needs.

445
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,318
- We waste so much time.
- You're right.

446
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,612
Let's not...

447
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,494
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

448
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,594
Lilliana, can you get that?

449
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,685
Richie, what a surprise!
What brings you this way?

450
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,895
How are you today, dear?

451
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:06,358
This is a thank-you for Sunday dinner,
some tripe and tomatoes I made.

452
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,528
We gotta be the only two people
who still like tripe.

453
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,406
Oh, my God, Richie. Thank you.

454
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,993
It's for you, for dinner,
for whatever you want to do with it.

455
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,913
Oh, my God, the kids are gonna
freak out when they see this.

456
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,127
- I made some fresh drip, want a cup?
- Sure, why not?

457
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,757
So, Richie, you and Par...
"Janice."

458
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,884
This is no flash in the pan.

459
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:39,016
It's ironic how life works.
She goes to Sri Lanka, or wherever...

460
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:44,312
...I go where I went, and here we are
back where we started, 20 years ago.

461
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,483
For every shoe there is a mate.

462
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,947
Mrs. Carmela, sorry, but my husband
has come to get extra TV set...

463
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,242
...you said I could have.
Sure, go right ahead.

464
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,083
If there's one thing we don't
lack here, it's TV sets.

465
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:11,006
Lilliana, the remote is down there
somewhere too, it's on the shelves.

466
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:16,011
- Hello, missus. Thank you for TV.
- Oh, Stasiu, please. Enjoy.

467
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:22,184
The poor thing. In Poland he was
a mechanical engineer...

468
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,770
...here, he's driving a cab.

469
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,189
What's the matter? You all right?

470
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,857
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

471
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,486
I gotta go.

472
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,540
Answering machine.
Christopher, where is he?

473
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,042
He's always here.

474
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,648
- This is fucked.
- What?

475
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,401
This. Us. Look at us.
We're like two scared rabbits.

476
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,278
- Douche bags.
- Don't say that.

477
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,573
Sean, grow up to reality.
We are nowhere.

478
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,786
Buying fish? Punching safes?
What is that? And for what?

479
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,788
We're just starting.
It's what you do.

480
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:28,208
We got stockbroker licenses.
I went to Pace College!

481
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:41,304
- Fuck. It's true, huh?
- We're fucked.

482
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,015
We gotta do something to get ahead.

483
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,855
Mom, I don't believe it,
and don't deny it!

484
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,566
I told you not to let Lilliana
into my room!

485
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,527
Look at the money they waste
on these CD-ROMs.

486
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:59,239
MindSpring, Earthlink,
what are these exactly?

487
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,200
Don't change the subject!
It's my room!

488
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,661
There were clothes a foot deep
on the floor.

489
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,329
You had half the bath towels.

490
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,666
- Don't exaggerate.
- Wet! It was starting to smell.

491
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,377
It's my room,
and that's the way I want it!

492
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:16,506
- I don't bitch about your room!
- Your room is in my house.

493
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,675
As long as you live here,
there are limits.

494
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,011
I won't be here for long!
I'm 18...

495
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,514
...going to college. I can
take care of myself, so bug out!

496
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,184
- Oh, you can?
- That's right!

497
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,065
You know what? You're right.

498
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,694
You are right.
You can take care of yourself.

499
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,696
Thank you.

500
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,658
You're going off on your
own to a wonderful college.

501
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,994
What right do I have to interfere?

502
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:07,224
- What's going on?
- Nothing I can think of.

503
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,769
Except it's Tuesday, 3:00.

504
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,021
So we gotta talk about something.

505
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,568
Okay, spin the wheel.

506
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,073
Here's something that's been
bothering me.

507
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,575
- I gave my daughter a car.
- Really?

508
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:29,955
Yeah, a used car. One of those SUVs.
You know, a '92 Pathfinder.

509
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,333
It belonged to a friend
of hers from school.

510
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,504
It came into my possession because
of a debt by the kid's father.

511
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,798
This is the way he made payment.

512
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,717
You gave her her friend's car?

513
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,471
It was a nice, safe car to which
I had the pink slip.

514
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,973
What's bothering you?

515
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,936
I must've known she'd know that it
was this kid's car...

516
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:58,233
...and how I got it.
You know, and she'd freak out.

517
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,444
- Then why'd you give it to her?
- I don't know.

518
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,243
For all these years I been shielding
and protecting her...

519
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,412
...from certain truths.

520
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,126
- So now I want to rub her nose in it?
- Any thoughts on that?

521
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:26,386
Well, this kid's father,
he's a fucking degenerate gambler.

522
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:31,182
But also a respected businessman
in the community and so on.

523
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,436
- One of your "Happy Wanderers."
- How do you remember this?

524
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,859
So it becomes my fault
he lost his kid's car?

525
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,946
I gotta look out for this bastard?
My friend Artie's got a restaurant.

526
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:49,034
Now, no one's telling him
to refuse a plate of fettuccine...

527
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,454
...to some fat fuck wandering in
eating himself to death.

528
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,499
Maybe that's what you said to her.

529
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,294
- What?
- By giving her the SUV.

530
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:04,049
- Wanting her to confront ambiguities.
- English.

531
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,137
Meadow's going to be going away
to college next year.

532
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,973
- That's why she needs the car.
- Leaving the nest.

533
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,976
- Not those fucking ducks again.
- Maybe you were...

534
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,314
...preparing her for reality, to fly.
You people are something.

535
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:24,152
I give my little daughter a car
to rub her face in shit...

536
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,321
...and you tell me
I did something noble?

537
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,989
We're getting to something here.

538
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,081
- Times up.
- Look, we're doing good work.

539
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,501
What? You feel you're cured?

540
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,088
Fine, I'll sit here.
But I got nothing else to say.

541
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:55,266
Yeah. Did you call me?
Oh, get the fuck out of here.

542
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,561
I'm supposed to go all the way
there to check a ramp?

543
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,856
- Christopher, what's up?
- Hey, what's up, man?

544
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,777
Get that motherfucker!

545
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,616
- Get him!
- Fucking seat belt!

546
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,020
- Richie.
- Yeah, what?

547
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,814
Matt Drinkwater, Bevilaqua.

548
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,899
Hear what happened to Christopher?

549
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,319
- Yeah, somebody blew him up.
- It was us. Me and Sean.

550
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,450
- It was what? You?
- Sean's dead. Christopher killed him.

551
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,245
- So, what are you doing here?
- We did it for you. A favor.

552
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,081
- What are you saying?
- You don't like him.

553
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,916
- So what?
- He hit your niece.

554
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,923
Jesus, are you crazy?
That's all I need now for that fuck...

555
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,592
...to think I had a part of this.

556
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:15,430
- You gotta help me, man.
- I'll help you. I'll fucking help you!

557
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,392
Hide me, I'm with you now.

558
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:24,772
Who told you to do that? Get out of
here, you dumb fuck! I'll kill you!

559
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:45,835
How can this happen?
How could this happen?
