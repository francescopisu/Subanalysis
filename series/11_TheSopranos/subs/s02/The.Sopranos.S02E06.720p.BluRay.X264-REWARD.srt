1
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:46,271
Our undergrad student body at Brown
only numbers about 6000 people.

2
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,943
That's from every state in the country
and over 60 countries in the world.

3
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,445
Admission is extremely selective.

4
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:58,367
So again, get all of your academic
and extracurricular ducks in a row.

5
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,911
Leave nothing to chance.

6
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,546
Hey, buddy.

7
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,964
Davey.

8
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,050
Saw your wife alone.
I figured you for the trotters.

9
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,595
Not tonight.
I had a customer I couldn't shake.

10
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,597
Guy spends half an hour...

11
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,851
...deciding between a $20 soccer ball
and a $22 soccer ball.

12
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,644
Who do you like?

13
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,106
That guy from Bowdoin seems
to be making some sense.

14
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,066
No, I mean the game tonight.

15
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,901
Ho, ho, ho!

16
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,737
You guys want to be alone?

17
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,616
I saw that refreshment table.
I knew you'd be around.

18
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,785
How do I get roped into this?

19
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:46,290
Charmaine knows with your sfogliatelle
her daughter can go anywhere.

20
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:51,295
- The janitor's the only one near them.
- That's a nice career for a lady.

21
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,463
Fuck you.

22
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,967
- I gotta get one of them belly bombs.
- Have I said "fuck you" yet?

23
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,475
Delicious, Artie.
Glad I didn't eat tonight.

24
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,896
Thanks, Davey. It's nice
to be appreciated by your friends.

25
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,397
The sensitive chef.

26
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,900
- Hey, Eric, they all done?
- I guess.

27
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,360
Dad, can I have 20 bucks?

28
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,530
- You like this?
- Did you think he was gonna say:

29
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,868
"Gee, Dad, thanks for taking the time
to come to this important event"?

30
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,038
- How you doing, Eric?
- Good, Mr. Soprano.

31
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,333
- You want something to eat?
- No, we're going to Starbucks.

32
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,835
You're thinking of going to Brown?

33
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,963
Yeah, it's a good school.
A lot of star-fucking though.

34
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,257
- Hey, latrine lip.
- He's right.

35
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,843
He'll go where his mother says,
like his old man.

36
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,929
You too?

37
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,139
These guys were like Namath
and Tittle.

38
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,058
Yeah, I've heard.

39
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,019
And now they're like Phil Donahue
and Alan Alda.

40
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,192
Listen, I heard...

41
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,153
...through the grapevine
you took your uncle's game.

42
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,988
You know, the big one.

43
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,741
- Grapevine?
- Yeah.

44
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,618
If you listen close, that song says:

45
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,704
"Believe none of what you hear
and half of what you see."

46
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,249
You know me. I like to play a little.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,667
A little?

48
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,169
Forget it. This game's not for you.

49
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,340
No, it's just, you know,
I was thinking it'd be a kick.

50
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,094
David, you're a nice guy.
I like you. Okay?

51
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:26,181
Trust me, this game's not for you.
I don't want to see you get hurt.

52
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,558
These guys, they play deep.

53
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,355
- Know how many jockstraps I sell?
- Not enough for this game.

54
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,274
Okay? Forget it.

55
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,320
Come on. Let's go see what the
Y.O. from Bucknell's got to say.

56
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,285
Do you want to tell me
what you're thinking?

57
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,290
Believe me, you don't want to know.

58
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,797
You want to know what I'm thinking?
Seriously?

59
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:05,470
I'd like to smash
your face into hamburger.

60
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,848
Okay.

61
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,476
I'm not...

62
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,646
Don't worry.

63
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,774
I know I broke
your coffee table and...

64
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,818
It's not gonna happen again.

65
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,779
You asked, I told.

66
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,866
- But you'd like to smash my face.
- Not really.

67
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,077
It's just a way of describing
how I'm feeling.

68
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,205
Making hamburger out of me
would make you feel better?

69
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,166
Is this a woman thing?

70
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,627
You ask me how I'm feeling.
I tell you how I'm feeling.

71
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,921
And now you torture me with it?

72
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,550
I don't know who the fuck
I'm angry at. I'm just angry, okay?

73
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,892
Why the fuck am I here?
I even asked to come back.

74
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,437
I got the world by the balls and can't
stop feeling like a fucking loser.

75
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,273
Who makes you feel like a loser?
Your mother?

76
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,360
Please, we wasted
enough oxygen on that one.

77
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,613
It's everything and everybody.

78
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,492
I see some guy walking down the
street, you know, with a clear head.

79
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,329
You know the type, he always whistles
like the Happy-fucking-Wanderer.

80
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,831
I just want to go
and rip his throat open.

81
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,668
I want to fucking grab him and pummel
him right there for no reason.

82
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,672
Why should I care
if a guy's got a clear head?

83
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,591
I should say, "Good for you."

84
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,554
- Let's get back to smashing my face.
- Jesus Christ.

85
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,390
Ahh.

86
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,351
No, I think it all ties in.

87
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,442
All right. Sometimes I resent
you making me a victim.

88
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,610
That's all.

89
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,446
- I make you feel like a victim?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,533
Remember the first time
I came here I said...

91
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,703
...the kind of man I admire is Gary
Cooper, the strong, silent type.

92
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,499
And how all Americans are doing
is crying and complaining.

93
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,001
A bunch of fucking pussies.
Fuck them!

94
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,379
And now I'm one of them, a patient.

95
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,257
Your parents made it impossible
for you to experience joy.

96
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,967
See? There you go again.

97
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,594
You said you're not
the Happy Wanderer.

98
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,596
I'm more like one of them...

99
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,392
...than I am the jerkoffs
I see leaving this office!

100
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,021
Stop with the faces already.
What do you got?

101
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,108
Three eights full. Santa Maria, yes!

102
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,652
Santa Maria? More like Santa Claus.

103
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,946
- Did you cut the pot?
- Twice.

104
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,324
Here. Make sure you spend it
in my restaurant, you prick.

105
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,954
One chip? Ma va' a Napoli, you can't
even buy McDonald's with that!

106
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,373
- That's it, I gotta go.
- Come on, another hour.

107
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,460
I can't. Charmaine'll have
my balls on the menu tomorrow.

108
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,753
- Cash me out.
- Look at all the money!

109
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,090
- Rich, can I get another dime?
- We only got three players.

110
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,967
Vito's up for it, right?

111
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:53,138
Where the fuck do I gotta be?
Only, let's up the ante.

112
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,475
You're into me for seven G's already.

113
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,728
That's all? I'll make that back
from Vito in an hour.

114
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,522
Count this ciucio out another dime.

115
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,019
Well, we have our work cut out for us.

116
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,937
Gudren?

117
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,331
Meadow?

118
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,833
I'd like to talk to you.

119
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,754
It really sounds good.
I know you're disappointed.

120
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,842
When you try out, the form asks
what you want and I checked "solo."

121
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,137
You seniors!
This is your last chance at Cabaret.

122
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:20,016
Gudren hasn't had a solo.
I like to give everyone a shot.

123
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,853
Mrs. Gaetano, I was a sophomore
when I did Spider Woman.

124
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,189
Now it's important because of college.

125
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,903
- You okay with this?
- Do I have a choice?

126
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,406
Yeah, you could
continue to run the game.

127
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,243
You know I'm under fucking house
arrest, you cute fuck.

128
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,537
Then take it and be happy.

129
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,540
Either way, I'm having
the executive game.

130
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,209
Your father and me started
that game 30 years ago.

131
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,130
We were talking one day
about how credit card companies...

132
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,590
...work their angle.

133
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,135
They didn't care what you bought
if you don't pay all at once.

134
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,471
They juice you, you thank
them for letting you have a card.

135
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,932
You'd rather be juiced
than pay at once.

136
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,101
That's a certain kind of player.

137
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,562
That's why we call it
the executive game.

138
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,772
My brother Johnny was keen.

139
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,818
Oh, yeah. That's why he left us
with cici beans.

140
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,529
You don't know
what you're talking about.

141
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,742
Your father left Livia with a package
that could choke a fucking elephant.

142
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,411
I gotta tell you?

143
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,416
She's like a woman with a ham, crying
the blues because she has no bread.

144
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,211
Please. They don't make them
like Johnny.

145
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,548
Keep in mind that he paid freight
for your Uncle Ercole, buon'anima.

146
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,634
That was a major fucking nut.

147
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,595
Who? Who the fuck is Ecle?

148
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,972
Keep thinking you know everything.

149
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,100
Some are so far behind in a race
they believe they're leading.

150
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,853
Yeah, that's cute.
Who the fuck is Ecle?

151
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,105
Ercole. Let's talk something else.

152
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,650
No, you opened this clam.
Who is he?

153
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,194
You don't know him.
It's water under the bridge.

154
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,947
Me and your father looked out for him.
He wanted for nothing.

155
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,450
I don't have time for this shit.

156
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,870
He was my younger brother,
between me and your father in age.

157
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:08,124
His name was Ercole. Actually, Ercole.

158
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,627
Hercules, named after my grandfather.

159
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,257
What are you saying?

160
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,594
- I got another uncle?
- Sharp as a fucking cue ball.

161
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:24,933
Yeah, we had a brother you
didn't know about because he was...

162
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,855
It was different in those days.

163
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:35,568
My parents didn't speak English and
couldn't take care of a kid like that.

164
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,656
But God bless your grandmother.

165
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,867
She went to every charity home
in this fucking state...

166
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,370
...till she found one
to take care of him.

167
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,165
- Are you saying he was retarded?
- Why don't you go fuck yourself?

168
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,500
He was slow.

169
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,838
He was strong as a fucking bull,
handsome like George Raft.

170
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,759
If it was today, they might
have trained him to be a whatever.

171
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,720
Get him a job.

172
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,056
They didn't understand
these things back then.

173
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,767
Jesus.

174
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,521
- What were we thinking?
- Un-fucking-believable.

175
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,569
I remember my mother and father
arguing about... I don't know.

176
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,740
She kept talking about my father's
feeble-minded brother.

177
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,575
I thought she meant you.

178
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,750
What a kick in the balls.
When did he die?

179
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,043
Not long before your father.

180
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,380
Past is the past.
This is the present.

181
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,300
Let's talk about this game.
What's my end?

182
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,305
- I don't know. Ten percent.
- Twenty.

183
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,850
Fifteen.

184
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:53,438
Call your friends.
Let them know the game's happening.

185
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,910
Can I help you with something, sir?

186
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,163
Yeah, I want to buy a boat
with three propellers.

187
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,332
- What?
- Kid...

188
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,085
...you see me here every week.
When are you gonna stop asking?

189
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,837
Ho, Rich!

190
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:23,468
- Is there a problem?
- I'm just breaking your kid's balls.

191
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:33,269
Like the pimp says to his hos,
"Keep them coming."

192
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,816
Rich, that envelope's two C's shy.
I'll catch up on it next week.

193
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,568
It's no problem.
I just got caught off guard.

194
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,447
I took a second on the house,
didn't calculate it into my budget.

195
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,117
- No good, Davey.
- It's just a stutter step. No biggie.

196
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,912
The difference gets tacked
on to the principal.

197
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,915
- And you know that.
- Yeah, I understand.

198
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,626
Now don't take this personally...

199
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:01,631
...but I don't want to see your face
at my games until you're caught up.

200
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,133
Come on, Rich. That's not necessary.

201
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,262
You think I started this life
ten minutes ago?

202
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,432
A guy hands you a light envelope,
it's just the beginning.

203
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,851
Nothing personal.

204
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,020
- I know, but it's just this...
- I know.

205
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,731
It's just a stutter step.

206
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,533
- What kind is that?
- Brazilian snapper.

207
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,869
- Is it fishy?
- It's fish.

208
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,205
You know what I mean.
It's for pizzaiola, let me smell one.

209
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,171
- You want something?
- Give me enough of that for 15 people.

210
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,173
And ten pounds of shrimp.

211
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:55,768
There's gonna be some serious money.
This is no nickel-and-dime shit.

212
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,897
These motherfuckers can play
for two days straight.

213
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,984
Now once you start work, you
don't go until the game breaks up...

214
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,070
...and that fucking place looks
like an operating room.

215
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,531
You mean we're, like, cleaning guys?

216
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,161
- What are you doing?
- Something ain't right.

217
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,705
I saw you put
your finger on the scale.

218
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,459
- No, I didn't.
- Pull that with old ladies, not me.

219
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,878
I didn't put my finger on the scale.

220
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,546
I don't believe this shit.

221
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,882
Where you going? Wrap that up!

222
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,718
- I gotta weigh...
- You gotta what? Rob me?

223
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,228
Yeah, you serve some booze,
empty the ashtrays.

224
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,480
That reminds me.

225
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,275
Whatever you do, don't engage
Silvio in conversation.

226
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,986
He can be a sick fuck
when he's gambling.

227
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:51,783
Once he was down 50 large.
He sneezes, Fritzi says "salute."

228
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,410
Fritzi Neste from Hoboken?

229
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,079
- Yeah, you know him?
- No.

230
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,083
Then shut up and let me finish.
Anyway, Fritzi says "salute."

231
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,293
Silvio thinks he said something else.

232
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,839
For the rest of the night, Silvio
blamed Fritzi for his losing streak.

233
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,093
- What did he think he said?
- Are you listening?

234
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,011
He's a fucking nut. Who knows?

235
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,932
Here.

236
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,434
I didn't put my finger on no scale.

237
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,771
Put that shit in the trunk
so it don't stink up the car.

238
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,690
Pay for the fish.

239
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,738
Is this guy for real or what?
We're fucking piss boys?

240
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,449
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

241
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,929
We want the room with the stove
and the refrigerator.

242
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,807
The efficiencies are booked
to paying customers.

243
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,311
And the two rooms on the sides.
We may be here for some days.

244
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,565
- You people are ruining this place.
- That's your father's fault.

245
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,150
He made the deal.

246
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,571
We want a lot of clean towels
and the bathrooms fresh-smelling.

247
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,323
I should work for nothing?

248
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,666
You ever suck his dick?

249
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,964
I make that beanie spin
when I work his thing.

250
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,341
Am I right?

251
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,722
Don't bitch to me.

252
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,706
What do you say?

253
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,833
License and registration.

254
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,128
How about this instead?

255
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,755
- I'm wearing a vest.
- Oh, yeah?

256
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,175
If I shoot, it's going
in your braciola.

257
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,385
You're a real sick fuck.

258
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,806
Danny-boy!

259
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,767
- How's the family?
- Not bad, Paulie.

260
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,728
We had to move my father
to another old folks'...

261
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,606
I got my own fucking problems.

262
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,735
How many times will I fall for that?

263
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,570
Here.

264
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,697
Listen. Do me a favor, right?

265
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,241
Your friends...

266
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,079
...players or no, they don't fuck with
the tourists and the hotel guests.

267
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,665
No gunshots or we gotta take the call.

268
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,835
Go play cops and robbers.

269
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,295
Make it four.

270
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,048
Change coming to you.

271
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,716
Mike.

272
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,846
- Hey, Mike.
- Matt, Tony wants you.

273
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,184
- Yeah, T?
- Tony. Got the Macanudos?

274
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,521
- Yeah, you want one?
- Give one to me, one to Dr. Fried.

275
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,778
Gentlemen? Frank?

276
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,780
Yeah, I'm in.

277
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,949
Me too.

278
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,495
Four hundred to you, Sil.

279
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,624
- What's in the pot?
- About 2400.

280
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,962
- Too soon to chase an inside straight.
- Doc?

281
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,839
Call.

282
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,468
- Macanudos, you want one?
- Go ahead, take a walk.

283
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,139
Don't let him scare you.
He's not really a nasty fuck.

284
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,183
He's an incredibly nasty fuck.

285
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,810
Hey, chair-boy of the board,
read your cards.

286
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,104
Four hundred to you, John.

287
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,901
Shakespeare's straightening out.
Paulie doesn't have shit as usual.

288
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,487
And the prick doctor may be flushing.

289
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,825
Put the TV trays out between each
player. Put some of this on them.

290
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,787
Don't give anyone booze unless
they ask for it, all right?

291
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,420
I heard Tony was here. Soprano.
I'm a friend of his.

292
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,839
- Do I know you?
- Yeah, you know me.

293
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,342
I own Ramsey's Sports and Outdoor.

294
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,527
- Davey, what're you doing here?
- I was driving by.

295
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,988
I thought I'd stop and say hello.

296
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,367
- Some place you got here.
- Yeah, a regular Taj Mahal.

297
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,912
- Heard the kids?
- Bad enough she took me to the play.

298
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,122
I never want to hear that song again.

299
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,958
Eric's only light in the arts.

300
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:56,003
His performance will put him over the
goal line at schools he's applying to.

301
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,051
- So, what's the game?
- Seven card.

302
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,220
- Was that Frank Sinatra, Jr?
- Yeah.

303
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,181
He's a friend of my uncle's.
He flies in.

304
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,393
Wow! This really is
an executive game.

305
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,063
- So, what do you think?
- There's a resemblance.

306
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,899
No, I mean the game.
Could I take them or what?

307
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,110
Davey, this isn't a game for you.

308
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,321
What are the chances of me getting
close to a game like this again?

309
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,825
- Let me sit in once.
- I don't do business with friends.

310
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:26,909
You understand.

311
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,246
Do I have to show your prom picture
to these guys?

312
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,583
I appreciate your position,
but come on, Tony, I'm a big boy.

313
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,794
- What are you holding?
- I didn't expect to gamble tonight.

314
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,881
- You need five G's just to sit in.
- Can't you float me, short-term?

315
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,802
Davey, don't say short
if you don't mean short.

316
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,679
All kidding aside.

317
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,932
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah, of course.

318
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,351
Hey, you don't have
to explain business to me.

319
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:10,244
- Christopher, say hi to Davey Scatino.
- How you doing?

320
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,206
Give him five boxes of ziti.
Good luck.

321
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,586
Okay, fellows, make room.
New blood coming in.

322
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,430
So there's a lot of money
in sporting goods?

323
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,140
Yeah, but I tell you...

324
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:35,019
...Nike has its stores, the NBA has
its stores, it cuts in.

325
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:39,398
It's just temporary, though.
I got some ideas for next year.

326
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,901
Hey, Davey. Ask the doc
what his specialty is.

327
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,571
- Hard-ons.
- I wanted him to ask.

328
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,865
- Really?
- Penile implants.

329
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,576
- Hey, doc...
- Please, I've heard all the jokes.

330
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,455
Pot's right.
Sixth Street, here we come.

331
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,998
No help.

332
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,000
Mysteries abound.

333
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,211
Shut the fuck up and deal.

334
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,754
Nine of spades, thank you.

335
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,881
Six of clubs.

336
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:08,219
Get a broom and sweep that shit
over there, especially under Silvio.

337
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,847
- What's the bet?
- Eight hundred.

338
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,394
- What the fuck could you have?
- Incredible luck.

339
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,521
You're telling me, you fuck.

340
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,107
- Bet?
- Don't rush me.

341
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,526
You been rushing me all night.

342
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,612
- He didn't study this hard in school.
- The bet's not to you.

343
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,241
Good. The dealer controls the game.

344
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:34,120
Do you fucking mind?
Jesus, do you ever shut the fuck up?

345
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,955
Blow that smoke somewhere else!

346
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,293
- What are you doing?
- Take it easy.

347
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,047
I'm losing my balls over here
and this moron's playing Hazel!

348
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,715
Get out of here!

349
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,926
I was trying to sweep the cheese.

350
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,888
- Why now? Leave it there.
- I don't know, I was just...

351
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,933
What? Where do you get
these fucking idiots?

352
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,059
Where?

353
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,437
He's sweeping the cheese,
I'm trying to...

354
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,441
Leave the cheese there!
I love fucking cheese at my feet.

355
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,026
I stick provolone
in my socks at night...

356
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,446
...so they smell like
your sister's crotch!

357
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:13,451
All right? So leave the fucking
cocksucking cheese where it is!

358
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,162
Here. Here. Here.
Go ahead!

359
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,289
Have a good time.

360
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,751
800.

361
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,922
Why don't you go fix a fucking dick?

362
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,259
Doctor Fried, you know
about that Viagra shit?

363
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,094
He won't quit, this fucking guy.

364
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:37,099
I heard they're sinking a crate of it
to the Titanic to try and raise it.

365
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,477
- Very good, very good.
- All right.

366
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,228
Down and dirty.

367
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,023
Last card, automatic 12 hundred bump.

368
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,859
Kings rule the realm. Kings talk.

369
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,323
Check.

370
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:56,118
- Door's wide open, Dr. Fried.
- Check.

371
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,996
- David?
- He checks.

372
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,751
Bet. Twelve hundred.

373
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,130
I'm gonna call,
because you ain't got dick.

374
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,675
Can I steal this fucking hand?
I think I can.

375
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,968
I'll raise 12.

376
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:17,932
You should've checked. You got shit
and now it costs you another bet.

377
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,020
Oh, fucker.

378
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,150
- Let's see them, boys.
- Trips.

379
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,527
Three deuces.

380
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,781
Cry me a river.
Three beautiful kings.

381
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,992
- Flush.
- You motherfucker.

382
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,829
You slow-rolled me.
What were you doing to that hand?

383
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,499
His money's good. He wants
to sail, it's his business.

384
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,209
Fuck you too.

385
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,753
I should've stayed
with my goomar tonight.

386
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,507
Hey, cheese fuck, get me some food.

387
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,071
- I'm so pissed.
- Good morning.

388
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:18,534
Hunter called and said that Rachel
got an early acceptance to Wesleyan.

389
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,120
- And you didn't expect it?
- No.

390
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:25,833
- Think. Did you ever see her mom?
- Please. I'm blacker than her mother.

391
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,878
Well, you should've mentioned that
on your application.

392
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,182
T.

393
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,727
T.

394
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,861
- What time is it?
- It's almost 9.

395
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,406
- How we doing?
- Slowing down.

396
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,160
See if they want to close the lights.

397
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,999
Thanks.

398
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,631
Want more coffee?

399
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,635
Yeah, Tony, put a little sambuca
in it for me, would you?

400
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,723
- Anyone want to close the lights?
- Is that a game?

401
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,600
He's a pisser, this kid.

402
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,768
Closing the lights...

403
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,937
It means do you want to admit
you lost and pack it in?

404
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,815
- Me? No.
- All right, cut, please.

405
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,109
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Francis.

406
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,569
Coming out.

407
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:40,949
To Sil, to the doctor,
how about a winner this time?

408
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:45,537
- How much is he into us for?
- About 45 boxes of ziti.

409
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,248
He grabbed ten while you slept.

410
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,583
He said you okayed it.

411
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,879
Go get that.

412
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,351
Look at this fucking lineup.

413
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:16,110
Johnny Sack! They must have had
free tokens at the tunnel.

414
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,947
How do you expect to make a dime
with this fucking stonewaller?

415
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,496
How'd you get in here?

416
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,834
Same as you. Through the front door.

417
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,586
- Hi, Rich.
- Hi, Rich?

418
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,506
I got some nice fresh lox.

419
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,385
- You got some fucking balls.
- What did I do?

420
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,345
I should stab you in the fucking eye.

421
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,057
- Come on, Rich.
- Get off me...

422
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,728
...or I'll put one in your head.
Don't threaten me, Richie.

423
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,356
Don't threaten you?
I got a hard-on for you already.

424
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,108
Give me a reason.

425
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,198
Don't make me embarrass you.
Outside now, I want to talk.

426
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,747
Christopher, get everybody a drink.
I'll be right back.

427
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,749
That's it. Cash me out.

428
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,877
Come on, Frank, doc, sit down.

429
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,920
It's a misunderstanding, right?

430
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,466
No, Tony, I'm wiped.
I'll settle up with you next game.

431
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,635
- Give my regards to your uncle.
- Have some breakfast.

432
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,140
No, really, I got tickets
for the Rueles-Harris fight tonight.

433
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,102
Matt, thanks a lot.
Here's one for your pal.

434
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,437
Cash me out, Sunshine.

435
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,981
Thank you, Mr. Sinatra, Jr., sir.

436
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:41,111
I shut him the fuck down, he comes
here and he sticks it up my ass!

437
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,781
What's that got to do with you
disrespecting my game?

438
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,326
- Like you wouldn't be different.
- You're fucking right.

439
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:51,747
I'm sick of this holier-than-thou act,
and I'm not the only one.

440
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,584
Oh, really? Well, if anybody
wants to make a move...

441
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,003
Come on, Tony.
Don't get so fucking dramatic.

442
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,714
All I'm saying is you act
like you're in a different business.

443
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,509
Send that prick out
so I can talk to him.

444
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,760
No.

445
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:11,099
Do you realize this motherless fuck
is into me for over eight large?

446
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,435
He's got money to play here?

447
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,772
Let him pay me my money.
Send him out.

448
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,275
Go home. This ain't gonna
happen to one of my players.

449
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,253
Everything all right?

450
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,926
Wow, he was pissed.

451
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,096
I'm gonna let you sleep one day.

452
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,599
Then you're gonna get up
and get my $45,000.

453
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,059
Yeah, no problem.

454
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:59,273
- How about the luck on that Silvio?
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?

455
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:06,780
I could use a schvitz.
Want to go for a schvitz?

456
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,785
If you don't give me
every penny...

457
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:16,373
...I'll send somebody to you every
Saturday for five percent interest.

458
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,334
If you don't have it,
I'll tack it on to the principal.

459
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,752
Understand?

460
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,091
Listen, Tony, I had a good run
there for a while.

461
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,468
I should have quit then, though.

462
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:35,142
So you never told me
how your kid made out at Bowdoin.

463
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,896
How my what?

464
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,441
How your daughter made out at Bowdoin.

465
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,280
Would you like anything else?

466
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,076
No.

467
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:57,456
Tony, did I do something
to insult you?

468
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,833
Two days.

469
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,780
- How'd we do?
- Not done counting, but it's up there.

470
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,658
At least 80 boxes of ziti,
after expenses.

471
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,368
Two boxes came out of my pocket.

472
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,827
Fellas?

473
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,581
Salut.

474
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,298
You fucking believe it?
We now run the executive game.

475
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:53,512
Sil, remember when we used to
look through that crack in the door...

476
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,056
...when my old man and Junior had it?

477
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,016
Yeah, I remember.

478
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,435
Junior would chase us down the street.

479
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,606
Executive game.

480
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,153
Do you mind? God!

481
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,031
I'm trying to sleep.
I been working all night.

482
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,325
- How you doing, Eric?
- Good.

483
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,287
- Sounds good.
- Thanks.

484
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,123
- Are you awake now?
- Yeah.

485
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,333
- Good. Close the door.
- Hey!

486
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,837
- Where's your mother?
- The store.

487
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,468
Aunt Barb called.
Uncle Tom's father died.

488
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,096
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tom, Sr?

489
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,850
- When?
- I don't know.

490
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,436
- Well, what the hell happened?
- I don't know.

491
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,023
He's here every Christmas Eve.
You don't ask?

492
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,944
Somebody says "Joe Blow died,"
normal people ask, "How?"

493
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,824
Jesus.

494
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,872
This gust of wind comes,
knocks him off the roof.

495
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,957
All for a satellite dish.

496
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,834
That's very sad.

497
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,294
Yeah.

498
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,963
- How old?
- 65.

499
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,341
Works his whole life,
takes care of his family.

500
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,470
One day after he retires, one day...

501
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,266
It's freaky.

502
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,020
Carlos Castenada said:

503
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,982
"Live every moment as if it were
your last dance on earth."

504
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,110
Who listens to prizefighters?

505
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,488
Ali, maybe.
He had a little wisdom.

506
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,742
Well, at least Tom, Sr. isn't
the Happy Wanderer anymore.

507
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,744
What's that supposed to mean?

508
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,997
He got his. You don't
have to pummel his ass.

509
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,750
He's joined the ranks of the unlucky.

510
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,962
Maybe you know what
you're talking about, but I don't.

511
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,471
Found out I had another uncle.
A retarded uncle.

512
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,392
My father's brother
that nobody told me about.

513
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,144
You believe this shit?

514
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:52,315
Was he seriously
developmentally disabled?

515
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,193
Serious? No, he had everybody
in stitches back then.

516
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,202
Now that you found out
you have a retarded family member...

517
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,288
...do you feel better
about coming here?

518
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:07,998
What?

519
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,000
Is it permissible now?

520
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:15,130
Is it enough of a sad tragedy that you
can join the rest of the douche bags?

521
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,057
I was talking
to him a couple days ago.

522
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:30,020
Yes, he was a wonderful man.
We're here for you, Barbara.

523
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,993
We knew we were bound to see them
at some function. Just relax.

524
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,208
Oh.

525
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:56,046
- Fucking Bette Davis back there.
- No scenes.

526
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,513
- Come on, get up. We're leaving.
- Thank you, God.

527
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,808
- I will kill you.
- We paid our respects. We're leaving.

528
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,812
This may be a shock, but they're not
here to see Sopranos kill each other.

529
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,856
Show respect for Tom's father.

530
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,776
- Hi, Carm.
- Hi, Richie.

531
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,737
Do I give the boost to your sister?

532
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,615
Come on. I gotta give mine too.

533
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,811
- How many rooms this place got?
- It's a big joint.

534
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,939
This is a pretty good racket.

535
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,195
I don't think you can smoke in here.

536
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,949
Who's gonna complain? Him?

537
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,951
Hey, you mind?

538
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,788
He don't mind.

539
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,542
Listen, Anthony.

540
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,547
I'm sorry about blowing up
in your game.

541
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,969
You were out of line.

542
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,097
What am I supposed to do with you?

543
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,100
Back off and respect the title,
you jerkoff.

544
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,103
It's your ball. You make the rules.

545
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:40,150
No, no, I don't make them.
They've always been there.

546
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:44,404
And David Scatino doesn't pay you
a penny until I get mine first.

547
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,782
That's the tax you get for raising
your hands at my game.

548
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,411
I get mine, then you get yours.
That's how it's gonna be.

549
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,998
I don't do something,
how's it gonna look?

550
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,838
If everyone could
please take their seats.

551
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,923
We are about to begin.

552
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:09,637
In the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

553
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,979
Since it has pleased Almighty God
to call our brother from this life...

554
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:23,526
...we commit his body to the earth to
return to that from which it was made.

555
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,404
Christ was the first
to rise from the dead...

556
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,993
You shouldn't take shit from him.

557
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,163
I heard you the first time.
Let's drop the subject.

558
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,873
All right.

559
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,717
Tony put me back in action.
Gave me 50 G's.

560
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,220
- What is that, nothing?
- Please.

561
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:54,808
I know how things work. Don't forget
I was Daddy's little girl.

562
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,563
- What are you talking about?
- You're his responsibility.

563
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,524
He didn't do you any favor.

564
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,527
When my father was in his position...

565
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,656
...he gave Romeo Martin $50,000
when he got out of jail.

566
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,659
Now we're talking about 30 years ago.

567
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,869
Thirty years ago.

568
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,956
Today that's half a million dollars.

569
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,875
Fifty thousand.

570
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,421
Mailmen make more than that.

571
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,524
What's this fucking appointment
you had when my friend came?

572
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,651
Think I'm still a kid
on the school bus?

573
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,279
Please, Tony, I'm doing my best here.

574
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,450
I fucked up, okay? I'm gonna make
it all work out somehow, I swear.

575
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,077
- What do you got for me?
- I'm tapped.

576
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,080
- Stand up.
- Why?

577
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,082
Because I just said so. Get up.

578
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,794
Get up or I'll rip
your fucking head off.

579
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,171
Come on.

580
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,635
I'm sorry, Tony.
I wouldn't do anything to insult you.

581
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,846
Our kids go to school together.

582
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,686
Tony, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm just having some bad luck.

583
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,104
It just got worse.

584
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:30,028
I'm gonna come back.
My luck's gonna change.

585
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,865
Tomorrow. I want something tomorrow.
You understand me?

586
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,258
David! Hey.

587
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,970
- Where's the wife?
- She's home.

588
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,516
- Can I talk to you?
- You all right?

589
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,061
Sit down. Sit down.

590
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,654
Talk to me.

591
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,156
I got myself in a little bind.

592
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,369
Jesus, I feel ashamed.

593
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,038
Well, what's going on? What happened?

594
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,583
I'm in a jam, a bad one.

595
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,503
This could cost me
my marriage, my business.

596
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,756
I'm sure there's something
we can do. What kind of jam?

597
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,261
You didn't knock up that
TaeBo broad, did you?

598
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,513
God, no, Artie.

599
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,765
Talk to me. I'm your friend.

600
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,143
I need money.

601
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,064
Money, Artie. Not much, just...

602
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,777
I swear on my kid I'll get it back
before you miss it.

603
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,863
- How much money are we talking?
- Just enough...

604
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,201
...to give me some breathing
room until I get the rest together.

605
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,287
It's 20 thousand.

606
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,543
Davey...

607
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,382
Shit. Bad timing. Man!

608
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:19,012
You won't believe it, but
I gotta put a new roof on this place.

609
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,561
God forgive me for saying this,
but did you consider Chapter 11?

610
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,813
Tony Soprano's not gonna buy that.

611
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,231
Tony.

612
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,321
Oh, jeez, Davey. Jesus Christ.

613
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,821
- Eric, give me the keys.
- Why?

614
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,449
- There's mud all over the tires.
- Dave, what's wrong?

615
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,077
- Say goodbye to your truck.
- What?

616
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,788
- Dave.
- Oh, this is bullshit!

617
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,750
I warned you, no off-roading.
I gave you enough chances!

618
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,544
- Dave, this is not the place.
- Dad, I didn't do anything!

619
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,381
- Eric, accountability is everything.
- Off-roading?

620
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,717
I drove it onto the field to bring
some girls to cheerleading!

621
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,970
There's mud all over the doors.
I warned you!

622
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,557
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything, Mom!

623
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,060
- Get in the house.
- I fucking hate you.

624
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,688
You apologize, right now!

625
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,316
Open them.

626
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:01,155
- I knew it was a car.
- It's a sports utility vehicle.

627
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,412
You like it?

628
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,374
This is Eric's jeep.

629
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,919
Oh, my God.
Is this Eric Scatino's jeep?

630
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,004
Yeah, but it's yours now.

631
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:22,009
- His dad sold it to you?
- Yeah, you know. Something like that.

632
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,721
What do you mean,
"Something like that"?

633
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,014
You know.

634
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,565
Jesus, Tony.

635
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,151
She don't want it, fine.

636
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,404
I'll eat it before I give it back.
What am I, a sucker?

637
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:45,199
What does Eric have to do with
his father? What'd he do to you?

638
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,453
The guy owed me money, and he did
the right thing offering the car.

639
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,704
Yeah, right.

640
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,205
This is you talking.

641
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,710
His wife's close to the brother-in-law
of the provost at Georgetown.

642
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,378
- The who?
- Oh, great.

643
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,088
You want to act holier-than-thou?

644
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,840
Go ahead, but I'm not giving it back.

645
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,717
I'll sell that car to Pussy.

646
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:06,345
Then I'm gonna buy clothes and food
and shoes and CDs...

647
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,391
...and all the rest of the shit I've
been buying since you were born!

648
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,645
- Everything comes from the work I do!
- All right, Tony, that's enough.

649
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,649
A grown man made a wager. He lost.

650
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,652
He made another one. He lost again.
End of story.

651
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:26,073
Take that high moral ground and go
sleep in the bus station if you want!

652
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,826
Oh, Jesus.

653
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,788
Where?

654
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,873
A few rows back.

655
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,087
Tony.

656
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,966
I almost didn't make it.
Where's Janice?

657
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,803
- Didn't I see those at the wake?
- That's funny.

658
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,888
They're behind.

659
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,516
I'll see you after the show.

660
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,710
Just keep thinking of Meadow.

661
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,799
Eric, come on! Let's talk.
You're just gonna leave?

662
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,551
I thought you were my friend.

663
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,178
I am. I can't stop my dad
from selling it.

664
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,390
Your dad's a fucking asshole,
you know that?

665
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,225
He's a real low-life asshole.

666
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,352
I suppose yours is innocent?

667
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:22,189
For your information, he gave it
to my dad. He didn't steal it.

668
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,777
You know what, Meadow?
Fuck you, fuck your gangster father...

669
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,280
...and fuck this!

670
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,082
Welcome, everyone, to Cabaret Night.

671
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:44,045
As we are recording tonight's show,
we'd like to remind everyone:

672
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,465
Please, no talking, no pictures
or videotaping.

673
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:51,218
And please remember to turn off
those pagers and cell phones.

674
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,096
If you think you may need a lozenge...

675
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,266
...may we suggest that now
would be the time to unwrap it...

676
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,353
...as opposed to during
the performance.

677
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,482
Program notes: In the second act,
"Sun and Moon"...

678
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:09,320
...to be performed by Eric Scatino
and Meadow Soprano, has been canceled.

679
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,907
Regretfully, Mr. Scatino will not be
performing tonight.

680
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,118
Instead, Ms. Soprano
will perform a solo...

681
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,915
...singing "My Heart Will Go On,"
the theme song from Titanic.

682
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,500
Enjoy the show.

683
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,212
That's a lucky break.
I wonder what happened.
