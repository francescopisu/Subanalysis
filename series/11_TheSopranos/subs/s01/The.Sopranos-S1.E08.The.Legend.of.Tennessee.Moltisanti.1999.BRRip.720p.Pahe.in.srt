1
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:54,129
In the czech republic, too,
we love pork.

2
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,748
Ever had our sausages?

3
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:05,757
In the czech republic, too,
we love pork.

4
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:08,760
You ever had our sausages?

5
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:32,784
- Adriana?
- In the czech republic, too,
we love pork.

6
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:34,920
Ever had our sausages?

7
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,294
Emil kolar?

8
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:46,798
- Help you?
- Salami sub, hold the mayo.

9
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,800
We're out of mayo.

10
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:54,806
Change my meat
to black forest.

11
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,953
- You killed me.
- What do you want me
to do about it now?

12
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:11,456
- I wanna tell you.
- Tell me what?
You come here every night.

13
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:14,459
- You fucked up.
- What do you mean?

14
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,213
Here's these.

15
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,831
Where did you find'em?

16
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:23,335
One in the table.
Three in my skull.

17
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:28,340
You will have our sausages.

18
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,226
Get rid of these.

19
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:33,729
Let go of me! Let go!

20
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,492
I would have wrapped it, but--
that's okay.
A computer!

21
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:51,496
This model got such a good
write- up, i got one for myself.
You're gonna love it.

22
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's move on, okay?
Congratulations.
God bless.

23
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:03,258
Hon, you look gorgeous.
By the way,
who's your date?

24
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:06,762
I'll give you "who's
your date." come here.
Good to see you.

25
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:08,764
Congratulations.
Thank you.

26
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:11,266
Melissa was beautiful
up there.
I know. Thank you.

27
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,769
Oh, mama livia.
Come esta, darling?

28
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,274
Listen to him with
that "my darling."
I am nobody's darling.

29
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:21,777
This one here,
she never disappoints ya,
i'll tell ya that.

30
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,780
Are you still seeing
your other women, lorenzo?

31
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,282
Come on, ma.
Let's mingle.

32
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:29,284
Sorry. The older she gets,
the worse she gets.

33
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:32,788
Ah. Listen. I heard
some disturbing shit
last night.

34
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:36,792
I wanted to talk to you about
it. But with the rehearsal
dinner and everything, it just--

35
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:39,294
yeah.
I-- there's
the priest, though.

36
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:41,296
I'll be right back.
Go ahead.

37
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:51,807
Yeah! Whoo!

38
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:54,676
Salute!

39
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:56,678
Federal indictments?
Yeah.

40
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:59,181
Where the fuck
you get this?
I got a guy who owes me.

41
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:03,185
He's got agoomatowho
works at f. B. I. Headquarters
as a word processor.

42
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:07,689
When's it comin' down?
I don't know. When she
knows, she'll tell me.

43
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:10,575
Indictments? What the fuck
you talkin' about?
You sure about this?

44
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:15,080
It ain't just my source in
jersey. Half of new york moved
to fort lauderdale already.

45
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:17,699
Fuck. They're gonna
want my ass.

46
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,703
Why?
What do you mean, why?
I'm o. C.

47
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:25,207
When'd you get
your fuckin' wings?
I didn't.

48
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:28,210
Not yet anyway.

49
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,596
Uncle junior, you got anything
you wanna say about this?

50
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:34,599
You guys see indictments
under your bed at night.

51
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:38,103
Right away you're ready to lam
it. As far as i'm concerned,
it's just speculation.

52
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:42,107
- It's rumor.
- Better be safe
than sorry, no?

53
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:45,110
I say we duck for a while.
And what are we gonna do?

54
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:46,728
Close shop?
We can't do that.

55
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:48,980
Tony, what do you think?

56
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,985
What the fuck you askin'
him for? I just--
i just gave you the answer.

57
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,488
Junior's right. We go on
the lam now, it's open season.

58
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:59,991
The fuckin' albanians
will be livin' in our houses.
Fuck!

59
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:01,993
I just gave a g- note to
larry boy's kid for the boost.

60
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:04,996
If i knew i may have to lam
in a hurry, i would've duked
her another time.

61
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:16,258
Thank you, darlin'.
Gotta go.

62
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:19,261
Say good- bye
to your father for me.

63
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:24,766
I agree with my uncle.
He calls the shots,
we do it.

64
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:27,769
But maybe, for today,
for right now...

65
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,773
you were thinkin', uncle jun,
that everybody should do
a little spring cleaning.

66
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:34,526
That was my next comment.

67
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,035
We're goin' right now.
Let's go.

68
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:48,039
Come on. We have to go.

69
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,813
Think they're gonna come
over the weekend?

70
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:14,316
They're comin' someday.

71
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,323
- Where's the rest of the money?
- It's everywhere.

72
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,825
Well, get it.

73
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:28,830
What else?
How'bout your phone numbers?

74
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,832
Anybody who's anybody
is in my head.

75
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,723
What's the matter?

76
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,843
Nothin'.
Just here we go.

77
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:45,347
Here.
Why now?

78
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,600
Why the fuck now, just
when things we're goin' good?

79
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,994
Boot your computer.
The cops are coming.

80
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:02,998
- So?
- You want them to see all that
porno you downloaded?

81
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:05,500
Shit!

82
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:15,260
You better give me
your jewelry.

83
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,263
Jesus.
Hey.

84
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:22,767
They know we can't produce
receipts. You want'em stealing
this shit from us?

85
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:30,892
Come on.
I'm not giving you my engagement
ring. This isn't stolen.

86
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:38,033
Is it?
No. What do you
think i am?

87
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:41,653
Come on.
Give me that.

88
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,565
Adriana!

89
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,569
It ate my whole script now!

90
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:19,574
You're still on the file.

91
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:21,576
You must've deleted
the text.

92
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:24,079
What the fuck--
whatever, whatev--
you fuckin' asshole!

93
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,582
All right, stop
with the hysteria,
would you, please?

94
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:31,586
If you're gonna keep behavin'
like a baby, fuck it, i'm not
gonna help you, christopher.

95
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:36,091
- I mean it.
- At least you work that squirrel
program in the restaurant.

96
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:41,596
There.
The text came back.

97
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:45,600
You put it in
buffer memory.
What do you think?

98
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,103
Of the script?

99
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:51,606
Babe, i can't like give
an opinion every time
you add a sentence.

100
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:54,109
I gotta have
the whole story flow.

101
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:56,611
I'm startin' with the dialogue.

102
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:09,624
"Imanugedto get
the drop on him"?

103
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:12,627
Do you mean to say,
"imanagedto get
the drop on him"?

104
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:16,631
Or is he saying"manuge,"
like"manugia l'american"?

105
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,642
My tennessee william.

106
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:34,649
Where you goin'?

107
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,651
Get over here.

108
00:10:38,153 --> 00:10:41,656
I have never seen you
apply yourself like this.

109
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:44,659
I love movies.
You know that.

110
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,663
That smell in blockbuster,
that candy and carpet smell,

111
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:51,166
i get high off it.

112
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:55,170
I'm gonna let all this
love and knowledge
go to waste?

113
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,673
My cousin gregory's
girlfriend amy, the one that
works for tarantino, said,

114
00:10:58,673 --> 00:11:01,176
"mob stories
are always hot."

115
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:04,679
I can make my mark.

116
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,182
Babe,
with these indictments,

117
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:12,187
shouldn't you put
the script away for a while
and get rid of evidence?

118
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:16,691
Travel light.
Free bird.

119
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:20,695
You stole this computer,
plus the one
you just gave melissa.

120
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,702
- I'm writing!
- Turn on channel 6.

121
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:29,704
Turn on channel 6.

122
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:36,711
New jersey attorney general
james d. Ricci stated
at a fund- raiser...

123
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:39,714
that a grand jury has been
impanelled to investigate...

124
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:43,718
possible mob activities
in the garden state,
with indictments to follow.

125
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:47,839
With us is syndicated columnist
and author ofmafia:

126
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,342
America's longest running
soap opera, jeffrey wernick.

127
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,845
First of all, welcome.
Thank you.
Pleasure to be here.

128
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:57,982
For years now, the f. B. I.
Has been telling us that
the mafia is all but dead.

129
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:01,486
Let me interject.
While it is true...

130
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:04,489
that the mob is getting
a standing- eight count,

131
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:06,491
uh, i wouldn't call
the fight.

132
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,993
The government knows this
better than anyone.

133
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:13,498
Murder, truck hijacking as well
as money laundering are expected
to be among the inquiries.

134
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:16,000
Do we know yet
the names of those
who will be indicted?

135
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,002
Well, the indictments
are sealed.

136
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:22,006
But with the recent death
of acting di meo family boss,
jackie aprile,

137
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:26,010
my sources tell me that
corrado "junior" soprano...

138
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:28,630
was made new boss
after the death of aprile.

139
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,768
The sopranos have
long historic ties to
the new york families.

140
00:12:33,768 --> 00:12:36,271
What about these possible
murder charges?

141
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:40,024
They will undoubtedly
be focused on
the as- yet- unsolved...

142
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:44,395
execution- style slaying
of soprano family associate,
brendan filone.

143
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:48,399
Uh, was it part
of a power struggle?
Interesting.

144
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,402
No one would ever have
ranked him as associate!
My associates tell me that...

145
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:55,290
filone is a loyal soldier, if
you will, and he winds up dead--
soldier?

146
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,660
Brendan filone!
Associate? Soldier?

147
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,162
Fuck you!
Jesus.

148
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:14,175
Georgie, did you see it
from the beginning?
Did they mention my name?

149
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:18,680
No-- stop the fuckin'
chitchat, all right.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

150
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:26,688
Nobody makes "ginzo" gravy
like you, nana.

151
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:30,191
You know, i'm up at bard
waiting for my care package.

152
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:32,193
I don't like
that word, jason.

153
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:35,079
- What? Ginzo?
- The word is offensive.

154
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,583
She's right, jason.
It's not a nice word.
Sorry, nana.

155
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,702
- What's it mean?
- Derived from the word
"guinea."

156
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,955
- What's that mean?
- It's a derogation.

157
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:47,458
I have a patient,
you wouldn't wanna say the word
"guinea" in front of him.

158
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,961
Huh, italian male
seeing a shrink.

159
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:52,463
Let me guess.
Mother issues.

160
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,966
- Why wouldn't you say it, mom?
- You just wouldn't.

161
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,970
What, you'd be scared?
Is he in the mafia?
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

162
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,972
Can't we change
the subject?

163
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:04,475
No way. What's he do, mom?
Is he in the mob or what?

164
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,477
He's not a mobster,
is he, jen?

165
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:10,982
Nobody knows better
than you, richard,
i can't discuss my patients.

166
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:14,986
I just hope he's not
one of those crumbs they're
talkin' about on the news.

167
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:19,490
Jen, just refer him
to another doctor. You could
do that, couldn't you?

168
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:24,245
- Grate the cheese, dad, okay?
- Sure she can.

169
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:26,748
That might be what
you would do, richard.

170
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:29,751
Now i remember why
we got divorced.

171
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:33,504
Why should i refer him
to another doctor?
He's my patient.

172
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,139
You know you can't treat
sociopaths.

173
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,141
He's scum and you shouldn't
help him with his bed- wetting.

174
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:41,145
You have no idea
who this man is,
and yet you call him scum.

175
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:44,649
People like him are
the reason italian- americans
have such a bad image.

176
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:50,154
I agree.
Ask any american to describe
an italian- american,

177
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:54,659
and invariably he's gonna
referencethe godfather,
goodfellas.

178
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,162
Good movies.
And the rest
are gonna mention pizza.

179
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:00,164
Good movies
to eat pizza by.

180
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:03,668
Stop it, jason.
I never said he was
in the mafia.

181
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:06,170
Why do you think we're never
gonna see an italian president?

182
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,172
And that's
my patient's fault?

183
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:12,677
- Hey.
- I realize you're very involved
in the antidefamation lobby.

184
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:17,682
So go after hollywood if you
feel you absolutely have to,
but leave my patient alone.

185
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:22,687
It's a synergy. News items
and the constant portrayal of
italian- americans as gangsters.

186
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:28,192
Wasn't the italian antidef deal
started by joe colombo,
a mobster?

187
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:30,695
Italians against discrimination
did a study,

188
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:34,315
and in its height,
the mafia in this country
had less than 5, 000 members.

189
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:37,702
And yet, that tiny,
insignificant fraction...

190
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:42,206
cast such a dark shadow
over 20 million
hard- working americans.

191
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:44,325
Dad, at this point
in our cultural history,

192
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:47,829
mob movies are classic
american cinema,
like westerns.

193
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,832
I have to agree there, rich.
You know,

194
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,334
you never saw that scotch- irish
pissin' and moanin'...

195
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:57,221
about always bein' portrayed
as, as rustlers
and gunslingers.

196
00:15:57,338 --> 00:16:00,842
That's absurd.
See what you started
with your gravy, nana?

197
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:04,846
To we,
the 20 million.

198
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,981
- Salute.
- Salute.

199
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:10,351
Salute.

200
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:28,503
- What?

201
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,756
- Get down here right away.
We're exterminatin'.
- I'm kind of busy now.

202
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:33,875
And get some sfogliatelle
and cannoli and shit
for the guys.

203
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,127
Yeah.

204
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:52,527
Twenty- nine.

205
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,286
Here you go, big guy.
Thank you.

206
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:13,047
Hey, gino.
What can i get you?

207
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:16,417
Give me some--
whoa, whoa.
Number 34, right here.

208
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:19,170
He was in line.
He just went out to go
get gas in his car.

209
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:23,558
Oh, so i could go out,
fuck your sister, come back
saturday, i go to the front?

210
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:27,311
- I said he could.
- Hey, poppin' fresh,
i'm in no fuckin' mood today.

211
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,314
I'm next.
Now get a fuckin' pastry box.

212
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:32,433
Gino, what can i get ya?

213
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:35,186
Oh!
It's all right, dougie.
Let him go first.

214
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,438
No. He don't make
the rules here.

215
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,325
All right, let me have
two neapolitan loaves--

216
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:45,696
you touch a single fuckin'
crust, you're gonna wish you
took that job at mcdonald's.

217
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:50,084
- Fuck you.
- Okay, take a walk.

218
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:54,088
What about my bread?
You come back
in ten minutes.

219
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:57,592
- What the fuck do you
think you're doin'?
- Come on.

220
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:08,352
Come on. Get up.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

221
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:11,856
What is it? What is it?
Do i look like a pussy to you?

222
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:13,858
No.
I'm serious.
Be honest.

223
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:16,360
I won't get mad.
No.

224
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,364
Why the fuck would you give me
a hard time and talk to me like
i'm nothin' to worry about?

225
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:22,867
I- i- i'm sorry.

226
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:26,737
Get a pastry box.
Move it!

227
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:32,877
That's better.
Now fill it...

228
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:35,880
with cannoli, sfogliatelle
and napoleons.

229
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,882
Okay.

230
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,887
- Move!
-

231
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,757
good.

232
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,263
Give me the box.
Come on.

233
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:54,515
Here.

234
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:04,025
Next time you see my face,
show some respect.

235
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,160
I will.

236
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:09,914
You motherfucker!

237
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:13,534
- You shot my foot!
- It happens.

238
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:16,037
Oh, you fuckin' asshole!

239
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:23,427
If i'm gettin' an invitation
to the dance,

240
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,930
i wish the feds would hurry
the fuck up about it.

241
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,932
You heard what
they're sayin' on the news.

242
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:30,434
The way things are workin',
it's gonna be junior's party.

243
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:33,437
That was a far- thinkin' plan
you had there, ton.

244
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:38,442
I called you
last christmas.
Fuck this.

245
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:42,446
Hey, the sfogliatelle.
What's wrong with you?

246
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:45,950
What are you doin'?
Were you brought up
in a barn or what?

247
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,453
What's the matter with you,
huh? This is no time to go
on the rag, christopher.

248
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,957
Not with the indictment shit
comin' down.

249
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:56,460
Take georgie,
go in the bathroom,
sweep for bugs, okay?

250
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,462
Come on.

251
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,972
Well, i hope
they'll be all right.

252
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,726
- Who?
- The guys.

253
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,477
- What about me?
- You'll be all right.

254
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:16,097
They didn't even mention
your name on television.

255
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:19,100
Fuckin' amazing,
though, huh?
You know what, that news guy,

256
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,603
he said the words,"brendan
filone," i'm tellin' ya, the
hairs on the back of my neck,

257
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:24,605
they fuckin' stood up.

258
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:29,110
- I mean, i knew the guy.
- They made him look like
john fuckin' gotti.

259
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,112
I brought him around here.

260
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:35,116
Tony wouldn't have never
known him if it wasn't for me.

261
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:38,252
Huh. I had no idea.

262
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,141
Who is it?
I'm sleeping!

263
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:03,144
Carmela.
Oh, come on in.

264
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:07,782
I- i- i just said that in case
you were that snooty- ass...

265
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:10,284
mrs. Ryan down the hall.

266
00:21:10,284 --> 00:21:15,289
Oh, she is so shanty irish,
and with all her airs.

267
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,291
Come on. Get dressed.
I'm taking you to brunch.

268
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,794
What?
You heard me.
Get dressed.

269
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:24,298
What's wrong? Tell me.
Nothing is wrong, ma. Why does
something have to be wrong?

270
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:26,050
Is it meadow?
She eats like a bird.

271
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,553
Everything is fine, ma.
Relax. Nothing is wrong.

272
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,425
But you come here unannounced.
And i- i shouldn't wonder
if something's wrong?

273
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:37,061
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.

274
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:40,064
It's a nice day.
I thought i would
take you out.

275
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,435
I don't wanna go out.

276
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,824
Is it anthony?
Those indictments?

277
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:52,326
His father could take it
in stride, but he can't.

278
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:54,578
I don't believe you.

279
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:01,085
- Come on, ma.
Will you get dressed?
- We just went to a wedding.

280
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:05,589
That was a big to- do.
This way, you and me, we get
to spend some quality time.

281
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:11,095
The manor is gonna stop
serving brunch any minute.

282
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:17,101
Did he cheat on you again?

283
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:22,473
You know,
i try to do something nice.
I come here to take you out.

284
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:27,478
Right away you think
i have some other agenda that
i have to talk toyouabout?

285
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:30,481
Don't flatter yourself.

286
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:33,984
I'll, uh--
i'll throw something on.

287
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:40,124
Buckle your seat belt, ma.

288
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:43,627
I can't find it.
Where is it?

289
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:11,332
It's not definite.
I just thought i'd tell ya,

290
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:14,335
you know, in case i don't
show up for an appointment.

291
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:16,971
So, you're telling me
that you're planning
a vacation,

292
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:19,473
but you're not sure
exactly when it will be?

293
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:22,226
Right.

294
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:25,095
I may never go.

295
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:29,099
Let's put it this way.

296
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,354
There's a strong possibility
that it-- it could happen.

297
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:39,994
Does this have anything
to do with what's been
on the news lately?

298
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:47,251
So, if you, uh, suddenly stop
coming to your appointments,

299
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:50,254
i will assume that
you are on vacation.

300
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:53,374
And i should wait
to be contacted?

301
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:57,127
That would be
a good assumption.

302
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:05,636
Who is it?
Paulie.
Open the door.

303
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:27,658
I thought we were
steppin' out.

304
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,663
I got two broads in the car.
You said ad' went to stay
at her mother's.

305
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:41,171
No wonder.
This place looks like
a fuckin' sty.

306
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:46,927
What's wrong with you?

307
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:49,680
Talk to me.
This ain't like you, kid.

308
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:54,435
I ran into
billy cracchiolo.

309
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:56,820
The meter maid?
What about him?

310
00:25:56,937 --> 00:25:59,940
Told me the regular cops
in nutley are lookin'
for a guy.

311
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,444
Blew off a kid's toe
for no good reason
in russo's bakery.

312
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:05,946
Drove a lexus.

313
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,452
Does tony know about this?

314
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:14,455
What's goin' on, chrissy?

315
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:17,458
Been workin' my ass off
on this movie script.

316
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:21,211
You know how many pages
i got? Nineteen.

317
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:24,715
That a lot
or a little?

318
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:28,218
Books say movie's supposed
to be about 120 pages.

319
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:30,721
Got this fuckin' computer.
I thought it would
do a lot of it.

320
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:32,973
You ain't bein' frank
about the business, kid?

321
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:34,858
I would never do that.

322
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,361
It's only "suggested by."
That writer,

323
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:42,366
with the bullfights,
blew his own fuckin' head off.

324
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:44,868
I bought a script- writin'
program and everything.

325
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,122
My advice.
Put that thing down a while.

326
00:26:48,622 --> 00:26:50,124
We go get our joints copped,

327
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:53,627
and tomorrow, the words
will come blowin' out your ass.

328
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:58,132
You ever feel like
nothin' good was ever
gonna happen to you?

329
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:00,634
Yeah. And nothin' did.
So what?

330
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:02,636
I'm alive.
I'm survivin'.

331
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:06,140
That's it.
I don't wanna just survive.

332
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,145
Says in these movie- writing
books that every character
has an arc. You understand?

333
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:15,149
Like everybody starts out
somewheres,

334
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:18,652
and then they do somethin'
or somethin' gets done to them,
it changes their life.

335
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:22,156
That's called their arc.
Where's my arc?

336
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:28,412
Take richard kimble,
all right?

337
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:32,916
No, that's no good.
His arc is run, run,
jump off a damn-- run.

338
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,919
Uh--

339
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,921
keanu reeves, devil's advocate.
You see that?

340
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:40,424
Al.
Right.

341
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:46,430
Keanu's a lawyer.
Gets all turned on by money,
power and the devil.

342
00:27:46,547 --> 00:27:50,551
Then his wife says to him,
"you're not the man i married."
Leaves him.

343
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:52,803
You see the arc?

344
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:58,809
He starts down here.
He ends up here.

345
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,311
Where's my arc, paulie?

346
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:05,315
Kid, richard kimble,

347
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:07,818
thedevil'swhatever,
those are all make- believe.

348
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:10,954
Hey, i got no arc either.

349
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:14,458
I was born, grew up,
spent a few years in the army,

350
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,461
a few more in the can
and here i am.

351
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:19,463
A half a wise guy.
So what?

352
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:21,832
I got no identity.

353
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:26,336
I mean, even brendan filone's
got an identity. He's dead.

354
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:29,840
I killed that fuckin'
emil kolar and nothin'.

355
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,344
I don't even move up a notch.
All i got is nightmares.

356
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:36,847
That polish, czech, slavic,
whatever the fuck he is,

357
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:39,349
is hauntin' me in my dreams
every night.

358
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,487
That happens.
The more of them you do,
the better you'll sleep.

359
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:46,490
I had one prick chasin' me
for months in my dreams.

360
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,992
I feel like he's tryin'
to tell me somethin'.

361
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:51,995
That we fucked up
the night that we buried him.
We didn't fuck up.

362
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:54,498
- That i'm in danger.
- Could i ask you a question?

363
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:57,000
Why the fuck would he wanna
tell you you're in danger,

364
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:00,504
considering you put
a fuckin' moon roof
in the back of his head?

365
00:29:00,754 --> 00:29:03,257
What did we do wrong
that night?

366
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:06,760
The gun was hot,
so the slugs in his head
couldn't be traced back to me.

367
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:09,763
You know who had an arc?
Noah.

368
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,402
Is that him?

369
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:36,540
Now that would be
some fuckin' coincidence
if it wasn't, wouldn't it?

370
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:41,545
Holy shit!
Look at that!

371
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:45,165
- What?
- He was clean shaven.
He's got a fuckin' beard now.

372
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,668
You know what?
I read that. That happens.

373
00:29:48,051 --> 00:29:50,053
Jesus. I always thought
it was bullshit.

374
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,172
Oh! Look
at his fingernails!

375
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:56,677
- Oh, fuck!
They're like a woman's.
- I'm gonna fuckin' puke.

376
00:29:58,178 --> 00:30:00,180
All right, help me lift him.

377
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,684
We'll take him down to
pine barons before they build
a fuckin' condo here.

378
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:05,686
Georgie!

379
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:11,325
I don't know about
selling this property.

380
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:15,329
I don't know about you,
but i sure as hell
could use an infusion...

381
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:18,332
if we're gonna support jas
after he graduates.

382
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:23,337
It's funny how
even during our marriage
we saw things differently.

383
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:27,457
I never saw this place
as an investment.

384
00:30:27,457 --> 00:30:29,960
I always thought
that we'd build a house.

385
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,964
So, are we gonna sell
or what?

386
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:35,966
For jason.

387
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:40,354
But, you know, i don't wanna
hear that you took one of
your colleens on a cruise.

388
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:43,223
What's that supposed to mean,
"colleens"?

389
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:46,476
We all know you're a sucker
for those irish girls.

390
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:51,114
Every italian boy
bows down to the freckles.
I married you.

391
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:55,869
- Yeah, i was a mother figure.
- Don't bust my balls with freud
by numbers, would ya?

392
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:59,623
"Don't bust my balls"?
Watch it, richard.
Yourcalibrazeis showing.

393
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:01,625
What, are you somehow
implying by all this...

394
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,628
i'm- i'm ashamed to be
an italian- american?

395
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:07,130
With all the poverty,
starvation, ethnic cleansing...

396
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,633
and generally horrible shit
in this world,

397
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:14,388
you devote your energies
to the protection of the dignity
of connie francis.

398
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,893
You know, you're all
worked up about my patient,

399
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:24,398
a man who has no bearing
on who you are or where
you are in this world.

400
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,517
Call him a patient.
The man's a criminal, jennifer.

401
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:31,021
And after a while,
finally you're gonna get
beyond psychotherapy...

402
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:33,523
with its cheesy
moral relativism.

403
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:37,277
Finally, you're gonna get
to good and evil.
And he's evil.

404
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:02,436
Sorry i'm late.
The alarm was--

405
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:05,939
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Didn't paulie tell you
i ain't been feelin' good?

406
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,942
I wipe my ass
with your feelings.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

407
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:11,945
Drive the fuckin' car!

408
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:23,457
We're under a microscope,
and i gotta hear you shot some
fuckin' civilian in the foot...

409
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:25,959
'cause he made you wait
for buns?
Fuckin' paulie.

410
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:28,962
Don't blame paulie!
Makazian comes to me
and says nutley p. D. S...

411
00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:30,964
got a description
and a make on the car!

412
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:33,967
Why don't you just leave a
fuckin' urine sample next time?
If i could've done it--

413
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:37,971
oh, shut up! Fuckin' georgie
comes into the club, he's got
vomit all over his shirt.

414
00:32:37,971 --> 00:32:41,475
I ask him,"what the fuck?" he
said you're diggin' up some body
you clipped three months ago!

415
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:43,477
I was worried--
shut up!

416
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:46,480
People do that shit,
they wanna get caught.
I wanna get caught?

417
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,483
You wanna get caught.
I seen it before,
this fuckin' "cowboy- itis"!

418
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:52,486
You wanna be a big,
bad guy, christopher?
I was worried that i didn't--

419
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:54,488
shut up!

420
00:32:59,743 --> 00:33:03,246
Can i try and explain here?

421
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:08,502
I don't know, tony.

422
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:12,506
It's like just the fuckin'
"regularness" of life is
too fuckin' hard for me.

423
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:14,508
I don't--
i don't know.

424
00:33:20,013 --> 00:33:23,016
Look at you.

425
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:26,019
I bet you're sleepin'
all the time, right?

426
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:28,889
It's the only thing
i still enjoy.

427
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,392
You know what i think?

428
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:36,396
Maybe i have cancer.

429
00:33:36,897 --> 00:33:38,899
You remember
how jackie got?

430
00:33:39,032 --> 00:33:40,534
Cancer?

431
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:44,905
Somethin' fuckin' horrible's
goin' on inside my body.
There's a physical change.

432
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,542
Does this word "cancer"
pop into your mind a lot,

433
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:50,544
a little bit, what?

434
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:56,550
- Huh?
- Well, i'm just thinkin'
maybe you're...

435
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,552
depressed.
Me?

436
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:01,671
I'm no fuckin'
mental midget.

437
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:08,311
All right.

438
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,432
- Watch the, the--
- what?

439
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:14,935
The filter.
Oh, fuck!

440
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:29,449
Maybe you got a, uh,
serotonin problem,

441
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:33,453
or whatever the fuck
they call it, ya know.

442
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:35,839
You know about that shit?

443
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,843
I saw it last night
on a...program.

444
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:43,847
What, take fuckin' prozac?
Not this skinny guinea.

445
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,352
Let me ask you a question.

446
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,225
You ever think about,
uh, you know--

447
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:59,729
fuck no!

448
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:03,233
Good.

449
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:09,239
Can you imagine those
fuckin' losers blowin' their
skulls all over the bathroom?

450
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,741
It's fuckin' pathetic.

451
00:35:33,513 --> 00:35:37,017
Hey, didn't you hear
the goddamn doorbell?
I'm in the middle of a game.

452
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:40,520
You'll be in the middle
of the fuckin' street
you don't wise up.

453
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:53,783
Anthony soprano?

454
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:55,919
What are you doing
in my backyard?

455
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:58,038
The gate was open.
I'm agent harris.

456
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:02,042
This is agent driscol.
May we come in?
If i say no?

457
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:05,295
If we were local,
we wouldn't even have knocked.

458
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:07,931
What's your point?

459
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:11,051
We have a search warrant.
We know you have children
in the house.

460
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:13,937
Other team's waiting out front.
We don't think it necessary...

461
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:16,056
to traumatize kids
by kicking in doors.

462
00:36:16,556 --> 00:36:20,060
So, why don't you take
a minute and tell them
you have, uh, visitors.

463
00:36:35,075 --> 00:36:37,077
Hmm.

464
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:46,469
Any quarters,
you can keep.

465
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:49,472
You tryin' to bribe me?

466
00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:52,475
Why don't you tell me
what you're lookin' for?
Maybe i can save you some time.

467
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:55,478
- Any incriminating evidence
would be nice.
-

468
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,349
dad!

469
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:02,736
They're taking my computer.
I have an english paper.
You gotta be shittin' me.

470
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,739
I better have all
my programs on there
when it comes back.

471
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,241
Anthony.

472
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:12,245
What the hell are they doin'
in my kitchen?

473
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:17,367
What the hell are you doin'
in my refrigerator?

474
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:20,870
- If you forgot your lunch box,
pal, why don't you just ask?
- I'm very sorry.

475
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,374
Mrs. Soprano, how much
would you say that bowl cost?
I'm not cleaning that up.

476
00:37:24,874 --> 00:37:26,876
Grasso, get somethin'
to clean that.

477
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:29,379
Grasso--

478
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:32,632
- your ass!
- Hey, hey, hey! Tony.

479
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:34,634
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Grasso, take it easy.

480
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:37,520
Tony, we're gonna be out
of here in a few minutes.

481
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,524
Tony, let's wait
in the living room.
Clean up the bowl.

482
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:43,526
Come on.

483
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:54,287
I know those feds are doin'
their job, but it pisses me off
the way they act.

484
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:56,790
That one guy wasn't
so bad, harris.

485
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,794
Trust me, he was the biggest
sneak out of all of'em.
It's all part of his little act.

486
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:03,296
And that guy
that broke the bowl,
he did that on purpose.

487
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:05,799
I don't think so.
He was just a klutz.

488
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:10,670
What was his last name?
Rizzo, razzo, what?
Grasso.

489
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,673
Grasso. Do you think
it's a coincidence
they sent him?

490
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:17,177
If he wasn't an italian,
he'd be back at the office
sweepin' up. The stupid jerk.

491
00:38:17,677 --> 00:38:19,679
They probably frisk him
every night before he goes home.

492
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,066
- Why?
- Why? 'cause he has a vowel
at the end of his name.

493
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:28,071
Grasso. What's he think,
he's gonna make it to the top
by arresting his own people?

494
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:30,690
Pass the mushu.
He'll see.

495
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,442
- He'll learn.
- We have a vowel.

496
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,444
"F"- in' right,
and you be proud of it.

497
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:38,948
Jesus christ, you'd think
there never was a michelangelo
the way they treat people.

498
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:41,701
Did you know that an italian
invented the telephone?

499
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:45,088
- Alexander graham bell
was italian?
- You see?

500
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:48,958
You see what i'm talkin'--
antonio meucci invented the
telephone and he got robbed!

501
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:51,961
Everybody knows that.

502
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:54,464
Who invented the mafia?

503
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,218
What?
La cosa nostra,
who invented that?

504
00:38:58,218 --> 00:39:00,603
- Who cares?
- Wasn't it salvatore lucana,

505
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:05,475
better known as
charlie "lucky" luciano who
organized the five families?

506
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:08,611
Lucchese, gambino,
bonnano, profaci.

507
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:11,364
Is there somethin'
you wanna say to me?

508
00:39:12,615 --> 00:39:15,118
I just like history,
like you, dad.

509
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:17,987
- Can you just shut
the fuck up about it?
- Hey!

510
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,623
Hey!

511
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,745
A. J. , did you know that
john cabot was italian?
Whoa.

512
00:39:25,745 --> 00:39:29,249
- Like he knows who that is.
- It's the famous discoverer
of canada.

513
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:32,135
The bank of america.
You ever heard of it?

514
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:35,138
One of the biggest banks
in the world,
started by an italian.

515
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:37,507
The first american saint
was italian-- mother cabrini.

516
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,009
That's right.

517
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:43,012
Is it true that the chinese
invented spaghetti?

518
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:46,516
Now think about it.
Why would people
who eat with sticks...

519
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:50,019
invent something that
you need a fork to eat?

520
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,522
And here's something else
i bet you didn't know.

521
00:39:52,522 --> 00:39:56,409
More italians fought for
this country in world war ii
than any other ethnic group.

522
00:39:58,161 --> 00:40:00,163
And they won't tell you about
sacco and vanzetti either.

523
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,032
The two antichrists
that got the electric chair
in massachusetts?

524
00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:06,035
- Anarchists.
- Isn't it antichrists?

525
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:09,289
They were two innocent men
who got the chair
because they were italian.

526
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:12,292
How can there be
two antichrists?
There was only one christ.

527
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:15,795
- So?
- And of course,

528
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:18,298
francis albert.

529
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:24,437
Will i see you next week?
Unless you know somethin'
i don't.

530
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:27,941
Just so you understand,
that i have to charge you
for the missed session.

531
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,810
What are you talkin' about?

532
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:32,946
We agreed on that
on our very first meeting.

533
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:35,448
I know, but i just explained
to you my situation.

534
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:39,319
I understand,
but it's important that
we respect the agreement.

535
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:44,073
- What if i got hit by a car?
- But you weren't.

536
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:47,577
- I know, but what if?
- But you weren't.

537
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:50,713
- I know that, but, but what if?
- You weren't.

538
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,334
- Why don't you answer
my fuckin' question?
- I will not.

539
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,836
You won't?

540
00:40:57,337 --> 00:40:59,339
All right, fine, fine.

541
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,342
Here. Here you go.

542
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:05,228
Of course, 'cause this is what
it's all about? Motherfuckin',
cocksuckin' money!

543
00:41:05,728 --> 00:41:07,730
Here.

544
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:13,736
I don't understand that comment,
and i don't appreciate
being made to feel afraid.

545
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:17,490
I don't appreciate feelin' like
i pour my heart out
to a fuckin' call girl.

546
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,610
- Is that how you see me?
- Not until now.

547
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,614
But it's obvious you don't
give a shit about my situation
or what's happenin' with me!

548
00:41:24,614 --> 00:41:27,617
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be shakin' me down.

549
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,622
It'll show as "paid"
on your next month's bill.

550
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:36,125
Fine.
Stick it up your ass.

551
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:48,054
And how about dr. Goldman
over here?

552
00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:52,058
Originally, he was gonna be
a tree surgeon, but he fainted
at the sight of sap.

553
00:41:52,058 --> 00:41:55,061
Sap, ladies and gentlemen.

554
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:59,065
Pace yourselves.
Don't spend it all
in one place.

555
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:03,570
Movie night, right?
Last week they showed
the polish version ofrashomon.

556
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:08,074
Everybody remembers
the rape exactly the same.
The'60s--

557
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:10,577
what's the matter
with you, corrado?

558
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:14,581
Headaches, that's all.
Not the kind you take
aspirin for.

559
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:18,084
Now, tonight on our show,
we have mitzi gaynor,

560
00:42:18,084 --> 00:42:20,587
sergio franchi
and a woman from france...

561
00:42:20,587 --> 00:42:23,590
who will pull
a string of lightbulbs
out of her husband's throat.

562
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,592
This woman can relate.

563
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:30,847
I think we may have
a bad apple.
Does tony know about this?

564
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:35,852
What are you gonna do?
There's not much to do.
We have to sit back and wait.

565
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:39,856
And do me a favor,
don't let tony know you know.
He's under enough pressure.

566
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,362
I'm sure he's tellin'
his psychiatrist
it's all his mother's fault.

567
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:51,751
- What are you talkin'
about, a psychiatrist?
- Yeah, a psychiatrist.

568
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:54,754
He's been seein' one
for a while now.

569
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:58,625
God only knows what he says.

570
00:42:58,758 --> 00:43:01,761
- Tony?
- Yes, tony.

571
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:05,265
Tony, who had
such a terrible mother.

572
00:43:05,265 --> 00:43:10,019
- A psychiatrist?
- Yes, junior.
For christ's sake!

573
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,024
Show of hands.
How many people think j. F. K.
Is still alive? Come on.

574
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:17,527
They should take
a zapruder film
of your salad bar?

575
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:20,029
Hello? Help me out.

576
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,782
Who?
The psychiatrist, i mean.

577
00:43:22,782 --> 00:43:24,784
Do you think i know?

578
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:28,288
What did you say
to tony about this?
Me?

579
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:32,792
Nothin'. I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction.

580
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:37,914
And, junior, i don't want
there to be any repercussions.

581
00:43:39,415 --> 00:43:41,417
A psychiatrist?

582
00:43:41,801 --> 00:43:44,804
You're a broken record.

583
00:43:44,804 --> 00:43:46,806
Yes, yes.

584
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:48,808
Shh.
Do i have to--

585
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:53,313
this lady is blind. Dear,
i have a few words for you.

586
00:43:53,313 --> 00:43:56,816
Do i have to say it again?
They are lucy in the sky
with diamonds.

587
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:59,936
All right?
Picture yourself in a boat
at ellis island.

588
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,438
All right,
how does that sound?

589
00:44:06,442 --> 00:44:08,945
It's me. Leave a message.

590
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:11,447
Christopher? It's mommy.

591
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:13,950
I know you're there.
Pick it up.

592
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,954
Are you all right?
I'm worried about you.

593
00:44:17,954 --> 00:44:20,957
My god, they mentioned your name
in the newspaper today.

594
00:44:20,957 --> 00:44:24,460
Thestar- ledger.
Mrs. Jones told me.

595
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,963
With all those scumbags.

596
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:30,967
It's been a while
since we met for therapy.

597
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:32,969
Mm- hmm.

598
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:35,972
Jason, how's bard?

599
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:41,477
I'm moving into
a smoke- free dorm.

600
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:46,983
And how do we feel
about that?

601
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:49,736
I'm more interested
in discussing what
we mentioned before.

602
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,123
Jason, are you concerned
that your mother is treating
this patient x?

603
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:57,744
I don't care.

604
00:44:58,244 --> 00:45:03,249
As a colleague, jen,
i suggest you drop the patient.

605
00:45:03,383 --> 00:45:06,753
After her
last encounter with him,
she finally acknowledged...

606
00:45:06,753 --> 00:45:10,256
that she saw the different side
of him-- the subhuman.

607
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:12,759
I take it you were frightened.

608
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:15,261
Frightened, revolted.

609
00:45:15,645 --> 00:45:17,146
At long last,
appropriate emotions.

610
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:20,149
Oh, for christ's sake, richard.
You too, sam.

611
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,021
- When did we become so afraid
to get our hands dirty?
- It's what she gets paid for.

612
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:28,024
Jason, how would you like
to see your mother--

613
00:45:30,026 --> 00:45:34,030
never mind.
I'm not gonna paint
any graphic images.

614
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:36,916
See?
He always does that.

615
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:41,421
- What?
- Follow that up, jas.
Dad does what?

616
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:44,924
His real issue is that
i should distance myself
from this man...

617
00:45:44,924 --> 00:45:47,927
on the grounds of the stigma
that he brings us.

618
00:45:48,044 --> 00:45:51,547
I say, refer this patient
to a therapist...

619
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:55,551
that specializes
in mafia depression.

620
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:02,058
- Sam, this isn't funny.
- No, of course not.

621
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,562
Jen has a real honest
to goodness personal...

622
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:09,699
and professional dilemma.

623
00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:17,457
You know,
on my mother's side
we have a few dark sheep.

624
00:46:17,457 --> 00:46:19,459
Excuse me?

625
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:21,461
Lepke.

626
00:46:25,965 --> 00:46:27,967
Who's lepke?

627
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:31,471
Louis lepke buchalter.

628
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:34,841
You know.
Murder incorporated.

629
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:40,229
My mother's uncle
was lepke's wheel man.

630
00:46:40,229 --> 00:46:42,231
His driver.

631
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:45,985
Uh- huh.

632
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:48,488
Those were some tough jews.

633
