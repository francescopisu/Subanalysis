1
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:44,119
Okay, we know
what we're gonna do.

2
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,122
Till the government
indicts, anyway.

3
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:50,626
Jimmy?
This answers your concerns?

4
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:53,629
I think
a lot of good ground
was covered.

5
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,633
Okay, i guess that's it.

6
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:01,136
All right.

7
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:16,401
You know, you better
get the tickets.
I got'em already. Don't worry.

8
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:19,404
Fuck, the rangers
are gonna lose anyway.

9
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:23,909
You're right, it's him.
All of a sudden,
he asks for a meeting...

10
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,911
to discuss shit
we already covered.

11
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:28,914
He's wearin' a wire.

12
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:31,416
You got my okay.

13
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,919
Make sure
you send a message
to everybody else.

14
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,922
Done.

15
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:41,927
See you later.

16
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:52,971
Who was it that told me
you hated fuckin' russians?

17
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:55,974
Ah, the two needle pricks
junior brought around
to pound my ass were russian.

18
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,977
For a while i was bitter.
But tony'sgoumada
is russian.

19
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:00,979
You couldn't ask
for a nicer person.

20
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,482
These two tonight
are friends of hers.

21
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:07,986
I got enough cologne on?
You smell like paco rabanne
crawled up your ass and died.

22
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:11,490
Oh, easy for you to say.
I don't get young ones
like before.

23
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,992
Well, you're gonna
be glad i got you
out of bed tonight.

24
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:18,247
Russian boo- boo's, you go
for some basic foreplay,
they'll detail your car.

25
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:22,751
How's the hygiene
over there?
I don't know.

26
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:26,255
This is here.
You didn't even let me
put anything decent on.

27
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:28,257
Here we are.

28
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:35,264
Hi, elena, baby.
How are you?
Hey, okay.

29
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:37,766
Is tatiana here?
I'll go get her.

30
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,772
You are jimmy?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm jimmy.

31
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:52,281
Oh! My man!

32
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,536
Big tits, little feet.
A hit in any man's league.

33
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,676
Have a seat.

34
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:15,804
Fuckin' punk- ass
pieces of shit.

35
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:19,308
- Did you forget i'm a captain?
- Why don't you call for help
in your radio mike?

36
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:21,810
- You fuckin' rat.
- Mother of god!

37
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,313
- What's the matter?
Not wearin' one tonight?
- Nah.

38
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:27,316
- He didn't have time
to put on anything decent.
- God!

39
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,965
Come on. Stop.
I want to watch.

40
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:50,722
- Kiss me.
- Ha- ha, georgia o'keefe.

41
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:55,227
Was that your back gate?

42
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:58,230
Hmm, it's
probably nothing.

43
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,733
Come here.
That's what people always
say in these creepy movies.

44
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:07,239
And the last thing i need
is your parents come home and
your dad sees my dominican ass.

45
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:10,742
Seti- i- imia!
Jesus fuck!

46
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:16,615
I just saw my grandmother go by
the window. How'd she get here
from her nursing home?

47
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,756
Settimia!

48
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:33,015
Cakey! Tell my sister
to open the door.

49
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,517
Grandma, it's me.
Anthony, junior.

50
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:37,519
Well, you've got
whooping cough.

51
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,523
- Get yourself
under the vaporizer.
- Holy shit.

52
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:46,528
- Hey, what do you want, lady?
- Go away.

53
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:50,532
I will never speak...

54
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:55,037
another word to you
again, settimia.

55
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:57,539
Grandma, aunt settimia's
dead. It's me, meadow.

56
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,545
Facia bruta!
Grandma, it's meadow,
remember? Come sit down.

57
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:07,049
Yes. Meadow.

58
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:11,553
Ohh!
I can't stay in this house,
honeybunch.

59
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:13,555
Not while thatfacia bruta
is in here.

60
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:18,060
Come on, grandma.
Let's go see who it is.

61
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:26,818
- Evening. How are we tonight?
- Make my sister get out
of the house.

62
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,323
It's 1:00 a. M. , dear.
Why were you walking on
mountain avenue at this hour?

63
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:33,825
Shut up.

64
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:36,578
We got a complaint
from your neighbors
of a woman wandering.

65
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:39,081
- She's my grandmother.
- Hi, grandma.

66
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,583
Ahh!
How are you?

67
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,586
- Ow, shit!
-
you know this young man?

68
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:48,090
Of course. He's--

69
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:53,095
he's my- my grandson.

70
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:56,548
And is this
your house, dear?

71
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:07,309
Where was she trying
to get to?
Schrafft's.

72
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:12,314
She's being retested...
for alzheimer's.

73
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:15,817
It's been a long odyssey
with your mother, hasn't it?

74
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:18,954
Oh, these last 500 years
just seemed to race by.

75
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,960
Listen to me.
- It's okay. -

76
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:30,215
- let it out.
- They're transferring her
to the nursing unit.

77
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,718
Which is...

78
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,720
the thing that
she dreaded and feared.

79
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:39,591
Isn't it interesting
how this memory loss
has cropped up...

80
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:44,346
right after
you failed to be killed
in the carjacking?

81
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:48,233
- You think
it was a carjacking?
- Course not.

82
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:51,736
But i got an idea
who was behind it,

83
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:54,739
and...

84
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,741
'nuff said.

85
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,995
- You don't want to go there.
- Maybe you don't want
to go there.

86
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:02,747
What are you
talkin' about?
Well, let's track it.

87
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:07,002
Right around the time
of the shooting, you were
having hallucinations...

88
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:09,504
of that isabella figure?

89
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:12,507
The "protective, loving"
mother?

90
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:16,761
Your subconscious was
shouting something at you.

91
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:19,764
On the day before the shooting,

92
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:23,018
you said to me that
she kept going on...

93
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:27,639
yet again about news stories
of mothers throwing their babies
out of windows.

94
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,142
Why don't we put
our fuckin' cards
on the table here?

95
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:35,647
Wh- what do you think, my mother
tried to have me whacked'cause
i put her in a nursing home?

96
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:39,401
In your worst dreams,
a duck flies off
with your penis.

97
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:42,904
- Castration.
- Hey, my mother never
went after my basket.

98
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:45,790
No, not literally.

99
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:51,296
Look, ordinarily
a patient is helped
to make his own breakthroughs.

100
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:55,166
But your life is in danger,
so okay, i'm willing to put
the cards on the table.

101
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,169
I say what your mother has,
at the very least,

102
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,806
is what we call borderline
personality disorder.

103
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:04,059
A borderline personality
disorder?

104
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:08,430
Let me read to you
from the d. S. M. - Iv, okay?

105
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,932
Definitions
of the condition?

106
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:14,436
"A pattern of
unstable relationships.

107
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:17,322
Affective instability."

108
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:22,327
It means intense anxiety,
a joylessness.

109
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:26,197
These people's internal phobias
are the only things
that exist to them.

110
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:29,200
The real world,
real people are peripheral.

111
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:32,954
These people have
no love or compassion.

112
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:36,458
Borderline personalities are
very good at splitting behavior,

113
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,347
creating bitterness and conflict
between others in their circle.

114
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,600
You twisted fuckin' bitch.

115
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,103
That's my mother we're
talkin' about, not some
fuck up in attica...

116
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:50,605
stabbed you
in the shower.
Relax.

117
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,608
See, we're through,
you and i.
We're finished.

118
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:56,611
And you're lucky if i don't
break your fuckin' face
in 50, 000 pieces.

119
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:59,614
Okay.

120
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:17,048
I mean, let's face it,
jackie's work is
what killed him.

121
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:19,050
All thatagita
brought on the disease.

122
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,554
But his reign was peaceful.
This shooting with tony--

123
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:25,056
suppose my jackie
hadn't died of cancer.

124
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,559
Who knows how his life
would have ended?

125
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,564
Look at angie bompensiero.
A fuckin' shell since
pussy disappeared.

126
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,934
Ladies,
compliments of the house!

127
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,936
Buccetin"matriciana.

128
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:40,822
Artie, you want
a pair of hippos
to walk outta here?

129
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:43,074
That's imported pancetta
in there!

130
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,578
You gonna hate me, artie,
if i say i like this place
better than the old vesuvio?

131
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:50,448
A few bugs to be ironed out.

132
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,951
And the one in your salad,
that was a freak occurrence.

133
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:55,453
My produce man,
he's the most expensive
in the area.

134
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,957
The insurance
really came through!

135
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:01,960
- Yes, it did.
- Carm, what do i hear
about tony's mom?

136
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:05,597
- Chiara was talkin'
to meadow in school.
- Yeah, looks like alzheimer's.

137
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,099
Oh, boy.
Yeah.

138
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:11,603
Aw, i've known
mrs."s" since--

139
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:16,474
she's always been a--
an individualist,
should we say? Huh?

140
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:20,612
But she's a real pistol.
What a character!

141
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:24,115
- Aw, poor tony.
- Yeah, he's beside himself.

142
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:27,118
He's got a lot
on his plate.

143
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:31,239
The attempted carjacking--

144
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:35,243
- hey, well--
- i'll let you eat.

145
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:37,746
Okay. Enjoy!
Thanks, artie.

146
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,753
Oh, my god,
look who's here!

147
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:47,756
What?
You hiding back here?

148
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:50,258
Your best friend's
on table 12.

149
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:52,761
When are you gonna
bury the hatchet?

150
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:55,263
Arthur, i love carmela
like a sister.

151
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,266
We just don't want
this place to become
another mob hangout...

152
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:00,268
like the old vesuvio.

153
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:02,270
Get it into your head
that a certain amount...

154
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,273
of that kind of patronage
creates "buzz."

155
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:09,277
Artie, that kind of buzz
we should avoid in droves.

156
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:18,286
Sh- it!

157
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:21,423
- Your first time here?
- The dellacroces gave me
a gift certificate.

158
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:23,925
It's part of artie's
opening promotion.

159
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,678
- You will notbelievethe food.
- That's what i hear.

160
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:29,681
Although they'd have
to be doing something
pretty special back there...

161
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,683
to trump you two ladies
at the spice rack.

162
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:35,437
I was over at carmela's
the other night, ro.

163
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:39,441
We had somezabaglion'that--
well, now, of course,
we did make it together.

164
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,443
But everybody was
just raving about it.

165
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:45,313
Please, you made it,
basically.

166
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:50,819
I only wish tony had
taken me up on my offer to talk
to him about the carjacking.

167
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,322
- Well, that makes two of us.
- Yeah.

168
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,825
Well, i better
get seated and order.

169
00:12:57,325 --> 00:13:00,328
No, wait, wait.
Stay here.
Take a load off.

170
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,330
Yeah.
H- how's the watch,
father phil?

171
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,332
Oh, it's fantastic.

172
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:08,586
I realized this morning
i can set one of the dials
to the millennial countdown.

173
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:11,589
- Well, i haven't done it yet.
- Is that jackie's watch?

174
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,482
Thanks again, ro.

175
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:47,625
Mr. Soprano was kind enough
to come with us.

176
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,128
Yeah, when you
threatened to wait
until my kids got home.

177
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,130
I'm sure
agent harris explained...

178
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,632
that there's something
we'd like you to hear.

179
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:58,520
The springsteen boxed set.
I already got it.

180
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,022
- You know agent grasso,
i believe?
- Yeah, how are you doin'?

181
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,525
Have a seat.

182
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,282
As we both know,
there's been an attempt
on your life.

183
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,284
You have enemies.

184
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:15,787
I'd say it's a safe assumption
that you may have...

185
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:18,790
finally run out your string
here in north jersey.

186
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,293
The lovely agent harris and i
have had this conversation.
I'll pass.

187
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:24,796
You haven't heard
what's on the tape.

188
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:27,298
Play it, 'cause
i don't give a fuck
what's on it.

189
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,801
I understand you
and agent grasso...

190
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:33,304
had an interesting colloquy
about our, uh, shared heritage.

191
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:36,808
- Colla- who?
- You and i are
notcompare, tony.

192
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:40,311
You on the one hand,
me and agent grasso
on the other,

193
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:44,315
even though our ancestors
all hailed from the same
sunny peninsula.

194
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:47,318
What the fuck
is your problem?

195
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,322
But we do share
some cultural ideas.

196
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:56,828
Religious, culinary,
matriarchal--

197
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,330
maybe we can motivate you
to testify.

198
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,833
Why don't you get
the kumquats out of your mouth
and get to the fuckin' point,

199
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,335
because i don't know
what you're talkin' about.

200
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:12,460
Boy, anthony must've really
gotten under your collar.

201
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,965
Admit it. You're lookin'
to crack hiscoglionifor
puttin' you in here.

202
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,968
I- i don't know what
you're talkin' about.

203
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:23,688
Yeah. And i'm playin'
shortstop for the mets.

204
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:29,060
A psychiatrist. He's been
seein' one for a while now.

205
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,564
God only knows
what he says.

206
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:36,567
You wired green grove.
You must have
taken me for an idiot.

207
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,569
It was my idea.

208
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,571
Everyone else thought
it was a waste of money.

209
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,958
My cousin cakey,

210
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,961
after he had his lobotomy,
looked exactly like my son.

211
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:49,414
Livia--
empty, a shell.

212
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:51,883
Better cakey had died
than go on living like that.

213
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:55,887
That's what his own mother
always used to say.

214
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:08,516
What are you talking
about, meetings? Well, who,
for christ's sake, livia?

215
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:12,020
All of them.
Raymond.

216
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,606
- Larry.
- Three of my capos have
their mothers in this place?

217
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:19,610
If this is true, livia,
you know what i--

218
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,113
i mean, i'm the boss,
for christ's sake.
If i don't act--

219
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:25,116
blood or no--

220
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:27,618
i have to.

221
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:51,776
Mrs."s."

222
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:54,028
How are you?

223
00:16:56,397 --> 00:16:58,399
You remember me?

224
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:03,404
Arthur bucco?
That's right.

225
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:07,041
- Victoria's boy!
- That's right.

226
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:12,046
Yeah, you and my johnny
used to play little league
together.

227
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:15,666
No, johnny was yourhusband.

228
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,668
But you're right
about the little league.

229
00:17:17,668 --> 00:17:22,807
- That was me andtony.
- My son. That's right.

230
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:25,560
Yeah.

231
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:30,181
Aw, gee, what's
the matter with me?

232
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:36,187
- How are you?
- Well, how are you, arthur?

233
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:38,940
Never been better.

234
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:46,447
It's a nice room.
Lots of sun!

235
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,950
Yeah.
Oh, sit down.

236
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,952
How's your mother?

237
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:54,705
- You call her every day?
- Mom passed away.

238
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,960
Really?
When?

239
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:03,464
About six months ago.

240
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:06,851
Please,
give her my regards.

241
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:10,354
Is she still on
that crazy diet?

242
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,863
I, uh,
i brought you something.

243
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,865
Um, from my restaurant.

244
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:25,119
- I don't know
if you remember vesuvio?
- Oh, of course i do.

245
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,622
That was way back
when your dad had it.

246
00:18:28,122 --> 00:18:29,624
Good for you!

247
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:32,627
Yeah, i got
a new restaurant.

248
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:37,131
Here you go.

249
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,635
Gavadel!

250
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:44,639
With the nice duck ragout.
Homemade. It's northern.

251
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:48,643
Oh, northern.

252
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:56,517
Mrs."s,"
what's the matter?

253
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:03,024
- Is it something i said? -

254
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:08,029
you're a good boy, arthur,
comin' to visit me.

255
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,784
We go back a ways.
You made a mean p. B. And j.

256
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:17,038
After what
my son did to you--

257
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,041
oh, how can i look you
in the face?

258
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:21,926
Tony?

259
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:23,928
What did he do now?

260
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:27,298
Y- you don't blame him
for setting the fire?

261
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,271
Well, you're
a bigger man than some.

262
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:36,641
Well, we should all
be grateful that...

263
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,644
nobody was
incinerated to death.

264
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:53,241
Altieri's wake is tonight.
I phoned in
a bomb scare.

265
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:55,243
You know,
that's over the top.

266
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,253
It was junior and mikey
that definitely
took out the hit.

267
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:08,256
- Start things movin'.
- Not like we didn't know.

268
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:11,759
- How did you find out for sure?
- No room for interpretation.

269
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,762
Minchia.
"T," i'm sorry.

270
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:16,764
Your own uncle.
Now, let's do it right.

271
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:20,768
Act normal.
Plan things out.

272
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:23,271
- Make no mistakes.
- If i'm your uncle,

273
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:25,773
i gotta finish
what i started.

274
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:30,278
He can strike first.
Yeah, and he won't use
boys 2 menthis time.

275
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:33,281
- He'll go with what he knows.
- Chucky signore.

276
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:35,283
No, mikey's now
too high up.

277
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:38,286
So, chucky's gotta
disappear without
settin' off any alarms.

278
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:42,290
I just passed
my coast guard tests.

279
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:47,795
"T." anything else?

280
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:50,798
My ear hurts.

281
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,694
Here.
One of mine.

282
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:05,696
It'll help you sleep.

283
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:12,203
What kinda person can i be,
where his own mother
wants him dead?

284
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:18,709
The problem
is not with you.

285
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,711
That woman is
a peculiar duck.

286
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:23,214
She always has been.

287
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:27,718
Yeah, but that's
not the point.
She's gotten worse with age.

288
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,720
You think my mother
didn't warn me about her
on my wedding night?

289
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,722
Please, don't start
with that again.

290
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:34,225
Your sisters left
new jersey so young
you would have thought...

291
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:36,727
there were contracts
out on them!

292
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:40,231
I know.
But you
were different.

293
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:43,234
You tried
to make it work.

294
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:48,239
Two pricks
with nine millimeters.

295
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:51,742
My self- esteem is
nonexistent right now.

296
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:54,245
Well, i could kill her.

297
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,747
With these two hands.

298
00:21:57,248 --> 00:21:58,749
The next time i see her,
it's gonna be--

299
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,751
you gotta play
"the concerned daughter- in- law."

300
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:05,256
You gotta stay even- keeled,
for the sake of the business.
Fuck the business!

301
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:09,260
And let me tell you something,
tony, dollars to donuts this
alzheimer's thing is an act,

302
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,762
so she can't be called
on her shit.

303
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:19,770
Uncle jun and i,
we had our problems.
With the business.

304
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,273
But i never
should have asked him
about eatin' pussy.

305
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,775
This whole war
could have been averted.

306
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:28,279
Cunnilingus and psychiatry
brought us to this!

307
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:32,283
You had to see a shrink
because of the mother
you had.

308
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:37,788
When i look at the guys now,
all i feel is humiliation.

309
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,794
I'll take care
of my uncle.

310
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:46,297
And i'll take care
of mikey "p."

311
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:50,301
And i'll get
some satisfaction.

312
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:52,303
But inside,

313
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,306
i'll know.

314
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:14,325
Ton'!
Jesus christ, relax.

315
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:15,943
- What the fuck
you doin' here?
- Takin' thestugatz.

316
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:18,446
- Puttin' it in
the marina next door.
- No shit.

317
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:21,332
Look at this baby i caught
right off the point here.

318
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:22,510
- Just wait a minute.
Wait. All right, wait.
- Oh, no! No!

319
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,148
- Look, look,
i need to talk to you!
- No!

320
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:30,151
Come on!

321
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:33,154
I'm dialing 9- 1- 1.

322
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:35,656
Because you've given me
no choice.

323
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:37,658
Come on!

324
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,163
If anything happens to me,
they're gonna hear everything.

325
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:44,165
Look, you wanna talk,
we'll go down
to the coffee shop.

326
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:48,169
- Plenty of people around.
- Emergency services.
May i help you?

327
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:50,671
Hey!
I need to talk to you.

328
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:55,176
Do i have your word that
i'm in no physical danger?

329
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:57,678
Yes. I am humbled
that you would take
my word. Yes.

330
00:24:57,678 --> 00:25:01,682
- What?
- Aw, fuck me. Yes!
You've got my word!

331
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:05,186
Emergency services. State
the nature of your emergency.
Come on!

332
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:08,189
Hello? Hello?

333
00:25:21,702 --> 00:25:23,704
Oh, god!

334
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:31,078
I take no pleasure
in the fact that i was
right about your mother.

335
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:35,716
You have any dreams since
you heard the f. B. I. Tapes?

336
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,835
No.

337
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,842
Some sex dreams.

338
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:50,981
Involving--
my neighbor.
Jeanne cusamano.

339
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:55,352
- Go on.
- Well, we're doin' it,
doggie- sty--

340
00:25:57,855 --> 00:26:01,242
- you know jeanne.
- That's okay. Go on.

341
00:26:02,743 --> 00:26:06,247
I'm doin' her
doggie- style.

342
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:10,751
And i finish, you know,
and her big ass is--

343
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:13,120
oh, look, we don't
got time for this shit.

344
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,122
It's interesting
that you would say
a big ass,

345
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:17,625
'cause jeanne
is quite slender.

346
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:20,261
We got bigger things
to talk about than
jeanne cusamano's ass.

347
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:24,381
Like feelings of worthlessness,
sparked by your mother's plot
to have you killed?

348
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,634
One of the reasons
that they tried to
have me clipped...

349
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:29,136
is'cause
i'm seeing a shrink.

350
00:26:29,136 --> 00:26:31,772
- You.
- Oh.

351
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:33,641
Uh.

352
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:36,026
You know that
patient- doctor conversation
is privileged,

353
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:39,029
and i couldn't testify
against anybody.

354
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:42,900
Well, maybe they know that,
and maybe they don't.

355
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,786
Either way, they're using it
as a fuckin' excuse.

356
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:49,290
You never mentioned
any of your associates
by name!

357
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,793
All except for that,
uh, one fellow,
uh, booty?

358
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,047
- Pussy. Pussy!
- Pussy, booty--
i don't know his last name!

359
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,050
And look,
anything concerning
your uncle junior--

360
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:05,055
all right,
shut the fuck up a minute.
You're in danger.

361
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:08,175
Get outta here!
That's not fair!

362
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:10,811
Fair? What are you talking
about, fair? They don't
give a shit about fair.

363
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:16,317
Okay, what am i
supposed to do?

364
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:19,820
Leave town.
Today. Right now.

365
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,324
I'm gonna get some guys here
to stay with you
until you get on a plane.

366
00:27:23,324 --> 00:27:25,826
I can't just do that!
Lam it!

367
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:29,330
- I have a life!
I have patients!
- Tell'em august came early.

368
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:31,448
It doesn't work that way.

369
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:33,450
I have patients
who are suicidal.

370
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,586
They're not gonna feel
any better about their life
if you get clipped.

371
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:40,457
- Jesus fucking christ!
- Look, i know.

372
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:42,459
I'm sorry, okay?

373
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,962
I'm gonna work
on this problem with the people
that pose a threat to you,

374
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:47,965
and i'll take care
of it, and you'll be
able to come back.

375
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:53,854
My god.
People are gonna get
murdered, aren't they?

376
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:57,474
Don't worry about distractions.
You keep your eye on the ball.

377
00:27:57,474 --> 00:28:00,611
- I know what you're thinkin'.
- You have no idea
what i'm thinking.

378
00:28:00,728 --> 00:28:03,731
You're thinkin' you're
gonna go to the cops! But you
can't give them anything.

379
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:09,486
Don't be stupid.
Even in the short term.

380
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,623
Get the fuck out of town.

381
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:19,129
You been a good doctor
to me. Thank you.

382
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:33,227
Artie, how's your rash?

383
00:28:37,731 --> 00:28:39,733
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- How could you?

384
00:28:40,234 --> 00:28:43,604
- How the fuck couldyou--
- you took their money?

385
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:48,492
Good, then do it.
Do it, 'cause i don't
give a fuck anymore.

386
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:51,495
That restaurant
was like my child.

387
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:54,364
So they got in your ear.
Three generations...

388
00:28:54,748 --> 00:28:58,752
of buccos sweated over
that same stove.

389
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,754
Even your mother
treasures the memory
of vesuvio.

390
00:29:04,758 --> 00:29:06,760
My mother?

391
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,013
Oh, don't say
she's lying, ton.
Because why would she?

392
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,884
What'd she tell you,
my mother?
Don't make it worse.

393
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:17,387
Do me the respect
of not treating me...

394
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:19,890
like a fuckin' idiot
piece of shit.

395
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:27,281
When you blew up the restaurant,
you made me party
to a criminal conspiracy.

396
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:29,283
Did you ever stop
to think about that?

397
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:34,037
I don't know what
she told you, my mother--
of all people--

398
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,292
two arson investigators
gave that fire
a clean bill of health, artie.

399
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:42,045
- Why the fuck would i
blow up your restaurant?
- To help me!

400
00:29:42,045 --> 00:29:45,048
You fuckin' bent psycho.

401
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:47,668
You hear your uncle's
gonna hurt my business...

402
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:51,305
by stagin' a hit
in my place, and
that's your solution?

403
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:54,308
To burn it down
for the insurance money!

404
00:29:57,177 --> 00:30:00,180
What kind of stupid,
sick, twisted logic?

405
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:05,819
All right.
Ask yourself a question:
Am i that fuckin' stupid?

406
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:09,823
Huh?
Am i that fuckin' stupid?

407
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,942
Really?

408
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:19,700
My mother,
god bless her,

409
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,703
is goin' senile, artie.

410
00:30:23,203 --> 00:30:27,207
- I mean, you saw.
- I loved my new place so much.

411
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,461
And this ruins everything.

412
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:36,466
I swear to god...

413
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:39,469
i didn't touch
your place, artie.

414
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:43,473
My mother was confused.

415
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:46,109
Look me in the eye.

416
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:50,731
Tell me you didn't lay
a finger on my place.

417
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:56,236
I didn't burn down
your restaurant.

418
00:30:56,236 --> 00:30:59,239
I swear on my mother.

419
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:11,635
Take it easy!

420
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:13,637
What the fuck
are you doin'?

421
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:27,401
Come on. Look out!
You could--

422
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:36,910
it's good we can
get together, you know,
for our regular sunday dinner.

423
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,414
Or somebody's nose
could get out of joint.

424
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:45,419
Joint!

425
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:49,423
You've got to admit it, ma,

426
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:52,175
it's a nice nursing unit
where they let you be signed
out for family occasions.

427
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:54,177
I don't have to
admit anything.

428
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:56,930
- I gotta leave in ten minutes.
- Meadow!

429
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,932
Well, i don't want
dessert, and i have
to study with hunter.

430
00:31:58,932 --> 00:32:01,935
- Is this pork cooked?
-
kids are growin' up.

431
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:04,688
Gonna be
out of the house soon.

432
00:32:05,188 --> 00:32:07,057
- Even goo- gootz over there.
- If you believe
she's going to study,

433
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:12,195
- i got a bridge to sell you.
- I read last week
in the paper...

434
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:14,314
about this family
in "saint luis" obispo.

435
00:32:14,815 --> 00:32:17,818
In california.

436
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:20,320
That whole family died
of trichinosis.

437
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,206
That's uncooked pork.

438
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:25,709
That was last year.
That same family.

439
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:29,329
Listen to him.
He knows everything.

440
00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:37,721
So, uncle jun, what do
you hear from your lawyer
on the big thing?

441
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:41,224
Hey, on and on it goes.
Ma, don't you agree...

442
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:43,593
they should not talk business
at the table?

443
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:45,846
What's goin' on
in your little corner
of the world?

444
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:49,349
- Such as?
- I don't know.
The state of the union?

445
00:32:51,735 --> 00:32:54,354
So, i hear artie bucco
came to see you.

446
00:32:54,354 --> 00:32:56,857
Who is artie?

447
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:04,614
- Friend of mine,
from elementary school. -

448
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:07,117
he owns a restaurant.

449
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:11,121
They had
a little fire in it.
He came to see me?

450
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:14,624
Where? Wh- where--
where are we talkin' about?
Here?

451
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:30,357
I've lost faith in everything.

452
00:33:30,357 --> 00:33:33,860
You moved away from god
quite some time ago, though.

453
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:39,483
Is it fair to say it's
not just this recent crisis?
Yeah. Back in high school.

454
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:43,487
Maybe before.

455
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:47,991
I- i bring the kids
here on holidays,
but my mind wanders.

456
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:51,378
I just...stare
at the stained glass,

457
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:53,880
people's hats--

458
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,384
i'm full of rage, father.

459
00:33:57,884 --> 00:34:00,387
Murderous...whatever...

460
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:02,889
urges.

461
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:08,395
I don't just hate this man.
I hate all men.

462
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:12,516
I hate life.

463
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:15,152
Have you talked
with your wife?

464
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:17,654
I can't.
Why?

465
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,657
Oh, what
it would do to her.

466
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:23,660
She's been through
so much.

467
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,912
Charmaine's a strong woman.

468
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:29,416
Anyway, she's going
to find out in the course
of the investigation.

469
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:35,922
I, uh-- i didn't go
to the insurance company.

470
00:34:36,423 --> 00:34:40,427
Why not?
Well, legally,
what if i'm wrong?

471
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:42,929
I could get hit
with a defamation suit.

472
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,434
Arthur, you know what
your heart is telling you.

473
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:51,438
I think the only reason
you haven't told charmaine...

474
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:55,442
is because you know
she'll insist you go
to the police immediately.

475
00:34:55,442 --> 00:35:00,564
And this will jeopardize
your restaurant.
Everything.

476
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:03,567
You must be strong.

477
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,072
All due respect,
father,

478
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:11,074
you're getting
off the subject.

479
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,715
Sorry i'm fuckin' late.

480
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:22,219
Okay.

481
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,721
I need to tell you
something.

482
00:35:25,222 --> 00:35:28,725
And i want you should
hear it from me, not from
some asshole in the street.

483
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:36,733
About four or five
months ago,

484
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,735
i started seein'
a psychiatrist.

485
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:45,242
You know, i was
passin' out, and uh,
they couldn't find nothin'.

486
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:48,745
She's been helpin' me
with that.

487
00:35:56,753 --> 00:35:59,756
Okay, come on.
Give it to me!
Give it to my face.

488
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:08,765
Well, i'm sure you did it
with complete discretion.

489
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:14,271
And, uh, speakin' for pussy,
if he's still alive,

490
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:16,773
i'm sure he would agree.

491
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:19,776
Business was not discussed.
No names were mentioned.

492
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,283
Junior knows.

493
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:28,285
He's decided
to use it against me.

494
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:39,045
Ask now.
'Cause we're not
discussing this again.

495
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:45,552
It's not the worst thing
i ever heard.

496
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:48,555
I was seein' a therapist
myself about a year ago.

497
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:56,062
I had some issues.
Enough said.

498
00:36:56,062 --> 00:36:58,064
I learned
some copin' skills.

499
00:36:58,064 --> 00:37:02,068
Look, uh,
this thing of ours,

500
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:05,071
the way it's goin'--

501
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:09,075
it'd be better if
we could admit to each other,
uh, these are...

502
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:13,079
painful, stressful times.

503
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,083
But it'll never
fuckin' happen.

504
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:22,589
What about you?
You got a problem
with this?

505
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:25,592
Uh--

506
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:31,097
what was it like,
marriage counseling?

507
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:37,103
Yeah, like that.
Sort of, yeah.

508
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:53,236
The contra commandant was
trying to scare us priests.

509
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:56,239
That's so dangerous
down there.

510
00:37:57,624 --> 00:38:00,126
Mm! Aw--

511
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:05,131
oh, the fresh basil
really adds to it.

512
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:07,133
Mm- hmm. Mm- hmm.
Yeah?

513
00:38:08,134 --> 00:38:10,136
Mm.
Oh, father,
you got a little--

514
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:12,138
mm, thanks.
...mess here.

515
00:38:12,138 --> 00:38:14,007
You want a little bit?
No, please.

516
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:18,395
I have so much at home.
And so,
how are the twins, rosalie?

517
00:38:33,026 --> 00:38:35,028
We should start with,
"would you like a cocktail,

518
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:39,032
or see the wine list?"
Yeah, sure.

519
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:41,418
I'll do it however you like.
On my other job,
the waiters usually do...

520
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:46,423
the cocktail solicitation,
but if you want, i'll do it
as i seat them.

521
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:48,925
Good. Great.
Thanks!
All right.

522
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:53,797
She catches on fast,
that one.

523
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:58,802
Very conscientious.
She's workin' two jobs,
to become a music manager.

524
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:00,804
Whatever that is.

525
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:05,809
Everything is goin' so good.

526
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:10,814
The new exterminators?
I got faith.

527
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:13,817
The owner is portuguese.
They're sticklers.

528
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:18,321
I feel so wonderful
we're up and running again.

529
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:21,825
Oh, you said you had
something to tell me.

530
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,330
I like the bar stools.

531
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:38,475
You're in a good mood
today, dad.

532
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:50,987
And if chucky calls,
you get me on the cell phone.

533
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:53,990
Ho!
You hear me?

534
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,993
Yeah, okay. I think that
i heard you, already.

535
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:58,995
Go take a midol.

536
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:25,889
Nipps. Nipps!

537
00:40:25,889 --> 00:40:28,641
Jeez.
Bad boy!

538
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:22,829
- You prick! -

539
00:41:30,086 --> 00:41:32,088
yeow! Motherfucker!

540
00:41:39,095 --> 00:41:42,098
Ow! You son of a bitch!
Oh, come on. Please.

541
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:44,717
Please. Come on.
Come on!

542
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:48,721
Oh, come on!
Come on, please!
Please!

543
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:51,224
Fuckin' poison ivy
all over.

544
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:55,478
My friend brendan,
you shot him
in his bathtub naked.

545
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:58,481
- No chance to run.
- No! I swear to god!

546
00:41:58,481 --> 00:42:01,868
- It wasn't me, it was junior.
He hated that kid.
- Yeah, right. It was junior.

547
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:06,623
- Mister magoo.
- Oh, come on!
Please! Please, please.

548
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,125
I can feel it
itching me already!

549
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:40,156
Corrado soprano?
F. B. I.
Fuck.

550
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:50,533
Are you lawrence barese?
Aw, what the fuck.
Go on.

551
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:54,537
Joseph sasso,
you're under arrest.
Fuck.

552
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:57,674
Junior soprano, alleged boss of
the new jersey crime family...

553
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:02,178
that bears his name,
was indicted today on
federal racketeering charges.

554
00:43:02,428 --> 00:43:04,931
F. B. I. And local police--
talk about fuckin' timing.

555
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:09,936
- He's lucky he's still alive.
- ...along with
lawrence "larry boy" barese,

556
00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:15,308
ailing alleged underboss
joseph "beppy" sasso, and
13 other reputed mob figures.

557
00:43:15,692 --> 00:43:18,311
Oh, my god.
It's uncle junior.

558
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:21,814
Yeah. Look at the old guy.
Makin' him do the perp walk.

559
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:24,951
- A legitimate businessman.
- Dad, cut the crap.

560
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:26,953
Go blow- dry your hair.

561
00:43:26,953 --> 00:43:30,206
These indictments are part of
an ongoing investigation,

562
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:32,709
stretching back
nearly four years.

563
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:35,962
They represent
the most crippling blow
to mob activities...

564
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:40,967
in the new jersey area
since the early 1980s.

565
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:43,836
Uncle junior got busted.

566
00:43:43,836 --> 00:43:45,838
Cool.

567
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:47,840
Not seized today, although
named in the indictments,

568
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,596
was alleged soprano enforcer
and loan sharking chief,
michael "grab bag" palmice.

569
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:58,601
Authorities believe palmice may
have fled the new jersey area,
acting on prior knowledge.

570
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:00,853
Oh, lucky him!
Earlier today,

571
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:03,489
palmice's wife
denied any knowledge of
her husband's whereabouts.

572
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,993
Yeah, he was, uh,
he was so happy.

573
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:10,496
He was going out
to try out these
new running shoes.

574
00:44:10,496 --> 00:44:14,617
You know, he told me
that he loved me,

575
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:16,619
and that he would
be right back!

576
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,006
- I can't--

577
00:44:20,006 --> 00:44:22,508
all right, go.
Come on. Go eat
somewhere else.

578
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:25,011
Coming up next,
rain from canada.

579
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:28,381
Hello. Yeah, counselor,
thanks for gettin' back
to me so quick.

580
00:44:30,383 --> 00:44:33,886
He says it's a broad
indictment that sounds better
for the feds than it really is.

581
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:37,890
I wasn't named'cause the focus
of the investigation is some
telephone calling card scam...

582
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,892
that junior and larry
had goin',

583
00:44:39,892 --> 00:44:44,397
and this diamante
technical stock thing
that i wasn't into.

584
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,532
Thank god.

585
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:49,535
That prick altieri
gave them reams of shit.

586
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,038
They got stuff on me,
they got stuff on all of us...

587
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:55,041
from the surveillance
at the green grove.

588
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:59,045
They just don't have a case yet.
"An ongoing investigation,"
the d. A. Said.

589
00:44:59,045 --> 00:45:01,547
They always say that
to make it sound good.

590
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:05,551
But this is
no fuckin' joke.

591
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:07,553
What i gotta
worry about now...

592
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:10,556
is the guys that got
pinched today, if they flip.

593
00:45:19,565 --> 00:45:21,567
All right. Good work.

594
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,074
Art! Hello.
How are things?

595
00:45:28,074 --> 00:45:30,576
Good, father.
Busy!
Yeah!

596
00:45:30,576 --> 00:45:34,080
You?
Like the man said,
"rust never sleeps."

597
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,583
Listen, father--

598
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:40,586
i want to thank you
for taking the time out
to talk to me the other day.

599
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:44,590
Ahh. Did you bring
your wife into things?
No.

600
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:48,594
No?
Sitting there in the house
of god, i realized...

601
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:51,597
you can either be
a "yes" person
or a "no" person.

602
00:45:51,597 --> 00:45:54,100
A positive ion
or a negative ion.

603
00:45:55,601 --> 00:45:58,604
I- i'm not quite sure
i get what you're saying.

604
00:45:58,604 --> 00:46:00,606
It's just that...

605
00:46:01,107 --> 00:46:04,610
this woman's always
been an odd bird,
a sea of negativity.

606
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:08,114
Even as a kid, we all
learned to take her ravings
with a grain of salt.

607
00:46:08,114 --> 00:46:10,616
But you also said
the son was unstable.

608
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:18,124
Complicated? Yes, he is.

609
00:46:18,124 --> 00:46:21,127
Little too comfortable
outside the law?
Yes, he is.

610
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:26,249
But it would only add
to the quotient of sorrow
in the world to doubt him.

611
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,752
When the source,
unfortunately, is a person...

612
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:33,256
who rarely has
a kind word for anyone.

613
00:46:33,256 --> 00:46:36,259
Hmm.
You seem at peace.

614
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:39,262
I am, father.

615
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:41,898
Thank you again, father.
Sure.

616
00:46:41,898 --> 00:46:44,400
Okay, artie.

617
00:46:47,403 --> 00:46:49,405
Do you prefer
"corrado" or "junior"?

618
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:53,359
I prefer "mr. Soprano."

619
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,329
Your tenure as boss
was a short one.

620
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:59,782
Actually, it was unusual
in several ways.

621
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:02,251
Let me put this to you
as simply as i can.

622
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:06,255
You can avoid sentencing
on these charges if
you will testify that, in fact,

623
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:10,676
you were not
the boss of north jersey;
that, in fact,

624
00:47:10,676 --> 00:47:14,180
your nephew,
anthony soprano, wasandis.

625
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,600
Thathe, de facto,
controlled your capos...

626
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,602
with the backing of two
of the new york families,

627
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:22,605
communicating through
their emissary, john sacrimoni.

628
00:47:26,058 --> 00:47:28,060
We want johnny sack.

629
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,063
But more than him,
we want mangano and teresi.

630
00:47:31,063 --> 00:47:34,517
I wanna fuck angie dickinson.
See who gets lucky first.

631
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:36,953
We want you
to corroborate information
that we obtained...

632
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:38,955
through informants
and wire tap...

633
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:41,457
that you were allowed
to profit, more or less,

634
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:44,961
but you were not
making policy, and you were
not in the new york loop.

635
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:48,464
You were positioned
to take the hits,
and now you've taken them.

636
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:52,468
Question is, how long are
you gonna keep eating shit?

637
00:47:55,922 --> 00:48:00,426
You're 70 years old.
How many years you got left?

638
00:48:08,935 --> 00:48:12,438
My nephew running things?

639
00:48:12,438 --> 00:48:16,442
Not thatstrunz.
Not in this life.

640
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:27,587
Hey! Here,
let me schlepp that.

641
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:31,340
You got any more
in the car?
Mm- mm.

642
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:34,844
How did you
get in here?
Liliana.

643
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:37,346
She said to tell you
that she left early.

644
00:48:37,346 --> 00:48:41,350
So, what they're sayin'
on the tv about the storm
that's headed this way, huh?

645
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,352
Yeah. You want
some coffee?

646
00:48:43,853 --> 00:48:45,354
Only if you're makin' it.

647
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:47,356
Father, don't start that.

648
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:52,361
No, really.
I mean, it's practically
the cocktail hour anyway.

649
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:55,865
- Would you rather have
a glass of wine?
- How about a lillet?

650
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:59,368
You in the mood?

651
00:48:59,368 --> 00:49:03,372
Just came to check on you guys,
see how you're holding up
with these indictments.

652
00:49:03,372 --> 00:49:05,875
We're hangin' in.
Oh.

653
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:10,379
So, what we were
talking about,
a few months back--

654
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:13,883
think any of these
recent developments have
brought tony any closer...

655
00:49:13,883 --> 00:49:16,385
to reexamining his life?

656
00:49:16,385 --> 00:49:20,389
Making some hard choices?
I told her she was
not to use my card again.

657
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:22,391
No, that's mine.

658
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:24,894
One true thing,
just out on dvd.

659
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:27,396
I was over at video one
anyway, i thought maybe...

660
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:31,017
you might want to take
your mind off these stressors.

661
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,023
You want to stay
for dinner?

662
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:41,527
- Something wrong, carm?
- Just tell me so i know
how many steaks to defrost.

663
00:49:41,527 --> 00:49:46,032
- Tony's not gonna make it.
- Well, if--

664
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:49,035
you know, as i was saying,
my real concern for tony--

665
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:52,788
father, he doesn't give
a flying fuck.

666
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:56,292
You know it
and i know it-- at least
for the foreseeable future.

667
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:58,794
Then that's even
a bigger reason to--
he's a sinner, father.

668
00:49:58,794 --> 00:50:01,797
And you come up here
and you eat his steaks,

669
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:05,301
and you use his
home entertainment center--
carmela,

670
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:10,056
the dvd is for you.
Really? Even after
just last week i told you...

671
00:50:10,556 --> 00:50:13,059
i'm not a big
renee zellwegger fan.
You did?

672
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:17,697
I- i don't remember that.
You wanna watch
one true thing, fine.

673
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:20,199
At least admit it.

674
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:23,703
I d--
i thought you liked movies.
Mea culpa.

675
00:50:23,703 --> 00:50:28,207
Jesus, you know,
i get exactly the same
"who, me?" shit with tony.

676
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:30,710
Two i don't need.

677
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,714
"Has tony thought
about changing?"
Father, please.

678
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:37,216
You do think i'm
a schnorrer, don't you?

679
00:50:37,216 --> 00:50:39,218
A- a- a parasite.

680
00:50:39,218 --> 00:50:42,221
I asked you that before
and you denied it, but clearly
that's what you think.

681
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:44,974
No. You know
what i think, father?

682
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:47,977
I think that you like the--
i don't even know
what to call it--

683
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:53,482
the, uh,"whiff" of sexuality
that never goes anyplace.

684
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,603
I had feelings for you,
carmela. I admitted it.

685
00:50:57,603 --> 00:50:59,605
It's my job to deal
with them so i can...

686
00:50:59,605 --> 00:51:01,607
carry on my pastoral duties.

687
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:04,610
How does rosalie aprile
fit into your feelings for me?

688
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:10,116
Oh, so that's it.

689
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:14,120
I really appreciate
everything that you've done
for me, father phil, truly.

690
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:19,008
The religious counselling,
the book on buddhism,

691
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:22,011
the wonderful chats--
i am very fond of you.

692
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:25,381
More than fond.

693
00:51:26,382 --> 00:51:29,268
But i think you need
to look at yourself.

694
00:51:31,637 --> 00:51:33,639
Call this an intervention.

695
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,143
Because i think
you have this m. O.
Where you manipulate...

696
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:39,645
spiritually
thirsty women,

697
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:43,149
and i think a lot of it is
tied up with food, somehow,

698
00:51:43,149 --> 00:51:46,652
as well as
the sexual tension game.

699
00:51:48,654 --> 00:51:52,158
Whoa.

700
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:45,845
Oh, mr. Soprano?
Your wife found you. Good.

701
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:47,847
Found me?
What are you talking about?

702
00:52:47,847 --> 00:52:51,851
You haven't spoken?
We left a message
on your home machine.

703
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:54,353
Your mom's had a stroke.

704
00:52:54,353 --> 00:52:57,857
Stroke?
The news on tv yesterday,
it really upset her.

705
00:52:57,857 --> 00:53:00,359
Not that it's
any of my business.
Anyhow, it just happened.

706
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,863
The e. M. T. 's are
stabilizing her for the ride
to st. Vincent's.

707
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:08,367
Ma.

708
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:10,369
I know what you did.
Sir, please--

709
00:53:10,369 --> 00:53:14,623
your only son.
Your middle child.

710
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,877
- She can't answer you. Her
speech center's been affected.
- Yeah, my ass.

711
00:53:17,877 --> 00:53:21,881
Heard the tapes, ma.
The fuckin' f. B. I. Tapes.
Don't tell me you don't know--

712
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:24,633
hey!
George clooney, don't get in
the fuckin' middle of this.

713
00:53:24,633 --> 00:53:26,635
Mr. Soprano--
alonzo, call security.

714
00:53:27,136 --> 00:53:31,640
Uncle jun's in jail now.
And i got one last detail
i gotta take care of.

715
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:34,760
Mr. Soprano!
I didn't tell you, i don't
die that fuckin' easy, ma.

716
00:53:34,894 --> 00:53:37,396
I'm gonna live a long,
happy life, which is more
than i can say for you.

717
00:53:37,897 --> 00:53:38,898
That's enough!
Yeah?

718
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:41,150
Keep her moving. Keep moving.

719
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,653
- I try to do right by you.
You try to get me whacked?
- She doesn't understand you.

720
00:53:44,653 --> 00:53:46,655
She smiled!
Look at the look on her face!

721
00:53:47,156 --> 00:53:49,158
Go look at the look
on her face. She's smiling.

722
00:53:49,275 --> 00:53:51,277
Get off me. Off me.

723
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:54,280
Look at her face!
She's got a fuckin' smile
on her face!

724
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,282
All right, that's enough.

725
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:30,899
She go vacation!

726
00:54:55,424 --> 00:54:58,427
Dad, give it up. We're not
gonna make it to aunt patty's.

727
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:05,434
Dad, hello. We're not gonna
make it to aunt patty's.

728
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:07,936
Why did i buy a goddamn
off- road vehicle?

729
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,323
To waste petrochemical
resources?

730
00:55:11,323 --> 00:55:14,827
She's right. We can't
keep drivin' in this. I can
hardly see in front of us here.

731
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:18,580
What street are we on?
I think it's
walnut parkway.

732
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,699
I got an idea.

733
00:55:28,707 --> 00:55:31,210
Come on, come on.
Inside.

734
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:33,712
It better be open.
Forget the umbrella.
Come on.

735
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:44,356
Artie, thank christ.

736
00:55:44,356 --> 00:55:46,859
We went to pick up
the kids at school because
of the buses and all.

737
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:49,478
We can't get to the house.
There's a huge tree
across mountain avenue.

738
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:52,481
Oh, marrone.
We been driving around
since 7:00.

739
00:55:52,481 --> 00:55:55,484
Nobody's eaten nothing.
Ton, i got no power,
no lights--

740
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:57,986
i'm closing as soon as
these last few people leave.

741
00:55:57,986 --> 00:56:00,989
Let's go to mickey d. 's,
they'll be open.
All right, let's go.

742
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:07,880
Let's go.
No! Come on!
What do you-- come on!

743
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:09,998
We'll figure out something.
Come on.

744
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,253
They gave me steroids, too,
but it fucked me up.

745
00:56:14,753 --> 00:56:17,756
Yeah, well, keep away
from me when i ski,
all right?

746
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:21,760
Hey, look at this.
Hey, what are you doing, ton?

747
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,763
Hey, squirt.
How are you doin', pal?

748
00:56:24,763 --> 00:56:27,266
Adriana, you look beautiful.
How are you doin'?

749
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,772
- How are you? -

750
00:56:33,772 --> 00:56:38,777
chiara, her brother and sister,
are back in the kitchen
if you want to say hello.

751
00:56:39,278 --> 00:56:42,281
More refugees.
The gas is still workin'.

752
00:56:42,781 --> 00:56:46,285
I been cookin' by candlelight.
I can make anything
on the menu except--

753
00:56:46,285 --> 00:56:51,173
- whatever you got is fine.
- Jose! Cabernet, por favor.

754
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:54,042
- Regaleali, right?
- Yeah. Beautiful.

755
00:56:55,544 --> 00:56:57,546
No cigars, please.

756
00:57:05,053 --> 00:57:08,557
Look at that fuckin'
lovesick pygmy over there.

757
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,061
The skip seein'
a psychiatrist--

758
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:15,564
how's that sit
with your ass?

759
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:17,566
I usually do
sit with my ass.

760
00:57:17,566 --> 00:57:19,568
Why don't you sit
with yours?
Hey!

761
00:57:19,568 --> 00:57:22,571
Pat cooper over here.

762
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:24,573
Wait a minute.
This bothers you?

763
00:57:25,073 --> 00:57:26,575
Yousawa fuckin'
psychiatrist.

764
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:30,078
Not a woman.
I can't get past that.

765
00:57:30,078 --> 00:57:33,582
It don't compute for me.
You're the one with
the fuckin' issues.

766
00:57:33,582 --> 00:57:36,084
Womanissues.
Ah, i don't even wanna
fuckin' go there.

767
00:57:36,585 --> 00:57:38,587
Well, let's not.

768
00:57:38,587 --> 00:57:41,590
Irregardless,
i said my piece.

769
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,592
What are you
gettin' at, paulie?

770
00:57:44,092 --> 00:57:47,095
Nothin'.

771
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:50,599
Look, he's gonna be
their new boss now.

772
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:54,603
In name, in everything.
Wish himbuona fortuna.

773
00:57:58,991 --> 00:58:00,993
You guys have any
peanut butter back here?

774
00:58:00,993 --> 00:58:03,996
You gotta be kidding.

775
00:58:14,006 --> 00:58:17,626
Oh, god, artie, you saved
our friggin' lives here.

776
00:58:18,877 --> 00:58:21,380
It's beautiful, artie.
Thank you.

777
00:58:21,513 --> 00:58:23,015
Enjoy.

778
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:27,519
- Ah, fuck!
- Hey!

779
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:29,638
You said "frig."

780
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,143
All right,
wait a minute.

781
00:58:35,143 --> 00:58:37,396
I'd like to propose a toast.

782
00:58:39,281 --> 00:58:41,400
To my family.

783
00:58:43,902 --> 00:58:47,906
Someday soon, you're gonna
have families of your own.

784
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:50,909
And if you're lucky,

785
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:53,912
you'll remember
the little moments.

786
00:58:53,912 --> 00:58:56,415
Like this.

787
00:58:59,918 --> 00:59:02,921
That were good.

788
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:06,808
Cheers.
