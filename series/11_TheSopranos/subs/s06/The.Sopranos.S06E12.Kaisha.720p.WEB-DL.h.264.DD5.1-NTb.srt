1
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:41,148
Motherfucker!

2
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,159
- I just got rid of the last.
- Thank fuckin' Christ.

3
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,489
I drove up to Connecticut.

4
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:00,119
Good. The rump roast went in
down the shore.

5
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,539
So the barbecue over in
Sheepshead Bay... that still a go?

6
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:05,539
You know I'm not really sure
where the big guy left that.

7
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,440
This way, sweetheart. There's something
I need to get straight between us.

8
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:33,821
Seriously, you look beautiful tonight.

9
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:02,142
- Yeah.
- It's done. Listen.

10
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:07,062
Gee, sounds like a real weenie roast.

11
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:09,402
Your friend the Shah was walkin' in.

12
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:12,573
Him and some schifosa got
blown back on their keisters.

13
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:18,743
...and last, transfer of the deed to Jamba Juice.

14
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:24,623
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

15
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:30,423
I'll meet you out front.

16
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:35,344
Listen, I just wanted to apologise.

17
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:40,514
That night...
it's just I make it a policy not to mix business...

18
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:42,854
No apology necessary, seriously.

19
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:49,114
Good, cos I haven't been able to forget
about you and it ain't like I haven't been tryin'.

20
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:53,655
So, you free for dinner? Maybe?

21
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:55,705
Thanks, but I think I'll pass.

22
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:57,785
Congratulations on the sale, though.

23
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:06,255
Morning Sunshine, Benjamin Moore.

24
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:09,385
And we can do the borders
with the Disney characters.

25
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:13,306
Makes me nervous, this stuff.

26
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,056
We should wait to decorate till the baby's born.

27
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:18,976
Again with the superstitions?

28
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:22,186
Remember the penguin movie, how you cried?

29
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:28,446
You sit on an egg for months, one
little thing goes wrong, you're left with nothing.

30
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:31,277
Honey, I'm not Adriana.

31
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:34,617
I'm healthy. Our baby's healthy.

32
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:37,117
Stop worrying and enjoy this time, OK?

33
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:40,417
I am. Let's just stop countin' the chickens.

34
00:05:59,648 --> 00:06:02,148
Workin' man get off OK?

35
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:03,858
He was gone by the time I got up.

36
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:07,028
Used to be he wasn't home
by the time you got up.

37
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,829
What's the matter?

38
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:20,539
- Liz La Cerva tried to commit suicide. Pills.
- What'd she do that for?

39
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,089
She got a letter for Ade
from the Salvation Army.

40
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,209
- Ade's homeless?
- She made a donation every year

41
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,299
to feed the homeless on Thanksgiving.

42
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:33,166
Jag sa ju att jag hade
Ã¤nnu en drÃ¶m om Ade i Paris.

43
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:36,519
En fransk polis berÃ¤ttade att hon
var dÃ¶d och jag mÃ¥ste berÃ¤tta det.

44
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,850
She thinks her daughter is dead.

45
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,140
I told you I had another dream
about Ade in Paris.

46
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,440
A French policeman told me
she was dead and I had to tell her.

47
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,360
I know, Carm. PepÄÂ© Le Pew...

48
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,690
Doesn't change the fact Adriana is missing.

49
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,240
Or the fact her mother's a bitter lush
who can't accept reality.

50
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:52,321
What reality?

51
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:55,451
That her daughter couldn't stand her
so she moved away.

52
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,291
That's what you say to me two weeks

53
00:06:57,331 --> 00:07:00,001
after our own daughter
moves away to California.

54
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,791
Come on, will you stop?
It's a different situation entirely.

55
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:08,421
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just...
it's just everything all at once.

56
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,262
What everything?

57
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:13,972
The holidays are coming
and my spec house has gone to shit.

58
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:17,972
Well, AJ's got a job. He's doing better.

59
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,772
You raised two gorgeous kids.

60
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:24,152
You got a husband that loves you.
You made us a beautiful home.

61
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:27,652
Doesn't that count for something?

62
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,863
Come on.

63
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:38,913
Not exactly a Thanksgiving Day
classic here, Ed...

64
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:42,163
What the fuck? Come on, cut it out.

65
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,923
He's already talkin' like a construction worker.

66
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:48,343
Yeah, funny. See how you like
working out in the cold.

67
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,224
Go check on the bird.

68
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,724
Bring back some onion dip too.

69
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:05,984
So how's your bird these days?

70
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:11,244
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- Come on, clandestine phone calls...

71
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:13,155
I know you got a new goomah.

72
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:16,035
- What can I say...
- With a pregnant wife at home.

73
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:20,375
- Your timing is fuckin' priceless.
- Playground's closed. A man has his needs.

74
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:22,375
When Carmela had her spec house,

75
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:27,005
I can't tell you how often I had to fend for
myself while she looked at bathroom fixtures.

76
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:29,635
So this new one,
why don't you bring her around?

77
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,926
Honestly, I would but...

78
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:35,346
between us, she's black.

79
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:37,516
You're bangin' a shine?

80
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:42,106
She's hot, too. Classy.
Not that it would matter to Paulie.

81
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:48,066
- I'd still have to listen to all his racial bullshit.
- Yeah. She would feel it too.

82
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:00,787
Hey, Uncle Paulie.

83
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:08,677
The fuck you doin'?

84
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:17,638
There's my girl.
Come here. Gimme that cheek.

85
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,608
I got your cheque.

86
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,898
She a doll or what? Blanca.

87
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,738
Hi. I'm Anthony.

88
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:30,568
Yeah. I just did your paperwork.

89
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,369
- You live in Jersey?
- Hello.

90
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,119
My urologist. I gotta take this.

91
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,659
Soprano!

92
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,711
I would've cleaned up if you gave me a minute.

93
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,621
You started it.

94
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:29,631
Seriously, I'm sorry it's such a pigsty.

95
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:34,602
I just work a lot and I'm a pig.

96
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:37,472
Gonna get a tree in here?

97
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:41,602
I come from Hanukkah people,
but it doesn't do a lot for me.

98
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:44,942
So Christmas Eve's just another day to you?

99
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:47,692
We usually go to some incredibly shitty movie.

100
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:50,902
There's nothin' else.
Makes me worried about my project.

101
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:54,743
- You ruined my dress.
- Save it.

102
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,993
Like Monica Lewinsky.

103
00:10:57,043 --> 00:11:00,123
Show your friends
how hard you made me come.

104
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:12,343
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know.

105
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:16,064
Can't stop thinkin'
about fucking you all the time.

106
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:26,114
How can you even like a person
who sleeps with a married guy?

107
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:27,734
Can we not talk about it?

108
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:30,694
I rushed in with her. I thought I wanted it.

109
00:11:30,745 --> 00:11:33,035
You do.

110
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:35,575
And you're not giving it a chance.

111
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:39,915
You'll see, eventually you'll want kids.
It'll be good.

112
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:42,925
I don't want a family with her.

113
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:45,255
She's got no idea who I am.

114
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:49,465
She "doesn't understand you"?

115
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:04,696
Phil asked me for this meeting
after the fire in his wire room.

116
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:07,946
Correction. You asked me to fuckin' attend.

117
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:10,366
- I agreed.
- Fair enough.

118
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:15,367
Now I won't call it a sit-down because
of the inclement negative implications.

119
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,877
Let's think of it as a meeting of minds.

120
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:23,047
Now for whatever reason, certain incidents
have expired lately

121
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:28,927
that, as well as being dangerous, may have an
adverse impact on our respective bottom lines.

122
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:33,098
I know Vito's bottom was impacted
if that's what you're referring to.

123
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:38,148
- You're talkin' about one of my captains.
- Captain? The Good Ship Lollipop, right?

124
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:40,188
- Phil, please.
- Please, my ass.

125
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:42,148
The man was a fuckin' disgrace.

126
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:45,318
Well, before he came out of the closet,
he worked for me.

127
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:48,488
And he put a lot of money in my pocket.
And yours, too.

128
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,789
Talk about earners?
How about Fat Dom Gamiello?

129
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:55,079
- What about him?
- He's MIA.

130
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:58,829
- People are concerned for his wellbeing.
- What would I know about it?

131
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,049
As coincidence would have it,
he was last seen in New Jersey.

132
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:04,759
So was the Hindenburg.
You wanna look into that?

133
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,589
Tony, please. Phil.

134
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,929
We're getting off point.

135
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,720
I grew up in this, guys.

136
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,180
And I just lost my friend Rusty,

137
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,770
and for reasons
I will discern in time, believe me.

138
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,190
If there's one thing
my father taught me it's this...

139
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,740
a pint of blood costs more
than a gallon of gold.

140
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,320
My business, all of our businesses...

141
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:31,581
this infighting's costing money.

142
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:33,661
I'm willing to move forward,

143
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,211
let the past be bygones.

144
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:41,041
- Fine with me.
- A wise decision on both your parts.

145
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:44,921
Now what I'd love to see is a truce.
Wipe the slate clean.

146
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:49,091
The no-shows, the wire room, Vito...
put it all behind us.

147
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,102
Yeah.

148
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,392
Your brother Billy, whatever happened...

149
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,392
- All right.
- "Whatever happened"?

150
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:58,312
- The shooting.
- "Whatever happened"?

151
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:01,272
- God rest his soul.
- I'll tell you what fuckin' happened.

152
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:04,572
- This shit's cousin put six bullets in the kid...
- Calm down.

153
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,862
...without any provocation whatsoever!

154
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:08,992
- My cousin's dead.
- Fuck you!

155
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:14,033
- We were making headway. I didn't mean...
- Fuck what you meant, cocksucker!

156
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,163
Come on.

157
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,543
Jesus Christ, Carmine. What the fuck?

158
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,553
Why would you possibly bring that up?

159
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:32,854
He's holdin' the board, looking the other way.
So the nail gun goes off, bam!

160
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:35,644
- Right through the dude's cheek.
- Fuck.

161
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,306
- Passaic.
- What?

162
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,976
Where I live. You asked me.

163
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,856
Right.

164
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:22,236
Why you ask me that?
You gonna come over, take me on a date?

165
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:24,446
Yeah, absolutely.

166
00:15:25,276 --> 00:15:28,986
I got a son, Hector. He's three.

167
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,407
That's cool.

168
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,047
You're gonna call me, right?

169
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,467
There's only six numbers.

170
00:15:48,508 --> 00:15:50,468
I left the last one off.

171
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:53,728
You wanna find me,
you're gonna have to work for it.

172
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,818
You have an emergency call on two.

173
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:05,738
My God. Pop?

174
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:07,908
Guess who.

175
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:10,288
- Not funny.
- Had to get your attention.

176
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:12,959
You had it. Now you're wasting my time.
I have to go.

177
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:16,379
Hold on. You got a warehouse
listed on Panama

178
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,879
that used to be a uniform supply.

179
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,259
- What's the asking?
- Three and a quarter. Can I go now?

180
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:24,549
I was driving by. I thought it had potential.

181
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,469
But it's really 9,400 square feet

182
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:30,969
of leaky tar paper roofs and clotted galvanized
plumbing and no foot traffic.

183
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,980
Ease up on the hard sell there.

184
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,270
I'm thinking, you get the seller to knock
something meaningful off the asking,

185
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,440
I fix it, you flip it.

186
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,610
Whatever happened,
we made some money together, right?

187
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,450
- You serious about this?
- You never do shit like that?

188
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:52,581
I'll get back to you.

189
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:02,801
I was up for anything.

190
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:04,511
He signed the escrow papers

191
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,011
and I'm not sure what happened

192
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:09,971
but he left.

193
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,892
It was so fucking humiliating.

194
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:18,022
And I was so worked up.
I just needed to smooth it out.

195
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:20,402
So there's the Cristal.

196
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:26,032
I mean it could've been
worse, given my history.

197
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:28,362
It could've been junk.

198
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:31,033
Julie, right?

199
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,993
- Julianna.
- Christopher.

200
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:36,123
I liked your share in there, seriously.

201
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:39,213
I'm glad... or sorry, I guess.

202
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:42,003
Got a similar situation with my job.

203
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:44,383
I really get that rush when it's working.

204
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:47,263
I don't think I've ever heard you share in there.

205
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:51,103
- Not a judgment, by the way.
- You learn as much from others.

206
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:53,224
I split my time at NA too.

207
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,064
Junk's another thing...

208
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:57,184
Tell me about it.

209
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:02,404
- You look familiar.
- Pork store there, Satriale's.

210
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:06,194
Right.

211
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,495
Cool. So I guess I'll see you.

212
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:13,995
Or maybe next week, here.

213
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:16,505
Wait. You wanna go for coffee?

214
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,675
Well, OK.

215
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:24,465
Wanna follow me to that dive on Sip and JFK?

216
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:53,626
For some people, depression is a form
of forced introversion.

217
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:56,997
And in Lincoln's case,
it was extremely painful.

218
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,917
But it's out of that forced introversion

219
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,257
- that comes the Lincoln...
- Where you been?

220
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:06,507
Linda Merola's. I left you a message.
The annual Christmas toy drive.

221
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:09,847
- How was it?
- It was nice. We gave an Xbox.

222
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:16,818
So, Stan Klimik was there.
Ruth's husband? He works for Kroll.

223
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:20,278
- The private eyes?
- He does their computers.

224
00:19:20,318 --> 00:19:24,198
I was telling him about Ade
and he said we should hire professionals

225
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:26,828
- to track her down.
- Carm...

226
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:30,328
It's not as expensive as you might think.
He gave me his card.

227
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,499
Look, it's not about the money.

228
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,919
Did you think maybe it's
an intrusion into Ade's personal life?

229
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,049
But what if she's in trouble, Tony?

230
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:48,179
Stan said they had this case once,
this guy ran out on his child support.

231
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:51,929
He was a hiking enthusiast,
missing 12 years

232
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,810
and they tracked him down to a watering
station in the Mojave Desert.

233
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,490
Carmela's spec house?
I need you to lean on that building inspector.

234
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,330
- Leave it alone, you said.
- Do it, for all our sakes.

235
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:12,451
My wife needs a career.

236
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,001
Tony, season's greetings.

237
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,291
Good holidays to your family...

238
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:20,421
Yeah, you too.

239
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,761
Well, it's bigger than I thought.

240
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:31,641
I had a developer who said he could
do apartments, some light retail,

241
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:34,732
but we snagged on some zoning issues.

242
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:37,192
Let me worry about that.

243
00:20:37,232 --> 00:20:42,032
So who's this fiancÄÂ©
you were telling me about?

244
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:45,952
Jesus, what the fuck do you want here?

245
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,122
- Just move on...
- I was confused, OK?

246
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:53,123
- I'm not now.
- What a coincidence,

247
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:55,713
cos that's exactly how I feel.

248
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:59,173
Take all the time you need.
Just stick it in the lock box.

249
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:12,314
It's only the latest draft.

250
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,934
Guy who wrote it, I met him at a meeting.
JT Dolan, big user.

251
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,854
You can tell. It's relentless.

252
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:21,024
Yeah, it's a work in progress.

253
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:24,744
I didn't mean it like that. There's a lot in it.

254
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,204
Are you sure about the title, Cleaver?

255
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,034
The Jerry Mathers connection?

256
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:32,335
Rules of success for pictures like this?

257
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:36,415
One-word titles - Saw, Hostel, Cleaver.

258
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:42,295
But Michael, he knows
it's the boss right away?

259
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:45,465
- You might want to make it more of a mystery.
- Maybe.

260
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:47,935
This boss, he's a really rough...

261
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:52,396
Is Anthony Soprano like that?

262
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,106
He's just a jumping-off point for the character.

263
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:01,486
He's got some similarness.

264
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:03,946
Like he thinks everything's his.

265
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:05,906
But it's not.

266
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,627
I can't get into it but there are some rules.

267
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,957
Thank you. Don't get into it.
I don't wanna know.

268
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,627
It's just weird, you know?
Being where he's been.

269
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:24,297
He hasn't been anywhere.
Nothing happened. I told you that.

270
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:27,097
Don't matter. He's been there in his mind.

271
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:30,268
Fine.

272
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:45,238
You're right. Guy's got a lot more
on his mind than this.

273
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,868
Like whether or not to have
that third sandwich.

274
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,469
I'm not a fucking parking spot.

275
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,790
I loved Dom more than anybody.

276
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,370
But we don't know
if Tony was behind this.

277
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:32,251
It was payback for Vito.

278
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,751
So why the fuck did they blow up
the wire room?

279
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:41,381
- The balls on this prick.
- To blow up a store, you call that balls?

280
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,511
Balls is you look a guy in the eye
as you jam an ice pick in his lung.

281
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:46,931
I meant balls as in nerve, gall.

282
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:48,761
I know what the fuck you meant.

283
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:51,732
Far as I'm concerned, this is like 9/11.

284
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:53,852
Tony wanted our attention. Fine.

285
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:56,692
He got our attention.
Now we wipe him off the planet.

286
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:59,862
That fat cocksucker says
I look like the Shah of Iran.

287
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:02,952
- Who does?
- Tony.

288
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:05,412
- I never got that at all.
- Fat piece of shit.

289
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:09,662
It's irrelevant, Phil.
But he's testin' you all the time.

290
00:24:09,703 --> 00:24:11,373
And you keep indulging him.

291
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:14,793
You're right.

292
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:19,803
But whack a boss? I won't do that.

293
00:24:19,843 --> 00:24:22,383
- It's been done before.
- And it was wrong then.

294
00:24:22,423 --> 00:24:25,973
Eye for an eye then...
Pick somebody over there.

295
00:24:31,564 --> 00:24:35,694
White trash motherfuckers in Narcotics
Anonymous. Fucking Jerry Springer Show.

296
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:38,404
What the fuck with your whining tonight?

297
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:43,784
Listen... I been involved with this girl.

298
00:24:43,824 --> 00:24:45,784
In there, that's the place to share.

299
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,284
It's complicated.

300
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:53,085
Remember that real estate agent
Tony dealt with? The Jewish one?

301
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,585
Fuckin' A. He planted the flag. I'd back off.

302
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:59,545
He didn't do shit, she said. He wanted
to but never pulled the trigger.

303
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:01,635
OK, it's touchy but OK.

304
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:06,345
I don't know if it's OK but fuck him
and what he don't know, you know?

305
00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:10,105
So what's the problem?

306
00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:13,526
She's in recovery. Junk.

307
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:17,066
Her? Fuckin' movie of the week.

308
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:20,946
Listen to me. That last run you went on,
beginning with the feast?

309
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,696
How hard you had to work
to get back from that?

310
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:28,536
Civilians, their bosses find out they slipped,
they get a plane ticket to Minnesota.

311
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:31,497
Tony will mulch his roses
with what's left of you.

312
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:33,957
She's solid now. Years sober.

313
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:35,957
We fuckin' met at a meeting.

314
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,927
- That never happens to me.
- That's all you got to say?

315
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,967
Schools of thought...

316
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:45,057
The two of you together could be enabling.
Bad habits shared.

317
00:25:45,097 --> 00:25:48,387
It's more she knows how bad it is.
We watch out for each other.

318
00:25:48,438 --> 00:25:51,398
She wouldn't even
let me have Red Bull. Seriously.

319
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:54,228
That's the other school.
Two are stronger than one.

320
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:56,438
I know I'm different with her.

321
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,238
Well, I guess we just keep an eye on it.

322
00:26:00,408 --> 00:26:02,068
You fuckin' lucky cocksucker.

323
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:06,078
- Another married man?
- I know.

324
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:08,998
And it gets worse. I think he's connected.

325
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,079
To what?

326
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:13,089
- The Mafia.
- No...

327
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:17,629
Actually, I know he is because
I was involved with his boss.

328
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:21,219
You ever hear of Anthony Soprano?

329
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:24,299
Sorry, Jules.
I don't even know where to fucking start.

330
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,519
I know, I know.

331
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,059
The stupid thing is he's sweet.
He's good to me.

332
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,110
Listen to this very carefully...

333
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,530
I'm your sponsor. I'm not judging you.
I'm not disappointed.

334
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,360
I am concerned
and I'm here to help you help yourself.

335
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,240
Unlike you, I've lived
in North Jersey my whole life.

336
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,830
And those people like his boss,
they are sociopaths. Murderers, actually.

337
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:54,501
I know, Ame, but I think you're getting
a little carried away.

338
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:58,171
Don't hug me.
On top of everything I'm getting a cold.

339
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:01,681
Cock...

340
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,931
...sucker motherfucker!

341
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:05,851
You shit asshole! I hate you!

342
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,351
This man is so lame.

343
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:12,602
Shit.

344
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:15,982
- What's wrong?
- These assholes again.

345
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:18,362
They wake up the baby.

346
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:26,332
My baby's sleeping.

347
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:28,542
Come out here and suck our dick!

348
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,253
What's this asshole's problem?

349
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:37,043
My ex used to go down
and kick their asses, but...

350
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:39,383
now they're back.

351
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:44,343
OK, baby. It's all right.

352
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:48,223
It's all right, baby.

353
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:58,614
Fuckwads.

354
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:27,805
Look, you guys move.
Go hang somewhere else,

355
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:30,605
I'll give you this bike. It's a Gary Fisher.

356
00:28:30,646 --> 00:28:34,896
It's only a year old.
My parents gave it to me last Christmas.

357
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:42,616
All right.

358
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,847
It doesn't bother you
that I'm younger than you are?

359
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:12,728
You know who was born
on your birthday? Jesse Ventura.

360
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:15,278
Who?

361
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:18,278
He's a famous politician. I looked it up.

362
00:29:18,318 --> 00:29:20,618
How do you know my birthday?

363
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:24,908
I did your W-4, remember? The withholding?

364
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:36,799
You sure it don't bother you I have a baby?

365
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,759
No, I love kids.

366
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:47,599
This is ridiculous.
You're not goin' no place.

367
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:50,349
- I want to.
- We can watch a DVD.

368
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,940
I got the 50 Cent movie down in my trunk.

369
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,400
They were giving it away at the car wash.

370
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,490
Don't talk.

371
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,990
That's it. You're fuckin' grounded. Lie down.

372
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,961
I'm gonna go get some Robitussin.

373
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:15,001
No! It's got dextromethorphan.

374
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:19,381
What are you gonna do?
Rip your fuckin' lungs out? This is crazy.

375
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:23,851
You certainly seem very anxious
to get cough medicine in here.

376
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:27,021
I resent that.

377
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,902
Fuck it! It's over the counter.
How much shit could be in it?

378
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:50,332
Maybe you could get some valerian tea.

379
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:53,003
You put eight, nine, ten tea bags in a cup.

380
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:58,173
- Fuck's that gonna do?
- It's equal to like taking a Valium.

381
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:01,633
- I didn't know that.
- Same chemical family.

382
00:31:03,393 --> 00:31:06,393
Gotta have some cough
suppressant value, right?

383
00:31:07,813 --> 00:31:11,733
Worst-case scenario,
it might help you sleep, at least.

384
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:15,364
What do you think?

385
00:31:15,404 --> 00:31:20,034
- Valerian tea.
- You have to go to the health food store.

386
00:31:30,795 --> 00:31:34,715
Jesus Christ, they didn't teach you
how to use a pair of pliers yet?

387
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:38,095
- It smells all Christmassy in here.
- Yeah.

388
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:42,845
Come on.

389
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:46,895
The Russos... picture of their dogs.

390
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:49,685
It's sad, with no children.

391
00:31:57,156 --> 00:32:03,536
My God! The Building Department. They're
repealing the stop work order on my house!

392
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,576
"Construction may begin immediately."

393
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:09,416
Tony, is this you? This is the best
Christmas present I could ever get!

394
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:14,047
I better return that vacuum I got you then.

395
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:16,047
Christmas Eve, besides the shrimp,

396
00:32:16,087 --> 00:32:19,887
- I told DeSanto the cherrystones.
- Fine, good.

397
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:22,307
Sure? Last year you said they were chewy.

398
00:32:22,347 --> 00:32:23,927
The littlenecks then.

399
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:28,227
Jesus! Ebenezer Scrooge over here.

400
00:32:28,858 --> 00:32:32,858
So stop breakin' my balls about clams.
I don't feel good.

401
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:38,568
The Soft Scrub, lemon scented.

402
00:32:41,488 --> 00:32:43,948
You're cool as a cucumber.

403
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:45,998
Did I say I'm hot?

404
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,828
I got a tightness
in my chest up by the oesophagus.

405
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:51,039
Well, you just had a checkup, Phil.

406
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,089
Yeah.

407
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:58,429
Imagine Christmas for
Marie and the kids after all that with Vito?

408
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:00,969
The DiBellas, too.

409
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:02,719
Catherine's stroke?

410
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:04,929
Remember last year at my mother's house?

411
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:09,479
Francesca Spatafore did
that beautiful solo of O Holy Night?

412
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,400
Vito accompanied her on the piano?

413
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,860
I gotta try and take a shit.

414
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,910
When one has a heart attack,
the body releases proteins

415
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,450
that act as markers
we would detect in the blood.

416
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,830
You don't show any, sir.

417
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,830
- So, his heart is fine?
- Yep.

418
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,580
Jesus Christ.

419
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,670
Some people
would pay millions for that diagnosis.

420
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:32,671
- So what's wrong with me?
- My guess is simple gas.

421
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:36,131
- I always say he's full of hot air.
- Pharmacy's down the hall.

422
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:39,721
They will give you some antacid. Take care.

423
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:41,681
Arrogant prick.

424
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,931
Nervous Nellie. That's what you are.

425
00:33:58,532 --> 00:34:00,072
I'm so sorry.

426
00:34:00,112 --> 00:34:01,952
This asshole Wall Street couple

427
00:34:01,992 --> 00:34:04,582
came back to look at this loft space.

428
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,975
- I'm dyin'. My heart!
- My God!

429
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:06,055
OK, we're here. We're here.

430
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:09,685
It's all right, it's all right.
It's OK. Don't worry about it.

431
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:12,196
Help! My husband.

432
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,606
- Phil!
- Crash cart!

433
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:17,156
Can I get a crash cart? Crash cart!

434
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:24,536
I fucked a girl wearing a Santa hat once.

435
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:28,416
It was too distracting. I kept losin' my hard-on.

436
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:30,547
Hey, Tone. Did you hear?

437
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,757
Phil Leotardo took a heart attack,
a big one apparently.

438
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:37,507
So there is a Santa Claus.

439
00:35:37,547 --> 00:35:41,767
He's in intensive care over in Brooklyn.
Doesn't look too good.

440
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:47,517
Sweetheart, drinks all around.
And a club soda for the messenger here.

441
00:35:47,557 --> 00:35:49,897
You're happy about this, T?

442
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:52,988
Why not? He's a pain in my balls.

443
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,948
A manageable pain though...
The devil you know...

444
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,778
After the scene at Little Carmine's?

445
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:05,418
- Corrado, don't you have nothing?
- You can make a hand turkey.

446
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:08,458
For Christmas? Fuckin' idiot.

447
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:13,169
Visitor for Mr Soprano.

448
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:19,099
Bobby!

449
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,189
Any of you know what bacala is?

450
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,019
Of course you don't.

451
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,070
Well, it's salted cod.

452
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,740
We taught the world how to eat.

453
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,910
Junior, sit.

454
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,710
Happy holidays...

455
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,620
You smell the piss in this place?

456
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,040
I ain't gonna stay too long.

457
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:53,461
Just to say you should keep this.

458
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,971
- What's that?
- You had Beppe drop it by, remember?

459
00:36:57,011 --> 00:36:59,891
Had a Post-it? It said "Merry Christmas"?

460
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:06,481
It's a gift. It's a little something
for you and Karen and the kids.

461
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:09,191
It wouldn't be right.

462
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:12,652
Frankly, I shouldn't be here
after what happened with Tony.

463
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:17,072
- He's still up on his cross?
- Junior, you shot him.

464
00:37:17,822 --> 00:37:21,742
Yeah, well it's not that simple.
I know a few things you don't.

465
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:25,792
- Like maybe I wasn't acting alone.
- Junior, JFK was 40 years ago.

466
00:37:25,832 --> 00:37:28,002
That's all I'll say about that.

467
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:32,503
You see that one over there?

468
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:35,633
An attorney. I'm mounting my case.

469
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:39,683
Look, I should take off.

470
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:41,473
You want a snack? A soda?

471
00:37:41,513 --> 00:37:43,223
What the fuck? You just got here.

472
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:47,313
Happy holidays.

473
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:07,044
Here.

474
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,374
One hand washes the other.

475
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:11,885
So the husband says, "I wasn't talkin' to you."

476
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:35,776
You know her?

477
00:38:35,826 --> 00:38:39,076
That's right, you and her...

478
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:43,076
- How'd that all go?
- I had to put her on the shelf.

479
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:49,086
Yeah, she's a friend of Kaisha,
the black one I was tellin' you about.

480
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:54,007
She was just now asking
what to get Kaisha for her birthday.

481
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:58,137
What'd you tell her?

482
00:38:58,177 --> 00:39:00,057
Luther Vandross, a box set.

483
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,950
You know what's interesting?

484
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,330
Us being able to use again,

485
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,960
but integrating it into our lives.

486
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,710
Yeah.

487
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,840
Work...

488
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,301
socialise...

489
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:17,051
but still having a mastery.

490
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:22,471
- Not easy.
- But interesting as shit.

491
00:40:36,242 --> 00:40:38,742
For one thing, we don't use needles.

492
00:40:50,543 --> 00:40:53,553
I should probably tell Tony we're fucking.

493
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:03,273
What?

494
00:41:03,313 --> 00:41:05,893
We're not any more.

495
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:08,443
He's already hinky.

496
00:41:09,774 --> 00:41:12,194
He starts pokin' around,

497
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:14,494
finds out we met in AA,

498
00:41:14,534 --> 00:41:17,404
he could suspect I'm usin' again...

499
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:25,624
and ruin everything.

500
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:59,286
- There he is.
- Where the fuck you been?

501
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:01,246
You heard that Phil had surgery now?

502
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:03,956
Turds in the aorta... a medical first.

503
00:42:03,996 --> 00:42:05,796
Gotta see my chiropodist.

504
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:10,216
T, there's something I should tell you.

505
00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:20,807
- The real estate agent.
- Yeah?

506
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:23,187
I've been bangin' her.

507
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:30,197
See, I knew some shit was goin' on.

508
00:42:32,238 --> 00:42:34,028
Why the fuck did you lie to me?

509
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,288
I wasn't sure how it ended with you two

510
00:42:36,328 --> 00:42:38,288
till you set me straight.

511
00:42:38,328 --> 00:42:40,748
Stupid, right?

512
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:43,578
Point is I want everything above boards

513
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:46,588
as always between you and me.

514
00:42:46,628 --> 00:42:48,628
I don't give a fuck.

515
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:51,259
Do what you want with her.

516
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,969
- This is my reward.
- Your reward.

517
00:42:58,019 --> 00:42:59,349
I do not betray my wife.

518
00:42:59,389 --> 00:43:02,809
I go out of my way
not to have an affair with this woman,

519
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:05,479
this very hot,

520
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,729
very beautiful, intelligent woman...

521
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,150
cos of the way Carmela
nursed me and cared for me.

522
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,320
And my fuckin' turkey-neck of a nephew

523
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,030
winds up with his dick in there.

524
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,910
A guy I gotta see every day.

525
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,210
This is my reward.

526
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,710
- Frankly, I'm encouraged.
- With the fuckin' riddles again.

527
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,460
I sat here dreading the end of the story

528
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:30,051
would involve you erupting

529
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:33,591
in some act of violence towards your nephew.

530
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:35,011
Christmas isn't over yet.

531
00:43:35,051 --> 00:43:37,221
You came out of that shooting

532
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:39,641
feeling each day is a gift.

533
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:42,181
Well, this is a corollary to that.

534
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:44,691
A what?

535
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:48,401
You don't have to eat every dish of rigatoni.

536
00:43:48,442 --> 00:43:51,152
You don't have to fuck every female you meet.

537
00:43:56,112 --> 00:43:59,702
You know what I've been realising?

538
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:03,002
These women, they're all sort of the same...

539
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:06,292
dark complexion, smart,

540
00:44:06,332 --> 00:44:09,172
they smell a little bit of money.

541
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:13,223
There's you and Gloria

542
00:44:13,263 --> 00:44:15,473
and this "Ashkenuzi".

543
00:44:17,763 --> 00:44:21,223
- So what's that about?
- What do you think it's about?

544
00:44:27,403 --> 00:44:29,773
Well...

545
00:44:29,824 --> 00:44:34,284
It's probably the reason I still come here,
to hang out with you...

546
00:44:34,324 --> 00:44:38,124
cos nothing really changes
with the therapy part.

547
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,336
Tone? That fed's out front. Harris.

548
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:28,126
Says he wants you to know
he's here having a sandwich.

549
00:45:39,477 --> 00:45:43,147
- What's the matter? Not enough mayo?
- Tony, how you doing?

550
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:46,527
Good. So how's the war on terror?

551
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:50,157
Christmas is always
potentially our busy season.

552
00:45:50,198 --> 00:45:53,448
So, Phil Leotardo... Coronary?

553
00:45:53,488 --> 00:45:56,698
I swear to God I had nothin' to do with that.

554
00:45:56,748 --> 00:46:01,748
Just so you know, I'm still in touch
with some agents who work OC.

555
00:46:01,788 --> 00:46:04,998
From what they hear,
you're not very popular in Brooklyn.

556
00:46:05,048 --> 00:46:06,878
So what else is new?

557
00:46:06,918 --> 00:46:09,468
That someone close to you may be in danger.

558
00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:13,549
Really? Anybody specific?

559
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,019
All they know is it's under serious
discussion at top levels.

560
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:29,609
- Thanks.
- It's Christmas.

561
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,380
What? You want me to call a doctor?

562
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:52,431
Cramping in my legs? It could be anything.

563
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:53,971
Then what'd you call me for?

564
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,391
- Just to say hi.
- But you're all right?

565
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:59,061
Yeah. I'll see you later.

566
00:47:01,271 --> 00:47:04,771
Bring me a quattro formaggi.
I don't care what time it is. Wake me.

567
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:06,821
All right.

568
00:47:17,032 --> 00:47:20,832
We were talking about recovery
and your organised crime thing.

569
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:25,002
That I took an oath
that was a sacred oath.

570
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:29,672
- That's not an urban legend?
- No, you burn a saint.

571
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:33,473
You draw blood, but technically
I shouldn't even be tellin' you this.

572
00:47:36,973 --> 00:47:42,063
The programme... I could never really get
into the "Higher Power" part.

573
00:47:42,103 --> 00:47:44,273
Well, me neither. It's hard.

574
00:47:45,523 --> 00:47:48,733
I mostly think of the group
consciousness as a Higher Power.

575
00:47:48,774 --> 00:47:53,404
I said to myself that that oath
would be my Higher Power.

576
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:57,204
That would be my strength.
That code. That's a soldier's oath.

577
00:47:57,244 --> 00:47:59,834
- I could see that.
- But the problem is,

578
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:03,044
nobody lives it no more, not Tony, not nobody.

579
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:05,874
They let you down.

580
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:12,265
Whatever. Here I am.

581
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:15,185
- Using.
- Using.

582
00:48:21,145 --> 00:48:23,565
Are you breaking up with me?

583
00:48:26,815 --> 00:48:28,735
No.

584
00:48:39,496 --> 00:48:41,416
Should we go to a meeting?

585
00:48:43,336 --> 00:48:46,046
I don't know.

586
00:48:46,086 --> 00:48:48,216
What do you wanna do?

587
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:54,177
I know one that starts
in half an hour in Glen Ridge.

588
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:28,008
Take one car?

589
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:30,969
I'll follow you.

590
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,189
You should've called first.

591
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,580
How's John?

592
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,880
Some Christmas present...

593
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,300
I'll see you in the morn...

594
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:13,721
I'll see you in the morning.

595
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,101
God loves you.

596
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:37,162
Finally got you to come to Brooklyn,
cocksucker.

597
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,342
Listen to me.

598
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:01,603
Now I never told nobody this,

599
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:06,323
but while I was in that coma...

600
00:51:09,324 --> 00:51:11,204
somethin' happened to me.

601
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:14,874
I went someplace...

602
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:18,204
I think.

603
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:21,374
But I know I never wanna go back there.

604
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:26,344
And maybe you know what I'm talkin' about.

605
00:51:33,765 --> 00:51:39,265
Believe me, nobody ever laid on their deathbed
wishin' they saved more no-show jobs.

606
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:46,365
Now you take your time.

607
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:50,195
You get better.

608
00:51:50,236 --> 00:51:53,036
And you get out of this fuckin' place.

609
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:56,746
But when you do, you focus on grandkids.

610
00:51:56,786 --> 00:51:59,626
The good things.

611
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:02,876
We can have it all, Phil.

612
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:04,676
Plenty for everybody.

613
00:52:09,967 --> 00:52:12,347
Stop cryin' now.

614
00:52:21,227 --> 00:52:22,687
We should let him sleep.

615
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:29,277
We gotta stop meeting like this...

616
00:52:58,689 --> 00:53:01,479
George, hi. Carmela Soprano.

617
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:04,779
Listen, I wanna move ahead with
the roofing... ordering the slate?

618
00:53:06,739 --> 00:53:08,489
Carm, you got cocktail sauce?

619
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,200
In the fridge, top shelf.

620
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,830
Bob Cratchit! Pass out the punch!

621
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:18,870
...gift set...
- What I said is none of your business!

622
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,500
I'll make it my business!

623
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:26,130
Sophia, come help, hon.

624
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,630
Either lay off politics or get out!

625
00:53:30,801 --> 00:53:33,641
Jesus, that's a lot of presents.

626
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:37,311
- You sure you got enough?
- Remember, you're a kid, WABC?

627
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:41,151
They'd tell you where Santa was,
trackin' him on Air Force radar?

628
00:53:43,941 --> 00:53:47,321
Are you gonna hog all the ice?

629
00:53:51,282 --> 00:53:54,282
- To America.
- To America.

630
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:56,372
To America.

631
00:53:56,412 --> 00:53:58,832
Hello.

632
00:53:58,872 --> 00:54:02,212
Everybody, this is Blanca.
Blanca, my mom, my dad.

633
00:54:02,252 --> 00:54:05,592
- Hi.
- This is Hector. Say hello, baby.

634
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:09,222
Hi, Hector. Look at those eyes.

635
00:54:10,343 --> 00:54:13,143
He's not so shy at home.

636
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,603
Hey, that is quite a bagatelle.

637
00:54:17,183 --> 00:54:19,983
- It's from Anthony.
- Really?

638
00:54:24,273 --> 00:54:27,613
Hector, no! Those ain't your presents.

639
00:54:27,653 --> 00:54:30,363
- It's OK. I got him.
- Easy, little fella!

640
00:54:30,404 --> 00:54:32,574
Hey, come here, you. Come here.

641
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:35,284
Who's coming later?

642
00:54:35,334 --> 00:54:37,664
- Santa!
- Is Santa Claus coming?

643
00:54:37,704 --> 00:54:40,754
- Carmela, it's Meadow!
- Tell her I kept my promise.

644
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:43,384
I'm wearing your present from Paris.

645
00:54:43,424 --> 00:54:46,674
Excuse me, my daughter's
calling from California.

646
00:54:57,645 --> 00:55:01,695
She's ten years older than him
and she's Puerto Rican.

647
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:04,615
Dominican... maybe.

648
00:55:06,065 --> 00:55:08,445
Least she's Catholic.

649
00:55:09,536 --> 00:55:12,996
Why look at me like that?
You were overjoyed when I sent him there.

650
00:55:13,036 --> 00:55:18,126
Carmela, your daughter says
you're using up all her cellphone minutes.

651
00:55:19,246 --> 00:55:22,256
Nice piece, that necklace. Where'd you get it?

652
00:55:22,296 --> 00:55:25,336
- The mall.
- Should've told me.

653
00:55:25,386 --> 00:55:28,216
- I got a guy.
- And I got a job.

654
00:55:30,347 --> 00:55:33,137
My dear mademoiselle,
perhaps you have already observed

655
00:55:33,187 --> 00:55:35,977
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

656
00:55:36,017 --> 00:55:38,107
Good night, mademoiselle.

657
00:55:38,147 --> 00:55:41,107
OK, sweetie. I love you too.

658
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,367
Merry Christmas, baby.

659
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:48,737
Janice, bring some of that right here.

660
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,948
- We're all here, as always.
- I'll take that.

661
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:52,958
Bobby Jr, get in here and eat!

662
00:55:54,668 --> 00:55:57,248
You want some wine?

663
00:55:57,288 --> 00:55:58,878
Aunt Barb's comin' later.

664
00:55:58,918 --> 00:56:01,298
Uncle Tom had to work.

665
00:56:02,128 --> 00:56:06,718
All right, honey. I miss you too.

666
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:11,639
Merry Christmas.

667
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:14,349
Love to Finn...

668
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:29,369
- You have a gorgeous home.
- Thank you.

669
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,500
We do.
