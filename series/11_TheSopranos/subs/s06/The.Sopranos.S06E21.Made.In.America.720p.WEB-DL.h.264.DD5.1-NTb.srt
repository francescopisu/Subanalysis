1
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,040
New York's classic rock
q104.3.

2
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,642
Good morning.
I'm Jim Kerr.

3
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,310
Coming up a little bit later
on the "q"...

4
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,963
Half an hour,
he says.

5
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,899
It's a fucking hour
and a half already.

6
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,902
He's busy.

7
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,070
Enjoy the music.

8
00:03:06,606 --> 00:03:08,507
I thought
you weren't coming.

9
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:10,509
You don't wanna know.

10
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:12,679
Actually, I do.

11
00:03:14,515 --> 00:03:16,449
We had intel

12
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:18,451
A salafist cell
was at Newark airport

13
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,020
Boarding somebody
onto a 767 to London.

14
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,456
You're right.
I don't wanna know.

15
00:03:23,524 --> 00:03:26,092
We get this all the time.
Our source was either wrong

16
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,094
Or it was done
to study our response.

17
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:30,096
Happens all the time?

18
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:32,466
What's up, my?

19
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,835
You know, my kid is
obsessed with this shit.

20
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,937
But we tell him he's making
a molehill out of it.

21
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:40,140
Is he right?

22
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:47,047
Hey.
Probably another hour.

23
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:49,817
Just leave it out,

24
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:51,820
All right?
I'll heat it up.

25
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:54,055
Well, then don't
leave it out.

26
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:57,993
What do you want me to say?

27
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:05,467
You got a rough enough job
with this terrorism shit.

28
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:09,104
I'll let you get home. The
reason I called is those two arabs

29
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,541
I turned you on to
- well, I happened to remember

30
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:13,276
My nephew
mentioned a bank

31
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:15,478
Where they had an account-

32
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:17,513
A branch...

33
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:23,853
The mintner first
merchants bank.

34
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:26,289
- you just remembered that?
- yeah.

35
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,823
Thanks.

36
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:31,027
Oh, whoa-
listen,

37
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:34,198
I know you got that friend
in the Brooklyn office.

38
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:36,667
Is it possible he knows
where Phil leotardo is?

39
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:39,570
I want to try to avoid any
more of my guys getting hurt.

40
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:42,206
I'm just saying,

41
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,575
If you heard anything
from your pal-

42
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,905
Ã„r du fÃ¶rsiktig?

43
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:36,554
- Det hÃ¤r oroar mig.
- Ring nÃ¤r du kommer hem.

44
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:51,816
You're overreaching.

45
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,338
Okay.

46
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,769
- See you Thursday.
- Bye.

47
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:44,671
Where are you going?
I just got here.

48
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:47,407
I'm really late meeting
patrick in the city. Bye.

49
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,342
Bye-bye.

50
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,451
How are you doing?

51
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,122
She smelled
that odor too.

52
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,760
Your remodel
will fix all that.

53
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:08,529
Maybe it's toxic. Maybe we
shouldn't be breathing it.

54
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:10,531
It's not toxic.
The owners were, what,

55
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:13,135
90 years old?
It's piss.

56
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:17,139
I got to get home.

57
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:20,375
I'm working on it.

58
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,947
I went to see Sil...

59
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,983
And Gab.
Oh my god, Tony.

60
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:30,652
Yeah.

61
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,924
Are you being careful?

62
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,063
This kind of
bothers me.

63
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:41,564
Call me when you
get home, okay?

64
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:43,566
Okay.
Thanks.

65
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,336
Who is she
gonna tell?

66
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,672
But you should used
the back door.

67
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:56,614
I wouldn't kick her out
of bed for purging cookies.

68
00:06:56,781 --> 00:07:00,284
Real funny.
We're just friends.

69
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,686
I know.
Nice work.

70
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:05,089
- She's a model.
- She's doing some modeling.

71
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,191
All right? She's a
junior in high school.

72
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,525
What?

73
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:10,594
She's quitting modeling
anyway.

74
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,430
She's tired of being exploited.

75
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,599
Did you help your mother
take the carpets outside,

76
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,202
- put 'em in the sun?
- he did.

77
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,639
Uncle Bobby's funeral
is finally set

78
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,441
For Thursday.
And you're gonna be there.

79
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,176
How's that
supposed to work?

80
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,580
We're all on def-con 4,
living in separate houses

81
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,882
And we're gonna stand out in the open
at the cemetery?

82
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,219
There is always
a large FBI presence.

83
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,989
Unbelievable.

84
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,428
He was different, you know?
We forget.

85
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,397
When he was
with blanca.

86
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,066
We commend to almighty god
our brother robert

87
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,235
And we commit his body
to its resting place...

88
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:51,605
The ceremony
just ended.

89
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,342
...The lord
bless him and keep him.

90
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:57,244
The lord make his face
shine upon him...

91
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:01,615
Every one of these things
is lemon chicken or fish.

92
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,084
- look at that.
- can I have some sauce?

93
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:10,090
- I heard cauliflower's $3.99 a pound.
- I'm not gonna have this.

94
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,260
Can you believe that?

95
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,534
Oh, pop, they got
roast pork.

96
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:22,870
Give me one.
Thanks.

97
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:30,879
- She had won "American idol. "
- No.

98
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:32,248
Jennifer Hudson? Absolutely.

99
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:34,550
Jason G. Was the winner
of italian "American idol. "

100
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:36,619
He could say "fuck"
more times in a sentence

101
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,954
Than any other contestant.

102
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:40,956
Uncle Paulie,
come sit down.

103
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:43,359
Yeah, I'll sit with you.
I'm young at heart, right?

104
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:48,631
Who are you, dear?

105
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:50,966
Tara Zincone.
Bobby's niece.

106
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:55,171
My condolences.

107
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:00,310
Oh...

108
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:01,978
- did I eat.
- it was good.

109
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:04,314
In the midst of death,
we are in life.

110
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:06,216
Or is it the other way around?

111
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,684
I think it's
the other way around.

112
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:10,687
Either version, you're
halfway up the ass.

113
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:13,291
Pardon my french,
sweetheart.

114
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:15,860
- I've lost two dear friends.
- Sil's hanging on.

115
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:18,129
I lost ma
last month.

116
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:20,498
You can take 2007 and give
it back to the indians.

117
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:23,100
- I'm sorry.
- what are you gonna do?

118
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:26,571
Life goes on.

119
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:31,510
We were discussing
"dreamgirls. " did you see it?

120
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:34,513
You people are fucked.
You're living in a dream.

121
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:37,416
You still sit here talking
about the fucking Oscars?

122
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:40,519
"what rough beast slouches
toward bethlehem to be born?"

123
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,921
- huh?
- "yeets. "

124
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:46,191
- A.J.
- yeats?

125
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,794
The world-
don't you see it?

126
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:53,032
Bush let
Al Qaeda escape...

127
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,634
- ho!
- ... In the mountains.

128
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,369
Then he has us invade
some other country.

129
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,305
Let's join up, go kill
some fucking terrorists.

130
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,975
It's more noble than watching
these jack-off fantasies on tv

131
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:04,510
Of how we're
kicking their ass.

132
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,184
It's like, America-

133
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:13,954
- What about it?
- This is still where people come

134
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,857
To make it.
It's a beautiful idea.

135
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:19,226
And then what
do they get? Bling?

136
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,662
And come-ons for shit they
don't need and can't afford?

137
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:24,431
You're all over the place. I don't
know what you're trying to say.

138
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:27,067
He's saying the framus
intersects with ramistan

139
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,069
Approximately
at the paternoster.

140
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,874
Julius, what do I
have to do?

141
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,277
What do I have to say
to get you out of here?

142
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:39,080
Give me a chance.
Give me first dibs at this-

143
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:41,850
This television series
thing, or whatever it is.

144
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,852
Let me do the
pilot, please.

145
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:47,622
Julius, my boy,
sit down.

146
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:49,624
Julius, I'm not a hard man.
I'm not a mean man...

147
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,494
Tell you right now,
it's light.

148
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:54,297
...But the television industry
today is looking for talent.

149
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,132
They're looking
for quality.

150
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,668
They're preoccupied
with talent and quality,

151
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:00,703
And a writer is
a major commodity.

152
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,738
You know, this situation
ain't all bad.

153
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,207
I haven't had a green
vegetable in over a week.

154
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:07,209
We can't even go down
to the pork store?

155
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:10,446
- we gotta hang around here all day doing nothing.
- baciagalup.

156
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:16,220
- Who does he belong to?
- He just showed up during the big storm.

157
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,288
Already caught a mouse
down the cellar.

158
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,024
A lot of my customers giving
their action to New York.

159
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,628
Power vacuum,
they're taking advantage.

160
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:29,032
Oh.

161
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:32,637
- the fuck you come in that way for?
- sorry.

162
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:38,476
We're gonna meet Paulie
down at the hospital,

163
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:41,346
Visit Sil.
You wanna come?

164
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:44,682
Nah, I got...

165
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:47,819
Shit I gotta do.
My daughter...

166
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:50,588
...Scratching plaintively on a closed door.

167
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,592
Mr. Julius moomer,
a would-be writer...

168
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,895
Yesterday it was
his gout.

169
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:00,366
This is New York's famous little Italy.

170
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:02,368
It once covered over
40 square blocks

171
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:06,538
But has now been reduced to
one row of shops and cafes.

172
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:12,545
Hello.

173
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,581
It's me.

174
00:12:14,682 --> 00:12:16,616
Where are you?
Are you close?

175
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:19,019
Let's do it over the phone.

176
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,956
No word yet.

177
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:25,025
No one knows
where our friend is.

178
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,894
It's not that there's no word,
it's that there's no progress.

179
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:30,030
Nobody's taking
this lightly, Phil.

180
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:31,766
He should have been
done first.

181
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:34,068
They thought they'd find
them both at the strip joint.

182
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:35,469
I've heard this
already.

183
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:37,905
I know you're
disappointed, Phil.

184
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,774
I can hear it
in everything you say.

185
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,542
Fuckin'- a
I'm disappointed.

186
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,744
I'm thinking.

187
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:46,080
- Come on in, check it out.
- I don't know.

188
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:48,115
- maybe...
- what?

189
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:49,917
Are you talking
about reaching out?

190
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:52,588
We can't go back. Are you
out of your fucking mi?

191
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,324
- no, I know.
- then what did you say it for?

192
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,226
I didn't, Phil.
You did.

193
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,261
Listen, kid,

194
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,663
When this is over
we're gonna sit down,

195
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,999
- me and you.
- I hope so.

196
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,002
I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

197
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,937
I said I hope-

198
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,710
"ferrara's. "

199
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:49,713
- want a pastry?
- I need to watch my weight.

200
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:52,350
I need to snag
another husband.

201
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:58,323
You're the only one
who realized that's a joke.

202
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,025
You had to grow up
in our family.

203
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,827
That dig you made about me giving
guys head under the boardwalk?

204
00:14:02,962 --> 00:14:05,063
He took it so seriously,
Bobby.

205
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:17,677
Anyway,

206
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:19,879
Thank you
for being here.

207
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:24,850
So what happens now?

208
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:29,422
Well, robert's already said he
wants to go live with his aunt.

209
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:32,526
- what about sophia?
- nica is my daughter.

210
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:35,562
She's very much
into her older sister.

211
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,565
Sophia's out of her mind if she
thinks she's getting out of this house.

212
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,369
Is that a joke? 'cause
that one even got by me.

213
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:55,016
You know,
five, six years ago

214
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:57,986
When johnny sack bought this house,

215
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:00,321
This was all
cornfields here.

216
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:04,692
I'd like to give it
a shot with Bobby's kids.

217
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:07,528
Bobby would want it.

218
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:10,865
I put in a lot of effort
with sophia-

219
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:13,969
Baking together... I think
we actually have a bond.

220
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:19,308
I've had therapy.
I'm a good mother.

221
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,477
I put ma and all her
warped shit behind me.

222
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:23,212
Good.

223
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,114
Not that I get
any thanks for it.

224
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,386
You know you could form
a new nuclear family.

225
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:34,658
You bring
harpo down here...

226
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:36,726
It's a big place.

227
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:39,229
Harpo changed
his name.

228
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:41,298
He's hal now.

229
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,502
Janice...

230
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,508
Well, you need anything,
you know I'm minutes away.

231
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,422
- Yeah.
- Multiple calls

232
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:07,158
Traced back to a payphone
in oyster bay, long island.

233
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,827
What?
Oh. Oh, uh...

234
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:13,999
- where's the phone at exactly?
- gas station, most likely.

235
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,434
- gas station?
- he's lammed out.

236
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,803
He may not be able to put his
hands on a clean cell phone.

237
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,805
All right, listen, thanks. Really-

238
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,039
All right.

239
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:08,522
You kept telling me
this guy is good.

240
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,793
It's amazing it was written so long ago.

241
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:14,229
It's, like,
about right now.

242
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,412
This could be
a mistake.

243
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:32,415
I know.

244
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:34,350
We're good friends.

245
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,519
Yeah.

246
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,612
Oh, wait.

247
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,607
Holy shit.

248
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,777
Oh my god.

249
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,779
Go!

250
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,425
Oh, christ.
I parked in leaves!

251
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:01,174
Wow.

252
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:03,443
At least my gas tank
was practically empty.

253
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:17,758
How many fucking times
have I told you:

254
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:20,328
It's an S.U.V., watch
where you park off-road?

255
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:23,531
The catalytic converter
and the dry vegetation!

256
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:26,334
I didn't see
the leaves.

257
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:28,469
You can grill fucking
steaks on that converter!

258
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:30,004
I told you!

259
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,708
If there was children
playing in those leaves,

260
00:19:32,842 --> 00:19:35,544
- you'd have run them over?
- I guess.

261
00:19:35,645 --> 00:19:37,613
Oh, you're gonna
get cute now?

262
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:40,616
- I was just answering her question.
- dad, he wasn't being funny.

263
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:43,852
You mind your own goddamn business
unless you want some of this too.

264
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:48,824
- Mr. Fat mouth.
- What did you say?

265
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:57,734
What was going through your mind?

266
00:19:57,835 --> 00:20:00,703
What do you want from me?
I am depressed.

267
00:20:00,838 --> 00:20:03,106
I'm supposed to go around
looking for piles of leaves?

268
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,909
Wanna hear depressed?
$30,000 for that car.

269
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,378
Isn't that what
you have insurance for?

270
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,713
Excuse me? You're not
getting another one.

271
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:15,619
Actually, that's good.

272
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,621
It'll force me
to take the bus.

273
00:20:17,722 --> 00:20:19,089
What?

274
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:21,258
We have to break our
dependence on foreign oil.

275
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:33,238
- Cafe Napoli.
- George, it's Anthony.

276
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:35,340
Your fucking ears must be ringing.

277
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,742
I just left your friend,
the son, crying the blues

278
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,478
Over the situation between
you and that outfit over there.

279
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,447
That's why I'm calling.

280
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,749
I need you to reach out
to the little guy.

281
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:47,586
He's not happy with Phil neither.

282
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,987
I know.

283
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,990
You're not part
of that family.

284
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:53,993
You're basically retired.
Everybody trusts you.

285
00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:56,963
What I'm thinking, you'd supply
a neutral location,

286
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:59,832
Guarantee
everybody's safety.

287
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:01,801
I could do that.

288
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,199
- Hi, George.
- Hey.

289
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,301
They're here.
They've been patted down too.

290
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:53,656
Anybody want a water?

291
00:21:57,027 --> 00:21:59,295
- no.
- no.

292
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:03,732
We started it?
We got a dead goomar

293
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,635
In queens and her
old ukrainian father.

294
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:08,203
And I'm not even
gonna blame Phil.

295
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:10,973
John sacramoni,
my friend,

296
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:12,943
I'm sorry to say,
was an insecure guy.

297
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,512
He created
a constant tension

298
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:17,380
Within his own family
which spilled over.

299
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:21,685
Go ahead, Carmine.
George was good enough

300
00:22:21,752 --> 00:22:24,654
To broker this meeting for us.
You're just gonna sit there?

301
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:27,991
It didn't have
to be this way.

302
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:33,664
We agree.
It's gone too far.

303
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:36,968
Phil, I don't know-
he's changed.

304
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:40,338
You got my word:
we'll back off.

305
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:43,574
My price is you help us
get a location on Phil.

306
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:50,514
Uh, I can't go there.

307
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:52,751
But you do
what you gotta do.

308
00:22:58,858 --> 00:23:01,393
One more thing:
you hit my brother-in-law.

309
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,695
- so?
- this is my sister

310
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:05,697
We're talking about.

311
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:07,899
She's gotta see
something out of this.

312
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:12,939
We'll come up
with a number.

313
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:51,045
Look at all this mail.

314
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:55,951
Anybody need
some barber's scissors?

315
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,588
- ton'?
- put some next to my coat.

316
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:05,660
He was at the safe house.
We brought him over.

317
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:07,462
Get him the fuck out.

318
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,097
These are snakes
with fur.

319
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,766
The old italians
will tell you-

320
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,501
You can't even
put them around a baby.

321
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:14,270
They suck the breath
right out.

322
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:17,006
Well, you're the only baby
here, so we're ahead of the game.

323
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,275
You wanna be wearing his
fucking pelt on your head?

324
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:21,611
- I said get rid of him.
- Leave him.

325
00:24:21,678 --> 00:24:23,679
He's a good guy.

326
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:47,237
No payphone.

327
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:02,820
...Daughter gloria on the tv series...

328
00:25:02,855 --> 00:25:05,356
Look, there's
a double-breasted robin.

329
00:25:05,424 --> 00:25:07,692
It doesn't cost anything to be polite.

330
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:09,928
That goes two ways, ma'am.

331
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,563
...Series "maude"?

332
00:25:11,665 --> 00:25:13,132
- Arthur?
- Yes, Bea Arthur.

333
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,733
Beatrice Arthur.

334
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,069
Put an x in the center
box. $300 to the pot.

335
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:20,205
And we shuffle the
categories around again.

336
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,108
Pat, how are you?

337
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:28,013
- hi.
- livia.

338
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:31,016
I'm Janice,
her daughter.

339
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,055
What did he say?
I can't-

340
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:39,459
Uncle jun',

341
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:42,462
I wanna show you
something.

342
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:44,931
Bobby and my baby.

343
00:25:48,636 --> 00:25:52,205
- Janice.
- no, I'm Janice.

344
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:54,308
That's my little girl.
Her name is domenica.

345
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:58,813
Sweet as she looks, she
left my stove on on purpose,

346
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,782
Put the flame out
with a wet dishrag.

347
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,951
I caught her.

348
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:14,296
Uncle jun',

349
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:16,331
I'm afraid
I have bad news.

350
00:26:19,402 --> 00:26:21,336
Bobby's dead.

351
00:26:21,437 --> 00:26:23,405
The ambassador hotel.

352
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:27,776
Your Bobby,
Bobby baccalieri.

353
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:30,812
I'm a widow now.

354
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:39,689
She was inveigling him.

355
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:41,624
She's after his money.

356
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:46,596
You're not even
curious about him?

357
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:52,169
He can fucking rot.

358
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:56,774
When you were
an inpatient,

359
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,143
You said you might try
and get a job.

360
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:02,746
I can't now
because of the car.

361
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:05,149
I need to get
a bus schedule.

362
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:08,819
The thing is,

363
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:11,288
Ever since it blew up

364
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:13,758
I feel, like...

365
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,461
Cleansed or something.

366
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:18,229
Because...

367
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:20,131
It was a polluter?

368
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,368
No.

369
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:26,004
I mean,
just watching it go,

370
00:27:26,138 --> 00:27:29,007
That huge fireball-

371
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:32,511
You have no idea.
The heat-

372
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:34,447
My seat melted.

373
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:37,350
I had been in it
just a few seconds before.

374
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:45,524
Carlo.

375
00:27:51,532 --> 00:27:54,201
Carlo.

376
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:05,012
Yeah.

377
00:28:05,113 --> 00:28:07,781
T, I had a meeting down
here with Carlo this morning.

378
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,851
We were supposed to go see butch
and them on a couple of items.

379
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,353
Carlo didn't show.

380
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:15,790
And he don't answer
his phones neither.

381
00:28:15,858 --> 00:28:17,525
I'll call you back
on the prepay.

382
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,837
Yeah.

383
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:32,508
- what are you thinking?
- that maybe we were had.

384
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:35,611
That this fucking butch has
taken out another ranking guy.

385
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:43,152
T?

386
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:46,989
What if he flipped?

387
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:49,925
- who? Carlo?
- well?

388
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:54,698
- you there?
- his kid, the imbecile-

389
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,933
- Jason?
- he got picked up yesterday,

390
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,436
Patsy told me,
for selling ecstasy.

391
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,777
Mead', they're gonna
be here in-

392
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:11,615
Miss Hunter!
Long time no see.

393
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,284
How are you,
mrs. Soprano?

394
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,286
Oh my god,
when was it?

395
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,288
It was right around
when you quit college.

396
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:20,524
You're being kind. I was kicked
out for partying and drunk driving.

397
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,994
Well, I didn't want
to say, but...

398
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,795
Well, that was
always you.

399
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,797
So what are you
up to now?

400
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,799
I'm in my second year
of med school.

401
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,935
- oh.
- yeah.

402
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:32,871
I completed undergrad
at purchase,

403
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:34,873
Got my act together.

404
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:37,609
Yes. They're gonna
be here, Meadow.

405
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:41,480
A man took his horse
to a vet

406
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:45,117
And the vet says to him,
"why do you have a long face?"

407
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:47,119
"a horse goes. "
there's no man.

408
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:50,055
Right right.
A horse goes to a vet.

409
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:52,292
And the vet looks at his
face and he says to him,

410
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,494
- "my friend-" - a
horse goes to the doctor.

411
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:57,297
The doctor says,
"why the long face?"

412
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:01,534
Can't tell jokes.

413
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,903
- more pinot grig', Patrick?
- no, thanks.

414
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:07,206
Speaking of jokers, where's
that other son of yours today?

415
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,743
I didn't think
he was invited.

416
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:13,280
I just thought with all the
wedding talk, you know...

417
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:16,550
No no, really, that pal
of his, the other Jason-

418
00:30:16,685 --> 00:30:19,687
I heard he ran
into some trouble,

419
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:22,089
- Carlo's Jason.
- he's a mess.

420
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,091
All right.

421
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:26,160
Well, he's got
no shortage of lawyers here.

422
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,935
Ton', patsy needs
a refill.

423
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:36,204
- no, ton', I'll-
- sit down.

424
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:46,114
Of course, this one here would
only take the case for free.

425
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:48,950
That's why we want her over
at Grubman, Grubman & Curcio.

426
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:50,852
Actually, Mead' and I
have had some conversations

427
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:53,356
And we may still snag her
over at the firm

428
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:55,691
- when she's done with law school.
- no kidding?

429
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,761
We went out to dinner with steven
grubman and the subject came up.

430
00:30:58,895 --> 00:31:02,064
Steven was very impressed with
her work at the poverty law center.

431
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:05,034
He even got into starting
salaries. He was talking $170.

432
00:31:05,102 --> 00:31:08,738
Jesus. Sweetheart,
that's fantastic, huh?

433
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,706
He had had
too much gevrey.

434
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,643
Don't devalue yourself.

435
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:14,578
We've got a really
interesting case right now.

436
00:31:14,612 --> 00:31:16,747
We're defending
James Trefoglio,

437
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:19,650
The county commissioner,
on those corruption charges.

438
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,318
Is that your case,
honey?

439
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,954
Bid rigging.
It's got bagmen, whores.

440
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:27,724
It's fascinating.

441
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:45,743
Yeah, he does that,

442
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:48,579
Sometimes most of the day
- just stares at chrissy's picture.

443
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:50,581
The fuck?

444
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,484
You know,
they're funny that way.

445
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:55,721
I had an aunt,
her cat would only sit

446
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:58,090
At the exact corners of
the table, staring at her,

447
00:31:58,258 --> 00:32:00,426
Or at the intersection
of two walls, staring in.

448
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:03,595
This fucking animal
is history, today!

449
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:05,531
- pick him up.
- you pick him up.

450
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:15,375
T, you see
this shit?

451
00:32:16,877 --> 00:32:18,611
Does it all the time,
he says.

452
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:21,448
- oh yeah?
- look at him staring at that dead kid.

453
00:32:21,515 --> 00:32:24,451
Gives me
the fucking creeps.

454
00:32:27,021 --> 00:32:29,456
Walden, give us
some privacy.

455
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,626
Yeah.

456
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,797
Walden
- the fuck kind of name is that for an italian?

457
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:39,300
I was named
after mr. Bobby Darin-

458
00:32:39,401 --> 00:32:42,470
Walden Robert Cassotto.

459
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:44,805
Heh.

460
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:50,478
The Cifaretto crew
- it's a fucking chinese fire drill over there,

461
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:52,514
Especially now that
Carlo is absent.

462
00:32:52,582 --> 00:32:55,050
I know.

463
00:32:55,151 --> 00:32:57,586
I want you
to skipper that thing.

464
00:32:57,654 --> 00:33:01,223
- really?
- fucking thing is one big ATM machine.

465
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:04,660
All our construction with New
York folds right into your kick.

466
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:07,062
Yeah.

467
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:09,064
Jesus christ,
I thought you'd be pleased.

468
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:11,434
I didn't hand you
the diagnosis of the clap.

469
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:14,437
With due respect, I'd like
to just mull it a little.

470
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,174
I'm no spring chicken
no more.

471
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:21,010
I don't want to have me dying on you,
leaving you worse off than before.

472
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:22,779
Oh, you with
the dead thing.

473
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:25,081
You got the arms and upper
body of a 20-year-old.

474
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:27,116
I gotta work at that.

475
00:33:27,184 --> 00:33:30,119
And I had the prostate.

476
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:33,023
All right, sure.

477
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:35,025
Go ahead.

478
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:37,861
I'm a little miffled,
but yeah, sit with it.

479
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:40,264
Thanks, T.
This means everything,

480
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:42,933
Your faith in me.

481
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:02,253
In the line of duty.

482
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:04,089
But we're short-handed.

483
00:34:04,123 --> 00:34:06,758
Anyway, mid-60s,

484
00:34:06,826 --> 00:34:08,994
Probably used
the payphones.

485
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:12,298
We don't have payphones. Just a
couple of stations have them anymore.

486
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:29,248
Get in.

487
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,262
Activity-
that's good.

488
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,364
I can already
see a difference.

489
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:46,199
Yeah.

490
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,935
Gonna get
back at it myself.

491
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:55,710
Listen...

492
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,180
I'm gonna join the army.

493
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:02,784
What?

494
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:06,554
Did you sign any shit?

495
00:35:06,622 --> 00:35:10,124
No, but this week
I will.

496
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:11,961
I gotta deal
with rhiannon first.

497
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:14,396
Rhiannon?
What about your mother?

498
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:17,499
- her too.
- are you nuts?

499
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,268
You wanna get sent
to Iraq?

500
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,303
Afghanistan.

501
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,072
The army's probably
good for my career.

502
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:25,074
You don't have
a career.

503
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:26,809
Right.
My ultimate goal is

504
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,911
to qualify for
helicopter pilot training,

505
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:30,813
Afterwards go to work
for trump or somebody,

506
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:32,482
Be their personal pilot.

507
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:37,087
I'm not even gonna tell
your mother about this.

508
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:39,122
And don't you
do nothing

509
00:35:39,156 --> 00:35:41,157
Until we've had
another chance to talk.

510
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:44,327
- you hear me?
- yes.

511
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:47,263
He's gonna join
the fucking army.

512
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:57,675
I gotta be frank,

513
00:35:57,743 --> 00:36:01,178
You people got him out
of his room- great-

514
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:03,681
So he can be
cannon fodder?

515
00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:05,483
I wasn't aware
of this latest plan.

516
00:36:07,285 --> 00:36:09,086
Sorry.

517
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:11,189
I should have gone
before we left the house.

518
00:36:12,725 --> 00:36:14,726
Still on the army thing.

519
00:36:17,463 --> 00:36:20,032
On the other hand, I'm
thinking maybe he could benefit

520
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,467
From the training,
the discipline.

521
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:24,269
Maybe the army'd be
great for him

522
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:26,905
If there wasn't
a war going on.

523
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:32,578
Oh, I didn't tell you,
he spent $200

524
00:36:32,646 --> 00:36:35,315
On a set of cds
that teach arabic.

525
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:39,052
Jesus Christ, come on. "shish kebab"
- what else do you need to know?

526
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,287
He used to just veg
in front of that tv.

527
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:46,092
He says he wants
to get past the hate,

528
00:36:46,226 --> 00:36:49,062
Focus it only
on the terrorists.

529
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,998
I really can't
reveal much more.

530
00:36:51,132 --> 00:36:53,467
Right.
Even though we're paying.

531
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,240
This whole therapy thing,
I gotta tell you-

532
00:37:00,308 --> 00:37:01,675
What?

533
00:37:03,778 --> 00:37:05,646
My mother was
a borderline personality.

534
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,015
So what?

535
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:12,487
- I don't know if you knew that.
- no.

536
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:16,424
Well, I did not have
a very happy childhood.

537
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:17,826
No?

538
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:20,762
There was little love
in the house.

539
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,831
He's mentioned your mother
very briefly.

540
00:37:22,965 --> 00:37:25,467
A very difficult woman,

541
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:27,435
Undermining.

542
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:29,270
I tried to place her
in a retirement community

543
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:31,040
For her own good-

544
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:33,209
She turned on me
completely.

545
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:39,982
You see, I never could
please my ther.

546
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:48,557
To what do I owe this
chance to go sake bombing?

547
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,227
We used to have dinner
all the time.

548
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:55,032
You're gonna get married and
my chances are flying by me.

549
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,567
- yeah.
- so, your brother,

550
00:37:57,669 --> 00:37:58,669
Our little soldier boy-

551
00:37:58,803 --> 00:38:01,171
What do you think is wrong
with that googootz?

552
00:38:01,205 --> 00:38:04,041
The world is
a sad, fucked-up place.

553
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:06,576
If there's so much
suffering in the world,

554
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:09,913
- why did you go off the pediatrician bit?
- we talked about that.

555
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:12,050
You said you wanted to be
a lawyer for black people.

556
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:14,352
Oh, that's all I said?
Really?

557
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:17,522
What I said was: the state
can crush the individual.

558
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,757
- New Jersey?
- the government.

559
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:22,593
Specifically,
the federal government.

560
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:24,329
And what about
little babies

561
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:27,532
In the face
of meningitis?

562
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:29,534
You know what really
turned me?

563
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:31,937
Seeing the way
italians are treated.

564
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:35,441
It's like mom says. And if we can
have our rights trampled like that,

565
00:38:35,575 --> 00:38:37,810
Imagine what it's like
for recent arrivals.

566
00:38:37,944 --> 00:38:39,945
- well...
- if I hadn't seen you

567
00:38:40,046 --> 00:38:42,514
Dragged away all those times by the fbi

568
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:46,518
Then I'd probably be
a boring suburban doctor.

569
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:03,436
Bye-bye.

570
00:39:03,504 --> 00:39:05,905
Wave "bye-bye, grandpa. "

571
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,241
- bye-bye, pop-pop.
- say "bye-bye. "

572
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:11,244
- bye-bye.
- bye-bye.

573
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:15,583
I gotta make
a phone call.

574
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:17,818
I'll meet you
at the drugstore.

575
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:20,888
Tell the goddamn pharmacist
to call dr. laconis.

576
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:23,958
I should get a 60-day
supply of the plavix.

577
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:28,596
Phil! Phil!

578
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,498
Oh my god!

579
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:33,502
Phil!

580
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:37,506
Oh my god!
Help!

581
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:39,274
Help me!

582
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:42,277
Oh my god!
Oh my god!

583
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:45,881
My babies!
Somebody help!

584
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:48,250
Help me!
The babies!

585
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:50,152
- somebody help me!
- okay, okay.

586
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,088
Help me, please!

587
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:55,258
Oh, god, they're
locked in there!

588
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,696
- oh!
- oh shit!

589
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:13,344
- seen metro news?
- no.

590
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:15,612
Your old beat.
Phil Leotardo got popped.

591
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,116
Damn. We're gonna win this thing.

592
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,067
Okay...

593
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:39,704
As your parents
we don't feel

594
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,840
Joining the army
is in your best interest.

595
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,809
This country is
in a crisis.

596
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:46,711
How can one soldier
stop it?

597
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:50,482
When my enlistment's up,

598
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,652
I could join
the CIA or something.

599
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:55,488
And with a military
background I'll have a leg up.

600
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:57,890
And as an arabic speaker,
I'll be really useful.

601
00:40:58,025 --> 00:41:00,092
I don't understand.
You're gonna ask the donald

602
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,295
For some time off from your
pilot job to go on CIA missions?

603
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:05,965
- everything's a joke to you.
- I'm not having a good time.

604
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:09,068
Did you or did you not want
me to go to military school?

605
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,339
But I started to cry.

606
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,342
At least you'd have
come out an officer.

607
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:17,444
Even then
I was opposed to it.

608
00:41:17,545 --> 00:41:19,112
I hate this idea.

609
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:21,448
I'm applying for
officer's candidate school.

610
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,450
I want to be
a liaison officer

611
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:26,086
With the local
population anyway.

612
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:30,791
Officer's candidate school?

613
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:34,395
You have terrible grades.
You flunked out of college.

614
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,531
Here we go. That's all
this is about, right?

615
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:38,666
No, Anthony, that's not
what this is all about.

616
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,735
You don't want to go to college
- don't go to college,

617
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:43,538
- but don't get your legs blown off.
- always with the drama.

618
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:47,375
So what does your girlfriend
say, the fashion model?

619
00:41:48,644 --> 00:41:50,578
She doesn't think
I should go either.

620
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:52,648
Well?

621
00:41:54,317 --> 00:41:56,752
Not that long ago you
talked about owning a club.

622
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,821
Right. You had a problem with that too.

623
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:02,224
A lot of your friends are
in film school, you say,

624
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:05,227
Especially the ones you
used to go to the clubs with.

625
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:11,668
Uh...

626
00:42:11,736 --> 00:42:14,637
So I got this screenplay
from danny baldwin.

627
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:16,906
We met at your
cousin's movie.

628
00:42:17,008 --> 00:42:19,175
Danny hoped I'd set him
up with some financing,

629
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:22,412
- but I never read it.
- well, you did now.

630
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,081
Yeah, I did now and...

631
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:27,450
Well, long story short, it's
about a private detective

632
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:30,453
That gets sucked into the internet
through his, uh, data port.

633
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,190
And he's gotta solve

634
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,960
Some murders and some
virtual prostitutes.

635
00:42:36,028 --> 00:42:38,462
I read it.
It's scary.

636
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,431
Point is, I talked
to little Carmine

637
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,933
And he's interested in
developing it through his company.

638
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:45,169
He does porn.

639
00:42:48,106 --> 00:42:50,875
He did "cleaver. "
he's branching out.

640
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,278
You would work for his producer, Inge.

641
00:42:53,313 --> 00:42:55,113
You would be-
what is the word-

642
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:57,883
Development executive
on this project.

643
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,152
Really?

644
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:04,956
What's this gotta do
with clubs?

645
00:43:05,058 --> 00:43:07,726
Hollywood and gossip
columns, the nightspots...

646
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:10,962
And you get some real-world
experience under your belt,

647
00:43:10,998 --> 00:43:12,965
You come see me
and we will talk

648
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:14,701
About me investing
in a club.

649
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:17,303
Run that past rahoony,
see what she says.

650
00:43:26,747 --> 00:43:30,183
Somebody's giving grand
jury testimony on something.

651
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,389
- so Carlo has flipped.
- we don't know.

652
00:43:36,391 --> 00:43:38,759
And subpoenas are flying.

653
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,435
My hunch-

654
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,839
80 to 90% chance
you'll be indicted.

655
00:43:51,907 --> 00:43:53,575
That fucking
gun charge-

656
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:55,510
I get sick
when I think of it-

657
00:43:55,678 --> 00:43:59,447
Plus interstate fraud and if
Carlo starts talking, homicide-

658
00:43:59,482 --> 00:44:01,082
Give me
the fucking thing.

659
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:10,425
Not like we haven't
envisioned this day.

660
00:44:10,527 --> 00:44:12,061
No no, it's not.

661
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:14,964
Look, trials are there
to be won.

662
00:44:21,938 --> 00:44:24,140
...Easiest omelet ever.

663
00:44:24,274 --> 00:44:27,043
In 10 seconds you can
open a can of instant soup

664
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,812
Or you can make homemade
soup from scratch,

665
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:32,249
Ready to eat
and serve!

666
00:44:32,316 --> 00:44:34,251
In 10 seconds
you can begin

667
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,219
Grating cheese
for a snack

668
00:44:36,321 --> 00:44:38,221
Or you can grate cheese,
shred chicken,

669
00:44:38,323 --> 00:44:40,624
Chop onions and peppers
to make a zesty filling

670
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:42,392
That you can
heat and serve

671
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:45,629
For hot delicious quesadillas
the whole family will love-

672
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,131
All three
ready to heat and serve...

673
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:50,400
- oh.
- ... All in 10 seconds or less

674
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:52,070
With the original
magic bullet-

675
00:44:52,237 --> 00:44:54,305
The versatile personal
countertop magician

676
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:57,709
That does any job
in 10 seconds or less.

677
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,044
Now you can do
small everyday jobs

678
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,779
Like chopping
garlic or onions

679
00:45:01,847 --> 00:45:04,682
Without the sticky, smelly
mess in just three seconds.

680
00:45:04,817 --> 00:45:06,684
Grate cheese
in just four seconds.

681
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:08,686
Then screw on
the handy shaker top

682
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:10,855
And sprinkle
onto pasta or pizza.

683
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:13,826
Or turn ice, coffee,
milk and chocolate syrup

684
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,095
Into a fancy frozen
coffee drink in just se-

685
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,381
Oh my gosh,
I won, I won, I won, I won!

686
00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:02,476
So?

687
00:46:05,914 --> 00:46:10,151
With all due respect, and I mean
that from the bottom of my heart,

688
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:12,988
- I'm gonna pass.
- I don't fucking believe this.

689
00:46:14,657 --> 00:46:17,693
- why?
- every guy who ran that crew died prematurely.

690
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,995
- aw, come on.
- I beat cancer once.

691
00:46:20,096 --> 00:46:21,697
You've got no idea
what that does to you.

692
00:46:21,764 --> 00:46:23,098
Yeah, I know,
but jesus-

693
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:26,168
Richie aprile, ralphie m. I.A.; Vito,

694
00:46:26,235 --> 00:46:28,170
And who knows what the
fuck with Carlo, gigi-

695
00:46:28,237 --> 00:46:29,938
Gigi died
taking a shit.

696
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:33,409
Doesn't mean it's not
part of an overall pattern.

697
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,115
Paulie, are you gonna deny
yourself life-changing money,

698
00:46:39,183 --> 00:46:41,351
A package to leave your
niece who has m. S.?

699
00:46:41,518 --> 00:46:44,287
It's like your bullshit
with the cat.

700
00:46:44,355 --> 00:46:46,289
The fucking animal
catches mice for us,

701
00:46:46,357 --> 00:46:47,857
- but you'd drown it.
- I would.

702
00:46:47,925 --> 00:46:50,059
He's not looking
at christopher.

703
00:46:50,195 --> 00:46:52,696
A rat died in the wall
back there or some shit.

704
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:54,932
I moved the picture.
The fucking thing

705
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:57,067
Came to the new spot
and stared!

706
00:47:00,972 --> 00:47:02,840
It's the abstract shapes
or something.

707
00:47:09,315 --> 00:47:11,216
Tell you this:

708
00:47:11,317 --> 00:47:13,218
Since he's dead,

709
00:47:13,386 --> 00:47:16,388
My gambling luck's
done a 180.

710
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:18,056
Oh, okay.

711
00:47:18,124 --> 00:47:20,125
It's fine for you
to believe that shit,

712
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:22,794
But I can't
worry about a jinx?

713
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:33,105
Ton', I never told this to
another living soul, but...

714
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:37,243
Yeah?

715
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:40,513
One time at the bing,

716
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:43,516
I was alone to meet
eddy lind-

717
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,687
I saw the virgin mary.

718
00:47:53,494 --> 00:47:55,862
Why didn't you
say something?

719
00:47:55,963 --> 00:47:58,765
Fuck strippers,
we coulda had a shrine,

720
00:47:58,933 --> 00:48:01,134
Sold holy water
in gallon jugs.

721
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:03,136
Coulda made billions.

722
00:48:03,271 --> 00:48:06,039
I tell you something deep in
my heart and you laugh it off?

723
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,175
I'm not saying there's
nothing out there, Paulie,

724
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:11,378
But to not live your life?
What the fuck are you gonna do?

725
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:15,616
You don't want the job-
you don't want the job.

726
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,219
I can put patsy in there.

727
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,688
He's gonna be
part of my family now.

728
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:23,491
It'd be good.

729
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:25,226
Prick.

730
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:27,862
You always know what
to say to me, don't you?

731
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:30,732
No, I'm serious.

732
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:43,312
I live but to serve you,
my liege.

733
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:14,011
Well, they had to
get it for me.

734
00:49:14,112 --> 00:49:16,547
There's no real
public transport out here.

735
00:49:16,615 --> 00:49:19,050
But I said no more suv.

736
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:40,472
Well, that's
the cool part-

737
00:49:40,606 --> 00:49:43,275
23 highway.
It's not so bad.

738
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:05,832
Hey.

739
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:11,237
Hey.

740
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:13,474
Oh, listen, we're not
eating at home tonight.

741
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:15,042
I thought we'd go
to holsten's.

742
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,310
You said we have
manigott'.

743
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:18,479
I got meetings
with carpenters.

744
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,790
Holsten's is
the consensus.

745
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:04,160
I gotta see some people.
I'll meet you there.

746
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,832
- Carter?
- That's correct.

747
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:11,935
And you win $400.

748
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:14,338
Your spin, marcia.

749
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,775
- joker, africa and quotations.
- sir.

750
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:20,711
I'll take quotations for 100, please.

751
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,813
Sir, sir,
excuse me.

752
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,981
...Explained his humor this way:

753
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,517
"all I know is just
what I read-" where?

754
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:28,919
"in the papers. "

755
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:30,520
That's right. You have $200.

756
00:51:30,656 --> 00:51:34,025
- your spin, ron.
- okay, thank you, jack.

757
00:51:34,126 --> 00:51:37,895
Law enforcement,
quotations and a joker.

758
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,897
Let's take quotations for 100, Jack.

759
00:51:40,032 --> 00:51:41,966
The correct answer will bring you $500...

760
00:51:43,702 --> 00:51:47,238
- hello.
- what, you don't recognize me?

761
00:51:48,807 --> 00:51:50,975
We used to play catch.

762
00:51:52,712 --> 00:51:56,215
You don't remember
that you shot me?

763
00:52:00,887 --> 00:52:02,488
Enough with
the fucking birds.

764
00:52:02,655 --> 00:52:04,356
I'm Anthony,
johnny's son.

765
00:52:04,424 --> 00:52:06,658
Fuck you want,
a boutonniere?

766
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:15,635
All right, listen to me.
Uncle pat came to see me

767
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:18,872
About Janice,
about your money.

768
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,541
People keep asking me.
I don't know.

769
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:24,411
There's a man from another
galaxy that came here.

770
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:25,712
That's your accountant.

771
00:52:26,781 --> 00:52:27,947
I'm confused!

772
00:52:28,049 --> 00:52:31,084
Any money should go
to Bobby bacala's kids.

773
00:52:31,186 --> 00:52:35,022
Now Janice may not do that,
but Bobby was with us.

774
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,525
He's a made guy.
Wouldn't be right.

775
00:52:39,394 --> 00:52:41,629
Me, I never had kids.

776
00:52:43,198 --> 00:52:45,466
You remember where your stash
is, you let uncle pat know.

777
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:47,535
Me as the head
of the family,

778
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:50,371
I'll hold on to it as a
guardian, for Bobby's kids.

779
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:54,276
- you remember Bobby?
- sure.

780
00:52:59,615 --> 00:53:02,250
You don't know
who I am, do you?

781
00:53:11,061 --> 00:53:13,796
Remember johnny-
johnny boy,

782
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:16,399
Your kid brother?

783
00:53:26,643 --> 00:53:28,644
"this thing of ours. "

784
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,584
I was involved with that?

785
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,587
You and my dad.

786
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,522
You two ran north Jersey.

787
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,525
- we did?
- yeah.

788
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,527
Hmm.

789
00:53:43,628 --> 00:53:45,763
Well, that's nice.

790
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:27,302
- hey.
- hey.

791
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:46,656
- what looks good tonight?
- eh, I don't know.

792
00:55:51,563 --> 00:55:52,963
Where's googootz?

793
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:56,167
He just called.
He's on his way.

794
00:55:56,301 --> 00:55:59,937
Mead's coming separately.
She had to go to the doctor,

795
00:56:00,072 --> 00:56:02,473
Switch birth control.

796
00:56:12,485 --> 00:56:14,619
Did you talk
to mink again?

797
00:56:16,422 --> 00:56:18,790
It's Carlo.
He's gonna testify.

798
00:56:34,675 --> 00:56:36,609
Mmm, onion rings.

799
00:56:36,677 --> 00:56:39,112
Best in the state
as far as I'm concerned.

800
00:57:00,035 --> 00:57:01,969
Shit.

801
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,657
How was work today?

802
00:57:22,758 --> 00:57:25,493
All I'm doing is getting coffee
and placing endless phone calls.

803
00:57:25,594 --> 00:57:27,896
You may not realize it
but you are making contacts.

804
00:57:27,997 --> 00:57:29,898
It's an entry-level job.

805
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,635
So buck up.

806
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:34,637
Right, focus
on the good times.

807
00:57:34,771 --> 00:57:36,672
Don't be sarcastic.

808
00:57:36,773 --> 00:57:38,641
Isn't that what
you said one time-

809
00:57:38,775 --> 00:57:40,342
"try to remember the times
that were good"?

810
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,178
- I did?
- yeah.

811
00:57:45,182 --> 00:57:47,416
Well, it's true,
I guess.

812
00:58:24,957 --> 00:58:27,725
I went ahead and ordered
some for the table.
