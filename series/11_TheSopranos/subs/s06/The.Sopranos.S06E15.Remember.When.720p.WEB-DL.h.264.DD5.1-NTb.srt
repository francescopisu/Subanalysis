1
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,081
Ah, stupid thing.
The pressure is shot.

2
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,850
Can you live with regular
instead of espresso?

3
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,086
Never mind, sweetie.
Thanks anyway.

4
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,390
Hey hey.
Sorry for the ambush.

5
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,025
I brung up your paper.

6
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,128
I am meeting
the new realtor.

7
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:43,131
Yeah?
Good luck.

8
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,207
Got a call from sergeant
danny over in newark p.d.

9
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,476
- yeah? And?

10
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,649
T? The feds are doing some
digging over by branford avenue.

11
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:05,220
Willie overall...
The bookie,

12
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,821
labor day, 1982?

13
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:24,740
Danny says he hears it's larry
barese that's been talkin'.

14
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:30,646
Lotta work
for a dead fuckin' bookie.

15
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:34,151
Come on, kid. Do it.

16
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:40,657
You made your bones
with that prick, eh?

17
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,593
Yeah.

18
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:46,496
Old zepupin's house.

19
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:48,765
You were shaky a little,
but you did good.

20
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:50,700
I remember
tellin' your old man.

21
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,637
25 years, T.

22
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:55,305
Possible there's
nothing left.

23
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:58,375
There'll be bones,
teeth.

24
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:02,346
What are we gonna do?

25
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,917
We're gonna pack
our toothbrushes.

26
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:10,588
Call you in a few days
on the alternate cell.

27
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:14,492
Any emergencies,
call sil or bobby.

28
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,561
And if you need
more cash, call me.

29
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:18,763
I know the drill, tony.

30
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:24,203
You know, it's not like
I won a trip to paris.

31
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:44,123
You have everything?
Your razor?

32
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:47,292
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

33
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,330
I... I can buy
whatever I need.

34
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:53,133
- will you make sure you wear your sunblock?
- it's nothing.

35
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,835
A little gambling charge,
that's all. It's gonna be fine.

36
00:04:55,902 --> 00:04:58,204
It's just... You know,
better safe than sorry.

37
00:04:58,238 --> 00:05:01,274
I know, it's just... This
is what life is still like...

38
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,476
At our age?

39
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:07,080
My tomatoes
are just coming in.

40
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:14,388
It's good to see you.
- yeah.

41
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:16,791
You seem good, junior,
I gotta say.

42
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:26,167
You're not repeating
yourself so much.

43
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,869
You gotta get me
out of here...

44
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:31,038
The smell alone
in this fuckin' place.

45
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,077
What do you hear
from my nephew?

46
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:39,915
Tony? They sent me
a card for my birthday.

47
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:42,451
I'm still waitin'
for an apology. Tell him.

48
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:44,286
All right.

49
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,922
Which one of you's
gonna tell him?

50
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,057
We'll figure it out,
junior.

51
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,029
If you made
an appointment

52
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:56,298
with an outside dentist,

53
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:57,933
that might do
the trick.

54
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:00,135
What trick?

55
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,803
We'll meet you there

56
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:04,073
and sneak you off
in our car.

57
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,544
Dinner, 10 minutes.

58
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:10,546
So what do you think,
junior?

59
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:12,248
Enchiladas tonight.

60
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:20,189
Here's the electricians' union.

61
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:43,447
Don't let 'e
take my plate, kid.

62
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,815
Make sure there's enough
so everybody can buy in.

63
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,955
$60.

64
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:25,858
- for sodas and fuckin' candy?
- caffeinated sodas and sugar.

65
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:28,360
You know some of them
ain't allowed this shit.

66
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,830
Gets them all riled.
I could lose my job.

67
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:34,733
- fuckin' stick-up artist. I already gave you
my watch. - don't count my money, nigga.

68
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,736
You're makin' 500%
off these motherfuckers.

69
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:40,906
You're good
till lights out.

70
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:42,776
I'll steer people
away from the door.

71
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:56,656
All right.
No-limit five-card stud.

72
00:07:56,757 --> 00:07:58,592
$40 buy-in to the house.

73
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:01,428
The white buttons are five
bucks. The red buttons are 10.

74
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:03,597
"red buttons."

75
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,699
what'd you say?

76
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,506
Today, we got coca-colas...

77
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:13,074
Fuck was I just sayin'?

78
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,777
- the soda, junior.
- what soda?

79
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:19,547
Right, the coke.

80
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,582
The real kind,
not the diet shit,

81
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,451
ice cold,
five buttons.

82
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:28,156
Plus, we got snickers,
kit-kats and sprees, also five.

83
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:30,124
Ll take some sprees.

84
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,729
Okay, ante up.

85
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:44,740
This is nice, huh?

86
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,742
A lile road trip,
just you and me...

87
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,644
All things considered,
of course.

88
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:52,314
Yeah, just like
the old days.

89
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:55,717
Willie-fuckin'- overall,

90
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:58,320
after all these years.

91
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:01,825
You remember drivin' around with that
prick in the trunk lookin' for a spot?

92
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,497
What was it, like a week
before a.j. Was born, right?

93
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,466
No, meadow.

94
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:12,135
- now she's gonna be a dr.
- yeah.

95
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:14,838
Remember we took you

96
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:16,739
me, puss, ralphie.

97
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:34,358
Chevy chase... Fuck ever
happened to him?

98
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:42,700
Let me ask you something.

99
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,202
You mentioned ralph before.

100
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:47,638
A few years ago, he had
that beef with johnny sack,

101
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:49,474
he made a crack about ginny...

102
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,710
Huge fuckin' mole
on her ass or some shit.

103
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,145
Yeah?

104
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:55,814
Who the fuck would tell
johnny about that joke?

105
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,315
How should I know?

106
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,056
Nine of clubs.

107
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,262
You know, I try
to be cooperative,

108
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:12,597
but it's that same
message over and over!

109
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,134
Walter,
what do you got?

110
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:18,671
Flush.

111
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:20,773
No, you don't.
George?

112
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,842
- uh...
- what?

113
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:24,444
- george, what do you got?
- hmm?

114
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:30,149
- your hand.
- he's got alzheimer's!

115
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:33,252
- help him, for christ's sake!
- pair of jacks.

116
00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:39,225
Guy comes home with a
bouquet of flowers for his wife.

117
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,762
"I guess I'll have to spread
my legs now," she says.

118
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,364
"why?" he asks.
"don't you have a vase?"

119
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:53,507
high rollers only.
Keep walkin', professor.

120
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:55,776
I'm not here to gamble.
I'm here looking for keith.

121
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:57,544
Keith's busy. Take a hike.

122
00:10:57,611 --> 00:10:59,813
We had
a chess match, keith.

123
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,849
The pride of rutgers...

124
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,885
Slits his wrists
in the faculty lounge

125
00:11:03,952 --> 00:11:05,453
after he stabbed
the dean.

126
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:11,159
At least some of us
know when we need help.

127
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:13,995
Get the fuck out of here,
ya fuck...

128
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,035
What did the blind man say
when he passed the fish market?

129
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:24,105
I don't know.

130
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:26,074
"good morning, ladies."

131
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:30,112
what's going on, guys?

132
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,348
- they're gambling, warren.
- relax, brian.

133
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:35,117
What did we
say about this?

134
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:36,685
What?
It's a friendly game.

135
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:39,155
Corrado, it's too stressful. Lookt him!

136
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:41,290
He's not even playin'.

137
00:11:41,357 --> 00:11:44,360
Come on, guys. Let's wrap it up.

138
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:50,933
I saw your girl today
at pet therapy.

139
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,270
Hodoes she keep
her coat so shiny?

140
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:59,476
...they can be unexpected,
frightening events.

141
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:03,847
But they're justutiful
part of the scenery. Park,

142
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:06,550
- crater lake is located high in the cascades

143
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:09,419
of south-central oregon, about
250 miles south of portland...

144
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:10,887
I brought you your tea.

145
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:22,400
You did a good job tonight,
kid. Here's your taste.

146
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:25,603
- that's all right.

147
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,939
Take it.
You earned it.

148
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:35,980
Time once, I was a kid.

149
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,815
You know, my oldan
was a stonemason.

150
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,120
He took me to work...

151
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:44,623
A job building a wall around
some rich lady's garden.

152
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,560
She mes home.

153
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:50,295
I help carry her groceries.

154
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:52,531
She goes to give me
a quarter,

155
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:55,601
which was a lot in
those days, but I say no.

156
00:12:56,835 --> 00:13:00,172
She goes in. No sooner
does she close the door,

157
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,542
when... Crack! My old man gives
me a belt right across the mouth.

158
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:06,411
"what are you, a millionaire?
You no need-a money?

159
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,047
You no like-a eat?"

160
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,516
"what are you, a millionaire?
You no need-wow.ney?

161
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,584
Even still, he was right.

162
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,421
He made me
walk home that night.

163
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:19,259
11 fuckin' miles from
essex fells back to newark.

164
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:21,194
I'm from essex fells.

165
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:23,596
- a rich kid, huh?

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,303
Uh... Warren said I should
get my buttons back

167
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,972
on account of we weren't
really supposed to be gambling.

168
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,542
Tell warren
he can fuck himself.

169
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:36,510
Got a problem with that,
tell him to come see me.

170
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:41,182
Can I get a kit-kat
at least?

171
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:44,718
Do you believe this guy?

172
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:46,954
Get the fuck out of here?

173
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:57,097
Once in third grade...

174
00:13:57,165 --> 00:14:00,602
I got a 96 on my spelling test,
highest mark in the class.

175
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:02,637
I was so proud.

176
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:05,006
I brought it home
to show my dad.

177
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:07,642
"what happened to thother
four points?" he says.

178
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:12,047
Fuck you!
Fuck... You!

179
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:22,992
... Uz f.m. Fredericksburg.

180
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,161
Your home
for classic rock.

181
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:27,029
96.9.

182
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:30,366
Paulie, we should stop.

183
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,869
- fuck are we?
- virgin.

184
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:38,207
You remember that place...

185
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:40,376
The dive with
the fuckin' massage beds?

186
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:43,613
It was in culpepper,
virginia.

187
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,615
- the havenaire.
- ah!

188
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,019
We met those 16-ye-old
hillbilly whores

189
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,587
near the taxi stand.

190
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,523
Yeah.

191
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,591
You want the old days,
let's go there.

192
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:57,060
We'll get a room, bucket
of ice from the machine,

193
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,496
bottle of scotch,
order up a couple steaks...

194
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,799
Heh heh heh.
Now you're fuckin' talkin'.

195
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:15,146
Excuse me!
This place, is it new?

196
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,415
I think maybe,
I don't know.

197
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:19,784
There was a motel
on this spot though, right?

198
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,287
- the havenaire?
- I don't know.

199
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:25,924
Fuckin' guy.

200
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,597
Mr. Spears,
you're all set.

201
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:35,366
Two king rooms, one night,
checking out tomorrow.

202
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:38,336
From 6:00 to 10:00 we offer a
complimentary buffet breakfast

203
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,072
in the courtesy room
off the lobby.

204
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,674
Sign there, please.

205
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,242
Can you have
room service send up

206
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,977
two fifths
of glenlivet?

207
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,979
I apologize, sir,
we don't serve bottles.

208
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,881
There is a minibar
in the room however.

209
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,017
- all right, a couple steaks then.
- with baked potatoes.

210
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,253
Wraps and salads only
after 11:00.

211
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,857
Buckingham's
is still open though.

212
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,592
You could get some nachos.

213
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,266
Your dad, boy.

214
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,401
Him and me made this
trip a thousand times

215
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,003
back in the '60s.

216
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,539
He had a piece
of that dog track, right?

217
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:15,108
Among other things.

218
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,444
This one time,
my first trip ever,

219
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,579
we're going
through georgia.

220
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,149
He's got a '59 eldorado
with the fins.

221
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,785
The biarritz,
he used to let me steer.

222
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:27,388
I'm like 20 at the time,
I'm a kid.

223
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:33,661
Neveanyway, I'm drivin',
we get pulled over.

224
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:36,330
State trooper with the hat,
fuckin' sunglasses.

225
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:38,966
I got no driver's license.

226
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,635
Of course not.

227
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,603
I'm shittin'
a brick.

228
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:44,639
This is the deep
fuckin' south we're in,

229
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,207
and we're italian.

230
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,509
I turn to your dad...
"what do I tell this prick?"

231
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:51,479
"relax," he says. "tell him
your cousin's on the job."

232
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,415
he gives me
a southern-sounding name.

233
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:55,517
The guy comes over.

234
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:58,153
"oh, my cousin's a state
trooper too," I tell him.

235
00:16:58,253 --> 00:16:59,988
"maybe you know him."

236
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:02,324
"what's his name?"
"barney fife." pow!

237
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:06,662
The prick gives me a shot, I
don't know what the fuck hit me.

238
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,797
Your dad's fuckin'
pissing himself.

239
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:11,166
I mean, I never watch tv.
How the fuck do I know, right?

240
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:14,903
- so what happened?
- your dad had to "duke" the guy 100 fuckin' dollars.

241
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,105
Probably ath's salary
in those days.

242
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:21,177
You know, I remember you
around that time.

243
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,046
When I was bad,
my dad used to threaten me

244
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:25,181
he was gonna get uncle
paulie to come get me.

245
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,752
Fuckin' johnny boy, eh?

246
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,123
He loved you, my friend.

247
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:36,326
I remember the night
you were born.

248
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,428
Only time
I ever saw him cry.

249
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,630
Heh.

250
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:42,732
It's funny, you know, I...

251
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:46,237
Never knew where
I stood with him.

252
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:49,740
Like he didn't believe
in me or something.

253
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,543
Fucking kidding?
He trusted you enough

254
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,278
to give you
the willie overall thing.

255
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:58,182
- and you were what, 24?
- 22

256
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:00,084
so there you go then.

257
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:10,762
I tell the guy,
I said, "listen,

258
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,330
I don't mind paying
for the tailpipe,

259
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:14,166
but that fuckin' muffler's
still under warranty."

260
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:17,235
- all set?
- yeah.

261
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,172
- nice talking to ya.
- yeah, you too.

262
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,607
Enjoy miami.

263
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,745
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

264
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,648
- what?
- you tell some fuckin' goober your life story?

265
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:32,083
We're supposed
to be laying low.

266
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:36,289
I'm gonna grab
some danish for the road.

267
00:18:57,544 --> 00:19:00,614
- you have shit on your pants, don.
- please be patient with him.

268
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,683
Yes, ma'am.

269
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,021
Visiting day
at the zoo.

270
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:10,157
Don't feed the chedrools.

271
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,795
- uh, ma.
- how was church?

272
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,731
It was fine.
It was good.

273
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:19,399
You remember mr. Soprano?

274
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,136
Corrado, please.
Hello, my dear.

275
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,407
- how are you today?
- I'd complain, but who'd listen?

276
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,479
They have me on some new
medication. It makes me salivate.

277
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:37,252
I'll leave you two to visit.
I have some letters to answer.

278
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:40,588
- he's a good boy, this one.
- thank you.

279
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,360
I have this new medication they
put me on. It makes me salivate.

280
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:07,416
How are you feeling?

281
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,621
- fine.
- maybe you can clear something up.

282
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,928
Dr. Mandl says you've been acting
aggressively toward other patients?

283
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:20,363
First of all, that is
total fucking bullshit.

284
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,533
- carter...
- secondly, why don't you just lead off with that?

285
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,202
What are you
talking about?

286
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:27,604
Instead of pretending to
give a shit how I feel.

287
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,608
Now, apparently, you are becoming bully.

288
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,480
Dr. Mandl feels you're modeling
your actions on the wrong people.

289
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:40,818
- ally? Like who?
- you know who. That gangster.

290
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:44,222
You of all people should know not to
believe what you read in the paper.

291
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:46,324
All that crap
they wrote about daddy.

292
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,493
That was
"the wall street journal."

293
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,061
it was entirely different.

294
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:52,330
It's never enough, is it?

295
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:55,366
My whole time at m.I.t., you told
me to get out and make friends.

296
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:58,002
Now I finally do learn
to assert myself a little,

297
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:00,104
suddenly that's a negative.

298
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,480
Checking in... Spears.

299
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:17,589
- sil.
- I'll get us settled in.

300
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:21,593
- hey.
- it's not good.

301
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:23,729
The feds found a body.

302
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:26,732
Skeleton. They tentatively
I.d.'d it as the guy.

303
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,602
- ah, fuck.
- try and relax, huh?

304
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:31,771
How's paulie holding up?

305
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:34,774
Jaws are holding up fine.
He won't shut the fuck up.

306
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:38,244
- that's too bad.
- what the fuck's he gotta worry about anyway?

307
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:41,714
Scenario like this, the feds ain't
interested in him, believe me.

308
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:46,252
Look, I love the guy,
it's just...

309
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:48,721
- you know how he is.
- believe me, I hear you.

310
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:50,723
What else?
Let me think.

311
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,091
Um...

312
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:53,928
I looked in on carm
and she's okay.

313
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:56,163
All right, thanks.

314
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,299
Call me if you hear anything.

315
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:02,670
...use your hat!

316
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:07,641
- "and hope to hear from you soon."

317
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,211
"sincerely... " no.

318
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:12,413
"respectfully,
corrado soprano."

319
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:15,716
read it back.

320
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:18,787
"dear vice president cheney,

321
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:22,524
as a powerful man all too
familiar with accidental gunplay,

322
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,894
I am writing in the hope that
you will intervene in my case.

323
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:28,997
Like yourself, I was involved
in an unfortunate incident

324
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:31,766
- when a gun I was handling misfired."

325
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,402
- head up, yo.

326
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:38,073
- I's you, I'd lay off the card games awhile.
-  fuck's the matter?

327
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,842
The professor snitched
you out to dr. Mandl.

328
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,282
What do you do
with those, jameel?

329
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:49,018
Autographed pictures of the
man who capped tony soprano?

330
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:51,521
Shit, them motherfuckers
go right on ebay.

331
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:54,991
Come on now, sign.

332
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:57,226
That was our deal.

333
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:00,530
You wanna keep
getting them sodas?

334
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,869
Sick fuckin' world.

335
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,647
- for you.
- oh, wow.

336
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:18,515

00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:19,983
Thanks.

338
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,486
Where's the dvd?

339
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:25,656
That never occurred to me.

340
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,826
I'll have sil fedex you one.

341
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:31,662
- long as you're here.
Salut'.

342
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,336
Hey, listen,

343
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:41,573
remember that cuban guy I was telling
you about? He knocks over trucks.

344
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,975
Last load was
american standard

345
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:46,744
sinks, toilets, tubs...

346
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:48,780
- no shit?
- mmm.

347
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:51,749
- all right, let's talk.
- I'll give you his number, you call him.

348
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:53,918
Now, check this out.

349
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:57,589
You're not gonna believe what I found
when we were moving into the new house.

350
00:24:02,895 --> 00:24:05,264
Holy fucking shit.

351
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:13,172
Mickey pinto
took that in 1963.

352
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:15,040
Look at that hair.

353
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:17,543
Handsome fuckin' guy, eh?

354
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,612
That wristband,
the leather thing,

355
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:21,580
I remember getting
one just like it,

356
00:24:21,615 --> 00:24:23,283
me and all my friends.

357
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:25,218
Wanted to be a tough guy
just like him.

358
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:30,090
That big one,
that's your uncle junior

359
00:24:30,157 --> 00:24:32,726
and your old man
in front of satriale's.

360
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:40,634
There he is.

361
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,570
It's the biarritz.
We were just talking about that.

362
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:47,541
I tell you what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna have my daughter

363
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:50,611
scan them into the computer so I
can get a couple of copies for you.

364
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:55,650
Oh, that's my wife.
I gotta take this.

365
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:57,485
No, stay, stay.
It's all right, come on.

366
00:24:57,552 --> 00:25:00,421
Uh, I gotta
empty my bag anyway.

367
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:02,089
Hey, honey, sweetie, h?

368
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:05,092
- gisays hi, guys.
- hello, gia!

369
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:14,837
He pisses in a bag now?

370
00:25:14,903 --> 00:25:16,872
Jesus christ,fuckin.

371
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:23,145
Supporting them with
a huge warehouse covering 28 acres!

372
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:26,014
Stuffed to the rafters
with over 3,000 products

373
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:28,150
you can order
at rock bottom prices

374
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:30,953
and sell for profits
of up to 300% and more.

375
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:33,355
It's easy to wish
for a better life...

376
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,963
Just pick up the phone and
call this toll-free number... )

377
00:25:42,198 --> 00:25:44,467
- hello.
- junior, it's pat.

378
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,035
You put any thought
to our plan?

379
00:25:46,102 --> 00:25:48,204
What plan?

380
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:50,306
The dentist,
know, like we said

381
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,877
- who is this?
- it's pat!

382
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:57,080
The dentis remember? You were
gonna make an appointment.

383
00:25:57,147 --> 00:26:00,150
You sneak me off,

384
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:03,987
- where would I lam it?
- um... A safe house, I don't know.

385
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:08,659
The time's not right.

386
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:12,163
I'm being watched.
Call back later.

387
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:15,733
- 'cause I'm headed back to sarasota soon...

388
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:20,805
...free to get started.
They give you plenty of ideas

389
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,274
and support and the
quality of the product

390
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,743
is even better than what you
see in the catalogs.

391
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,145
I decided I wanted something
where I was my own boss...

392
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:31,883
Back in the day...
'70s... Fuckin' '80s...

393
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,886
You didn't make a move
in north jersey

394
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,721
without this one
up your ass.

395
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:39,124
I wasn't even born yet.

396
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:43,662
Please. Wanna talk
about stand-up guys?

397
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:47,866
Sorry, beans.

398
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:52,437
Hey, carlo, can we get
some more champagne please?

399
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:54,440
Hey, remember that
yokel at the feast

400
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:56,108
mouthing off
to your cousin?

401
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:58,911
This maniac threw
a vat of hot oil

402
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:01,113
right from the zeppole
stand on this prick.

403
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,949
Oh my god.

404
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:05,284
Little powdered sugar,
he would've been done.

405
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:08,754
And ton', remember
when we all rented

406
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:10,456
that house
down the shore?

407
00:27:10,523 --> 00:27:13,159
- with the bedbugs?
- summer of '78.

408
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:15,294
Carlo, silvio,
frankie napoli...

409
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:16,629
- place up the beach...
- yeah.

410
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:18,265
...sonny spinz
from the bronx rented it,

411
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:19,666
that's where
that hippy kid

412
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:21,802
"mysteriously" drowned
during that party.

413
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:29,977
Hey ton', you okay?

414
00:27:30,043 --> 00:27:31,645
Yeah yeah.

415
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,248
You sure, T?
Yore being kinda quiet.

416
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:36,583
That's 'cause...

417
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,052
"remember when" is the lowest
form of conversation.

418
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:00,408
I told tommy deleo
you're the boss now.

419
00:28:01,743 --> 00:28:04,445
This fucking deleo construction
has always been a problem.

420
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:08,550
Tell him I personally
am upset.

421
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:15,925
- nice gravy, huh?
- yeah.

422
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:18,427
Anyway, yo taste.

423
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:22,398
How's patricia?
You mind?

424
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:28,604
Go ahead.

425
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:37,481
Now I'll start by making a
mountain fold on each corner.

426
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:40,484
Folding the corners into
the center of the paper...

427
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,385
Touche, "captain blood."

428
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:49,526
checkers,
the thinking man's game.

429
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:51,561
You looking for a smack
in the fuckin' mouth?

430
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:53,363
Corrado?

431
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,898
Language, please.

432
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,407
- what do you want?
- if you'd move, perhaps I could reach the chess set.

433
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,743
And if I don't, what the
fuck are you gonna do then?

434
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,513
- you don't intimidate me.
- corrado!

435
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:15,119
- you're lucky she's here, you little prick.
- naturally.

436
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,989
You're only toughwhen ty

437
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:21,559
so things don't go too far.
Oh, how the mighty have f...

438
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:23,095
Corrado!

439
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,400
Get him! Get him!

440
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,069
How do you like that, huh?

441
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,338
Fuckin' smart guy!
How do you like that!

442
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,641
God, no!

443
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,212
I'm gonna kill this prick.

444
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,716
Would you describe mr.
Soprano as the aggressor?

445
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,553
Is he generally
a troublemaker?

446
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,622
Nah, he cool.

447
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:52,292
You just gotta know
how to talk to him is all.

448
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,561
That's a lovely watch
you're wearing.

449
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,196
Is that vintage?

450
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:01,801
Bulova, yeah.
Flea market.

451
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:05,138
Must have been
quite expensive.

452
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,477
Why am I the only caregiver
being interrogated here?

453
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:13,980
It wouldn't happen to be because of
the color of my skin, now would it?

454
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,550
Thank you for your
cooperation. You can go.

455
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:29,964
I'm gonna write a change
order for soprano's meds.

456
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,967
Yeah, I need a bridge loan.
If ya could.

457
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,936
- 200k.
- done.

458
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:38,340
What can il you?
I've been fucking mush lately.

459
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:40,075
It happens.

460
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:41,977
I lost the 1:00 game
by a field goal.

461
00:30:42,043 --> 00:30:44,513
It was a pick 'em. Then the
4:00 game, I'm chasing the money,

462
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:46,314
I picked
the 49ers minus two.

463
00:30:46,348 --> 00:30:49,317
Ah, fuck it,
you don't want to hear this.

464
00:30:49,351 --> 00:30:51,686
It's been this way
the last couple months though.

465
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:54,189
- listen, this too shall pass.

466
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:56,525
- thanks, tateleh.
- any time.

467
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:58,393
All right.

468
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:33,497
Is this a nonsmoking room?

469
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:35,465
Go ahead.

470
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:50,280
Dinner was fun
the other night.

471
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:52,683
- yeah.
- how do you know per?

472
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,253
Who peter?

473
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,121
Beansie?

474
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:02,093
He's an old friend...

475
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,728
From the neighborhood.

476
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:06,631
So the other guy?
The one with, um...

477
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:08,733
White hair thingies?
What's his name again?

478
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,036
- paulie.
- right.

479
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:14,105
What is he,
like, your best friend?

480
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,175
- he say that?
- I just figured.

481
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:18,677
The way he was talking.

482
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:21,981
Honestly, I thought heas
your dad at first.

483
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:24,650
There was a time
when I wished he was.

484
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,388
He... He used to work
for my dad.

485
00:32:29,455 --> 00:32:31,157
I know, he told me.

486
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:51,978
Corrado?
Corro?

487
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:54,581
- huh?
- it's time for group.

488
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,320
It's these new pills
last couple of days.

489
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:02,222
I got no pep.

490
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:06,092
Oh, that'll change. There's
a slight adjustment period.

491
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,696
But I'm sleeping all the
time now. I can't focus.

492
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:11,098
Just givit some time,
you'll feel a lot better

493
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:13,000
and your memory will
improve too.

494
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,343
You know
that's bullshit, right?

495
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,413
They're trying
to numb you out,

496
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:28,216
'cause of what you did
to the professor.

497
00:33:34,957 --> 00:33:37,426
Where the fuck
is this guy?

498
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:40,128
West on 84,

499
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:48,604
There.

500
00:33:57,447 --> 00:34:00,150
What the fuck is this?

501
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:02,152
Ho! Ho ho ho!
God damn it.

502
00:34:06,623 --> 00:34:08,491
Who's ramon?

503
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,061
Waiting long?

504
00:34:12,128 --> 00:34:14,464
So everybody come tonight
except charo?

505
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:17,233
All right, hold
on, hold on, hold on.

506
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:20,003
I'm tony,

507
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:22,071
This is esteban
and the rest of the guys.

508
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:27,244
So our friend in the wheelchair tells
us you get regular access to goods?

509
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,020
Okay.

510
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,622
I got a trailer
full of power tools,

511
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:40,524
coming in later on
this month.

512
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:43,460
Factory-sealed black
and deckers and makitas.

513
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:46,263
I can get r you
50ÄÂ¢ on the dollar.

514
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:48,266
60 grand.

515
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:52,537
Well, 55 would work but that
includes shipping to jersey.

516
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,272
We look
like fucking u.p.s.?

517
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:57,909
Look, you send the truck up
north, we send it back-loaded.

518
00:34:57,976 --> 00:35:00,445
I got a line on air
mattresses, pool toys,

519
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:03,849
and I can round the load
out with kerastase,

520
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:07,285
it's a french shampoo...
$20 a bottle retail.

521
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:09,788
Now yoget 5%
after sale,

522
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:11,957
but that's gonna
involve a little trust.

523
00:35:13,726 --> 00:35:15,728
'sta bien.

524
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:17,897
All right.

525
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:20,099
We're looking for
a long-term relationship.

526
00:35:20,132 --> 00:35:22,368
- we'll be calling.
- all right.

527
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:23,970
You okay, tÄÂ­o?

528
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:40,821
Corrado, how you
doing today?

529
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,290
I'm dying a slow death,
that's how I'm doing.

530
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:45,492
Just take
your meds, yo.

531
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:48,495
Real fucking
nazi now, huh?

532
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:50,230
Stop fucking pushing!

533
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:51,732
Ah! I wasn't!

534
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:54,168
yo, stop bumping
dickheads out there!

535
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:18,226
You should have
seen him out there.

536
00:36:18,293 --> 00:36:20,195
The fuck can
handle himself.

537
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,398
He's got the gazzis
of a 20-year-old.

538
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:27,402
He's my friend, but, jesus,
what a fucking chiacchierone.

539
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:29,071
"yup-yup-yup-
yup-yup-yup."

540
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,076
heells me, "don't say nothing
to nobody." he's got prostate.

541
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:36,545
I say, "sure."
he tells everybody.

542
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,814
He was always like that.

543
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:41,417
Nah, he was
gary-fucking-cooper.

544
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:42,785
You forget.

545
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:46,255
One time, I fell asleep
while he was on the phone.

546
00:36:46,322 --> 00:36:48,224
I wake up
20 minutes later,

547
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,626
and he was still going.

548
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,003
I gotta say...

549
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:03,406
It concerns me.

550
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:04,908
Lately.

551
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:06,910
Nah.

552
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:08,745
Come on, huh?

553
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:14,584
Hey, people live alone,
they get like that. It's sad.

554
00:37:16,854 --> 00:37:19,223
I'm leaving
for my card game.

555
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,591
Are you two okay?

556
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:22,927
- dinner was great, hon.
- any time, you know that.

557
00:37:22,994 --> 00:37:24,595
Thank you.

558
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:30,368
That's a great girl
you got there.

559
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:32,036
The way she stood by you.

560
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:34,338
Now you see, that's what
paulie doesn't got.

561
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:37,942
Now I'm speaking
to your point.

562
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:39,677
He's got no wife.

563
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:41,412
He's got no kids.

564
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,215
He's got no steady
income stream neither.

565
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:47,252
Which is coming
to an end. Barone,

566
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:50,589
I told him, if you
can't show legit income,

567
00:37:50,656 --> 00:37:52,958
you're vulnerable
to the feds.

568
00:37:54,393 --> 00:37:56,128
He don't do
shit about it.

569
00:37:57,763 --> 00:38:00,332
I think you're worrying
for nothing, tony.

570
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:04,169
Things are going great.

571
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:06,605
Finally.

572
00:38:06,673 --> 00:38:08,942
Maybe I'm just...

573
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:11,110
Waiting for the other
shoe to drop.

574
00:38:11,177 --> 00:38:12,979
All I know is,

575
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,316
paulie gualtieri
is a stand-up guy.

576
00:38:16,382 --> 00:38:18,651
Has he ever really been
put the test?

577
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:29,195
You know, he had this
painting of me in his house.

578
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:32,398
I was all dressed up
like a fucking general.

579
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:35,636
I heard out that.

580
00:38:35,669 --> 00:38:37,505
Yeah, it pissed me off.

581
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:39,940
Thought it was
a fucking joke.

582
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:45,846
- but I don't think it was.
- he loves you, ton'.

583
00:38:45,913 --> 00:38:47,681
You're all he's got.

584
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:51,752
You, the guys
and his image.

585
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,860
I love him too.

586
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,962
You always did.

587
00:39:33,362 --> 00:39:34,697
Hey, sil.

588
00:39:34,764 --> 00:39:36,232
I'm here with bobby.

589
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:38,935
- he just got a call frojenna.
- who?

590
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,069
Karen's sister.

591
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:42,438
Works in the courthouse.

592
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,273
Oh, yeah yeah.

593
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,741
And?

594
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:48,978
- are you sitting down?
- just fucking tell me.

595
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,714
Jackie aprile.

596
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:53,217
- what?
- you heard me.

597
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:55,919
Larry told them j.a.
Was totally responsible

598
00:39:55,986 --> 00:39:58,689
for e death of a certain
african-american person.

599
00:39:58,755 --> 00:40:01,892
- he covered your
- congratulations, anthony!

600
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:04,328
Yeah, well...

601
00:40:04,394 --> 00:40:05,996
You got to wonder
what's next, huh?

602
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:08,065
Yeah,
but for tonight, huh?

603
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:11,001
All right, thanks.

604
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:12,704
Talk to you later.

605
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,401
Ha-ha-ha!

606
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:51,210
We're off the hook
on this willie overall thing.

607
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:53,979
Oh! Thank god!
That's fucking beautiful.

608
00:40:54,046 --> 00:40:55,915
Yeah.

609
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:03,123
Know what we ought to do?

610
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,159
We ought to treat ourselves
before we leave.

611
00:41:06,226 --> 00:41:09,329
I was thinking maybe we'd
do some sport fishing.

612
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:10,931
You serious?

613
00:41:10,997 --> 00:41:12,232
Yeah?
What are you kidding,

614
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:14,134
the fucking marlin
they got out here?

615
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:16,236
We'll rent a boat.

616
00:41:18,438 --> 00:41:20,874
Yeah. Sure.

617
00:41:23,343 --> 00:41:26,847
"what's that got to do with
chien farming?" he asks.

618
00:41:26,914 --> 00:41:30,852
The whore says, "last year,
I raised over 5,000 cocks."

619
00:41:33,421 --> 00:41:35,790
- where you going?
- the head. I gotta piss.

620
00:41:35,857 --> 00:41:39,126
- one more?
- yeah. One more.

621
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:42,697
Two fags decide
they want a baby.

622
00:41:42,763 --> 00:41:44,866
So they jack off
in a cup,

623
00:41:44,932 --> 00:41:47,602
use the sperm to get a lady
friend of theirs pregnant.

624
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:49,871
Nine months later,
they go to the hospital.

625
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:52,106
They see all the babies
in the nursery.

626
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:54,443
"look," they say.
"our baby's the sweetest one.

627
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,045
He's not even
crying at all."

628
00:41:57,112 --> 00:42:00,516
ah... God damn it,
what t fuck is it?

629
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:02,384
"now he's not crying,"
the nurse says.

630
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:05,153
"just wait till we take the
pacifier out of his ass."

631
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,155
right, yeah.

632
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:14,897
Oh, fuck me!

633
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:18,868
Accident! Accident!

634
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:22,405
God fucking damn it!

635
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:24,407
Corrado,
what happened?

636
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:26,976
Oh, jesus christ
on the cross.

637
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:28,578
It's all right.

638
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:30,346
Come on.

639
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:35,752
I'm an old man. It was an
accident, for christ's sake.

640
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:39,088
You're on ditropan specifically
to avoid incontinence.

641
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:43,026
Not to mention celexa, which should
be curtailing your aggressiveness.

642
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,929
I'm taking my medication.

643
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,864
Ask hormel,
you don't believe me.

644
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,200
Jameel.
He's been let go.

645
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,935
Mr. Soprano,
there's a mutual trust

646
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:54,238
among the staff and our
patients regarding treatment.

647
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,507
That means you
have a choice...

648
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,275
You can either
wear depends

649
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,611
while you await transfer
to another facility,

650
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,113
or you can take your
medication as prescribed.

651
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:14,559
Here, corrado.
Time for your medicine.

652
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,233
Where the fuck
is my ipod?

653
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,335
Every day it's
your ipod, carter.

654
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:25,070
Just stop causing
a commotion!

655
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:43,823
What'd you do that for?

656
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:45,658
I should piss
myself again?

657
00:43:45,758 --> 00:43:47,593
But I did the thing.

658
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,996
They're muscling me,
what do you want me to tell you?

659
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:52,832
I could have
gotten in trouble.

660
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:54,433
You don't even
give a shit.

661
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,642
Let's get
a card game together.

662
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,544
- they fired hormel.
- jameel?

663
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,179
Fuck him! You got me.

664
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:08,382
Maybe tomorrow, kid.
Don't know. I'm tired.

665
00:44:29,304 --> 00:44:32,073
Old ironsides!

666
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:36,277
Ho! You're supposed
to say "who, beansie?"

667
00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:38,379
yeah.

668
00:45:41,212 --> 00:45:43,581
Where you been?

669
00:45:43,648 --> 00:45:45,783
You didn't come
to lunch.

670
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,021
I brought you
these...

671
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:53,324
From keith.
He owed me money.

672
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:55,726
"hootie
and the blowfish."

673
00:45:57,261 --> 00:45:58,829
thanks.

674
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,336
That was a nice lett
you wrote to cheney.

675
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:06,305
But he don't
read 'em himself,

676
00:46:06,371 --> 00:46:08,740
they got computers
that do it.

677
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,343
I asked lynch,
the professor.

678
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,745
What are you talking
to him for?

679
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,748
He says we'll have a better chance
if we write him at his outfit...

680
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,250
Halliburton.

681
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,487
My father
owned umman ock.

682
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:29,662
My grandpa said my dad
lackedharacter.

683
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,567
Grandpa was a lion.

684
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:39,105
You're very smart,
anthony.

685
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,443
I'm sure you're very
good with spelling too.

686
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:32,060
Rigatoni a la paulie.
He-he!

687
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,730
But since you're eating it, maybe
it should be "rigatoni a la tony"?

688
00:47:35,797 --> 00:47:37,199
Heh heh.

689
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:39,234
Ah!

690
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:40,735
Oh, madonn'!

691
00:47:46,142 --> 00:47:47,677
What?
You're not hungry?

692
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:50,179
My fucking stomach.

693
00:47:57,253 --> 00:47:59,422
You know, when you
went down below,

694
00:47:59,522 --> 00:48:01,524
I thought I saw
a whale.

695
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:03,926
- no shit.
- it made me think of ginny sack.

696
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:13,804
That joke ralph made about
her, that was some funny shit,

697
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:15,505
no matter what john said.

698
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,975
You got to have
a sense of humor, right?

699
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:20,277
Yeah.

700
00:48:25,249 --> 00:48:28,085
I heard she took
an office job.

701
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:31,889
- chubb insurance.
- heh heh!

702
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:38,997
It was you
told him, right?

703
00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:40,331
I mean, it's no big deal.

704
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:42,166
I could hardly resist.

705
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,235
Grapevine, ton'.
I don't know.

706
00:48:44,302 --> 00:48:46,304
Yeah.

707
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:49,073
He was a funny prick,
that ralph.

708
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,976
His "gladiator" fixation,

709
00:48:52,043 --> 00:48:54,679
the time he hit georgie
in the eye with the chain.

710
00:48:54,746 --> 00:48:56,681
Heh heh heh!

711
00:48:56,749 --> 00:49:00,819
I'd have loved to have seen john's
face when he heard that crack.

712
00:49:00,886 --> 00:49:04,356
Always fucking holier-than-thou
'cause he didn't fuck other women.

713
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:08,661
Mr. Broomstick-up-
his-ass.

714
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:10,763
Heh heh heh.

715
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:13,332
You know,

716
00:49:13,399 --> 00:49:17,503
no offense, but... You ever had
yourself checked for tourette's?

717
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,505
What?

718
00:49:19,572 --> 00:49:20,839
Tourette's syndrome...

719
00:49:20,906 --> 00:49:22,341
Seriously.

720
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:25,345
"heh heh." it's like you
got a tick or something.

721
00:49:25,412 --> 00:49:28,949
I dunno. It's like some
people grind their teeth.

722
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:31,585
When I'm nervous...
Tense or something.

723
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:43,129
Come on, you told
john about that joke, right?

724
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,543
- it wasn't me, ton'.
- no?

725
00:49:55,643 --> 00:49:57,812
That's right.

726
00:50:07,388 --> 00:50:09,423
You want a drink?

727
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:11,959
All right, stewarts.

728
00:50:48,364 --> 00:50:49,866
- think fast!
- jesus! Ton'!

729
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:52,368
Fuck, that hurt.

730
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:21,295
What does it take
to get something to eat?

731
00:52:40,147 --> 00:52:41,748
When my time comes,

732
00:52:41,816 --> 00:52:45,420
tell me,
will I stand up?

733
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,078
Who was at the door?

734
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,147
"williams-sonoma.
From paulie.

735
00:53:12,214 --> 00:53:16,852
The elektra semiautomatic
chrome espresso machine."

736
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:18,854
4a>od2- so?
- my god, tony.

737
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:21,056
This is, like, $2,000.

738
00:53:21,123 --> 00:53:23,259
I mean, what is
wrong with that man?

739
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,161
What's wrong with him?
Nothing.

740
00:53:26,228 --> 00:53:28,931
It's guys like him that allows
our whole lifestyle here.

741
00:53:40,443 --> 00:53:42,579
Take me over
to jeanette's house.

742
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,558
Ah!

743
00:54:20,117 --> 00:54:23,154
In an apparent escalation
of a mafia power struggle...

744
00:54:23,255 --> 00:54:25,324
What year? Let me see,

745
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,126
'72, '73, back in
the feech lamanna days.

746
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:31,597
I'm on a roll. I mean, I haven't
lost a bet in fucking months.

747
00:54:31,663 --> 00:54:33,966
...after a brazen
ambush by...

748
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:35,534
Hey, ton',
you see this shit?

749
00:54:35,601 --> 00:54:37,336
Skip.

750
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:38,904
Hey.

751
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:42,007
Looks like phil's the main
guinea over there now, huh?

752
00:54:42,074 --> 00:54:43,775
Anyway, we're at
maxwell's plum,

753
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:46,178
the saturday night
before the game.

754
00:54:46,246 --> 00:54:49,282
Who walks in
but fucking namath?

755
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:52,452
Three sheets to the wind, fuckin'
staggering like aailor.

756
00:54:52,518 --> 00:54:55,188
So I know the game is
going into the toilet.

757
00:54:55,255 --> 00:54:56,689
I said to
my brother jerry...

758
00:54:56,756 --> 00:54:58,291
He was just
a kid at the time...

759
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:01,327
"take this money down
to old caruso on the corner

760
00:55:01,394 --> 00:55:03,496
and put it all
against the jets."

761
00:55:03,563 --> 00:55:07,333
my brother was just recovering
from rheumatic fever...
