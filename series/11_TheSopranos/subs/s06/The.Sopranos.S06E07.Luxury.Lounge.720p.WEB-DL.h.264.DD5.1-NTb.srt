1
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:43,024
That's where the Twin Towers were.

2
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:46,194
We should go see it.

3
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:58,745
You guys speak English?

4
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:01,285
Not some too much.

5
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,685
The address is in the bag.

6
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:10,555
134 Deweunter Terrace, Brooklyn.

7
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:13,065
That's New York.

8
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:16,825
There's a map.
Dump it all after you memorize it.

9
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:20,406
The man you're gonna pop is extremely
cautious, usually has protection.

10
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:25,176
Guy with a long horse face,
in good shape.

11
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:28,606
The fish have been cleaned.

12
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:30,716
You can drop them where you do it.

13
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:33,186
Where'd you learn to speak Italian?

14
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:36,516
I came over here with my parents
when I was two.

15
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,746
You were born in Italy?

16
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,086
Where?

17
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,437
I just wanna say

18
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:58,807
it's been a while
since we opened the books

19
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:01,677
and in regards
to you guys--

20
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:03,287
Burt, Gerry--

21
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:05,287
as a man
of few words, I--

22
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:07,517
Not few enough, though, huh?
New blood.

23
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:10,158
- New blood.
- Salut.

24
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:16,458
Sure, we break
some balls here tonight,

25
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:18,188
but I go way back.

26
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:20,238
And in light
of recent humiliations,

27
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:24,138
it's a honor
to be joined by men

28
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:27,108
and not faggot-ass
corn-holing cocksuckers

29
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:28,798
like married my cousin.

30
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,568
- He should fuckin' die!
- Phil, relax.

31
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,739
- Whoa whoa whoa, Phil.
- Take it easy.

32
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:35,979
Phil, you know the wine
makes you emotional.

33
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,819
Because I got
an empty fuckin' stomach.

34
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,759
- So have a breadstick.
- 45 minutes for some grilled eggplant?

35
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,259
Jesus Christ, is there nothing
without this complaining?

36
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:48,329
You didn't notice?
Artie's game is a little off lately.

37
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,699
Well, Carmela sent
her branzino back Sunday night,

38
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:52,669
but she loves
to do that.

39
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,329
Gentlemen,
how's everything so far?

40
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,129
- Fantastic.
- Delicious.

41
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,780
The delay--
a thousand pardons.

42
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:19,067
- Buon appetito!
- Det var pÃ¥ tiden.

43
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:28,700
JÃ¤vla Phil. Vilken uppvisning!

44
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,180
I gotta be honest-- new guy
in the kitchen aside,

45
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,480
I mean, how come we're waiting?
It seems empty out there.

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,920
People like to get in
that last barbecue.

47
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,550
Artie, you been
to this "Da Giovanni" up by Troy Hills?

48
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,990
- No, I haven't been.
- Supposed to be incredible.

49
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,920
- He's a kid, right?
- I hate fish,

50
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,030
but his,
with the agrodolce...

51
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,390
I'll check it out.

52
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,231
- Ah, buon appetito.
- About time.

53
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,911
Fuckin' Phil.
Some display, huh?

54
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:38,641
Paid a visit
to Vito's goomar, Jill.

55
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,721
She still hasn't
heard from Vito.

56
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:46,151
We were just discussin'
"La Cage aux Fat."

57
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:48,662
I was gonna get my cousin Tommy
to call his detective friend.

58
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,992
I've been hamstrung with that work
stoppage at the office park.

59
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:55,532
Vito shows up-- he shows up,
then we deal with him. If not...

60
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:57,672
It's just a phone call.
And seriously,

61
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:01,302
Tommy says the guy can track somebody
from the corn in his shit.

62
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:03,442
Yeah, I saw them
do that on "CSI."

63
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,352
- Good night.
- Bye, Sack.

64
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:10,482
- Bye now.
- Good night, kid.

65
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,023
Hey, I was glad to hear you say
that about the search,

66
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:16,783
'cause I gotta take a little time off
for some business in Cali.

67
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:20,083
Little Carmine's
lined up a meet in L.A. for us.

68
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,523
So, what is it,
business or time off?

69
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:24,863
Time off from here,
but definite business.

70
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:26,733
With Ben Kingsley, Ton'.

71
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,333
So you're gonna go
get an autograph

72
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,873
on the weekend
of the Notre Dame-Michigan game?

73
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,203
I got my guys all over it.
Little Carmine says

74
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:35,643
if we attach Ben Kingsley,
the picture's a go.

75
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:37,404
Little Carmine?

76
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:39,704
It's common knowledge
the guy's retarded.

77
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:42,014
I don't get it.
You agreed to this in the hospital.

78
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,344
Christopher,
I was in a coma.

79
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:49,114
Okay, fine.
I'll call Little Carmine,

80
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:52,454
call the airline, cancel.

81
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,324
I'll probably
still reach someone.

82
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,094
What am I gonna do
with you?

83
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:01,634
Make a lot of money.

84
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,565
All right.

85
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,145
What the fuck
is this idiot doing?

86
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,485
No speak English.

87
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,415
...Brooklyn.

88
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:22,585
Ho, pal.
Move your car. We're late.

89
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:28,936
Move el automobile.

90
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:36,066
Rusty! Don't forget
to call Marissa.

91
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:40,676
Hurry up. Let me see.

92
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:47,246
- Museum...
- Eastern Parkway.

93
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,886
Eastern Parkway,
not the Belt Parkway.

94
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,337
So I'm trying to eject the DVD
and the kids are freaking,

95
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,377
"What's wrong
with that lady, Daddy?"

96
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:16,807
- And Carrie says--
- How's the scaloppine?

97
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:19,038
Uh, it's delicious.
Thanks.

98
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,708
It all depends on slicing
the veal very thin.

99
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,718
My way--

100
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,988
I like to chill it down
a degree or two

101
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,458
and then I pull a straight razor
right across it.

102
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:31,288
Your father could cook.

103
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,228
He told me when you were in here last.
75th birthday, right?

104
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:37,388
- In the navy.
- What's that?

105
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:38,898
In the navy,
he cooked.

106
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,128
Terrific guy.
Great head of hair.

107
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:42,639
- You enjoy.
- Mmm.

108
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:46,269
Save room. I'll be back
with dessert specials.

109
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:49,779
Ho, Benny,
Moe and Jack.

110
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,649
How's the bruschett'?

111
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,449
You got a quorum.
Let me get you a table.

112
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:56,279
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna stay right here.

113
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,189
My best customer,
but he's nailed to this fuckin' spot.

114
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:02,329
It's either the wine
or the view.

115
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:03,929
Such a sweet kid.

116
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,089
You know, she told Charmaine
that back in Albania

117
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,670
her whole family
got blown up

118
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,000
waiting on line
for an oil change.

119
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,110
The shit she's been through,
we just had to help.

120
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,300
I even called in a favor with my cousin
in Manhattan,

121
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,950
got her a working visa,
started on the green card.

122
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,380
Martina,
come do some hosting.

123
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,980
- Hi.
- Hi.

124
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,140
What's up?

125
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,020
This is your cheering
section over here.

126
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,850
- Hello, Benny.
- You got the reservations squared away?

127
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,720
It's very few
right now.

128
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,521
Football season.

129
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,861
I could watch her
walk away all night.

130
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:41,061
Good, 'cause like most girls with you,
that's what she's gonna do.

131
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,201
Ah, to be young
and single again like these two,

132
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:44,801
- huh, Benito?
- Ahh.

133
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:17,032
I can put the credit card numbers on
actual plastic

134
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:19,672
for an extra five bills.

135
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,543
We do Internet strictly.

136
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:41,723
Mmm, the gnocchi!

137
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,203
I'll take your word.
It's a little too rich for my stomach.

138
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:49,134
It's okay.
Just a bite.

139
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,574
I think it's
a lamb ragu

140
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:55,684
with just a scoop
of cold rigott'.

141
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:57,114
Holy shit.

142
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,254
It's all so fresh.
That fish with pistachios?

143
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,884
I feel like a traitor.

144
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:04,584
Vesuvio, lately,
it's depressing somehow.

145
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:06,954
Maybe they need to remodel
or something. I don't know.

146
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,064
That menu
is so tired.

147
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:11,964
- Hey, Homo Junior!
- Leave me the fuck alone!

148
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:16,095
Get-- stop it!
Mom, they're hurting Vito!

149
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,825
- Stop it!
- Where are your parents?

150
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:24,175
I guess she can't hide
her face at home.

151
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:27,315
It'd be like admitting
there was something wrong.

152
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:29,105
I should have brought
a pair of sweatpants

153
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,015
to change into.
I'm gonna explode.

154
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:34,015
Apparently,
there is still a veal loin

155
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,915
yet to be unveiled.

156
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:40,256
Please, don't get up.

157
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,056
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

158
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:43,716
That kid,
I'm tellin' you...

159
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:47,296
- Thank you.
- ...he was so handsome in that church.

160
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:50,096
The name he took, "Francis"--
after my pop.

161
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:53,336
No restaurants in Brooklyn?
You gotta come all the way to Jersey?

162
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:56,846
This food-- it's worth a detour.
Why? ls there a problem?

163
00:10:56,996 --> 00:11:00,006
Artie's a friend of mine, you know?
I like to throw him some business.

164
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:02,846
Talk to you a minute?

165
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,447
Visited with John.

166
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:10,287
He said to tell you
he appreciates the recent headlines.

167
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,157
Rusty.

168
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:15,027
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

169
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:17,527
I turned him down
on that.

170
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,227
Madonn', you're
a cautious man.

171
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,867
You know, some people might feel
a little offended.

172
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:26,197
Me-- my heart
is an open book.

173
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:31,578
Anyway, Rusty's gone

174
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:33,578
and we'll chalk it up
to the headless horseman.

175
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:35,618
Giovanni.

176
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:42,118
Bravo!

177
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:06,649
Martina was just
tellin' me

178
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,679
that in Montenegro
I'd be the tallest guy.

179
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,579
Another fun fact
from the Balkans.

180
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:12,719
Ben, are you up
for dessert?

181
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,479
No, I'm all set here.
Thanks.

182
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,489
Martina, sweetheart,

183
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,650
can I talk to you
for a second?

184
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,460
What is it, Artie?

185
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,490
You're looking at me
very serious.

186
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,500
You remember I had
that friend in Manhattan

187
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,730
that was gonna help speed you through
the green card process?

188
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,070
Apparently,
it's not happening.

189
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,680
- Why?
- Too much on his plate, he said.

190
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,250
I guess you're just gonna
have to do it yourself. I'm sorry.

191
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,550
All those forms.
Shit me.

192
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:45,091
I wish I could help you,
but really,

193
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:47,951
it's a small inconvenience compared
to living in freedom, right?

194
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:49,891
Yes, I know this.

195
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,731
Get him another 'buca.

196
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:05,231
Hey, Tony.

197
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:23,162
You could fuck her,
you know?

198
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:24,662
Well...

199
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:26,262
I'm not 100%
in that department,

200
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:29,492
but I'm startin'
to feel the old pressure.

201
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:33,203
It's funny,
'cause guys like me, we come here,

202
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:35,243
we get drunk
and stare.

203
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:38,173
Best-case scenario, we go
in the back room, we get a lap dance

204
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,783
a dry hump and pfft--
blow in our pants.

205
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,643
Listen, you wanna fuck her so bad,
I'm sure it could be worked out.

206
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,753
Nah, I couldn't.

207
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,913
But you...

208
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,023
Well, what do you
want me to say?

209
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:56,463
Nothing.
It's just a fact.

210
00:13:56,624 --> 00:13:58,824
If I knew you were gonna be
in such a pissy mood--

211
00:14:03,464 --> 00:14:06,604
Gabriella Dante and Rosalie Aprile
came in for lunch yesterday.

212
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,474
So what, you wanna fuck
one of them now?

213
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:10,804
No.

214
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:13,544
Gab said you all went and had a meal
at Da Giovanni on Sunday.

215
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:19,484
Well, I was gonna
tell you.

216
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:24,054
It was Phil's grandson's confirmation.
It's a pain in the ass.

217
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:25,785
What are you gonna do?
You gotta eat.

218
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:28,325
It's nothing' special,
believe me.

219
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:32,665
Actually, Carm got a little sick after.
Too much oil, she thought.

220
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,535
Gab said
I should check it out,

221
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:36,065
like I could learn
something.

222
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:37,935
Well, she runs her mouth,
that one.

223
00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:40,405
Fuck her.

224
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:43,515
Carm got sick.
Nice touch.

225
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,445
It was a business
obligation, Artie.

226
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:48,915
Uh-oh. Last time I heard that,
I had to call the fire department.

227
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,116
Well, maybe you need another fresh start
to fuck up.

228
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,956
I should go.

229
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:58,116
- Oh, come on, come on.
- No.

230
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,226
- I'm sorry. Have another one, come on.
- Forget it.

231
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:02,796
I know where
your heart is.

232
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:04,996
I gotta plan
the menu for tomorrow.

233
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:13,336
Fasanella,
my old man's a meat guy.

234
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,307
He said that the restaurant business
was like keeping an elephant.

235
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:19,887
It costs a fortune and sooner or later
it shits on your head.

236
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,447
I miss him.

237
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:26,987
Hector had to trim
three inches off the fiorentinas.

238
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:29,557
Great. We can't even get
the good meat anymore.

239
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:32,217
Fucking Western Beef
is leaving us for dead.

240
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:36,487
I wanted you to call
their guy, but you were on the floor

241
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:38,398
talking to the Cohens'
mother-in-law.

242
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:40,968
You can't deal with the Western Beef
guy yourself,

243
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,038
my blushing flower?

244
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,148
It's not
the same from me.

245
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:48,148
And Arthur,

246
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:50,248
the chatting

247
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,408
with the guests...

248
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:53,948
Again, that's it.

249
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,718
It's not Hector or the meat
or these assholes

250
00:15:56,878 --> 00:16:00,088
that are always looking
for the next hot thing. It's me.

251
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:03,158
Limit it to a quick
visit at coffee.

252
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:06,129
People wanna talk
to each other, not you.

253
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:09,269
Really? You know better
than New Jersey Zagat--

254
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:12,669
"Arthur Bucco,
warm and convivial host"?

255
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,150
Yeah, we're here
right now.

256
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,700
Sure, the broad strokes.
Perfect.

257
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,770
Kingsley's agent says
we grab lunch tomorrow, poolside.

258
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,030
- That guy, Jay?
- Yeah, I got him out of some trouble

259
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,530
on a party yacht
down in the Keys.

260
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,470
Ben Kingsley, can he do
a New Jersey accent?

261
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,740
Welcome
to the Viceroy.

262
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,240
I usually send
the bags up, hit the bar,

263
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,211
decompress a little,
unless you're against it.

264
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:57,081
- What are you talking about?
- You're in AA.

265
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:59,781
You gave the stewardess an earful
when she put down the champagne.

266
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:02,051
I just don't wanna make you feel
uncomfortable.

267
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:06,891
Relax.
I can deal with it.

268
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:08,791
Be careful
with this wine,

269
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:11,861
because the way
you two are looking at each other,

270
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,931
pretty soon
we're gonna have to...

271
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:17,801
put a high chair
right here.

272
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,172
Did you clip the daily-special cards
to all the menus?

273
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,512
Hey, Artie,

274
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:34,452
come here.

275
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:37,152
You ready to order?

276
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:38,852
Why you kicking
her ass like that?

277
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:41,502
If you're referring
to the fact that she's my employee

278
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:44,323
and I'm telling her what to do, last
time I checked, that's the way it works.

279
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:47,193
She thinks you want her to cry.
I said not true.

280
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:48,863
She told you that?

281
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,833
'Cause you two
talk all the time.

282
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:53,443
- Yeah. So what?
- So, maybe you should hire her.

283
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:54,973
I know
how to treat people.

284
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:58,583
- You're a people person, obviously.
- I am.

285
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,913
And when they're good to me,
they get treats.

286
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:04,053
And when they're not,
well, I got this severance thing I do.

287
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,193
It's a complete break,
actually.

288
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,494
I get it.

289
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:13,534
See, 'cause you talked around that
threat so much, I almost missed it.

290
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:15,134
Sorry to interrupt
you guys,

291
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,594
but, Arthur, you have
to plate the salmon.

292
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:22,234
Arthur, the kid
is a hood, okay?

293
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,204
If he feels protective
of his girlfriend,

294
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:25,864
you should just
leave it alone.

295
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,804
She's a slow learner.

296
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:30,344
She's a nice girl,
and as predicted,

297
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:31,844
the customers love her

298
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,285
with her little stories
from the old country.

299
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:36,015
You are just
picking on her.

300
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:38,715
It's disgusting.
He's a married man.

301
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:55,505
So it's 500 for the hour,
300 for half.

302
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,196
And if you wanna keep
skiing, that's extra.

303
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:01,236
All right, Eden,
how's about 400 for 40

304
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:05,146
and four more lines
and then we'll take it from there?

305
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:07,656
That'll work.

306
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:20,266
Fuckin'-a.

307
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,926
Those are
some amazing tits.

308
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:25,167
Thank you, sweetie.

309
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:32,807
Carlo's running late.
Route 23, they think there's a sniper.

310
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,917
Listen,
the other night--

311
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,817
it's this place.
You know, the rope's

312
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,477
a little tight
at my collar.

313
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:45,627
Down 40%
from last year.

314
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:49,888
- You need a little help?
- From you? God no.

315
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:51,758
Oh, there's the gratitude
I was looking for.

316
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:55,068
No, I mean I'm not
at that point, thank God.

317
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,328
But thank you.

318
00:19:57,498 --> 00:19:59,338
Well, listen, the other day
I was driving along

319
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:01,838
and I was thinking
about your little problem.

320
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:04,238
How about a little promotion?
A coupon, two-for-one?

321
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:06,818
Two-fers, wow.

322
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:09,578
You mean, like you get
a free spaghetti and meatballs

323
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:12,018
if you bring another cheap gomer
douchebag in here?

324
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,919
How about an early-bird special?
Salad wagon?

325
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,689
This is a fine dining establishment.
I'll give it back to the bank

326
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,389
before I turn it
into a fucking IHOP.

327
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:21,759
Just send the waiter
over here.

328
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,129
You wanna help me so badly?
Try paying your tab.

329
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,739
- Excuse me?
- That little roast

330
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,739
you and the waste management people
threw for Dick Barone when he got sick--

331
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:31,839
40 fucking garbagemen
from around the country.

332
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,979
Of course you paid
Pat Cooper.

333
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:36,609
You paid
the entertainment.

334
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,551
Afternoon. We're looking
for Arthur Bucco.

335
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,421
- That's me.
- Dave Kloski. This is Jim Hollings.

336
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,531
American Express?
Funny, I had you two for cops.

337
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:30,432
In a past life.
Actually we're here to investigate

338
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:33,762
some recent irregularities in charge
activity here at Nuevo Vesuvio.

339
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:35,572
"Nuovo."
lrregularities?

340
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:38,502
Well, there is credit card fraud
going on in this restaurant.

341
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,412
- That's impossible.
- Based on cardholder disputes,

342
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:44,282
we show nine hits in this locus
that precede fraudulent activity.

343
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:46,472
- What does that mean?
- People's card numbers were copied

344
00:21:46,642 --> 00:21:49,422
and those numbers were used to rack up
thousands of dollars in phony charges.

345
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:52,282
Wait, you think I'm ripping off
my own customers? That's insane.

346
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:54,483
Were these meals
actually served?

347
00:21:57,223 --> 00:21:58,663
Shit.

348
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:01,323
Councilman Carillo?
That was just two weeks ago.

349
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:02,903
So you understand
we have to suspend

350
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:05,203
the use of our cards here
pending an investigation.

351
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:07,203
Suspend?
You're cutting me off?

352
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:08,773
What's going on?

353
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:11,033
They're from Amex.
No more charges.

354
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:14,473
- What?!
- Someone's stealing!

355
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,843
Guys, this is like 30%
of my business here

356
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,614
and I can't fucking
spare it right now!

357
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:21,654
Artie, please don't curse.
The minute you use profanity,

358
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:24,584
you give them the high moral ground
to do whatever they please.

359
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,384
We need copies
of your reservations

360
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,034
and a list of anyone who has access
to customer plastic.

361
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:36,334
I'm just asking, Jay.

362
00:22:36,494 --> 00:22:38,704
Well, tell me again.

363
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:41,434
Why am I meeting
with these chaps?

364
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:46,235
Oh! Oh, bollocks, Jay.
Uh-- bollocks!

365
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,755
Oh, please.

366
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:58,215
Anyway, we appreciate
that your time

367
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:00,265
is less than limited,
so I'll cut to the chase.

368
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:04,335
Log line-- "The Ring" meets
"The Godfather."

369
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:07,435
Wiseguy-- murdered,
I guess you could say--

370
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,796
seeks revenge on the man
who ordered it.

371
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:11,306
You would play that man.

372
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:13,206
Which man?

373
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:15,206
Who are we kidding here?

374
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,846
You're Ben Kingsley.
You'd play the boss.

375
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:21,386
I heard this idea--
I call Jay and I say,

376
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:23,816
"Sir Ben Kingsley,
no one else."

377
00:23:23,976 --> 00:23:27,656
Well, you know, as ever,
it's script-dependent.

378
00:23:29,846 --> 00:23:32,296
Oh, we got a sensational
writer-- JT Dolan.

379
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:34,797
I'm embarrassed.
I haven't heard of him.

380
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:37,837
He's from TV--
"Nash Bridges," "Hooperman,"

381
00:23:37,987 --> 00:23:40,297
and "Law & Order,
the SUV."

382
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:42,137
So there's a script?

383
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,967
We wanted to surmise
your interest

384
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:46,477
and then tailor the part
to your specificities.

385
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,837
No one plays a tough,
ruthless, hardhearted prick like you do.

386
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:52,817
You got it down,
trust me.

387
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:54,677
I take that
as quite a compliment.

388
00:23:54,837 --> 00:23:57,117
Sure.
"Sexy Beast"?

389
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:59,448
Now, we do have
a shortlist of directors.

390
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:01,688
We could go A-list
down the horror genre--

391
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:03,488
Ridley, Tobe Hooper.

392
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:07,258
Or we could try to find
the next James Wan. He did "Saw."

393
00:24:07,418 --> 00:24:09,198
Did you see that?
Fuckin' brutal.

394
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:11,698
Betty?

395
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:15,308
It's Ben.
How are you?

396
00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:17,538
What on earth
are you doing out here?

397
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:19,608
Oh, I don't know.

398
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,049
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Miss Lauren Bacall.

399
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:28,089
Lauren, this is Carmine Tazzi
and Christopher...

400
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:30,019
...Moltisanti.
Huge fan.

401
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,919
- Thank you.
- "Lupertazzi."

402
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,889
You were great
in "The Haves and Have-Nots."

403
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:36,859
Oh yes, dear Howard Hawks.
Thank you.

404
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,969
I'm a presenter
at one of these award shows--

405
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,969
ShoWest,
some bullshit.

406
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:45,039
Oh, I did one of those years ago,
after "Death and the Maiden, "I think.

407
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:47,329
They do take good care
of you, though.

408
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,170
I have shiatsu
in about 10 minutes.

409
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,250
- Wow.
- But let's catch up.

410
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,880
Absolutely.
Great to see you.

411
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,640
- Thank you.
- As always.

412
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,380
- So nice meeting both of you.
- Enjoy your success.

413
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,760
Uh, that reminds me,
I have a scheduling problem.

414
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
This meeting was last minute
and I'm supposed to be

415
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,290
at the Luxury Lounge
at 2:00.

416
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:14,491
Yeah, but we haven't even gotten
to the particulars yet.

417
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:16,931
We'll walk with you.

418
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,971
I think this is
going very well.

419
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:23,801
You okay? You seem
a bit distracted.

420
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:27,241
It's fucking Sir Ben Kingsley is all.
Lauren Bacall.

421
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:36,251
- Yo.
- Murmur, I'm chipping here major.

422
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:37,952
Get on a plane.

423
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:40,892
Sir Ben Kingsley
and... guests.

424
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:43,362
Janine will
take you around.

425
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:47,902
Hi, Janine.
Ben Kingsley.

426
00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:49,832
We're offering
the full services

427
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:52,132
of the spa today,
including massage.

428
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:56,072
Listen, we're thinking about Sam
Rockwell for the younger guy.

429
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:57,902
- ls that a good chemistry for you?
- Hmm.

430
00:25:58,072 --> 00:25:59,982
May I offer you
champagne?

431
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:02,152
Maybe later.

432
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:14,733
This is Yael from Cosabella Lingerie.
Sir Ben Kingsley.

433
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:16,363
I'll take an extra large
in these.

434
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:21,673
For a man, White & Warm is giving
this cashmere throw,

435
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:25,133
great for the airplane,
and here, one for the car.

436
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,173
- Thanks, Yael.
- They charge this shit to the room?

437
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:30,744
- Hmm?
- This is Carla from Oris.

438
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:33,144
Men's and women's,
sporty and dressy.

439
00:26:33,304 --> 00:26:36,414
A lot of guys are going
with the classic stainless chrono.

440
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:39,954
Oh, my godson would love that.
He's having his birthday in three weeks.

441
00:26:40,114 --> 00:26:43,584
- But for me...
- This is elegant.

442
00:26:43,754 --> 00:26:45,494
- Really is.
- Take the chrono too?

443
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:48,754
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

444
00:26:54,065 --> 00:26:55,875
ls all
this shit free?

445
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:58,335
I'm gettin' that.

446
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:05,515
"True Crime,
New York City."

447
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,745
Pam has
a huge crush on you.

448
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:15,515
Thanks, Pam.

449
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:17,956
So Kingsley,
they do this all the time?

450
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:20,096
- It's Sir Ben, actually.
- Sorry.

451
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:23,396
A couple of times a year,
mainly clustered around award seasons.

452
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:25,536
How is that even
fuckin' possible?

453
00:27:25,696 --> 00:27:27,506
I know.
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

454
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,696
- I know I have one of these.
- Shelly from iRiver.

455
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,936
I don't know
if you have this one.

456
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:33,736
It's got 20 gigs of space
in a tiny package.

457
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:37,146
That's 80 hours of video
or 600 hours of music.

458
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:39,406
Shelly, can I get
one of these?

459
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:42,486
- Here you go, Sir Ben.
- Thank you, Shelly.

460
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:46,787
Sir Ben, you've got
a meeting with Doug in 10, so...

461
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:48,927
Hey, guys,

462
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:50,657
looks like I ate up
all our time here.

463
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:52,557
What do you say
we catch up in New York?

464
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:54,797
You got a lot
of tables left.

465
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:56,797
We're gonna make
that work, Sir Ben.

466
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:58,597
They're giving away
a Caddy over there!

467
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:01,237
Well, no, it's just a test-drive
for a couple of weeks.

468
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:04,567
You know, my family
gave me some sunglasses for Christmas

469
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:07,647
so why don't you
have these?

470
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,178
I bet they'll look
great on you, Chris.

471
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:10,548
I don't know.
You think?

472
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,918
Sir Ben, can we get
a shot?

473
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:24,928
The thing, the Arabs.

474
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:27,498
Chris wanted me
to take care of you while he's away.

475
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:29,538
Cecil B DeMoltisanti
there.

476
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,369
- This is one week?
- Yeah, Murmur caught some big ones.

477
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:37,209
You're going to see your girlfriend
over at Vesuvio?

478
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:38,809
Yeah.

479
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,809
All right.

480
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,919
Uh...

481
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:46,619
Give this to Artie.
Put it on my tab.

482
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,189
We're not here
to accuse anybody,

483
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:54,699
'cause Mainie and I
like to think of you all as family.

484
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:56,799
And this is
very serious.

485
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,960
It is, but know
that as family

486
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,530
you'll be treated
with respect

487
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,800
and, if need be,
forgiveness.

488
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,310
I could bury my cock in those fucking titties.

489
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,580
Hector,
and you, mustache...

490
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,510
You got
something to say?

491
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,520
We have no intention of pressing
charges. It's just gotta stop.

492
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,280
That's all we want.
Any questions?

493
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:26,951
Understand this is not
about a 42-oz. jar of Moroccan olives

494
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:29,031
or a couple of rolls
of toilet paper here.

495
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:31,221
- This is our livelihoods.
- Are you looking at me?

496
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:33,231
Nobody's looking
at anybody.

497
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:36,001
- I didn't take the toilet paper.
- But the olives?

498
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:38,471
I'm joking here.

499
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:41,701
I'm just saying
if you don't come clean to us,

500
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:43,541
those investigators,

501
00:29:43,701 --> 00:29:45,581
well, they just might
question the honesty

502
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,722
of somebody
that wears a coat

503
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:50,112
- pulled from the lost-and-found.
- Fuck this!

504
00:29:50,282 --> 00:29:51,652
- No, fuck you!
- Arthur...

505
00:29:51,812 --> 00:29:53,652
I don't know which one of
you pieces of shit did this,

506
00:29:53,812 --> 00:29:55,922
- but I've been good to you!
- ...getting us nowhere.

507
00:29:56,082 --> 00:29:57,932
And you pay me back
with nonstop ass-rape!

508
00:29:58,082 --> 00:29:59,862
Well fuck all a' you!

509
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,913
You know what?
Just forget it.

510
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:17,883
I-- I'm so sorry,
everybody.

511
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:22,183
Um, could you just get this cleaned up
so we can open? Thanks.

512
00:30:23,713 --> 00:30:25,423
No no. It's very bad.

513
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,563
They had
the credit card police.

514
00:30:27,713 --> 00:30:28,883
Those companies
are huge.

515
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:31,393
They come on tough,
but in the end, they gotta eat it.

516
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:33,863
Okay.

517
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:44,234
Everything okay
in there?

518
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:47,714
For once I'd like to eat
without you getting a call from work.

519
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:52,654
Ah.

520
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:02,354
God damn it.

521
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:19,015
Motherfucker.

522
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:20,645
Arthur!

523
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:23,475
What do you want, a repeat performance
of the Fourth of July?

524
00:31:23,645 --> 00:31:25,215
That cop told you,

525
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:27,685
no firing guns in
the borough limits.

526
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,726
I brought those
arugula seeds

527
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:31,826
all the way back from Italy
in my shaving kit.

528
00:31:35,316 --> 00:31:38,266
Eden, get the fuck
out of there!

529
00:31:38,426 --> 00:31:42,336
- Fuck off.
- I wasn't going through your purse!

530
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:43,976
I was movin' it
and it fell.

531
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:46,636
Go fuck yourself,
you guinea bastard!

532
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,307
Good afternoon,
Mr. Moltisanti.

533
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:55,387
Room 812, please.

534
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:04,057
- Yes.
- Hey, Sir Kingsley.

535
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:06,597
It's Chris Moltisanti
from yesterday?

536
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,257
I spoke with Jay

537
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:10,697
and he's working on that
New York meeting right now.

538
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:13,837
Fine, but that's not
what I'm calling about, though.

539
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:16,337
That Luxury Lounge thing,
can you get me in there?

540
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:19,168
I don't know. My publicist
handles all that stuff.

541
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,678
- So, can you call 'em?
- I don't know

542
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:24,718
how my publicist
can help you, you know?

543
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:26,548
All right.

544
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:29,708
Yeah, in the city then.
My partner went back.

545
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:31,588
Friend of his died
recently. Guy's wife

546
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:33,818
is having a breakdown.
He'll call you.

547
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:43,538
That's security, Eden!
They're gonna blow that door open!

548
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:45,729
Fuck you!

549
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:52,969
- Fuck.
- I know, I gotta get it together.

550
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:56,309
Black truffle doesn't have the intensity
of white so you gotta use more.

551
00:32:56,469 --> 00:32:59,179
I'll be at my investing club
at the Learning Annex with my cell

552
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:02,719
if you have to call,
but try not to.

553
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:05,479
Sandy,
about the meeting...

554
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:07,349
- Oh, everybody knows you're upset.
- I know.

555
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,000
But Alonzo's coat,
you told me that in confidence.

556
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,490
I thought you
needed to know.

557
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,290
I also think-- well,
it's probably nothing,

558
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,870
but yesterday Martina
was showing off these Caovilla sandals.

559
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,200
I know she makes
more than me,

560
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,540
but they cost
like $600.

561
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,310
You should get back
to the coatroom.

562
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,920
Hold on a second.
I wanna ask you something.

563
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:40,291
- I knew it.
- I'm sorry. I'll pay you back.

564
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,431
- How could you do this to me?
- You were so mean to me.

565
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:46,461
Like helping you find the apartment?
Teaching you to drive?

566
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:49,691
As soon as you found out I wasn't going
to fuck you, you started picking on me.

567
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,361
I wanna fuck you? You certainly have
a high opinion of yourself.

568
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,701
You stare at me
like food.

569
00:33:55,862 --> 00:33:58,042
Well I never
fuck you.

570
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,152
- I go to Benny and we laugh at you...
- Benny.

571
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,972
...when I fuck him
in the pile of money

572
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:04,082
that we take from
your stupid customers.

573
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,552
You're fired.

574
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,552
Oh yeah?
Oh, who's laughing now?

575
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:11,452
What do you think? I can't press charges
'cause of my friendship with Tony?!

576
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:13,152
Three months
you worked here!

577
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:14,852
You think that doesn't go
on your permanent record?!

578
00:34:15,022 --> 00:34:17,792
We lead the world
in computerized data collection!

579
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,753
Artie, you know
what time it is?

580
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:46,363
- We need to talk.
- Now?

581
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:48,264
My wife is pregnant.
She needs to sleep.

582
00:34:48,424 --> 00:34:50,664
Martina told me about your little
credit card business.

583
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:52,594
Step outside, Ben.

584
00:34:54,164 --> 00:34:57,074
I'll be outside
a minute, honey.

585
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:00,814
Look.

586
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:03,904
You're upset,
all right?

587
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:06,414
But it's not my fault
that little trick got greedy.

588
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,144
Oh, so she's
a little trick, huh?

589
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:10,444
I was gonna cut you in,
but now you're acting stupid.

590
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:13,024
Regular people are
all fucking stupid.

591
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,295
You want some more?!

592
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,905
Piece of dogshit!
Little, crazy,

593
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:34,375
motherfucking
meatball dogshit!

594
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:49,556
Yeah, I'm stupid.

595
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:06,947
Ho! There he is.

596
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:08,977
How you doing?

597
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:12,047
- Great, thanks.
- This is Murmur.

598
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:16,187
- You heading to the pool?
- Massage.

599
00:36:16,347 --> 00:36:18,187
Oh.

600
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:20,987
Listen. You get a chance to call about
that Luxury Lounge for me?

601
00:36:21,147 --> 00:36:23,097
Well, it's like
I explained...

602
00:36:24,357 --> 00:36:26,267
there's nothing very much
I can do about it.

603
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:29,168
- They decide whom they give it to.
- Very important people,

604
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:32,138
like you, right? 'Cause you're a very
important person.

605
00:36:32,298 --> 00:36:34,238
To them, I guess.

606
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:39,608
Murmur's an interesting name.
What's the genesis?

607
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:43,118
I had a heart murmur
when I was a kid.

608
00:36:43,278 --> 00:36:45,278
They just keep
handing stuff out, huh?

609
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:47,288
The coolest shit
in the world

610
00:36:47,448 --> 00:36:49,218
to the people
who need it the least.

611
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,929
Look. I think you've
misunderstood something.

612
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:02,769
I give most
of that stuff away

613
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,639
to homeless shelters,
the rest I give to charity auctions.

614
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:08,609
- Not to your godson?
- I agree with you,

615
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,039
the whole thing's obscene,
and it's nothing

616
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,109
compared to the situation
at award shows.

617
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:16,549
Presenters get about $30,000 worth of
merchandise

618
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,350
in those baskets.

619
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,180
That's a year's salary
for some people.

620
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,050
Go figure.

621
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,660
Hopefully we can spread
some of that lolly around.

622
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,090
We'll get you
that script.

623
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,770
Hell of a tub here, guys.

624
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,710
Sea, sun. I'm gonna
make it my second home.

625
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:46,081
- Anybody else hungry? Huh?
- We'll get lunch started.

626
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:48,811
- Artie, another margarita?
- I could say no, but I won't.

627
00:38:08,492 --> 00:38:10,412
You lost
your fucking mind?

628
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:13,342
The shit you're in with that kid,
which you brought on yourself.

629
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:15,542
Brought on myself?
Oh, I suppose you let

630
00:38:15,702 --> 00:38:18,242
a certain element into your world,
you're asking for it.

631
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:20,782
- Oh!
- Jesus fucking Christ, Tony,

632
00:38:20,942 --> 00:38:22,322
how could you pull
that scam at my place?

633
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:25,112
Come on, you know I never would've
let that happen if I'd known.

634
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:27,522
You're innocent, I get it.
I'm just another victim

635
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:29,952
- of Benny Fazio, criminal mastermind.
- That's right.

636
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:32,962
And once you found out,
instead of putting him in the E. R.,

637
00:38:33,123 --> 00:38:35,503
you should've come to me.
He says he's gonna kill you, Artie.

638
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:38,163
I can't take
American Express now, Ton'.

639
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:41,533
You know what that means? I have
to start with the fucking two-fers.

640
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:44,613
My accountant insisted.
Are you happy?

641
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:46,403
Life's not fair.
Right, I know.

642
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:48,983
But somehow I believed my dad's crap
about honest work.

643
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:52,383
He used to say
to me, "You'll see.

644
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:54,713
Pays off in the end."

645
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:56,353
What a joke.

646
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:05,694
I hate to see you like this,
you know that.

647
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:08,594
'Cause you start
thinking crazy shit.

648
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:12,874
Who's hungry?

649
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:24,515
- Yeah?
- Ben Kingsley passed.

650
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:26,485
Fuck.

651
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:29,585
You know, I tried
to be his friend,

652
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:31,695
I sent a muffin basket
with the script,

653
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:33,695
I tried everything.

654
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,965
You can kill me after
if you want,

655
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:44,605
- but he's a fucking dead man.
- Calm down, Ben.

656
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:47,865
He came to my house,
Tony, where my wife was watching TV.

657
00:39:48,036 --> 00:39:51,066
My wife, who's carrying
my unborn son.

658
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:53,576
I'm gonna take him to
that warehouse in Paterson

659
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:55,916
- and drive fucking...
- Nails into his balls. I know.

660
00:39:56,076 --> 00:39:58,486
I heard you
the first time.

661
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:06,066
- You're having a son, huh?
- They showed us his cannoli

662
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:09,596
on the ultrasound
like a month ago.

663
00:40:09,756 --> 00:40:12,236
That's beautiful.

664
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:16,607
Oh, congratulations.

665
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:18,737
Thank you.

666
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:20,897
I'm gonna tell you
this once--

667
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:23,377
it's over.
You drop it.

668
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:27,037
And frankly you should be very happy
I'm not gonna tax you.

669
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:30,187
I mean beside the fact you know
I grew up with the man,

670
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,187
you don't shit
where you eat.

671
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,547
And you really don't shit
where I eat.

672
00:40:34,717 --> 00:40:37,287
I know, and I'm sorry
about that, but--

673
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:39,428
And your parents'
anniversary party?

674
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:41,728
It's not going to be at Da Giovanni's.
It's gonna be at Vesuvio.

675
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:44,598
What? Tony,
look at my face.

676
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:47,498
He's going to apologize
to you, and give you a rate.

677
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:52,838
He's hurtin' too.
And it's the least you can do.

678
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:59,548
Well Ms. Bacall, your limo
is second in line there.

679
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,118
Oh, well I can take it
from here.

680
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:04,279
- You sure?
- Yeah, thank you so much.

681
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:06,019
- Okay, you're welcome.
- Good night.

682
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:07,819
Night.

683
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:13,729
- Get the fuck away from me!
- What are you doing?!

684
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,399
Somebody help us!

685
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,699
Those guys!

686
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,039
Ms. Bacall,
don't move.

687
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,479
Yes, an ambulance
by Robinsons-May.

688
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,590
Oh Jesus,
my fucking arm.

689
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,490
- Hmm?
- No.

690
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,660
There's a line outside.

691
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,530
Okay, push the scampi. Wholesaler
says they gotta get eaten tonight.

692
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:53,300
And don't spread out too much. We still
got the Fazio party in the banquet room.

693
00:41:56,501 --> 00:41:58,531
Okay, Sandy.
Open the door.

694
00:42:02,441 --> 00:42:05,141
Hello. Welcome.

695
00:42:05,311 --> 00:42:07,551
Do you have
low-salt selections?

696
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:12,751
Ahem--

697
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:17,751
Ma, Pop,
order whatever you want.

698
00:42:17,922 --> 00:42:20,262
I'm having
that loin of veal.

699
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:22,602
That's
the other place, Ma.

700
00:42:28,232 --> 00:42:29,642
This the young couple?

701
00:42:29,802 --> 00:42:31,572
Yes, my mom and dad.

702
00:42:31,732 --> 00:42:33,112
Cent'anni!

703
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:36,152
- Hundred years!
- Cent'anni!

704
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:41,222
Well, I hope you all enjoy.
You're all set for wine, cocktails?

705
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,893
- Nothing?
- Fine, thanks.

706
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:50,123
Benny, can I get
you a Martina?

707
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:51,863
- Excuse me?
- A Martina.

708
00:42:52,023 --> 00:42:54,693
It's like a Martini,
but it's from Albania.

709
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,203
Hmm. I never heard
of it.

710
00:42:56,363 --> 00:42:58,773
Well, apparently
they go down real easy.

711
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:00,603
Right, Ben?

712
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:05,413
We're gonna look
at the menu.

713
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:08,684
Good enough.

714
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:15,314
- You order for me.
- Fine. The monkfish.

715
00:43:15,484 --> 00:43:17,854
There's such
a strange consistency.

716
00:43:28,464 --> 00:43:30,734
- Ow!
- In front of my wife?!

717
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:32,875
Fuck!

718
00:43:33,035 --> 00:43:34,805
Jesus! Fuck, my hand!

719
00:43:34,965 --> 00:43:37,815
Shit! Oh God!
Oh fuck!

720
00:43:39,475 --> 00:43:41,475
Fuck! My hand!

721
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:46,785
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

722
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:51,055
Oh my God, Arthur!
Somebody call 911 please!

723
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,356
Look at this.

724
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:32,167
I had no idea.
I'd have booked another flight.

725
00:44:32,327 --> 00:44:34,327
Fuck.

726
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:42,407
Where is everybody?

727
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:44,247
My father-in-law
don't wanna come.

728
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:46,247
Him and Carm
aren't speaking.

729
00:44:46,408 --> 00:44:49,758
- How's the meathook?
- Had to be my fuckin' saute hand, huh?

730
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:51,948
Why, you got an okay
crowd here today.

731
00:44:52,118 --> 00:44:54,188
Sunday pasta's
the last thing to go.

732
00:44:54,348 --> 00:44:56,348
The place is on life-support
ever since word got out

733
00:44:56,518 --> 00:44:58,318
to the regulars
about their credit cards.

734
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:00,858
And my staff is pissed off
about Martina leaving.

735
00:45:01,028 --> 00:45:03,668
Benny did a real
number here, Tony.

736
00:45:03,828 --> 00:45:06,928
Who knows?
Maybe it's cursed. The fire, then this.

737
00:45:07,098 --> 00:45:08,578
Will you stop talkin'
like an old lady?

738
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:10,968
- Artie.
- No go, huh?

739
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:13,669
He's just
being dramatic.

740
00:45:14,939 --> 00:45:16,539
- How are you, sweetie?
- Better.

741
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:19,279
And Carm,
the flowers...

742
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,229
Tonight, only the best

743
00:45:24,379 --> 00:45:25,919
for the best people.

744
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:35,129
Hmm, that's excellent.

745
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,440
Hey, be careful you two,

746
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,380
because the way
you two are looking at each other,

747
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,520
pretty soon we'll have
to put a high chair over here.

748
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,380
Like the icing on a cake, okay?
Capisce?

749
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,580
Keep your thumbs
out of the food.

750
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,100
We gotta talk
about your problem.

751
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:03,961
Oh, great.
Another idea.

752
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:06,191
How 'bout a strolling accordionist?

753
00:46:08,961 --> 00:46:11,031
I'm gonna give you the name
of a good psychiatrist.

754
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,511
She's Italian.
You'll like her.

755
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:17,271
You know what?
You go about in pity for yourself.

756
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,881
- I go about in pity for myself?
- Yeah.

757
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:21,981
I gotta tell you,
Bodhisattva,

758
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:24,091
that is fucking
priceless.

759
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:26,691
Use the other door.

760
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:29,052
You bitch and you moan
and you blame

761
00:46:29,212 --> 00:46:31,192
everybody else
for your problems,

762
00:46:31,352 --> 00:46:35,322
instead of maybe... not letting
the Mexicans do all the cooking for you

763
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,632
or, I don't know, changing the menu
or changing the decor.

764
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,902
I guess because you know how to eat,
you know how to run a restaurant.

765
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:46,702
On one of the bleakest
nights of my life,

766
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:51,542
after the shit with my
mother and that fuckin' storm outside,

767
00:46:51,703 --> 00:46:54,273
I came here
to this place.

768
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:57,183
I sat out there
with Carm and my two kids

769
00:46:57,343 --> 00:46:59,753
and we ate and we drank
and we were so happy to be here,

770
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:02,023
more than any other
place in the world.

771
00:47:02,183 --> 00:47:04,823
And you know I'm gonna
eat here until I fall off the chair.

772
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:09,523
But in business,
sometimes shit happens.

773
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:12,063
The playing field
changes, whatever.

774
00:47:12,223 --> 00:47:15,363
And you gotta do whatever you gotta do
to keep your dick up.

775
00:47:18,234 --> 00:47:21,014
If you hate it here so much,
why don't you go to Da Giovanni?

776
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:23,744
See if he'll cook you that bland shit
for your shot-up pancreas.

777
00:47:29,344 --> 00:47:31,084
I'll tell you one thing

778
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:33,094
and this is very hard--

779
00:47:33,244 --> 00:47:34,954
nobody wants
to hear you talk.

780
00:47:35,114 --> 00:47:38,824
They're trying to eat out there
and you come along

781
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,764
with your corny jokes
and your stupid stories.

782
00:47:43,355 --> 00:47:45,605
Just stay
in the kitchen.

783
00:47:45,765 --> 00:47:48,105
That'd be a start.

784
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:04,085
Hey.

785
00:48:07,356 --> 00:48:09,986
You wouldn't believe
what these people in the business get,

786
00:48:10,156 --> 00:48:12,366
totally fuckin'
absolutely gratis.

787
00:48:12,526 --> 00:48:14,506
Yeah, I hear the streets
are paved with hand jobs.

788
00:48:14,656 --> 00:48:18,006
Right. I scored
some major swag.

789
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:20,306
A little taste for you.

790
00:48:22,196 --> 00:48:24,376
Trip to Australia,
first-class vouchers,

791
00:48:24,536 --> 00:48:26,246
some kind of
golf resort.

792
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:28,776
Looks like Sarasota.

793
00:48:28,936 --> 00:48:32,446
After what,
a 20-hour flight? No.

794
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:50,867
That's for a pocket dog.

795
00:48:56,038 --> 00:48:57,678
How'd it go
with the movie star?

796
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:00,788
He was all over us,
but I don't think he's right.

797
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,788
We made some great contacts.
Plus we saw Lindsay Lohan.

798
00:49:03,948 --> 00:49:05,548
Total piece of ass.

799
00:49:08,118 --> 00:49:09,958
You hear Artie
burned his hand?

800
00:49:10,118 --> 00:49:14,118
Yeah. Him and Benny.
How crazy is that?

801
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:16,128
- He okay?
- A layer of skin

802
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,028
came off his hand
like a glove.

803
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:21,298
But, they said, you know,
no scarring, no grafts.

804
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,099
- Lucky.
- Hmm.

805
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,709
Well, not for nothin'.
I couldn't help but thinkin'

806
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:31,319
if you were here
watching your crew,

807
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,319
things wouldn't have gone
the way they did.

808
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:35,389
You let me go, T.

809
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,959
I asked you. Now it's my fault Artie
and Benny got into it?

810
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:41,889
This is what I was concerned about,
Christopher, the loss of focus.

811
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:44,459
Look...

812
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:48,569
not many guys have had to make
the kind of sacrifice I did.

813
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,170
How many times you gonna play
the Adriana card?

814
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,370
Sandy just seated
a couple.

815
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,110
Kitchen's closed.

816
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,380
He said they were supposed to go
to the city but they had car trouble.

817
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,050
Hector already left
to pick up his wife.

818
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:14,561
Plus I got nothing
back here, Charm.

819
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:16,721
They already opened
the bottle.

820
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:29,341
They're gonna have to eat
what I give them.

821
00:51:22,023 --> 00:51:25,123
Arthur, a lot of people
don't like rabbit.

822
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:26,663
My grandfather's way.

823
00:51:26,824 --> 00:51:28,394
Only with ProvenÄÂ§al elements
I been thinking about.

824
00:51:28,564 --> 00:51:30,974
I thought you were taking
it to him at the home.

825
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:34,834
Okay-- out.
I wanna get outta here tonight.

826
00:52:07,235 --> 00:52:08,765
For my mom.

827
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,245
The big store on 57th Street?

828
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:15,685
If you bought this in Naples?

829
00:52:15,846 --> 00:52:18,086
The weak dollar.

830
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:25,826
Mont Blanc. Actually cheaper in the U.S.
