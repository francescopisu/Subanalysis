They only catch other birds

are most scared of falcons,

00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:40,115
to think that they're eating
in an area that's full of rats.

173
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:43,911
But East Village is full of them,
so you can't hide that.

174
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,471
HURT: Rats love fine dining too.

175
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,712
But they don't leave tips behind.

176
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:52,636
They leave excrement and disease.

177
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:56,875
No-one wants to admit that
the Big Apple has a big rat problem,

178
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:59,875
so Jeff and Junior only work at night.

179
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,908
JEFF: Trash is a big deal.

180
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:05,745
Us being sloppy humans
throwing trash out on the sidewalks,

181
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:08,709
and leaving the juices and meat juices
and chicken bones everywhere.

182
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:11,954
That's a buffet for them,
you know what I mean?

183
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:15,273
HURT: Tonight,
they're laying traps in Chinatown.

184
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:16,716
Wow!

185
00:15:16,757 --> 00:15:18,395
(WHISTLES)

186
00:15:18,437 --> 00:15:20,268
Are you OK?

187
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:23,195
Another one of these, man.

188
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:25,705
Another one of these. Wow.

189
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:29,193
How do you even
leave your restaurant like this?

190
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:31,751
Oh, man! Dude, look at this.

191
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:36,666
Look at all of this stuff!
Sushi, rice, noodles.

192
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:44,073
HURT.. Rats will eat anything, from
chop suey to the chopsticks themselves.

193
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,233
JEFF: We walk in at night
because we have keys.

194
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:48,347
We have to go
when the customers are gone.

195
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:52,675
And when the people leave the restaurant,
the rats think it's time to come out.

196
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:56,471
But we go in there later, like an hour
after they close, so they're out partying.

197
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:58,473
Uh-oh. There he is, there he is,
there he is. Right there, right there.

198
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:01,236
Right there, right there,
right there, right there. See him?

199
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:04,872
Shh! Shh! He's going down, he's going
down. Right there. Right in the hole.

200
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:07,516
Damn!

201
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:10,117
- He was drinking coffee.
- Something.

202
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:12,955
That's the last thing
that this guy needs is coffee.

203
00:16:12,997 --> 00:16:14,476
(CHUCKLES)

204
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:15,745
Unbelievable!

205
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:18,630
- That's why I don't eat takeout, man.
- Yes, you do.

206
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,156
(CHUCKLES)

207
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:22,074
Come on. Let's go to the basement, man.

208
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:25,795
Watch out, man. It's slippery.

209
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:30,872
And there's another horror
in the basement.

210
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:35,229
Yo! Look at the bugs in the ceiling!
You don't ever see that.

211
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:36,426
Right there behind the door.

212
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:39,196
- Cockroaches.
- (WHACK!)

213
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:40,750
- This is professional extermination.
- I got these bugs.

214
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:45,111
- Oh! Have you seen this basement?
- What's in there, man?

215
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:48,627
Old buildings
connected by pipes and basements

216
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:53,034
allow the rats and roaches
to scuttle through the city unseen.

217
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:55,591
It's disgusting in here. Look at the water
dripping all over the place.

218
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:58,390
We're basically
trying to be quiet to hear noises

219
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:01,190
for any, you know,
any signs of rat activities.

220
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,910
You hear that? You hear that?
The little pitter-patter?

221
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,229
- (LIGHT TAPPING)
- Little fingernails?

222
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,745
Yup. Over here.

223
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:15,636
Look at that. That goes right into the...
I can see the kitchen!

224
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,515
For Jeff and Junior
it's a lifelong fight.

225
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:24,596
It's said there's at least one rat
for every person in New York.

226
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:26,628
That's nearly nine million rats.

227
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:33,430
JEFF: As far as humans winning
the battle over rats - nowhere close.

228
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:36,389
I don't even know how you would stop it,
I really don't.

229
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:40,516
HURT: They are going to use
every contraption they can devise

230
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:42,752
in the battle with the pests.

231
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:45,755
- Well, this is a...
- I don't want to call them out, but...

232
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:48,265
- Listen to that.
- (PITTER-PATTERING)

233
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,309
All those people out there, they have
no idea what's happening down here.

234
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:53,188
(CHUCKLES) And they're
going to come eat here tomorrow.

235
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:55,387
JUNIOR: 50% off all day, huh?

236
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:56,506
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

237
00:17:56,557 --> 00:18:00,345
Yeah... (CHUCKLES) Yeah, no wonder.

238
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:12,867
24 hours later,Jeff and Junior
are back to assess the death toll.

239
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,145
Ah, dude.

240
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:19,193
The snap traps have worked.

241
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:22,675
He's cute.

242
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:24,912
And the glue mats.

243
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:27,994
This one is decomposing.

244
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:29,675
And the poison.

245
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,867
Oh, dude!

246
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,750
- Look at the size of him!
- He's dead.

247
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:38,870
Looks like he's been
fighting with something, bro.

248
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,033
Damn! Look at them teeth, bro. Whoa!

249
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:44,353
- Whoa!
- What's the weight on that?

250
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:47,355
I'm telling you, man. My arm got tired.
That's pretty... That's brutal.

251
00:18:47,397 --> 00:18:48,830
Oh, man!

252
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:54,235
This is just another night in the ongoing
battle with our eternal enemies.

253
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:58,553
JEFF: Sometimes we'll walk out
with bags of dead things

254
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,430
and I'll take a takeout bag
from the restaurant

255
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:04,787
so people would think I'm leaving
with takeout food.

256
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:24,349
HURT: And it gets worse.

257
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:28,756
There are other tiny creatures
which take advantage

258
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:30,947
of dense urban populations.

259
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:36,989
They exploit us
in much more intimate ways.

260
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:40,790
They're reaching epidemic proportions.

261
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:44,511
Not just feeding off us like rats,

262
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:47,355
but literally feeding on us.

263
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:52,626
Londoner Carol Anderson
has these unwanted house guests.

264
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:54,872
Have you got any bites on you
at the moment?

265
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,396
GIRL: You mean these?

266
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:00,072
Yeah,
the bites that you had all round here.

267
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,347
There's still little red marks from them,
aren't there?

268
00:20:04,597 --> 00:20:07,270
Where do you think they are
in your room?

269
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:09,069
BOY: Down the side of the bed.

270
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:12,951
- That's what I meant.
- And crawling up the walls.

271
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:18,510
Irritating parasites
which only come out at night.

272
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:21,792
CAROL: Right. Right. Come on, then.

273
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:24,795
In you go. Hop up.

274
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:28,068
That's it, then. Good night,
sleep tight, don't let the...?

275
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:30,631
- GIRL: Bedbugs bite.
- (LAUGHS)

276
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:31,905
Let's hope not.

277
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:47,032
Bedbugs are insect vampires attracted
to carbon dioxide, heat and body odours.

278
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:53,433
They like clean, warm houses.

279
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:06,827
Their only food is human blood.

280
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:12,746
CAROL: The sheer numbers
is quite daunting, really.

281
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:16,585
They literally were streaming up the wall,
up to the ceiling,just full of blood.

282
00:21:16,637 --> 00:21:18,593
So they'd obviously
all just been feeding.

283
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:20,946
First thing in the morning,
I woke up and looked up.

284
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:23,465
It was horrible, it really was horrible.

285
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:32,507
Carol calls in the best bedbug detector
in the business...

286
00:21:34,197 --> 00:21:37,792
...Charlie the chocolate Labrador,

287
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:40,988
ably assisted by his handler, Adam.

288
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:53,111
Right. Well, the sofa seems to be the
worst affected. Got lots of bugs in here.

289
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:57,673
Charlie's nose is 44 times
more sensitive than ours.

290
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:00,026
He can literally
sniff out the bedbugs.

291
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:01,874
Seek.

If they are present,

295
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:16,109
Good boy, Charlie.

296
00:22:16,157 --> 00:22:19,069
It's all Adam needs to know.

297
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:26,627
Bedbugs are on the increase,

298
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:29,635
hitchhiking
as we travel from city to city,

299
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:33,033
often infesting furniture
like Carol's sofa.

300
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:38,754
CAROL: I do resent them,
but I quite admire them as well.

301
00:22:38,797 --> 00:22:41,709
They're actually quite amazing,

302
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:44,317
which makes it even creepier,
you know, because...

303
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:46,427
that's what I'm up against.

304
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:52,753
But with Adam's spray and Charlie's nose,

305
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:55,869
the bugs here have met their match.

306
00:22:55,917 --> 00:23:00,308
This is one urban intruder
nobody wants to live with.

307
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:11,829
In some parts of the world,
people have learned

308
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:14,869
to put their urban invaders to good use.

309
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,952
The Moroccan city of Fez,
a bit like Dubai,

310
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:23,227
has a problem with pigeons.

311
00:23:25,277 --> 00:23:30,670
But rather than chasing them away,
the people of Fez invite them in.

312
00:23:35,637 --> 00:23:38,993
Nordine has built
a home for pigeons on his roof.

313
00:23:58,957 --> 00:24:01,551
He doesn't do this
just for the love of animals.

314
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:04,589
Pigeon droppings
are vital to a local industry.

315
00:24:07,077 --> 00:24:11,229
And Nordine's friend Tami
has come to buy some.

316
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,874
Tami works at the local tannery.

317
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:35,876
Fez is the centre
of the Moroccan leather industry.

318
00:24:41,517 --> 00:24:44,589
The leather here
is famed for its softness,

319
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:47,709
and the pigeon droppings
are a secret ingredient.

320
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,550
Wild pigeon droppings

321
00:24:57,597 --> 00:25:00,828
contain an enzyme
which eats at the protein

322
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:03,550
in the animal skin, softening it up.

323
00:25:05,277 --> 00:25:08,986
The hides are soaked
in the vats for three days,

324
00:25:09,037 --> 00:25:11,676
and Tami works them with his feet.

325
00:25:12,717 --> 00:25:16,710
This could be
the stinkiest job in the world.

326
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:30,834
For Tami, it's a price worth paying.

327
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:33,835
The pigeon droppings
give the skins a softness

328
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:37,108
no man-made chemical can produce.

329
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,351
Thanks to Fez's wild pigeons,

330
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:13,912
the skins will reach
the highest possible price.

MIKE: There was a fair amount of people
that were actually afraid of the bats

346
00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:28,755
because they were afraid
we were going to have a rabies problem

or a disease outbreak,

348
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:33,906
so there were actually groups of people
lobbying the city council

00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:38,985
and business leaders to figure out
a way to exterminate the colony.

to be helpful for the city.

351
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:50,072
The 24-hour urban lifestyle
means that Austin is a city of light,

352
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:53,109
and that attracts millions of insects,

353
00:27:53,157 --> 00:27:57,150
which are, in turn, fast food for bats.

354
00:28:01,397 --> 00:28:05,993
Every night,
the bats eat six tonnes of insects.

355
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:09,234
That's an incredible
2,000 tonnes a year.

However,
they're more than just bug-killers.

Captain Mike saw bats
as a commercial opportunity.

358
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:24,425
MIKE: I started doing bat-watching cruises
shortly after they moved in here,

359
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:26,991

getting more and more popular.

and have brought their traditions from
the country into the towns and cities.

It is their belief that
gazelles are their children

and so the Bishnoi women
show an incredible act of kindness.

it was quirky but kind of wonderful,

sweetness in our lives

has its ups and downs.

505
00:43:22,037 --> 00:43:24,676
- Ow. Ow...
- What, what, what?

506
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:28,551
Nothing. Sorry, I didn't know they
could sting through hands quite like that.

507
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:31,270
They're stinging me like crazy.
I really want you to let go.

508
00:43:32,437 --> 00:43:37,830
There are now nearly ten million bees
living on the rooftops of New York.

509
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:48,990
Over the river in Queens,
it's a special day for beekeeper Stefanos.

510
00:43:49,037 --> 00:43:52,268
He's harvesting his first honey
with Andrew's help.

511
00:43:52,317 --> 00:43:55,354
(BUZZING)

512
00:43:55,397 --> 00:43:58,992
- This one's perfect. Couldn't be better.
- Oh, yes, look.

513
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:02,154
I think we should give
the honey a taste, just...

514
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:03,266
Just to make sure.

515
00:44:04,837 --> 00:44:07,715
Oh, man, this is going to be so good.

516
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:16,116
Oh, my God.

517
00:44:20,957 --> 00:44:23,152
It's like caramelised sunlight.

518
00:44:24,997 --> 00:44:28,194
- It's just quality control.
- Right.

519
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:38,591
Bees make honey and they pollinate
the city's parks and gardens.

520
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:43,916
But most importantly, they bring
New Yorkers back in touch with nature.

521
00:44:48,557 --> 00:44:51,151
ANDREW: I think a lot of people
are beekeeping in the city

522
00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:53,916
because they want to feel
a connection to nature.

523
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:57,233
They live in tall buildings,
they walk on asphalt...

524
00:44:58,277 --> 00:45:00,393
...they ride around
in trains under the ground.

525
00:45:00,437 --> 00:45:02,314
When they have a beehive
on their roof,

526
00:45:02,357 --> 00:45:04,109
they can spend one or two hours a week,

527
00:45:04,157 --> 00:45:07,388
and really be connected to nature,
and be creating their own food

528
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:11,476
with almost no footprint,
and I think that's great.

529
00:45:13,317 --> 00:45:16,548
HURT: Beekeeping in New York
isn't going to save the planet,

530
00:45:16,597 --> 00:45:19,316
but it's a step in the right direction.

531
00:45:27,837 --> 00:45:30,351
There is just no doubt.

532
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:33,309
If we are to continue living in cities,

533
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:39,148
we'll have to stop stripping nature bare
with no thought for tomorrow.

534
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:44,396
What we do in our homes and in our streets
affects the entire planet.

535
00:45:48,877 --> 00:45:54,235
The future of our civilisation
depends on us restoring the balance

536
00:45:54,277 --> 00:45:58,031
between the natural world
and the urban jungle.

537
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:01,229
Can we do it?

538
00:46:05,317 --> 00:46:09,833
There are clear signs of hope
from around the world.

539
00:46:09,877 --> 00:46:15,190
We do have the intelligence and ingenuity
to adapt to a changing world.

540
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:20,231
The ancient art of falconry now helps
protect the modern city of Dubai.

541
00:46:23,797 --> 00:46:29,269
We can work hand in hand with nature
to solve the problems we face.

542
00:46:30,917 --> 00:46:34,705
In India, we train fig trees
to make living bridges.

543
00:46:36,597 --> 00:46:40,431
And we team up with elephants
to extract valuable timber

544
00:46:40,477 --> 00:46:42,433
without trashing the whole forest.

545
00:46:44,557 --> 00:46:48,994
We can think as a community
and plan ahead. In Mali,

546
00:46:49,037 --> 00:46:52,746
the fish in this lake
are shared out only once a year.

547
00:46:59,837 --> 00:47:04,308
When we work together,
it's incredible what we can achieve.

548
00:47:04,357 --> 00:47:07,747
Everyone in the mud city of Djenne

549
00:47:07,797 --> 00:47:11,233
collaborates to protect
their sacred mosque.

550
00:47:15,517 --> 00:47:20,910
We have such spirit and such bravery
in the face of adversity.

551
00:47:23,957 --> 00:47:26,915
If we combine these natural abilities

552
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:32,315
with the best of our imagination
and our biggest ideas

553
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:36,191
then surely
our cities can adapt and change.

554
00:47:41,437 --> 00:47:45,476
The destiny of our planet
is now in human hands.

Just keeping up with them
proved to be a huge challenge.

The demands on our teams and kit
pushed them to the limit.

561

Filming on an active volcano in Java
tested the cameras to breaking point.

562

The crew were here
to film sulphur miners.

563
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:51,593
The air they breathe
was a danger to both people and kit.

I'm just going to go in there,
a bit closer, with a gas meter

565

(GASPING AND MUFFLED SPEECH)

The gas masks protected the crew,
but not the cameras.

573
00:49:31,797 --> 00:49:34,265
We've got an RF warning on the camera,

574
00:49:34,317 --> 00:49:37,946
which means that the signal's
not actually getting onto the tape.

575
00:49:37,997 --> 00:49:39,191
It's usually a head clog.

576
00:49:40,237 --> 00:49:44,150
The crew found that sulphide particles
had stuck to the tape head

577
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:47,667
and open-heart surgery was needed.

578
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:49,947
That's absolutely filthy.

579

- Hey!
- Ho-ho!

compared to those faced daily

cameraman Simon Enderby

585
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:18,627

called Sulbin.

with the latest in scuba gear,

587
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:30,876
and he was swimming in a pair
of underpants and wooden goggles.

588
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:33,431
We really made for a bizarre dive duo.

589
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:36,674
To capture the perfect hunt,
I had to match my scuba-dive skills

590
00:50:36,717 --> 00:50:39,185
with those of Sulbin's free-diving.

our search for food, and, finally,

all had to evolve together.

Luckily, on the third dive, it all came
together, and we both came up happy.

Oh, wow, mate, that's the one.
That's definitely the one.

herding all the fish on a reef
into a huge net.

597
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:14,514
Here, we found that fish
can be adaptable too.

saved one fish from becoming supper.

He nicknamed him Nemo.

Nemo sheltered in Roger's dive kit

601
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,277
and hid there until the coast was clear...

00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:35,391
...eventually swimming off back home.

603
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:47,267
We filmed in many locations

where people had never seen
film cameras before.

In northern India, the children
constantly looked into the lens.

So, to get the shots he wanted,
director Mark Flowers

607
00:52:00,837 --> 00:52:04,147
tried to distract the children
by singing a song.

608

with its abdomen twisted
as if it was ready to sting me.

626
00:53:19,757 --> 00:53:20,746
They got inside?

627
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:25,029
No, they were stinging through
the face mask and through the gloves.

00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,147
After 30 stings,

629
00:53:27,197 --> 00:53:31,952
Tim fully appreciated Tete's bravery
in gathering honey for his family.

in the middle of the night,
they finally felt something on the line.

636
00:54:10,757 --> 00:54:11,872
We're very excited

637
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:14,954
because we've all been
playing with the line

638
00:54:14,997 --> 00:54:17,465
that's 800 metres down into the water

639
00:54:17,517 --> 00:54:20,907
and you can actually feel
the shark on the end of it.

00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:26,756
Somewhere down there we think we've
got a, er, Greenland shark on a hook.

00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:39,750
They discovered
they'd underestimated the hole size,

because the Jensens had caught
a huge four-metre-long shark.

Co-ordinating helicopters
with action on the ground

648
00:54:59,157 --> 00:55:01,876
is both expensive and difficult.

649
00:55:01,917 --> 00:55:04,954
But in Australia, director Susan McMillan

650
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:07,636
had to co-ordinate
three helicopters at once.

651
00:55:07,677 --> 00:55:12,114
Two of them were flown by heli-cowboys
Ben Tapp

654
00:55:20,757 --> 00:55:22,475
have been quite considerable on this trip,

655
00:55:22,517 --> 00:55:24,394
because I'm filming it for real.

656
00:55:24,437 --> 00:55:26,587
It's not a drama and there's no take two.

657
00:55:26,637 --> 00:55:28,946
I have to actually capture the event
as it happens,

658
00:55:28,997 --> 00:55:33,787
and it's quite a dangerous situation.
I've got three helicopters in the air,

I've got quad bikes and horses
on the ground,

I've got stampeding cattle,

661

so, actually, the biggest pressure,
I think, has been safety.

662

can be just as dangerous,

00:56:07,717 --> 00:56:13,235
The thought of getting out of a vehicle
and walking towards lions on foot

670
00:56:13,277 --> 00:56:16,633
goes against
every common sense bone in my body.

671
00:56:17,677 --> 00:56:20,237
I mean, these guys are...
these guys are amazing.

672
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:23,349
They, um...
They've got their bows and arrows.

673
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:26,150
But, um, I haven't got anything!

674
00:56:26,197 --> 00:56:27,391
I've got... (CHUCKLES)

675
00:56:27,437 --> 00:56:30,952
...I've got a camera and a lens cap
to protect myself with.

676
00:56:30,997 --> 00:56:33,192
It's getting a bit real, though, isn't it?

677
00:56:33,237 --> 00:56:34,556
Butterflies in the stomach.

678
00:56:40,357 --> 00:56:45,226
Having located the lions, Toby
followed the Dorobo as they moved in

679
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,586
to have a look.

680
00:56:48,837 --> 00:56:52,955
Walking down there towards thick bushes
where you know there are lions, it, um...

681
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:56,034
God, it's something very primal
in the back of your neck,

682
00:56:56,077 --> 00:56:58,307
and everything...
the hairs on the back of your neck

683
00:56:58,357 --> 00:57:00,268
and you just feel these eyes on you,

684
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:01,989
but you feel very, very alive.

685
00:57:02,037 --> 00:57:05,825
It's a magical feeling. It's, um...
I sort of recommend it to everyone.

686
00:57:05,877 --> 00:57:08,266
Before going to work,
have a walk through lion country.

687
00:57:08,317 --> 00:57:10,069
It gets things in perspective.

688
00:57:10,117 --> 00:57:11,789
Yeah, amazing.

689
00:57:14,757 --> 00:57:17,112
Without the co-operation
and support of all the people

690
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:19,796
we filmed around the world,

691
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:22,476
this series could not have been made.

692
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:27,747
Their unique knowledge and survival skills

693
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:32,109
have relevance for us all
in an increasingly human planet.
