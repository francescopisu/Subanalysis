00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:09,050
Only one creature
has carved a life for itself

2
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:10,974
in every habitat on earth.

3
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:15,413
That creature is us.

4
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:23,487
All over the world, we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

5
00:00:23,537 --> 00:00:29,089
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

6
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:33,254
This is the Human Planet.

7
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:49,056
The sea covers 70%
of our planet's surface.

8
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:54,654
It's home to three-quarters
of all life on earth.

9
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:07,136
All the creatures found here are perfectly
adapted to thrive in the ocean...

10
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:11,807
...all except one.

11
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:32,611
We are not evolved for a life aquatic...

12
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:39,128
...and we're way out of our depth
in this dangerous and alien world.

13
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:50,974
But great opportunities await those people
who dare to venture into the water.

14
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:58,455
As we immerse ourselves
ever deeper in the big blue,

15
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:02,410
how do we overcome
the enormous challenges that confront us?

16
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:36,176
Our relationship with the ocean
begins on the coast.

17
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,330
Even here,
the sea is a force to be reckoned with.

18
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:46,973
Galicia, in Northern Spain, is home

19
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:51,135
to one of Europe's
most treacherous coasts.

20
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:57,010
But the more extreme the conditions,
the greater the rewards,

21
00:02:57,057 --> 00:03:01,608
if, like Javier and Angel,
you're prepared to take the risk.

22
00:03:19,497 --> 00:03:23,126
Javier and Angel are on the hunt
for a strange creature

23
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:26,806
that clings to the wave-battered rocks...

24
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:29,496
at the bottom of these cliffs.

25
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:47,008
They have to move fast.
Their quarry is only exposed at low tide.

26
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:55,088

(SPEAKS SPANISH)

28
00:04:17,297 --> 00:04:20,175
It's goose barnacles they're after,

29
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:24,733
a highly prized delicacy
that can sell for 200 euros a kilo.

30
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:30,929
But it's not easy pickings.
Each year, about five collectors die.

31
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,650
Few dare work when it's this rough.

32
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:38,770
But those who do can charge
a premium for their harvest.

33
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:54,136
Despite the onslaught,
Javier's filled his bag.

34
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:59,376
Now it's Angel's turn,
and though it's getting even rougher...

35
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,407
...he's going in with no safety rope.

36
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:15,726
Working unattached
allows him to dash between waves

37
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:19,770
and reach the lowest rocks,
where the biggest barnacles grow.

38
00:05:20,657 --> 00:05:23,774
But one slip could be fatal.

39
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:35,451
Although the tide's coming in,
Angel's determined to collect more.

40
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:06,414
Javier and Angel's gamble paid off.

41
00:06:06,457 --> 00:06:10,245
In two hours, they've gathered
enough goose barnacles

42
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:15,166
to fetch around 800 euros.
Not bad for a day at the seaside.

43
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:31,131
It's this abundance of food
that entices us into the waves.

44
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:35,693
And just a little further out,
there are even greater riches.

45
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:41,812
Coastal waters account forjust
one-tenth of the world's oceans,

46
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:45,327
but they're home
to the vast majority of marine life.

47

The trouble is, as we venture further
from the shore, the dangers escalate.

Benjamin's training to be a harpoonist

49
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:07,368
and he knows, any day now,
all he's learned could be put to the test.

50
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:30,776
He lives on a small Indonesian island
called Lembata.

51
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,285
Few crops grow in this rocky land,

52
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:36,773
and even surviving from the sea
is a struggle.

Benjamin and the rest of the crew

are about to take on
the biggest predator that's ever lived.

They all know the risks,

much bigger than this.

65
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:07,926

(WHALE SONG)

67
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:15,375
Up to 1 8 metres long, these mighty
leviathans are powerful animals

68
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,851
and they won't go down without a fight.

69
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:29,171
With simple wooden boats
and handmade weapons,

70
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:35,053
the whalers seem ill-prepared for battle,
but this is how it's been for 600 years.

71
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:41,288
They can only harpoon the whale
when it surfaces to breathe...

72
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,769
...so they need to move fast.

73
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:57,770
Benjamin's brother prepares
to launch himself at the whale.

74
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:01,689
This is the most dangerous moment of all.

75
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,527
But he misses,

76
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:16,612
and now someone else must step up
before the whale dives.

00:10:19,337 --> 00:10:21,692

He's got it.

80
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:51,687
But the battle has just begun.

81
00:10:55,257 --> 00:11:00,126
As the whale fights to break free,
they move to harpoon it again.

82
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:09,613
They need to prevent it from diving
and pulling a boat under.

83
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:20,169
But it's not enough.

84
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:28,332
Terrified of the thrashing whale,
the crew scramble to safety.

85
00:11:39,377 --> 00:11:43,290
Another boat attacks
and harpoons the whale once more.

86
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:58,290
Now dragging several boats,
the whale slowly tires.

87
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:13,730
Eventually, its struggles are exhausted

88
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:17,816
and a final cut, through its backbone,
is made.

89
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:37,612
It's been an epic eight-hour battle,

90
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,536
but Benjamin has shown his skill
and bravery...

91
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:50,130
...and this time everyone returns
safely home.

00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:58,688
The death of a whale may be sad to us,
but this is their lifeline.

One catch can feed a village for months,

94
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:05,013
and this small-scale hunt in Lembata

95
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:08,766
doesn't threaten whale numbers
in these oceans.

They only take around six whales a year.

Nothing is wasted. The meat is shared out.

As the man who dealt the decisive blow,
Benjamin gets a larger share,

we've become

at discovering new ways
to exploit the ocean.

105
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:03,892
And in a few special places, this means
working with the creatures of the sea.

106
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,456
These fishermen of Laguna in Brazil

107
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:16,569
have forged one of the most
extraordinary partnerships

that migrate through these waters
every May.

111
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:36,334
But there's a problem.

112
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:42,134
The water's so murky, the fishermen
can't see where to cast their nets.

113
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:50,332
So, they join forces with
the most intelligent animal in the sea.

In fact, Edson and his pal Alfredo

Incredibly, the dolphins drive the mullet

The fishermen say they can tell
the size of the school,

and which way it's travelling,

125
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:05,536
from the vigour and direction of the dive.

126
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:15,527
The dolphins do the hard work,
herding the mullet.

127
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,569
The fish are served
to the fishermen on a plate...

128
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:28,295
...but what the dolphins stand to gain
is less clear.

129
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:30,487
Since they detect prey by echolocation,

00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:33,210
they have no problem
hunting in the murky water,

but picking off individuals
from the school is more difficult.

It seems the nets panic the fish
into breaking formation,

00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:46,045

00:20:55,217 --> 00:20:57,572
It was a core part of their society,

171
00:20:57,617 --> 00:21:03,328
and the noble pursuit
of warriors, kings and queens.

172
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:12,735
TOM: We have a lot of history
about women that...that surf,

173
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:17,293
and, you know, they surfed so well
that they actually reached godly status.

174
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:25,211
We revered these women.

175
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:39,692
From ancient origins,
surfing has now gone global.

176
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:44,167
And for some,
searching for the ride of your life

177
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:46,526
has become an extreme obsession.

178
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:57,334
December 9th, 2009.

179
00:21:57,377 --> 00:22:00,574
The world's surfing elite
has gathered in Hawaii,

180
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:05,327
to ride some of the biggest swells
to hit these shores in over a decade.

181
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:29,053
Surfing's certainly changed,
but for many it's still a way of life,

182
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,453
and the best riders are still
revered as gods

183
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:35,455
amongst the worldwide surfing tribe.

184
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:50,650
With waves over 1 5 metres,
five storeys high,

185
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:54,326
this is a real test of skill and stamina.

186
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:23,210
Ken Bradshaw is famed
for taming a 26-metre wave,

187
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:26,135
probably the biggest ever ridden.

188
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:31,171
But these unpredictable swells
can claim even the most seasoned surfer.

189
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:56,015
Trapped in a rolling mountain
of white water,

190
00:23:56,057 --> 00:24:00,209
Ken is tossed around like a rag doll
in a washing machine.

191
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:07,887
Just as he surfaces,
another giant breaker comes crashing in.

192
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:29,925
After a relentless pounding
from six successive waves,

193
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:33,856
Ken eventually escapes in one piece.

194
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:41,329
All big wave surfers know the risks,

195
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:45,211
but the adrenaline and the glory
is addictive.

196
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:50,054
And just as the ancient Hawaiians
discovered,

197
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:53,885
surfing is still the most
spectacular demonstration

198
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:56,895
of our ability to conquer the waves.

199
00:25:55,217 --> 00:26:01,008
Our mastery of the sea is impressive,
but we'll never tame its full fury.

200
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:06,131
The enormous waves of December 9th

201
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:11,012
were created by intense
tropical cyclone activity in the Pacific.

202
00:26:13,497 --> 00:26:18,287
When warm waters fuel the ferocity
of depressions over the ocean,

203
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:21,932
they can create
the most violent weather systems on earth.

204
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:26,534
People must stay well away
from the raging sea

205
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:29,489
during these tempestuous times,

206
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:31,892
but they can't stop it coming to them.

207
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:43,006
These super-storms, with winds
of over 300 kilometres per hour,

208
00:26:43,057 --> 00:26:45,810
wreak havoc on the human world.

209
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:50,131
(SHOUTING)

210
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:53,726
It can take years to recover
from the destruction.

211
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:58,691
(SHOUTING)

212
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:05,372
Sometimes over 1,600 kilometres wide,

213
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:11,492
hurricanes and typhoons are persistent
reminders of the ocean's awesome force.

214
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:18,966
It's little wonder that coastal people
look at these mighty waters

215
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:20,689
with great reverence...

216
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:25,573
...but not just for
the power of the ocean,

217
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:28,654
but also the power
of the creatures that live in it.

218
00:27:33,657 --> 00:27:40,654
In the islands off Papua New Guinea,
Blais is known as a sorcerer of the sea.

219
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:50,128
Possessing the mysterious ability
to summon sharks from the deep,

220
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:54,932
he's one of the last so-called
''shark callers';

221
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:58,447
a traditional hunting technique
steeped in superstition.

222
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,612
(CHANTS SONG)

223
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:36,928
Blais respects ritual,
but he also understands shark behaviour.

224
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:42,973
Rattling in the water
mimics the activity of feeding fish.

225
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:46,646
Sharks can detect these vibrations
from three kilometres away,

226
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:48,972
but they don't always respond.

227
00:28:49,017 --> 00:28:51,611
(CHANTS SONG)

228
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:57,695
(RATTLING)

229
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:15,165
(RATTLING)

230
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:19,176
And as industrial fishing
decimates shark numbers,

231
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:22,095
the waits are getting even longer.

232
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:29,448
(RATTLING)

233
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:38,293
Finally, a grey reef shark
emerges from the blue.

234
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,455
Blais has appeased its spirit.

235
00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:48,971
But now he has to catch it,
and sharks are notoriously skittish.

236
00:29:55,697 --> 00:29:58,973
It's a game of cat and mouse.

237
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:09,135
Blais tries to entice the shark close
enough to slip a noose around its neck...

238
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:17,087
...but one false move and it's game over.

239
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:27,927
Finally it takes the bait.
Slowly he prepares the noose.

240
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:54,686
Blais can't keep hold of
the thrashing shark,

241
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:58,207
but this wooden float prevents it diving.

242
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:21,336
Then, as if under a spell,
the shark suddenly stops.

243
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:32,893
But in fact the float exploits
a quirk in shark biology,

244
00:31:32,937 --> 00:31:38,807
exhausting it so much, it enters a state
known as tonic immobility.

245
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:43,606
Blais approaches with caution.

246
00:31:44,617 --> 00:31:49,771
The shark is still very much alive
and its bite could cause serious injury.

247
00:32:02,857 --> 00:32:06,816
In the past, Blais would have
killed the shark for food.

248
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:11,728
But today he lets it go free.

249
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:18,170
Blais is committed to keeping
his shark-calling culture alive...

250
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:20,777
(SOUNDING HORN)

251
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:26,055
...and this means keeping sharks alive.

252
00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:47,016
And it's not just traditions
that are threatened.

253
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,653
In some seas around the world,

254
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:54,292
a growing shortage of fish
is forcing people deeper and deeper,

255
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:57,329
just to land a decent catch.

256
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:03,053
So deep, they venture
to the very limits of human survival.

257
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:11,610
Welcome to the world
of the Pa-aling divers,

258
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:15,445
perhaps the most dangerous
fishing method of all.

259
00:33:16,897 --> 00:33:20,014
80 men, many of whom are still teenagers,

260
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:23,333
are preparing to dive to over 40 metres,

261
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:29,566
breathing air pumped through these
makeshift tubes by this rusty compressor.

262
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:36,454
Joseph is one of the youngest aboard,
but he's aware of the risks.

263
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:47,096
He's already witnessed
just how lethal his job can be.

264
00:34:05,057 --> 00:34:08,811
The seas around the Philippines
were once rich with life,

265
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:10,813
but they've been so over-exploited

266
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:16,568
that decent fish numbers
are only found at perilous depths.

267
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:21,328
(SHOUTING)

268
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:35,092
The divers guide the huge ball of nets
40 metres down to the sea floor,

269
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:38,493
but all the while
their air supply is at risk.

270
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:42,293
Back on the boat,

271
00:34:42,337 --> 00:34:45,886
the ailing compressor
and the ever-worsening tangle of tubes

272
00:34:45,937 --> 00:34:47,450
need constant attention.

273
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:54,055
Like a failing heart
pumping through clogged arteries,

274
00:34:54,097 --> 00:34:56,292
if this circulation system fails,

275
00:34:56,337 --> 00:35:00,376
at this depth, it's almost certain death.

276
00:35:07,177 --> 00:35:09,372
Joseph and the team unravel the nets

277
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:12,011
and lay them out
by securing them to rocks.

278
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:26,809
They must work fast.

279
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:30,372
Joseph knows, the longer he spends
at these depths,

280
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,487
the more dangerous it becomes.

281
00:35:32,537 --> 00:35:36,416
With every breath,
more nitrogen dissolves in his body,

282
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:41,577
making him increasingly vulnerable
to decompression sickness - ''the bends''.

283
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:05,615
The top of the net is suspended
by plastic containers filled with air,

284
00:36:05,657 --> 00:36:09,252
creating a huge cavernous trap beneath.

285
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:20,646
Now it's time to set the scare-line.

286
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:36,448
The boats drag the 1,000-metre line
to form a huge circle around the net,

287
00:36:36,497 --> 00:36:39,534
and the divers position themselves
along it.

288
00:36:42,377 --> 00:36:48,009
Joseph and the team begin closing
the trap by swimming towards the net.

289
00:36:48,057 --> 00:36:51,447
The waving streamers
and the curtain of rising bubbles

290
00:36:51,497 --> 00:36:54,136
panics the fish and they flee.

291
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:04,409
As the line of divers tightens,
more and more fish

292
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:07,574
swim straight into the gaping net.

293
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:15,453
This deep-sea round-up is so effective,

294
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:19,092
it can take 50% of the fish
from a reef.

295
00:37:35,017 --> 00:37:39,169
The net is closed, and now Joseph must do
something even more dangerous,

296
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:43,813
get inside and herd the catch
to the far end.

297
00:38:02,617 --> 00:38:07,008
On deck, the tangled web of tubes
is getting worse.

298
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:29,647
Once the catch is concentrated, the net
is released from its anchor points.

299
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:39,374
Now comes the most lethal stage of all -

300
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,853
guiding the net
as it shoots to the surface.

301
00:38:42,897 --> 00:38:47,573
All too often, the divers ascend
too quickly and get the bends.

302
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:11,414
As the catch is hauled onto the boat,
its size is revealed.

303
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:16,489
Just under a tonne of fish isn't bad,

304
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:21,736
but it's nowhere near what these fishermen
were landing a few years ago.

305
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:28,807
And this isn't the only problem.
Some of the crew do have the bends.

306
00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:32,930
One diver has returned to the bottom
to relieve the symptoms,

307
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:36,174
whilst, closer to the surface,
another is massaged

308
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:39,448
to release the painful bubbles
in his spine.

309
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:46,571
Every day, these Pa-aling divers

310
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:50,246
are taking greater risks
for dwindling rewards.

311
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:12,817
Joseph has his dreams,

312
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:19,774
but the harsh reality is he'll be diving
twice again today,just to make ends meet.

313
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:24,412
We've become so successful in the ocean,

314
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:29,292
it's predicted that in 50 years
almost all the fish could be gone...

315
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:35,687
...and this may not be
the only change to come.

316
00:40:37,177 --> 00:40:41,056
All around the world,
sea levels are rising.

317
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:45,887
Soon our planet could be
even more dominated by the ocean,

318
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:50,533
and our ability to survive here
will be pushed to the very limit.

319
00:40:57,617 --> 00:41:02,896
Yet there are some people who've
already adapted to life in a water world.

320
00:41:07,737 --> 00:41:12,811
In the coral seas between Borneo,
Sulawesi and the Philippines,

321
00:41:12,857 --> 00:41:16,167
there are people who live
more intimately with the ocean

322
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:18,173
than any other culture on earth.

323
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:32,254
The Bajau Laut build their lives
in the middle of the sea,

324
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:34,891
often many kilometres from land.

325
00:41:34,937 --> 00:41:37,053
(CHATTERING)

326
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:51,247
The ocean has a profound influence
on every aspect of their existence.

327
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:54,733
They even measure the passage of time
by the rhythm of the tides

328
00:41:54,777 --> 00:41:57,371
rather than minutes and hours.

329
00:42:05,737 --> 00:42:10,253
And there are some whose relationship
with the sea runs even deeper.

330
00:42:19,577 --> 00:42:22,216
The Bajau, who live on houseboats,

331
00:42:22,257 --> 00:42:26,045
have almost completely
severed their ties with the land.

332
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:34,089
Nohara rarely sets foot ashore.

333
00:43:00,857 --> 00:43:07,296
Nohara and her family usually only
visit land to trade for rice and fuel,

334
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:10,135
or to mend their boats.

335
00:43:10,177 --> 00:43:13,726
But, like many Bajau,
Nohara gets ''land-sick''

336
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:16,245
and she prefers to stay aboard.

337
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:23,327
Her family has no nationality,
no fixed abode and almost no money,

338
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:26,892
but the ocean provides
everything they need.

339
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:33,166
They eat a bewildering variety of seafood.

340
00:43:40,377 --> 00:43:45,212
Her children adapt to an aquatic
way of life from a very young age.

341
00:43:49,337 --> 00:43:53,615
Some Bajau children
spend so much time in the sea,

342
00:43:53,657 --> 00:43:56,535
their eyes adjust
to focus better underwater.

343
00:44:00,097 --> 00:44:05,125
But there's one member of this community
whose adaptation is even more staggering.

344
00:44:08,777 --> 00:44:11,769
Sulbin is an underwater hunter,

345
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:15,605
and the living proof ofjust how far
we can push our bodies

346
00:44:15,657 --> 00:44:17,409
towards a life aquatic.

347
00:44:40,617 --> 00:44:46,089
Sulbin's search for supper takes him
on a incredible journey under the waves,

348
00:44:46,137 --> 00:44:50,050
and his abilities
will take your breath away.

349
00:44:54,337 --> 00:44:59,809
First he prepares
by entering a trance-like state.

350
00:45:18,337 --> 00:45:25,015
Sulbin is about to push his body
almost beyond the realms of possibility,

351
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:28,936
and if you want to try and join him,
get ready to hold your breath

352
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:30,854
for as long as you can.

353
00:45:36,457 --> 00:45:39,767
He takes one last breath.

354
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:07,250
Focused and calm, Sulbin descends
20 metres to the sea floor.

355
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:21,295
His heartbeat slows
to around 30 beats per minute.

356
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:25,894
The pressure at these depths
crushes his chest,

357
00:46:25,937 --> 00:46:30,692
squeezing the air in his lungs
to one-third of its usual volume,

358
00:46:34,297 --> 00:46:37,812
Even without weights,
he's negatively buoyant enough

359
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:42,089
to stride across the bottom of the sea
as if hunting on land.

360
00:46:59,697 --> 00:47:03,087
By now, the carbon dioxide in his blood
causes

361
00:47:03,137 --> 00:47:06,493
an almost irresistible urge
to gasp for air,

362
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:10,610
but Sulbin must keep his mind on the hunt.

363
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:25,057
After a minute and three-quarters,
Sulbin spots a fish.

364
00:47:36,777 --> 00:47:43,296
Sulbin can go even deeper than this
and stay down for up to five minutes,

365
00:47:44,497 --> 00:47:48,615
but he's not one to show off
and, after all, he's got what he came for.

366
00:47:51,457 --> 00:47:57,054
Two-and-a-half minutes of hunting
under pressure on one breath.

367
00:47:57,097 --> 00:48:01,010
Perhaps the idea of humans
existing as marine mammals

368
00:48:01,057 --> 00:48:03,412
is not so far-fetched after all.

369
00:48:15,337 --> 00:48:18,454
Through amazing adaptability
and endeavour,

370
00:48:18,497 --> 00:48:21,967
we've pushed our limits of survival
into the ocean,

371
00:48:22,017 --> 00:48:25,896
and, as we've immersed ourselves
deeper in the sea,

372
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:29,168
it's had a profound effect on our lives.

373
00:48:35,177 --> 00:48:40,126
But as we continue to change the nature
of the greatest environment on our planet,

374
00:48:40,177 --> 00:48:45,809
how we'll adapt in the future
remains to be seen.

375
00:48:57,097 --> 00:49:01,932
The most technical and demanding shoots
for the Human Planet: Oceans programme

376
00:49:01,977 --> 00:49:04,730
were those that took place underwater.

377
00:49:06,017 --> 00:49:10,772
The dive camera crew were well prepared
to film fishermen in the Philippines.

378
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:15,254
But they weren't quite prepared
for the dangers they'd witness

379
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:17,811
and the friendships they'd forge.

380
00:49:21,097 --> 00:49:26,330
Liminangcong is home to the 80 Pa-aling
fishermen that the film crew will follow.

381
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:47,086
Two fishing boats are crammed
with 80 divers, their food and provisions,

382
00:49:47,137 --> 00:49:50,334
before heading out for two weeks at sea.

383
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:56,770
At the fishing grounds,
Simon and Roger are playing catch-up,

384
00:49:56,817 --> 00:50:01,288
as their technical underwater equipment
is slowing them down.

385
00:50:01,337 --> 00:50:03,805
They've just dropped the lines.
They didn't even tell us.

386
00:50:03,857 --> 00:50:06,325
The captain seems to be on a mission
to prove something today

387
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:08,811
so we've got to go fast.

388
00:50:11,977 --> 00:50:15,447
Underwater filming is risky,
but these risks are nothing

389
00:50:15,497 --> 00:50:19,410
compared to those faced daily
by the compressor divers.

390
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:27,006
Compressor diving
is a dangerous way to make a living.

391
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:31,329
Air, often tainted with diesel,

392
00:50:31,377 --> 00:50:34,813
is pumped through thin plastic tubes
right down to the divers.

393
00:50:37,857 --> 00:50:41,167
At 64,Joning is one of
the veterans on the boat,

394
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:44,414
and knows the harsh realities
of compressor diving.

395
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:02,212
Most of the divers are young and fit,
and they need to be.

396
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:03,656
It's physically demanding work

397
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:08,213
and the men are totally reliant
on the compressor to keep them breathing.

398
00:51:24,857 --> 00:51:29,009
To use, basically, what's essentially
a garden hose down at 25 metres,

399
00:51:29,057 --> 00:51:30,888
to pump air into your mouth, is just mad.

400
00:51:33,977 --> 00:51:37,208
The biggest danger for these fishermen
is known as

401
00:51:37,257 --> 00:51:40,169
decompression sickness,
or ''the bends''.

402
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:46,727
The bends can happen when divers
have been down deep for a long time,

403
00:51:46,777 --> 00:51:49,530
and then come up too quickly
to the surface.

404
00:51:49,577 --> 00:51:52,489
Nitrogen is absorbed into the body

405
00:51:52,537 --> 00:51:53,936
and, as the divers rise up,

406
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:58,846
bubbles are formed that can lodge
in the joints, causing intense pain.

407
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:06,370
Two guys are in real trouble
on this deep dive.

408
00:52:06,417 --> 00:52:09,250
Martin, a young diver, is in such pain

409
00:52:09,297 --> 00:52:12,972
that his friend tries to relieve it
by massaging him.

410
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,408
Once on the surface,
it's obvious to everyone

411
00:52:18,457 --> 00:52:20,846
that Martin is still in trouble.

412
00:52:23,737 --> 00:52:30,210
If not treated, the bends can lead
to permanent injuries and even death.

413
00:52:32,337 --> 00:52:37,047
Meanwhile, the second diver,
Michael, is also having problems.

414
00:52:37,097 --> 00:52:40,169
It seems like two men just came up
with the bends.

415
00:52:40,217 --> 00:52:42,572
They went pretty deep on this dive,
trying to get more fish.

416
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:46,769
But we've taken them onto our boat
to get some medical attention

417
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:49,206
so, hopefully, they're all right.

418
00:52:50,297 --> 00:52:54,654
Simon tries to relieve their symptoms
with the crew's first aid supplies.

419
00:52:54,697 --> 00:52:56,130
One more.

420
00:52:56,177 --> 00:52:59,169
Michael's had 1 5 minutes on oxygen now.

421
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,526
I've now put Martin back
onto another set of 1 5 minutes.

422
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:05,695
This is the...you know,
the rudimentary decompression first aid

423
00:53:05,737 --> 00:53:07,329
we can give them at the moment -

424
00:53:07,377 --> 00:53:11,336
give them oxygen, give them water
to rehydrate and keep them warm.

425
00:53:11,377 --> 00:53:15,290
Both of them are saying
that their symptoms are decreasing

426
00:53:15,337 --> 00:53:19,455
and they are looking a lot more happy
than they did about half an hour ago.

427
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:21,249
He gives them oxygen,

428
00:53:21,297 --> 00:53:25,051
which helps reduce the nitrogen
in their bodies and relieves their pain,

429
00:53:25,097 --> 00:53:28,612
but even this most basic
of diving first aid

430
00:53:28,657 --> 00:53:31,854
is not normally available
to the Pa-aling fishermen.

431
00:53:31,897 --> 00:53:33,296
No pain?

432
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:35,487
This isn't surprising,

433
00:53:35,537 --> 00:53:39,735
as the fishermen in the Philippines belong
to the lowest wage earners in the country,

434
00:53:39,777 --> 00:53:44,567
earning about 25 US dollars
for a week's work.

435
00:53:45,897 --> 00:53:51,290
However, for many, like Joning and his
family, this is their whole way of life.

436
00:54:22,097 --> 00:54:26,136
His son had got the bends,
and now has to use crutches.

437
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:32,055
But this isn't the only time
the dangers of compressor diving

438
00:54:32,097 --> 00:54:33,894
have hit Joning's family.

439
00:55:06,857 --> 00:55:08,575
I'm very sorry about that.

440
00:55:08,617 --> 00:55:12,166
That's...yeah, that's terrible.

441
00:55:12,217 --> 00:55:14,606
(MUTTERS)

442
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:17,933
- That's very sad, isn't it?
- It is.

443
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:31,606
Having spent a week living
and working with the compressor divers,

444
00:55:31,657 --> 00:55:35,650
Simon and Roger have become
very close to the fishermen.

445
00:55:35,697 --> 00:55:37,688
(CHATTERING)

446
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:40,251
To fully understand their way of life,

447
00:55:40,297 --> 00:55:44,973
Simon needed to experience first-hand
what it's like to be a compressor diver.

448
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:52,089
So Joning is keen to take him
on a shallow dive.

449
00:55:52,137 --> 00:55:53,775
(AIR HISSES)

450
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:57,332
SIMON: I've seen the boys do it.
They've made it look easy.

451
00:55:57,377 --> 00:56:00,892
But we've had several guys that have
gone down with symptoms of the bends.

452
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:04,009
I've got to admit I'm feeling
a little bit apprehensive, actually.

453
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:14,416
Simon has scuba-dived for 1 6 years
and has logged over 3,000 dives,

454
00:56:14,457 --> 00:56:18,132
but this is diving at its most basic.

455
00:56:24,657 --> 00:56:28,093
SIMON: The first minute, I've got to say,

456
00:56:28,137 --> 00:56:31,527
I was, er...a little bit petrified,
actually.

457
00:56:31,577 --> 00:56:35,968
This is a violent thing. It's just
punching air down your throat.

458
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,086
It's quite mad.

459
00:56:37,137 --> 00:56:40,015
It took me a minute
to kinda get myself under control

460
00:56:40,057 --> 00:56:42,207
and then once you've got the hang of it,

461
00:56:42,257 --> 00:56:45,772
and once you believe in it
and trust in it, then you can swim on.

462
00:57:04,937 --> 00:57:06,893
There were a couple of times
when I lost it, though.

463
00:57:06,937 --> 00:57:08,814
I was flailing around everywhere.

464
00:57:08,857 --> 00:57:11,815
I was trying to find it again
and get it back in.

465
00:57:11,857 --> 00:57:17,011
But Joning was keeping a good eye on me,
and the rest of the guys were as well,

466
00:57:17,057 --> 00:57:22,768
but I wouldn't want to do that for
a whole sort of fish-catching session,

467
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:24,216
that's for sure.

468
00:57:25,897 --> 00:57:29,776
A strong camaraderie
between the divers has been forged.

469
00:57:29,817 --> 00:57:33,173
The film crew have captured
a dramatic sequence,

470
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:37,210
and the fishermen head home happy,
with a boatload of fish to sell.

471
00:57:56,777 --> 00:58:02,010
Joning and everyone on board have
finished another Pa-aling fishing trip,

472
00:58:02,057 --> 00:58:05,811
and all can return safe and sound
to their families.
