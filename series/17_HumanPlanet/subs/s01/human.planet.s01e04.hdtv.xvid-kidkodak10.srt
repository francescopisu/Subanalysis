1
00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:11,233
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.

2
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:16,109
That creature is us.

3
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:24,111
All over the world we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

4
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:28,992
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

5
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,273
This is the Human Planet.

6
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:55,547
The jungle is nature at its most vigorous,
complex and mysterious.

7
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:59,987
It may appear bountiful,

8
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:04,189
but for humans, this is a surprisingly
hostile environment.

9
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:22,315
Though, through history,
great civilisations have arisen here,

10
00:01:22,357 --> 00:01:25,429
none have stood the test of time.

11
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:36,826
The jungle refuses to be tamed

12
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:40,586
and it punishes those
who don't live by its laws.

13
00:01:45,997 --> 00:01:49,785
Yet even today, there are some
who guard the secrets

14
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:52,192
of surviving in this wild world.

15
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,149
These are the remarkable stories

16
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:59,031
of the people who call
the rainforest home.

17
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:31,871
Tropical rainforests coverjust
2% of the planet's surface...

18
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:37,554
...but they're home to half
of all species on Earth.

19
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:44,192
The problem is, much of this life
is in the tree-tops,

20
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,990
a world way out of our reach.

21
00:02:55,517 --> 00:03:00,671
Exploiting the canopy's riches from
the forest floor is so challenging,

22
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:03,868
getting enough protein
is a daily struggle.

23
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:20,429
The Matis of Brazil
are highly skilled hunters

24
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:24,914
but for the past week there's been
barely enough meat to go round.

25
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:34,555
Benin is hungry and he's determined
today's hunt will be more successful.

26
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:47,514
Administering tree-frog toxin into
his bloodstream purges his body,

27
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:49,752
preparing it for action.

28
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:10,555
The Matis also drop a noxious
plant juice into their eyes

29
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:14,909
to sharpen their senses
and focus their minds on the hunt.

30
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:33,229
Benin and the others summon
the power of the animal spirits.

31
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:45,074
Hunting canopy animals
from the ground

32
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:48,507
requires formidable fire power...

33
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:54,036
...a four-metre long blowpipe,

34
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:58,195
precision-made to a design
honed over thousands of years.

35
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:20,348
Spotting animals in the dense
vegetation is so hard,

36
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:24,026
the Matis rely on hearing
to locate prey...

37
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:36,075
...and use mimicry to lure them
into range.

38
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:42,795
They can imitate all ten species of
monkey found in these forests.

39
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,952
(IMITATES MONKEY CALL)

40
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,556
(MONKEY CRIES)

41
00:05:57,597 --> 00:05:59,747
A howler monkey responds.

42
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:08,395
30 metres up,
monkeys are feeding in a fig tree.

43
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:19,635
Scoring the darts with piranha teeth

44
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:24,193
ensures the poisoned tip breaks off
in the victim's body.

45
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:31,907
Unlike guns, blowpipes are near silent

46
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:34,630
and can be fired
without spooking the monkeys.

47
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:42,996
Benin makes the first hit,
and now the monkeys scatter.

48
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,590
Once shot, the monkeys
must be tracked

49
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:52,788
as the curare-vine poison takes effect.

50
00:06:55,757 --> 00:07:01,036
This monkey's already weak,
but it's hiding, and must be flushed out.

51
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:06,272
They shoot again.

52
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:14,513
But it's stuck in a vine now, and
there's no choice but to go and get it.

53
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:30,871
One down, but it's just the beginning.

54
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:41,593
As one of the swiftest hunters,

55
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:45,266
it's Benin's job to pick off
any escaping monkeys.

56
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:53,350
He shoots another, but misses.

57
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:06,749
Benin fires again, this time on target.

58
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:18,506
The monkey finally stops...

59
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:24,347
...and Benin takes aim one last time.

60
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:37,354
Eight monkeys. It's been a good day.

61
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:41,151
But all too often
they return empty-handed.

62
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,875
Hunting in the canopy is so difficult,

63
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:58,229
people must find most of their food
closer to the ground.

64
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:04,595
But scratching a living
on the forest floor is hardly any easier.

65
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:13,785
The complex nature of this mysterious
world is so hard to master,

66
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:16,305
the lessons have to start early.

67
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:27,032
Orlando's from the Piaroa tribe
of Venezuela.

68
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:29,709
He's like any other kid,

69
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:34,273
only life in the jungle has already
forced him to fend for himself.

70
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:50,952
But this childhood adventure takes
them deep into the jungle underworld.

71
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:02,396
As only 2% of sunlight
reaches the forest floor,

72
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:07,511
surprisingly few plants grow
and this means few animals.

73
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:15,113
There's less protein here
than in the desert...

74
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:18,593
and much that is here is poisonous.

75
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:31,235
Distinguishing dinner from danger
is an essential life skill.

76
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:44,071
Few creatures have a more sinister
reputation than the one they seek.

77
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:08,276
The goliath tarantula,
the size of a dinner plate,

78
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,753
the largest spider in the world.

79
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:20,588
It's hard to imagine
a less appetising meal,

80
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:24,630
but picky eaters don't last long
in the jungle.

81
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:33,034
Besides, Orlando says
they're delicious,

82
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:37,468
and handling dangerous animals
comes with the territory.

83
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:45,753
From about five years old,

84
00:11:45,797 --> 00:11:48,834
Piaroa children know exactly
where to hunt for spiders...

85
00:11:50,357 --> 00:11:54,475
...and in a couple of hours
can catch enough for a decent meal.

86
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:07,675
But they have to be careful
of both the huge fangs

87
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:11,676
and of the hairs they kick
towards any attacker.

88
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:22,035
If they contact the skin or are inhaled,
they cause a nasty reaction.

89
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:31,233
Orlando's come off worst.

90
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:37,756
But growing up in the jungle,
he's used to a little discomfort.

91
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:49,592
Tarantulas are best served toasted,
like marshmallows.

92
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:56,029
All the hairs must be singed off
so they don't catch in the throat.

93
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,471
And when they start squeaking,

94
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:03,829
which is just air escaping from
the joints, they're almost done.

95
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:17,745
Tarantulas taste a bit like crab

96
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,995
and, with a little seasoning,
they go down a treat.

97
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:34,277
Orlando's and his friends'survival

98
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:38,435
depends upon embracing
every opportunity in the forest.

99
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:54,829
Jungle people rely so heavily
on their surroundings,

100
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:57,835
they become a natural part
of the forest

101
00:13:57,877 --> 00:14:01,586
and form extraordinary bonds
with nature.

102
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:16,833
Very few people live more intimately
with animals than the Awa Guaja

103
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:19,391
of the eastern Amazon.

104
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:26,385
Nurturing a wide range of creatures
from the forest,

105
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:29,827
the Awa are obsessive pet keepers.

106
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:40,628
And there are some animals
they cherish above any others.

107
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:48,553
Like the Matis, hunting monkeys
is vital to the Awa's survival,

108
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,031
providing nearly half their protein.

109
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:57,156
But this relationship
provides far more than food.

110
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:04,629
Emwi not only eats monkeys,
she loves them.

111
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:34,908
Almost all Awa families
keep a number of monkey pets.

112
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:40,276
There are eight different species
in the village.

113
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:44,595
The Awa show extraordinary
tenderness for the little monkeys,

114
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:48,073
believing they're more human
than animal.

115
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:57,915
Emwi is a devoted mother,
both to her children and her monkeys.

116
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:15,635
For Emwi and the other Awa,

117
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:21,354
breastfeeding monkeys is simply
a natural way to help an orphan in need.

118
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:35,474
Caring so intimately for an animal
they regularly kill

119
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:37,712
may appear contradictory,

120
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:41,227
but the Awa believe for everything
they take from the forest,

121
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:43,837
they have to give back.

122
00:16:53,037 --> 00:16:57,553
When our lives are so deeply
entwined with animals and plants,

123
00:16:57,597 --> 00:17:01,385
they inevitably become
a great source of inspiration.

124
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:06,829
Perhaps the most spectacular case
of culture imitating nature

125
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:10,506
is found amongst the people
of Papua New Guinea.

126
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:25,110
Deep in the forest,

127
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:31,232
a male superb bird of paradise struts
his stuff for a rather drab female

128
00:17:31,277 --> 00:17:35,190
but she isn't the only one watching.

129
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,635
Geling is a bird of paradise hunter,

130
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:49,431
and it's the highly prized feathers
he's after.

131
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,510
These coveted plumes are passed
down through generations

132
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:26,345
but occasionally damaged ones
need replacing.

133
00:18:28,197 --> 00:18:33,908
Birds of paradise are so hard to hunt,
however, that Geling's enlisted help.

134
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:44,111
Peke is after the long tail feathers
of the Princess Astrapia,

135
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:48,070
and he's using fruit to lure them in.

136
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:16,593
Tomorrow is a big day for Geling.

137
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:20,073
His clan will be performing
at a Sing Sing,

138
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,314
where his reputation
and the honour of his village

139
00:19:23,357 --> 00:19:26,986
will be judged on the quality
of his feather collection.

140
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:36,756
Sing Sing events are all about competing

141
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:39,072
to see who's the best-dressed,

142
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:42,587
and Geling knows not a plume
can be out of place.

143
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:57,389
In both birds and humans,

144
00:19:57,437 --> 00:20:01,476
it's the most eye-catching
who gets the most attention,

145
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:05,715
though Geling might be
overstating his conquests.

146
00:20:27,077 --> 00:20:28,590
(CHANTING)

147
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:34,946
The Mount Hagen Sing Sing

148
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:39,229
is the world's largest jungle-themed
fancy-dress party.

149
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:45,347
Attended by hundreds of tribes,

150
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:48,946
it's one of New Guinea's
biggest national events.

151
00:20:55,077 --> 00:21:00,276
Amidst the mayhem, Geling's putting
the finishing touches to his outfit.

152
00:21:06,757 --> 00:21:09,908
In New Guinea, male vanity
is something to flaunt.

153
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:20,996
Though each clan has its own style...

154
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:26,834
...almost all wear bird of paradise
feathers as their crowning glory.

155
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,512
In their looks,
and even their courtship dances,

156
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:41,347
the parallels between man and animal
are unmistakable.

157
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:49,195
They're birds of a feather.

158
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:55,346
Both use these precious plumes
to display fitness and beauty.

159
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:02,395
Taking centre stage,
it's Geling's turn to show off.

160
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:20,036
This deep connection with birds of
paradise began 40,000 years ago...

161
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:23,797
...and it shows few signs of fading.

162
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:29,393
Geling's getting on a bit,

163
00:22:29,437 --> 00:22:33,828
and his female admirers aren't quite
as plentiful as they used to be...

164
00:22:35,757 --> 00:22:38,749
...but he's not going to let that
ruffle his feathers.

165
00:22:44,277 --> 00:22:48,589
The diverse nature of the rainforest
influences the people who live here

166
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:50,434
in endless ways

167
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:54,868
and it often leads to
breathtaking results.

168
00:22:57,837 --> 00:23:01,716
For the Bayaka tribe
of Africa's Congo basin,

169
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:05,306
it's the sounds of the jungle
that most inspire them.

170
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:20,753
(RHYTHMIC BEAT)

171
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:37,633
Whether using a river as a drum kit...

172
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:44,754
...or incorporating animal calls
into their work songs...

173
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:54,076
...the Bayaka consider music to be
their greatest gift from the forest.

174
00:23:56,197 --> 00:23:58,916
(SINGING)

175
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:10,912
But there's something else found here
that the Bayaka prize just as highly.

176
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:15,394
So highly they're prepared
to risk their lives for it.

177
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:22,193
Tete and Mongonje are on the hunt,

178
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:25,195
but it's not meat they're after.

179
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:48,067
Honey is liquid gold to the Bayaka,

180
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:51,473
and they go to extraordinary lengths
to gather it.

181
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:54,877
Using a special vine,

182
00:24:54,917 --> 00:25:00,514
Tete makes a harness to help him
get to grips with this 40-metre tree.

183
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:12,307
Climbing like this requires skill,
strength and stamina,

184
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:15,633
especially in the tropical heat.

185
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:22,586
While Tete climbs, Mongonje prepares
a bundle of smoking leaves

186
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:24,992
to help pacify the bees.

187
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,793
An hour's passed and Tete's
making impressive progress.

188
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:02,189
But he's still got a way to go.

189
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:14,714
News that honey's been found
has spread quickly,

190
00:26:14,757 --> 00:26:18,033
and Tete's wife and kids
come to watch.

191
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:32,713
Tete's finally made it
to the crown of the tree

192
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:37,626
but to go any further he'll have to
leave the security of his vine.

193
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:04,515
Tete's fully aware how dangerous
honey gathering is,

194
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:08,232
but the Bayaka believe it's bravery
that makes the man,

195
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:11,633
and sugar is so scarce in these forests

196
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:16,034
that honey is the best nutrition
Tete can provide for his family.

197
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:58,075
40 metres up, and unattached,
Tete can't put a foot wrong.

198
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,868
And now the bees
are beginning to attack.

199
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,952
He's made it to the hive,

200
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:16,025
but he's got to get at the honey
before being overcome by bees.

201
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:27,187
The smoke helps,
but Tete's still being stung.

202
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:40,111
Finally Tete strikes gold.

203
00:28:54,997 --> 00:28:58,114
The first basket goes down
to Tete's family...

204
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:06,229
...and even thousands of angry bees
can't stop the feast.

205
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:32,829
Tete takes time to savour his success.

206
00:29:32,877 --> 00:29:36,836
He's done enough to keep
his wife sweet, treat his children

207
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:39,630
and earn respect from his tribe.

208
00:29:55,517 --> 00:30:01,706
For forest people, simple things
can hold extraordinary value,

209
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:06,911
but it's the trees themselves that are
most in demand all around the world.

210
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:23,387
Logging is one of the greatest threats
facing the world's rainforests.

211
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:28,227
Yet there are a few places where
its effects are far less destructive.

212
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:35,992
The jungles bordering India and Burma
are harvested

213
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:39,632
using one of the most forest-friendly
methods of all.

214
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:42,908
And it involves harnessing the raw power

215
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:45,869
of the mightiest creature in the jungle.

216
00:30:54,637 --> 00:31:00,109
This is Ramprasad - five-and-a-half tonnes
of bull Asian elephant.

217
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:04,790
And this is Sumir, his mahout.

218
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:10,836
Before nightfall, they have to drag
a two-tonne log

219
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:13,471
three kilometres out of the forest.

220
00:31:15,837 --> 00:31:19,386
Ramprasad is the mightiest elephant
in the camp,

221
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:24,306
but it's still a mammoth test of
brute strength and communication.

222
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:32,311
Sumir steers Ramprasad
with over 1 00 different commands.

223
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:43,631
He can be operated in Hindi,
Assamese

224
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:47,033
and he even understands
a little English.

225
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:53,266
And Sumir's pretty fluent
in elephant too.

226
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:09,706
Unbelievably strong
and surprisingly nimble,

227
00:32:09,757 --> 00:32:14,547
elephants are far superior to
logging machines in this tangled terrain.

228
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:22,029
And most importantly, the forest
doesn't have to be completely cleared

229
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:25,114
just to access a few selected trees.

230
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:50,110
There's no need for expensive spare parts,

231
00:32:50,157 --> 00:32:54,673
and elephants run on 1 00% green fuel.

232
00:32:58,597 --> 00:33:03,546
But, unlike a machine,
Ramprasad has a mind of his own

233
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:06,794
and must be treated with respect.

234
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:21,954
It's essential to break elephants in
before they're put to work,

235
00:33:21,997 --> 00:33:24,795
but they're still wild at heart,

236
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:29,353
and keeping control of such raw might
is a fine balancing act

237
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,149
of command and compassion.

238
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:50,392
Sumir and Ramprasad make it
to the collection site in good time

239
00:33:50,437 --> 00:33:52,393
and help load the trucks.

240
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:58,712
Transporting logs to the sawmill

241
00:33:58,757 --> 00:34:02,227
is the only mechanised part
of the entire process.

242
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:11,509
But they're not out of the woods yet.

243
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:24,509
Once again, underjungle conditions,
elephants out-perform engines.

244
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:36,667
Job done, time for a well-earned wash.

245
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:46,986
The jungles of East India and Burma

246
00:34:47,037 --> 00:34:50,393
form the largest area of rainforest
left in Asia

247
00:34:50,437 --> 00:34:55,227
and provide sanctuary for the last
healthy population of Asian elephants.

248
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:05,194
Ramprasad and these other elephants
have lost their freedom,

249
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:08,832
but this way of logging helps secure
the future of their species

250
00:35:08,877 --> 00:35:10,071
and their home.

251
00:35:14,557 --> 00:35:17,276
It's through partnerships with nature

252
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:21,868
that people manage to live within
the jungle without destroying it.

253
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:31,234
But in most areas of tropical rainforest,
the picture is not so harmonious.

254
00:35:41,157 --> 00:35:46,914
In just 50 years, half the planet's
tropical forest has been cleared.

255
00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:55,225
As many as 1 00 rainforest species
go extinct every day...

256
00:35:56,877 --> 00:36:00,347
...often before
they've even been discovered.

257
00:36:06,077 --> 00:36:09,035
And it's not just animals and plants.

258
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:15,186
We're also losing human cultures
that we know almost nothing about.

259
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,910
Even in the 2 1st century,

260
00:36:21,957 --> 00:36:27,031
there are still people who exist
in isolation from the rest of humanity,

261
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:30,467
and virtually all live in jungles.

262
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:38,865
These vast, unexplored forests
are the only places left on Earth

263
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:42,671
where entire communities
can live undetected.

264
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:48,792
Brazil is thought to be home
to around 70 isolated tribes,

265
00:36:48,837 --> 00:36:51,909
around two-thirds of the world total.

266
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:57,750
Jose Carlos Meirelles works for FUNAI,

267
00:36:57,797 --> 00:37:01,585
a government agency that protects
Brazil's indigenous people.

268
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,346
Today he's hoping to encounter
one of these uncontacted tribes.

269
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:15,112
He needs to get to them
before others do.

270
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:37,592
Logging and mining
are encroaching on these forests

271
00:37:37,637 --> 00:37:39,867
and there are some who want to deny

272
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:43,626
that uncontacted tribes
live here at all.

273
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:05,870
Meirelles needs evidence.

274
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,147
The fight to protect these people

275
00:38:08,197 --> 00:38:11,951
depends upon proving
and publicising their existence.

276
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:34,707
This is the very first aerial footage
of an uncontacted community.

277
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:57,306
Very little is known about their
way of life or even their language,

278
00:38:57,357 --> 00:39:01,430
and Meirelles would rather
it stays that way.

279
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:11,468
He's dedicated 40 years to protecting
isolated tribes from the outside world,

280
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:15,396
but this isn't as simple
as just leaving them alone.

281
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:39,149
Using a stabilised zoom lens,

282
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:42,189
it was possible to film
from a kilometre away,

283
00:39:42,237 --> 00:39:44,910
minimising disturbance.

284
00:39:44,957 --> 00:39:49,189
Meirelles believes the more people
are aware these tribes are here,

285
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:53,549
the more effective the fight
to preserve their way of life.

286
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:36,591
Humans have survived here
by becoming part of the forest,

287
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,628
but it's this specialisation

288
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:42,750
that leaves them so vulnerable
in these changing times.

289
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:57,271
These people are the guardians of
a wealth of knowledge and skill

290
00:40:57,317 --> 00:41:01,947
that enable humans to forge a life
within the natural world.

291
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:09,788
And there are very few
whose existence remains

292
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:12,715
as intimately connected
with the rainforest

293
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:15,510
as the remote tribes of West Papua.

294
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:32,116
The Korowai are so adapted to life in
the jungle, they've taken to the trees.

295
00:41:33,677 --> 00:41:36,987
(SHOUTING)

296
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:40,586
This clan is building a new house...

297
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:47,113
(SHOUTING)

298
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:49,751
...but it will be no ordinary one.

299
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:55,266
All materials must be sourced on site,

300
00:41:55,317 --> 00:42:01,074
and much of the cutting is still done
using stone-age tools.

301
00:42:04,757 --> 00:42:07,510
It's an ambitious project.

302
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:13,996
The plan is to build their new home
in a tree 35 metres up.

303
00:42:17,717 --> 00:42:21,107
Just as well they've chosen an ironwood,

304
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:23,591
the strongest tree in the forest.

305
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:30,830
The first step is to build
a ladder to its crown.

306
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:46,073
These are the only tribes in the world
who live in tree houses...

307
00:42:47,957 --> 00:42:51,506
...and they do so for a number of reasons.

308
00:42:54,997 --> 00:43:00,674
It's an escape from the floods and
the biting insects on the forest floor.

309
00:43:00,717 --> 00:43:03,834
It offers protection
from enemy attack,

310
00:43:03,877 --> 00:43:08,428
but most of all, it's a display
of theirjungle prowess.

311
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:14,871
For the Korowai, the higher the house,
the greater the prestige.

312
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:28,833
The Korowai's skills may be exceptional,

313
00:43:28,877 --> 00:43:32,267
but builders are the same the world over.

314
00:43:42,637 --> 00:43:45,310
As one of the clan's
strongest climbers,

315
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:49,316
Wayo is the foreman overseeing
the most dangerous jobs.

316
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:07,348
Thinning the branches keeps the house
from shaking apart in the wind.

317
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:16,708
A fall would mean certain death,

318
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:20,989
but teetering in tree-tops
is second nature to the Korowai.

319
00:44:32,597 --> 00:44:35,031
(WHOOPING)

320
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:46,029
As the house goes up,
more trees come down.

321
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,593
But they have to fall
in the right direction.

322
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:09,395
Activity on the building site is intense.

323
00:45:10,477 --> 00:45:15,187
The rainy season is fast approaching
and the roof still needs to go on.

324
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:24,950
Everyone's pulling their weight
to complete on schedule.

325
00:45:39,397 --> 00:45:43,026
The roof is tiled with sago-palm leaves

326
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:46,672
and rolls of tree bark
make the floor and walls.

327
00:46:02,197 --> 00:46:07,590
In two weeks, with 42 workers,
countless felled trees,

328
00:46:07,637 --> 00:46:12,836
30 bundles of palm leaves, 1 6 rolls
of bark and 5 kilometres of twine,

329
00:46:12,877 --> 00:46:16,233
the new home is complete.

330
00:46:18,757 --> 00:46:21,112
It's time to move in.

331
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:41,545
As always, modesty dictates
a strict entrance policy.

332
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:55,786
Everything must be carried up,
even family pets

333
00:46:55,837 --> 00:47:00,149
and it's a long way back down
if you forget something.

334
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:11,067
The first fire is ceremonially lit,

335
00:47:11,117 --> 00:47:15,156
an interesting way to bless
a wooden tree house,

336
00:47:15,197 --> 00:47:19,076
but health and safety regulations
have yet to reach these parts.

337
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:30,270
Parents are surprisingly relaxed

338
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:33,514
as their children explore their limits
in the new home.

339
00:48:02,037 --> 00:48:05,746
Through knowledge, skill and ingenuity

340
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:10,029
rainforest people
have mastered their environment.

341
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:15,555
They live in tune with their surroundings

342
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:19,556
and show it a respect
that's being lost elsewhere.

343
00:48:23,157 --> 00:48:29,596
Their remarkable lives remind us
that we are nothing without nature.

344
00:48:52,717 --> 00:48:55,629
Documenting the Papuan
tree house build

345
00:48:55,677 --> 00:48:58,714
was the most challenging shoot
for the Jungles team.

346
00:48:58,757 --> 00:49:03,194
They came prepared for two weeks
filming in the tree-tops,

347
00:49:03,237 --> 00:49:08,675
but when things went wrong, it was
the Korowai who saved the day.

348
00:49:18,677 --> 00:49:23,671
This shoot took cameraman Gavin
Thurston, researcher Rachael Kinley

349
00:49:23,717 --> 00:49:25,787
and producer Tom Hugh-Jones

350
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,954
to some of the least explored
jungles in the world.

351
00:49:28,997 --> 00:49:32,353
We're about five days into the trip,

352
00:49:32,397 --> 00:49:35,434
we had a safe flight in, we had
a very good welcome committee,

353
00:49:35,477 --> 00:49:38,913
and I believe it's about
a three-day walk from here.

354
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,035
No going back now.

355
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:48,829
Though local porters
help lighten the load,

356
00:49:48,877 --> 00:49:53,632
trekking through the swampy jungle
proves tougher than expected.

357
00:49:56,237 --> 00:49:59,593
Well, I thought, if he's going in,
we've got to show willing, haven't we?

358
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:02,071
I was going to come and help,
but I've just fallen in.

359
00:50:04,477 --> 00:50:09,232
But with only two weeks'filming,
they have to push on.

360
00:50:10,597 --> 00:50:15,387
The crew eventually arrive at
Lahayu's village to a warm welcome,

361
00:50:15,437 --> 00:50:17,109
Korowai style.

362
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:25,867
This is Ninkana, and we are beginning
the five minutes of handshake

363
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:28,511
that seems to be necessary
when you meet someone.

364
00:50:29,717 --> 00:50:32,106
Then it's time to talk business.

365
00:50:41,757 --> 00:50:46,672
Gavin's already spotted
some local wildlife in unusual places.

366
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:49,277
This is Nasai,
if I've got his name right.

367
00:50:49,317 --> 00:50:50,830
He's got these amazing, um,

368
00:50:50,877 --> 00:50:53,471
apart from an amazing hornbill...

369
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,632
penis sheath,

370
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,510
he's got these feathers
on the side here.

371
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:01,310
Yakob. I think that's
the sulphur-crested cockatoo.

372
00:51:01,357 --> 00:51:03,917
(IMITATES COCKATOO)
Noisy, yeah?

373
00:51:03,957 --> 00:51:05,106
What else?

374
00:51:05,157 --> 00:51:07,307
Mambro.
(IMITATES PIGEON)

375
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:09,234
Pigeon?

376
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:12,075
And the hornbill?

377
00:51:12,117 --> 00:51:13,789
Pfff...

378
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,351
There we are, so that's
today's nature lesson!

379
00:51:17,637 --> 00:51:21,949
The crew go to inspect the ironwood tree
the Korowai have chosen.

380
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:26,315
Well, the Korowai
have found a really good tree.

381
00:51:26,357 --> 00:51:28,791
It's probably about 70 feet
up to where they plan

382
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:31,988
to build the tree house.
It's looking good.

383
00:51:32,037 --> 00:51:37,065
A line is fired into a nearby tree
to rig a camera position

384
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:40,029
but the rope gets caught.

385
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:44,034
One of these guys
has just shinned right up there.

386
00:51:44,077 --> 00:51:45,715
It's an unbelievable bit of climbing.

387
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:48,112
All I can say is, if that was
anybody else up there,

388
00:51:48,157 --> 00:51:51,513
my heart would be in my throat,
but he just looks so at ease.

389
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:57,548
Problem solved, thanks to the Korowai.

390
00:51:57,597 --> 00:52:02,068
Now the ropes are up,
it's Gavin's turn to impress.

391
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:04,551
I think these guys are fascinated

392
00:52:04,597 --> 00:52:09,512
by how much paraphernalia
we need to get up a tree.

393
00:52:09,557 --> 00:52:12,788
Especially when I can't do it properly.

394
00:52:14,477 --> 00:52:19,835
The Korowai begin building
at an astonishing rate,

395
00:52:19,877 --> 00:52:23,586
leaving Gavin struggling to keep up.

396
00:52:23,637 --> 00:52:28,267
Just as he gets into the swing of things,
rain stops play.

397
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:32,989
It's been raining for 1 7 hours solid,
I can't believe it.

398
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:35,153
When it's this wet
it's not safe for them to climb,

399
00:52:35,197 --> 00:52:36,516
the logs are really slippery.

400
00:52:36,557 --> 00:52:38,627
The water table has risen so much now

401
00:52:38,677 --> 00:52:40,747
we've got standing water everywhere,

402
00:52:40,797 --> 00:52:42,992
and the other detail
you probably don't want to know

403
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:46,234
is that the long drop too
is completely full.

404
00:52:46,277 --> 00:52:51,670
With work at a standstill,
the crew are invited for a social visit.

405
00:52:51,717 --> 00:52:53,116
It's a childhood dream.

406
00:52:53,157 --> 00:52:56,991
It's one of my first memories -
when I was about six or seven,

407
00:52:57,037 --> 00:52:59,551
building a tree house
about four foot off the ground

408
00:52:59,597 --> 00:53:01,030
in an apple tree in the garden

409
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,545
and here I am coming to film
the world experts.

410
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,475
All Korowai houses
are split into gender zones...

411
00:53:08,317 --> 00:53:13,266
...and, on the women's side,
Rachael's attracting a lot of attention.

412
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:19,752
They seem to be wanting to get me
to dress a bit like them.

413
00:53:20,957 --> 00:53:24,233
Before long she's going native.

414
00:53:27,877 --> 00:53:29,868
A little more than expected.

415
00:53:31,437 --> 00:53:33,871
With the skirt safely fastened,

416
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:37,876
all that's left is for her
to lose her trousers.

417
00:53:39,357 --> 00:53:43,873
We've had two hours of bonding
with these people.

418
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:47,671
It's just been really nice to sit down
and get to know the tribe

419
00:53:47,717 --> 00:53:50,948
and to share some jokes with them,
let them laugh at us

420
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:53,750
and see a bit of their life.

421
00:53:54,837 --> 00:53:58,625
When the rain stops,
the Korowai get going

422
00:53:58,677 --> 00:54:02,033
but Gavin's being encumbered
by all his gear.

423
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:09,029
I wonder if anybody's ever filmed
a heart attack on a rope before.

424
00:54:09,077 --> 00:54:14,947
Once at the top of the tree,
Gavin's kit comes into its own.

425
00:54:14,997 --> 00:54:17,909
This is quite a clever device,
called a tree pod.

426
00:54:17,957 --> 00:54:19,106
It's got a couple of spikes

427
00:54:19,157 --> 00:54:21,955
and when you strap it to the tree
you get a really good solid base.

428
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:24,557
The camera goes on top of there.

429
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:27,111
The tree they've chosen
to put the tree house in,

430
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:31,146
turns out it's the tallest tree
for a good few hundred metres.

431
00:54:31,197 --> 00:54:35,110
And one of the things we wanted to do
is be able to see the tree house

432
00:54:35,157 --> 00:54:39,230
in its environment, up in the canopy,
and give a sense of height.

433
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,950
It must be getting on for ten storeys high

434
00:54:41,997 --> 00:54:44,147
and just made out of sticks and rattan.

435
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:47,553
It's quite an incredible
bit of engineering.

436
00:54:47,597 --> 00:54:50,589
The whole time
they've been building this tree house,

437
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:53,390
there've just been really scary moments.

438
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:56,827
Right now there's quite a large tree
they're trying to fell

439
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,311
but they are worried it might fall
towards the tree house

440
00:54:59,357 --> 00:55:00,585
and take out the ladder.

441
00:55:00,637 --> 00:55:02,309
So instead of everybody getting out,

442
00:55:02,357 --> 00:55:05,713
there's three guys with long poles
just pushing it out the way

443
00:55:05,757 --> 00:55:08,066
and they've got two more down here
with a bit of rattan

444
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:11,348
pulling it, in the hope that
it will go away from the platform,

445
00:55:11,397 --> 00:55:14,150
but if it goes the wrong way,
those three guys are going to die!

446
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:20,315
(WHOOPING)

447
00:55:20,357 --> 00:55:26,387
Another tree falls. This time
it's a little too close for comfort.

448
00:55:26,437 --> 00:55:30,828
Well, luckily they judged that one right
and it didn't come our way.

449
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:40,066
The building's near completion, but
Gavin still has to shoot the big reveal.

450
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:42,756
We've set up a line
from the tree the tree house is in

451
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:45,152
across to where I was filming
from the tree pod.

452
00:55:45,197 --> 00:55:48,428
We're going to put the cable dolly on
and get a really nice pull back

453
00:55:48,477 --> 00:55:51,150
to reveal the tree house
right up in the canopy.

454
00:55:51,197 --> 00:55:54,189
(BEEPING)

455
00:55:54,237 --> 00:55:55,590
Please, baby.

456
00:55:55,637 --> 00:55:57,195
It won't go anywhere.

457
00:55:57,237 --> 00:56:00,195
- What has happened?
- (BEEPING)

458
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:01,875
It's died!

459
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:05,710
For the first time ever.

460
00:56:06,757 --> 00:56:09,555
Oh, (BLEEP)!

461
00:56:10,797 --> 00:56:14,836
Yet again the Korowai
come to the rescue.

462
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:19,311
Traditional Korowai craftsmanship,

463
00:56:19,357 --> 00:56:23,714
a stick with another little bit of stick
tied on the end.

464
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:25,031
Come on, baby!

465
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:30,505
Gavin retrieves the camera dolly
in time for supper.

466
00:56:31,957 --> 00:56:37,190
Food supplies are running low
so the Korowai serve up a local delicacy.

467
00:56:37,237 --> 00:56:38,226
Sago grubs.

468
00:56:38,277 --> 00:56:43,397
They're basically giant beetle grubs
that live inside the sago palms.

469
00:56:43,437 --> 00:56:45,075
And they are a delicacy.

470
00:56:45,117 --> 00:56:48,826
The crunch at the end when you chew
their teeth perhaps isn't the best.

471
00:56:48,877 --> 00:56:51,232
But other than that
they are all right.

472
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:54,155
GAVIN: You kept saying
you wanted protein.

473
00:56:55,677 --> 00:56:57,076
He's gagging!

474
00:56:57,117 --> 00:57:00,792
RACHAEL: I think they taste like caviar.
It's got that pop in your mouth.

475
00:57:00,837 --> 00:57:02,236
- Do you like them?
- Mmmm.

476
00:57:02,277 --> 00:57:05,713
- You can have the rest, then.
- Ah! Thanks. Some more!

477
00:57:05,757 --> 00:57:09,545
GAVIN: The verdict on the sago grubs is,
they are edible

478
00:57:09,597 --> 00:57:12,236
but they are actually
pretty disgusting!

479
00:57:12,277 --> 00:57:14,507
I'm still chewing!

480
00:57:15,997 --> 00:57:20,115
It's the final day and Gavin's last chance
to shoot the grand finale.

481
00:57:20,157 --> 00:57:23,388
Today, it's all come together.
The sun's shining,

482
00:57:23,437 --> 00:57:26,873
the guys are being really helpful
and the cable dolly is behaving itself

483
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:31,547
and hopefully this is the end shot
for the sequence and the programme.

484
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:39,393
It's just been incredible
seeing the whole process

485
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:42,907
of how they build the house
this high up in the canopy.

486
00:57:42,957 --> 00:57:46,745
They all seem to have settled in
very well. Most of them are asleep now.

487
00:57:48,437 --> 00:57:50,587
I'm knackered as well, actually.

488
00:57:51,877 --> 00:57:53,515
Spending time with the Korowai

489
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:57,232
has given Gavin
a different perspective on life.

490
00:57:57,277 --> 00:58:01,748
I find I judge my own inadequacies
against their expertise and knowledge.

491
00:58:01,797 --> 00:58:05,073
You come here and you've got
boots on in case of snake bites,

492
00:58:05,117 --> 00:58:07,233
you've got sun cream on
because of the sun,

493
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:09,996
you've got twin safety ropes
to make sure, if one fails,

494
00:58:10,037 --> 00:58:11,470
you are caught on the other one.

495
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:15,066
And these guys, OK,
maybe they have a higher mortality rate,

496
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,392
but they're much freer
in their lifestyle.

497
00:58:17,437 --> 00:58:20,235
You know, they're shinning
up and down these trees.

498
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:25,112
I think I'd much rather live a shorter,
fuller life, like they do out here.
