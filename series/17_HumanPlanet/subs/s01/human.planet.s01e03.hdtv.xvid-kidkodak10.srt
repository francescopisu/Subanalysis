00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:10,529
They're afterjust one whale.

172
00:24:13,977 --> 00:24:16,093
It's an ambush.

173
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:26,695
The narwhal pass
within 50 feet of Mikele...

174
00:24:28,777 --> 00:24:31,974
...but still all three hunters wait.

175
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:39,012
If he strikes too soon,
the whole pod will dive.

176
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:53,812
His eye is on the stragglers
bringing up the rear.

177
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:11,926
Especially in the final approach,
Mikele must be silent...

178
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:16,656
...and directly behind his prey.

00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:31,175
Their success will benefit
the whole community.

182
00:26:31,217 --> 00:26:36,166
The single narwhal will feed
their families for weeks, if not months.

183
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:50,529
The most prized part
of the narwhal is the skin.

184
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:52,533
They call it muktuk.

185
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:56,047
It's their primary source of vitamin C.

186
00:26:56,097 --> 00:27:02,445
Ounce for ounce, narwhal skin contains
almost as much vitamin C as oranges.

187
00:27:10,177 --> 00:27:11,576
Without narwhal,

188
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:15,610
it's doubtful the Inuit would ever
have survived in this part of the Arctic.

189
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:25,093
It's now July,
and the sun finally wins its battle.

190
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:30,286
The sea ice melts into open ocean.

191
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:38,007
To find food,
man turns his attention to the land.

192
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:50,969
Siorapaluk, Greenland, is the northernmost
native settlement on Earth.

193
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:56,927
Every year, Maassannguaq Oshima
is treated to a spectacle.

194
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,455
Millions of little auks on migration.

195
00:28:02,937 --> 00:28:06,054
They come here to breed on the cliffs.

196
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:10,971
And for predators,

197
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:14,726
there's a mouth-watering supply
of protein whizzing overhead.

198
00:28:17,497 --> 00:28:19,613
If you can reach it.

199
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:05,816
Thousands of years ago,

200
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:11,056
Maassannguaq's ancestors worked out how
to make nets out of sinew and driftwood.

201
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:16,847
And they created the same hiding spots
he uses today.

202
00:29:28,937 --> 00:29:32,213
On a good day, Maassannguaq
can gather up to 500 birds.

203
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:38,928
But he won't eat them now.

204
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:45,769
He'll take his cue from a fellow hunter.

205
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:50,611
Arctic foxes often stuff
a few birds underground,

206
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:54,491
so that when times are lean,
they'll have food to fall back on.

207
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,776
The birds can be used to make kiviak,

208
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:15,287
a dish that you save for a rainy day.

209
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:21,054
The recipe is thousands of years old,
and it goes like this.

210
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:25,168
Take one seal skin.

211
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:31,807
Stuff as many little auks inside it
as you can.

212
00:30:34,497 --> 00:30:37,091
At least 500.

213
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,092
Sew it up.

214
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:43,970
Make sure you press all the air out.

215
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:53,013
Seal fat repels flies,
so be generous when coating the seams.

216
00:30:54,497 --> 00:31:00,208
And finally, use a big rock
to make sure no more air gets in.

217
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:10,414
Maassannguaq's kiviak
won't be ready for three months,

218
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:13,847
but the frozen ground
is a natural refrigerator.

219
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:21,051
Come winter, he and his family
will have a vital supply of food.

220
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:32,606
It's now September.

221
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:38,535
Days are getting shorter
and temperatures are plummeting.

222
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:43,332
The few plants that have managed
to grow over the short arctic summer

223
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:45,254
are dying back.

224
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:52,851
This is exactly what is happening
on Arnoy island, northern Norway.

225
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:03,056
3,000 reindeer
have been grazing here all summer.

226
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:07,493
But now they have to move,

227
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:14,295
because their winter food source, lichen,
can only be found 450 kilometres away.

228
00:32:15,377 --> 00:32:20,849
And to get to it, they'll have to
cross this, the Arnoy strait.

Elle-Helene Siri is in charge of leading
these reindeer across the water.

231
00:32:32,777 --> 00:32:36,850
She belongs to a family
of Sami reindeer herders.

232
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:46,255
Before the migration begins,

233
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,051
Elle helps split the deer
into smaller groups

234
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:52,008
so they can give them vital medicine.

On the day she was born,
Elle was given a portion of this herd.

00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:20,652
Now aged 20, and a recent graduate
of Norway's reindeer college,

238
00:33:20,697 --> 00:33:24,690
it's up to her to make sure they all
survive the perilous journey ahead.

239
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:34,693
It will take nearly a month for these deer
to migrate to their winter pastures.

240
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:40,493
But today is the toughest day of all,

241
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:44,689
because the deer have to swim two
and a half kilometres across the channel.

These chilly arctic waters

245
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:08,691
Even for adult reindeer
this is a long swim.

246
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:18,529
But for this year's calves,
which have never been in the water before,

247
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:20,533
it's a marathon.

For Elle, it's a tense moment...

251

...because if one calf turns around
and swims back, the rest could follow.

A baby female is in trouble,
and suddenly, she turns back.

253
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:52,289
Elle must stop her
or the whole migration could derail.

become the Inuit delicacy known as kiviak.

It's easy to tell if your kiviak is ready
by the aroma.

265
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:50,652
It should sting the nostrils.

trick-or-treaters weren't the only ones
stalking the streets last night.

346
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:07,015
Lured into the cage by seal meat,
this male weighs over half a ton.

347
00:44:13,657 --> 00:44:19,254
This bear is sedated and will be flown
at least 60 kilometres outside of town.

348
00:44:26,617 --> 00:44:28,016
In the past,

349
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:33,085
an average of 75 bears per year
have been transported out of Churchill.

350
00:44:38,417 --> 00:44:42,376
But in recent years,
the number of invading bears has halved

351
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:46,012
because in this part of the Arctic,
polar bears are in decline.

352
00:44:56,377 --> 00:45:00,290
They have timed the sedative
so that it wears off soon after they land.

353
00:45:02,977 --> 00:45:07,892
This is done so that bears can protect
themselves from other bears in the area.

354
00:45:08,897 --> 00:45:14,255
For Officer Windsor, it means working fast
before this bear fully wakes up.

could be fatal.

about 400 kilos between six people.

So, to say we're travelling light
is possibly a little understatement!

With the kit and a person on board,

398

each dogsled is having to carry
about 1 00 kilos of freight,

DOUG: You can quite distinctly
see the movement here.

408
00:50:12,537 --> 00:50:16,246
The swell's coming in from the open ocean
and it's just breaking it up.

409
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:20,006
And this little crack here,
which you can put your finger down,

410
00:50:20,057 --> 00:50:23,367
maybe 1 5 minutes from now,
it's gonna be this wide.

Half an hour,
it will be too wide to cross.

So, you really have to be careful.
This ice is on the move all the time.

413
00:50:29,857 --> 00:50:33,975
The Inuit hunters
decide the ice is too unstable

414
00:50:34,017 --> 00:50:38,215
and the expedition
is forced back to the safety of land.

415
00:50:38,257 --> 00:50:40,452
After five and a half hours of travelling,

416
00:50:40,497 --> 00:50:43,375
we've come all the way across
the...the inlet.

417
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:47,649
The ice edge is still unstable
so I think we'll wait the night out here

418
00:50:47,697 --> 00:50:50,814
and then maybe
have a look-see tomorrow.

419
00:50:52,057 --> 00:50:53,456
The next morning,

420
00:50:53,497 --> 00:50:56,853
they pick their way
across broken tidal ice to the sleds,

421
00:50:56,897 --> 00:50:58,933
to check out the situation.

422
00:50:58,977 --> 00:51:03,050
I'm pleased that the hunters made
the decision they did, because overnight,

423
00:51:03,097 --> 00:51:06,851
we've lost three or four kilometres
of the ice shelf,

424
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,606
which is now disappearing
rapidly in that direction.

425
00:51:12,297 --> 00:51:16,813
As we were coming into the fjord just now,
we actually crossed our tracks,

426
00:51:16,857 --> 00:51:21,647
and they disappeared off into the water,
which was quite a sobering thought.

427
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:27,207
When they do reach the edge,
they can't believe their luck,

428
00:51:27,257 --> 00:51:29,691
as Mamarut quickly spots some narwhal.

429
00:51:32,137 --> 00:51:35,095
We've just seen some narwhal
further along the ice edge,

430
00:51:35,137 --> 00:51:38,049
so the guys are getting the kayaks ready

431
00:51:38,097 --> 00:51:42,807
because if the narwhals come close,
they might try to hunt them.

432
00:51:44,377 --> 00:51:46,766
Doug's ready to capture the action.

433
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:54,976
But just when Gedion is in position
to harpoon, the narwhal dives.

434
00:51:59,657 --> 00:52:03,093
They wait and hope
for the whales to resurface.

435
00:52:04,577 --> 00:52:09,093
It's now one o'clock in the morning.
We've been here for about 1 2 hours.

436
00:52:09,137 --> 00:52:11,492
The narwhal have gone

437
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:16,088
but the hunters are still pretty sure
that they're going to come back,

438
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:20,210
and we're still waiting,
and we're all getting very tired.

439
00:52:23,897 --> 00:52:27,094
24-hour daylight
melts the ice from above,

440
00:52:27,137 --> 00:52:31,574
and ocean swells
stress the ice from beneath.

441
00:52:31,617 --> 00:52:34,575
It's not the safest place to camp,

as there's more than ten kilometres before
they reach the safety of the village.

500
00:57:03,097 --> 00:57:08,217
Within sight of home, an inexperienced
dog team makes a serious error.

501
00:57:08,257 --> 00:57:11,169
(SHOUTING)

502
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,653
(SHOUTING)

503
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:22,685
An unseen crack has opened up
just metres from the village.

504
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:27,726
Any wider and the fully laden sledge
would sink to the bottom,

505
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,768
dragging the dogs under.

506
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:35,052
There's a dog trapped under the sledge

507
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:39,807
but, miraculously,
even this one emerges unharmed.

508
00:57:41,817 --> 00:57:46,607
Doug and the rest of the crew spot
the problem and find a better route home.

509
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:52,135
It was another week
before the ice was safe enough

510
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,772
for the crew to film
the full narwhal hunt sequence.

511
00:57:56,777 --> 00:57:59,166
This shoot, more than any other,

512
00:57:59,217 --> 00:58:02,289
highlights the importance
of the complete trust

513
00:58:02,337 --> 00:58:06,012
between the Human Planet crew
and the local Inuit,

514
00:58:06,057 --> 00:58:10,926
in a place where knowing your environment
is the key to survival.
