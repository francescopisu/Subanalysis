1
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,232
Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

2
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:51,903
A shadow grows on the wall behind
you, swallowing you in darkness.

3
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,947
- It is almost here.
- What is it?

4
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,365
What if it's the Demogorgon?

5
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,493
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

6
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,620
It's not the Demogorgon.

7
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,955
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

8
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,166
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya.

9
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,063
Wait a minute.

10
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,673
Did you hear that?

11
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,175
That... that sound?

12
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,927
Boom... boom...

13
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,763
Boom!

14
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,747
That didn't come from the
troglodytes. No, that...

15
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:21,516
That came from something else.

16
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,937
The Demogorgon!

17
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,481
- We're in deep shit.
- Will, your action!

18
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:28,857
- I don't know!
- Fireball him!

19
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,233
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

20
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,152
Too risky. Cast a protection spell.

21
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,780
- Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
- Cast Protection.

22
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,574
The Demogorgon is tired of
your silly human bickering!

23
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,451
It stomps towards you.

24
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,535
- Boom!
- Fireball him!

25
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,913
- Another stomp, boom!
- Cast Protection.

26
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,832
He roars in anger!

27
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,417
Fireball!

28
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,127
- Oh, shit!
- Where'd it go?

29
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,921
- Where is it?
- I don't know!

30
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,547
- Is it a 13?
- I don't know!

31
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,799
- Where is it?
- Oh, my God!

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,467
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:56,635
- Mike!
- Can you find it yet?

34
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:57,803
No, I can't find it!

35
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,554
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,431
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

37
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,642
You mean the end? Fifteen after.

38
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:06,913
- Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
- Why do we have to go?

39
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:09,689
- Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
- It's a school night, Michael.

40
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,234
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

41
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,860
- But that'll ruin the flow!
- Michael...

42
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,195
I'm serious, Mom.

43
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,739
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,923
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

45
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:21,901
You've been playing for ten hours?

46
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:26,832
- Dad, don't you think that 20 more...
- I think you should listen to your mother.

47
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,394
Dang dumb piece of junk.

48
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,380
Oh, I got it!

49
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,358
- Does the seven count?
- It was a seven?

50
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,569
Did Mike see it? Then it doesn't count.

51
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,349
Yo, hey, guys.

52
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,327
- Does anyone want this?
- No.

53
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,957
Yeah.

54
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,334
No, I don't think...

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,027
Yeah, he's cute.

56
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,448
Barb, no, I don't think so.

57
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,008
- Barb, you're not...
- Hey, Nancy.

58
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,247
There's a slice left if you want it.

59
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:05,684
- Sausage and pepperoni!
- Hold on.

60
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:16,465
- There's something wrong with your sister.
- What are you talking about?

61
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,341
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,927
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

63
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,763
Yeah, she's turning into a real jerk.

64
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,181
She's always been a real jerk.

65
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,141
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

66
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,845
Like that time she dressed up as
an elf for our Elder tree campaign.

67
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:29,912
Four years ago!

68
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,557
- Just saying.
- Later.

69
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,066
- It was a seven.
- Huh?

70
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,919
The roll, it was a seven.

71
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,214
The Demogorgon, it got me.

72
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:43,259
See you tomorrow.

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,944
- Good night, ladies.
- Kiss your mom 'night for me.

74
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,347
Race you back to my
place? Winner gets a comic.

75
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:07,116
- Any comic?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:10,101
Hey! Hey!

77
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,163
I didn't say "go"!

78
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,233
Get back here!

79
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,443
I'm gonna kill you!

80
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,963
I'll take your X-Men 134!

81
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,804
Son of a bitch.

82
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,222
Mom?

83
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,867
Jonathan? Mom?

84
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:56,499
Hello? Hello?

85
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:10,089
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

86
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,488
And that's it for News
Center this morning.

87
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,906
Thanks for joining us.

88
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,283
Let's hand off now to
Liz at the news desk.

89
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,785
All right, thank you, Donna.

90
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:37,952
Turning now to local news,

91
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,456
we're getting reports of surges and
power outages all across the county.

92
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:44,501
Last night, hundreds of homes
in East Hawkins were affected,

93
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,961
leaving many residents in the dark.

94
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,172
The cause of the
outage is still unknown.

95
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,466
We reached out to Roane
County Water and Electric,

96
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:54,094
and a spokesperson says
that they are confident

97
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,763
power will be restored
to all remaining homes

98
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,389
within the next several hours.

99
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,143
Mmm.

100
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,784
In other news, you might
wanna stay home tonight

101
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,161
or at least pack an umbrella.

102
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,663
We turn to everybody's favorite
morning weather guy, Charles.

103
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,170
Where the hell are they?

104
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,672
- Jonathan?
- Check the couch!

105
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:13,899
Ugh, I did.

106
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,486
Oh... Got them.

107
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,930
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

108
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,849
- Yeah, see you later.
- Where's Will?

109
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,017
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

110
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,226
He's probably still sleeping.

111
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,438
- Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
- Mom, I'm making breakfast.

112
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,356
I told you this a thousand times.

113
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,086
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

114
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,825
- He came home last night, right?
- He's not in his room?

115
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,202
- Did he come home or not?
- I don't know.

116
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,537
- You don't know?
- No.

117
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,664
I got home late. I was working.

118
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,790
You were working?

119
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,792
Eric asked if I could
cover. I said yeah.

120
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,496
I just thought we could
use the extra cash.

121
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:54,130
- Jonathan, we've talked about this.
- I know, I know.

122
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,132
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

123
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,735
Mom, it's not a big deal. Look,
he was at the Wheelers' all day.

124
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:01,488
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- I can't believe you.

125
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:03,824
I can't believe you sometimes.

126
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,355
That's disgusting.

127
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:12,649
- You're disgusting!
- Hello?

128
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,484
Hi, Karen. It's Joyce.

129
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,611
- Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

130
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,862
- Hey!
- Quiet!

131
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,656
- Language.
- Are you kidding?

132
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,115
Was that Will I heard back there?

133
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,700
Will? No, no, no, it's just Mike.

134
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,202
Will didn't spend the night?

135
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,704
No, he left here a
little bit after 8:00.

136
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,122
Why? He's not home?

137
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:32,043
Um, you know what? I think he
just left early for... for school.

138
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,146
- Thank you so much. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

139
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,987
That's weird. I don't see him.

140
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:00,613
I'm telling you, his mom's right.

141
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,532
He probably just went
to class early again.

142
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,236
Yeah, he's always paranoid Gursky's
gonna give him another pop quiz.

143
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:07,255
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

144
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,456
Step right up and get your
tickets for the freak show.

145
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,185
Who do you think would make
more money in a freak show?

146
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,857
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

147
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,429
I'd go with Toothless.

148
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,974
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

149
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,809
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

150
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,894
"I told you a million times."

151
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,039
Do the arm thing.

152
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,166
Do it, freak!

153
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,758
God, it gets me every time.

154
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,911
- Assholes.
- I think it's kinda cool.

155
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,164
It's like you have
superpowers or something.

156
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,124
Like Mr. Fantastic.

157
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,477
Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it.

158
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,595
So, did he call?

159
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,222
Keep your voice down.

160
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,891
Did he?

161
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,743
I told you, it's not like that.

162
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:16,081
Okay, I mean, yes, he
likes me, but not like that.

163
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,083
We just...

164
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,693
made out a couple times.

165
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,155
"We just... made out a couple times."

166
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,573
Nance, seriously,

167
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,742
you're gonna be so cool
now, it's ridiculous.

168
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,243
No, I'm not.

169
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,997
You better still hang out
with me, that's all I'm saying.

170
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,875
If you become friends
with Tommy H. or Carol...

171
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,251
Oh, that's gross!

172
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,521
Okay, I'm telling you,
it was a one-time...

173
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,441
Two-time thing.

174
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,572
You were saying?

175
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,441
- Steve...
- Mmm-hmm?

176
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,193
- I have to go.
- In a minute.

177
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,947
Steve. I really, like...

178
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,865
Seriously, I have to go.

179
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,325
Wait, wait, wait. Let's...

180
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,285
Come on, let's do
something tonight, yeah?

181
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,288
Uh... No, I can't. I have
to study for Kaminsky's test.

182
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,624
Oh, come on. What's
your GPA again? 3.999...

183
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,418
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

184
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,670
- Well, then, just let me help.
- You failed chem.

185
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,755
- C-minus.
- Well, in that case...

186
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,174
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

187
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,219
- Are you crazy? My mom would not...
- I'll climb through your window.

188
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,524
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

189
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:31,806
You are crazy.

190
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,790
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

191
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,101
We can just...

192
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,103
We can just, like, chill in my car.

193
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,148
We can find a nice quiet
place to park, and...

194
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,651
Steve... I have to study.

195
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,445
I'm not kidding.

196
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,839
Well, why do you think I
want it to be nice and quiet?

197
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,576
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

198
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,143
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

199
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,354
To study.

200
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,851
Good of you to show.

201
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:20,605
Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

202
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,358
- Hey, Chief.
- Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

203
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,443
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

204
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:28,070
Well, I looked better than your
wife when I left her this morning.

205
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,781
While you were drinking or sleeping,

206
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,826
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

207
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,911
Phil Larson called.

208
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,663
Said some kids are stealing the
gnomes out of his garden again.

209
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,207
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

210
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,542
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

211
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,169
On a more pressing matter,

212
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,296
Joyce Byers can't find
her son this morning.

213
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,132
Mmm. Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

214
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,426
- Just give me a minute.
- Joyce is very upset.

215
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,386
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

216
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,805
Mornings are for coffee
and contemplation.

217
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:58,785
- Chief, she's already in your...
- Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

218
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:12,031
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

219
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,700
And I apologize again.

220
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm going out of my mind!

221
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,830
Look, boy his age, he's probably
just playing hookie, okay?

222
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,916
No, not my Will. He's not like that.

223
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,543
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well, you never know.

224
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,336
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

225
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,339
when really I was just
screwing Chrissy Carpenter

226
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,091
in the back of my
dad's Oldsmobile, so...

227
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,801
Look, he's not like you,
Hopper. He's not like me.

228
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,387
He's not like... most.

229
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:38,349
He has a couple of friends, but,
you know, the kids, they're mean.

230
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,268
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

231
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,395
- They laugh at him, his clothes...
- His clothes?

232
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,438
- What's wrong with his clothes?
- I don't know.

233
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,816
- Does that matter?
- Maybe.

234
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,944
Look, he's... He's a sensitive kid.

235
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,739
Lonnie... Lonnie used
to say he was queer.

236
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,157
Called him a fag.

237
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:59,179
- Is he?
- He's missing is what he is.

238
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,040
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

239
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:09,505
Uh, last I heard, he was in
Indianapolis. That was about a year ago.

240
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,468
- But he has nothing to do with this.
- Why don't you give me his number?

241
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:14,812
You know, Hopper, he has nothing
to do with this. Trust me.

242
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:17,597
Joyce, 99 out of 100
times, kid goes missing,

243
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,807
the kid is with a parent or relative.

244
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,392
What about the other time?

245
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,830
- What?
- You said, "99 out of 100."

246
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,939
- What about the other time, the one?
- Joyce.

247
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,149
The one!

248
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,067
Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?

249
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,902
You wanna know the worst
thing that's ever happened here

250
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,070
in the four years
I've been working here?

251
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,454
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

252
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:37,533
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

253
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,327
because it thought that
her hair was a nest.

254
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:42,079
Okay, fine. I will call Lonnie.

255
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,873
He will talk to me before he talks to...

256
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,934
- What, a pig?
- A cop!

257
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,004
Just find my son, Hop.

258
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,982
Find him!

259
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:04,745
Dr. Brenner.

260
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,356
This way, gentlemen.

261
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,275
The entire east wing will
be evacuated within the hour.

262
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,213
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

263
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:04,013
- This is where it came from?
- Yes.

264
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,115
And the girl?

265
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,869
She can't have gone far.

266
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,840
All right, and one more.

267
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,700
Hey, Ben. What do you
think about that, uh...

268
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,327
Hey, I don't know. I don't know.

269
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,746
I don't know, 37 points
per game average...

270
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,847
- Thirty-seven now, but...
- Mr. Basket.

271
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,196
Hey!

272
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,423
Come here!

273
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,467
Hey, come here!

274
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,182
You think you can steal from me, boy?

275
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:57,852
What in the hell?

276
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,214
Remember, finish chapter 12

277
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:06,093
and answer 12.3 on the
difference between an experiment

278
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,304
and other forms of
science investigation.

279
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:12,266
This will be on the test, which
will cover chapters 10 through 12.

280
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,412
It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

281
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,439
So, did it come?

282
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,898
Sorry, boys.

283
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,876
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, but...

284
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,003
it came.

285
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,574
Yes!

286
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,451
The Heathkit ham shack.

287
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,275
- Whoa.
- Ain't she a beaut?

288
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:34,121
I bet you can talk to
New York on this thing.

289
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,372
Think bigger.

290
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,458
- California?
- Bigger.

291
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,935
Australia?

292
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,462
Oh, man!

293
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,423
When Will sees this, he's
totally gonna blow his shit.

294
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:45,591
Lucas!

295
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,068
Sorry.

296
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:52,014
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

297
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,826
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

298
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,561
What are you doing?

299
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,812
Hello, this is Dustin,

300
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,899
and this is the secretary and
treasurer of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

301
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,151
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

302
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:11,176
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may
I borrow Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

303
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,706
Okay, okay, okay.

304
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,769
One at a time, all right? You.

305
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,462
- You said he takes what?
- Mirkwood.

306
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,131
- Mirkwood?
- Yeah.

307
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,718
- Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
- I have not. That sounds made up to me.

308
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,595
No, it's from Lord of the Rings.

309
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,556
- Well, The Hobbit.
- It doesn't matter.

310
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,475
- He asked!
- "He asked!"

311
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,161
- Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

312
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,187
- What'd I just say?
- Shut up.

313
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:43,565
One at a damn time. You.

314
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,860
Mirkwood, it's a real road. It's
just the name that's made up.

315
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,463
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

316
00:24:48,464 --> 00:24:51,426
- Yeah, all right, I think I know that...
- We can show you, if you want.

317
00:24:51,427 --> 00:24:52,701
I said that I know it!

318
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:54,326
- We can help look.
- Yeah.

319
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,328
No.

320
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,540
No. After school, you
are all to go home.

321
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,833
Immediately.

322
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:04,712
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

323
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:05,879
no nonsense.

324
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,923
This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.

325
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,801
- The Hobbit.
- Shut up!

326
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,261
- Hey!
- Stop it!

327
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,490
Do I make myself clear?

328
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:25,250
Do I make myself... clear?

329
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,044
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

330
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,582
Ring-a-ding-ding!

331
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,375
Anybody home?

332
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,085
Password?

333
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:47,146
Uh, Rada...

334
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,966
Radaga... Radagast?

335
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,469
Yeah. You may enter.

336
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,030
Thank you, sir.

337
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,640
So, guess what?

338
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,185
I got off early and...

339
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,937
Ta-da! Poltergeist.

340
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,641
I... I thought I wasn't
allowed to see it.

341
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:07,118
I changed my mind.

342
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,902
As long as you don't have
nightmares for a week.

343
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:12,488
No, I won't. I don't get
scared like that anymore.

344
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,572
Oh, yeah?

345
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,324
Not even of clowns?

346
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,492
No.

347
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,952
What about my witch?

348
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,454
- No. Mom...
- Ooh...

349
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,372
- I'm not five anymore.
- But Will Byers...

350
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:25,073
- I'm going to cook you up in my...
- Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

351
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,380
Will?

352
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,066
- Will?
- Will?

353
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,861
Will?

354
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,407
- Will?
- Will!

355
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:42,184
- Will!
- Will?

356
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,811
Will!

357
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,580
Where are you?

358
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,174
Geez.

359
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,801
Your parents forget to feed you?

360
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,307
Is that why you ran away?

361
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:08,978
They, uh...

362
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,147
They hurt you?

363
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:15,717
You went to the
hospital, you got scared,

364
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,498
you ran off, you wound
up here, is that it?

365
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,741
All right.

366
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,955
I'll give this back, all right? And
you can have as much as you want.

367
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,022
All right? Maybe even some ice cream.

368
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,483
But you gotta answer a few of
my questions first, all right?

369
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,545
We got a deal?

370
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:40,158
All right, let's start with
the easy stuff. All right?

371
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,620
My name's Benny. Benny Hammond.

372
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,414
See? Like this. Here.

373
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:48,417
I got you. Don't worry. It's okay.

374
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:51,980
Nice to meet you, yeah. And you are?

375
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,365
Eleven?

376
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:04,701
What's that mean?

377
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,328
What's it mean?

378
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,647
- No.
- Well, I'll be damned.

379
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,441
She speaks.

380
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,210
"No"? No, what?

381
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,989
All right. I guess no more food, then.

382
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,258
Eleven.

383
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,677
Yeah.

384
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,555
What's it mean?

385
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,725
Eleven.

386
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,586
All right, then.

387
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,421
Here you go.

388
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,274
Take it easy, take it easy.

389
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,261
Yeah, look, all I know is
that she's scared to death.

390
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,472
Yeah, I think maybe
she's been abused or...

391
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,199
kidnapped or something.

392
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,269
Yeah, it'd be great if
someone would come by.

393
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,815
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph
Lane. Yeah, Randolph.

394
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,487
Will Byers?

395
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,657
Will!

396
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,143
Will Byers?

397
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:35,148
Come on, kid!

398
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,501
Will?

399
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:41,422
Hey! I got something.

400
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,391
- That his bike?
- Yeah, he must have crashed.

401
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,403
You think he got hurt in the fall?

402
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,712
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

403
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,714
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

404
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,441
He would've walked it home.

405
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:12,394
... get off work if I win.

406
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,146
Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...

407
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,024
... but we will cover whatever
the damages are to your property.

408
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,888
- It's just, um...
- That's for sure.

409
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,286
Is Lonnie there?

410
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,929
- Lonnie isn't here right now.
- Can you please...

411
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,889
- I told you, Lonnie's not here.
- Who is this?

412
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,709
- His girlfriend, Cynthia.
- Cynthia.

413
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,503
- Who the hell is this?
- Cynthia, this is Joyce.

414
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,339
- Who?
- Lonnie's ex-wife.

415
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,583
- I really need to speak to him...
- Lonnie's not here.

416
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:44,543
- Can you please put... No!
- Why don't you call back later?

417
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:45,719
No, not later. Now!

418
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,970
Can...

419
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,472
- Bitch!
- Mom.

420
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:51,016
- What?
- You have to stay calm.

421
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,174
Hey, you've reached Lonnie.

422
00:31:01,175 --> 00:31:03,468
Leave a message and I'll
holler right back at ya.

423
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:06,948
Lonnie, some teenager
just hung up on me.

424
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,534
Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

425
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:10,786
I need...

426
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:13,455
I just need you to call
me back, please, just...

427
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,876
Damn it! Damn it!

428
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,628
Mom?

429
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:20,730
What?

430
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:23,941
Cops.

431
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:42,335
- It was just lying there?
- Yeah. Cal?

432
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:46,905
- Did it have any blood on it, or...
- No, no, no, no, no...

433
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,490
Phil?

434
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:51,010
If you found the bike out
there, why are you here?

435
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,931
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- Yeah.

436
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,350
So...

437
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,459
maybe he came home.

438
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,586
You think I didn't check my own house?

439
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,481
I'm not saying that.

440
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,134
- Has this always been here?
- What? I don't know.

441
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:10,071
Probably. I mean, I have
two boys. Look at this place.

442
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,848
You're not sure?

443
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:25,836
Hey.

444
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,197
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

445
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,801
Nothing, he's probably
just hungry. Come on.

446
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,405
- Hey!
- Jesus!

447
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:55,075
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

448
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,637
What's going on?

449
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:00,914
Hello?

450
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:04,084
- Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
- Listen, I want you to call Flo.

451
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:06,028
I want to get a search
party together, all right?

452
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:08,713
All the volunteers she can
muster. Bring flashlights, too.

453
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,108
Hey, you think we got a problem here?

454
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:21,000
We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

455
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:22,852
We've been over this,
Mike. The chief says...

456
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,437
- I don't care what the chief said.
- Michael!

457
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,301
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

458
00:34:26,302 --> 00:34:27,482
More reason to stay put.

459
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,627
- Mom!
- End of discussion.

460
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,742
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

461
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,245
- That's cool, right?
- No, not cool.

462
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,580
What? Why not?

463
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:44,874
Why do you think? Am I
speaking Chinese in this house?

464
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,003
Until we know Will is
okay, no one leaves.

465
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,879
- This is such bullshit.
- Language.

466
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,381
So we're under house arrest?

467
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:53,383
Just because Mike's friend got
lost on the way home from...

468
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,760
- Wait, this is Will's fault?
- Nancy, take that back.

469
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,387
- No!
- You're just pissed off

470
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:59,448
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

471
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,309
- Steve?
- Who is Steve?

472
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,811
- Her new boyfriend.
- You are such a douchebag, Mike!

473
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,706
Language!

474
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,792
Nancy, come back.

475
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:11,860
Come back!

476
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:15,381
It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

477
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,115
You see, Michael?

478
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,499
- You see what happens?
- What happens when what?

479
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,163
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

480
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,290
That is really unfair, son.

481
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,600
We care.

482
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,274
- Mike!
- Let him go.

483
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,404
I hope you're enjoying
your chicken, Ted.

484
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,698
What did I do?

485
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,619
Hey! What'd I do?

486
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,690
- Will!
- Will Byers!

487
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:51,816
Will!

488
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,735
Will, we're here for you, bud!

489
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,823
He's a good student.

490
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:02,327
- What?
- Will. He's a good student.

491
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,054
Great one, actually.

492
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:06,456
I don't think we've met. Scott Clarke.

493
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:09,834
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

494
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,920
I always had a distaste for science.

495
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,963
Well, maybe you had a bad teacher.

496
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,383
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff was a piece of work.

497
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:19,094
Ratliff? You bet.

498
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,346
She's still kicking
around, believe it or not.

499
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:25,242
Oh, I believe it. Mummies
never die, so they tell me.

500
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,369
Sarah, my daughter...

501
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:32,899
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

502
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,443
I always figured there was
enough going on down here,

503
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,296
I never needed to look elsewhere.

504
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:39,572
Your daughter, what grade is she?

505
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,450
- Maybe I'll get her in my class.
- No, she, uh...

506
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,078
She lives with her mom in the city.

507
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,641
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

508
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,712
- She died a few years back.
- Sorry?

509
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,064
His kid.

510
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,060
Lucas, do you copy? It's Mike.

511
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,980
- Lucas?
- Hey, it's Lucas.

512
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,064
I know it's you.

513
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:16,317
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

514
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,027
I'm done. Over.

515
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,530
I'm worried about Will. Over.

516
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:22,675
Yeah.

517
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,411
This is crazy. Over.

518
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,138
I was thinking...

519
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,459
Will could've cast Protection
last night, but he didn't.

520
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,543
He cast Fireball.

521
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:37,380
- Over.
- What's your point? Over.

522
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:42,177
My point is... he could've
played it safe, but he didn't.

523
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:44,137
He put himself in
danger to help the party.

524
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:45,364
Over.

525
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,578
Meet me in ten. Over and out.

526
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,782
What are you doing here?

527
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:25,160
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

528
00:38:25,161 --> 00:38:27,680
- I figured we'd just study here.
- No. No way.

529
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:30,016
Oh, come on. I can't have
you failing this test.

530
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,893
So just... bear with me.

531
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:35,956
What'd I tell you?

532
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,500
Ninja.

533
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,016
You like that ice cream, huh?

534
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,685
Smile looks good on you.

535
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,104
You know, smile?

536
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,848
All right. You just sit tight.

537
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:13,327
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to
go away real quick, all right?

538
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,207
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

539
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,818
- Hey, can I help you?
- Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

540
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,282
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

541
00:39:24,283 --> 00:39:26,990
- So try back tomorrow morning.
- Connie Frazier. Social Services.

542
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,951
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

543
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:32,871
- That's a heck of a drive.
- Not too bad this time of night.

544
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:35,255
Hey, listen, I... I haven't
told her that you're coming yet.

545
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:39,252
I didn't want her running off
again. She's a tad skittish.

546
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:41,981
- Children I work with usually are.
- Right, right.

547
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:45,383
- So, where is she?
- Right. She's in the kitchen.

548
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,302
- Come on up. I'll introduce you.
- Thank you.

549
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,178
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

550
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,602
- It's fine.
- You know, it's funny.

551
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:53,263
Your, uh, voice sounds
different on the...

552
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,567
Ah, man. This is it.

553
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,161
Hey, guys. You feel that?

554
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,856
- I think maybe we should go back.
- No.

555
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,567
We're not going back. Just stay close.

556
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,794
Come on.

557
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,257
Just stay on channel six.
Don't do anything stupid.

558
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,263
Hey, guys, wait up.

559
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,223
Wait up!

"Which polymers occur naturally?"

561
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:10,760
Starch and cellulose.

00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,095
Mmm.

563

565
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,562
Wow. Jesus, how many
of these did you make?

566
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,499
You said you wanted to help.

567
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,733
How about this? How about...

568
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,360
How about every time that
you get something right,

569
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,945
I have to take off an item of clothing.

570
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:30,769
But every time that you
get something wrong...

571
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,906
- Uh, pass.
- Oh, come on.

572
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,032
- Come on.
- No.

573
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,492
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- No.

Ooh, it's boiling points.

That's what I meant.

579
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:47,064
Yeah, that's not what you said.

580
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,775
- No.
- No?

581
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,969
Oh, do you need... Do
you need help, or...

582
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,113
No.

583
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,243
Steve. Steve, come on.

584
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,327
What?

585
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,556
Are you crazy? My parents are here.

586
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,768
That's weird, I... don't see them.

587
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:33,259
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

588
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,928
- get another notch on your belt.
- No. Nancy, no.

589
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,139
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

590
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,825
You mean, you're not a slut.

591
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,726
That's not what I'm saying.

592
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,579
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

593
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,330
Shut up.

594
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,567
Bad Steve.

595
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:53,213
Bad. Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

596
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,841
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

597
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:58,802
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

These are great.

602
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:24,203
Wow, they really are.

603
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,439
- I know I haven't been there for you.
- I've been...

604
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,608
working so hard and I...

605
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,527
I just feel bad. I don't even...

606
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:35,071
barely know what's going on with you.

607
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:37,925
All right? I am sorry about that.

608
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,596
Hey, what is it?

609
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:44,848
What is it, honey?

610
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,001
- Nothing.
- Tell me. Tell me.

611
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,129
- Come on. You can...
- No.

612
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,397
It's just...

613
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:55,410
I should've been there for him.

614
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:58,469
No. Oh, no. You can't
do that to yourself.

615
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,764
This was not your fault. Do you hear me?

616
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:05,535
- He is... close.
- I know it. I...

617
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:08,914
I feel it in my heart.

618
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:12,441
You just have to... You have
to trust me on this, okay?

619
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:16,863
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at this.

620
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:19,323
Look at this one. Look at this one.

621
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:23,828
- I mean, that's it, right?
- Yeah.

622
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,705
That's it. That's the one.

623
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:32,211
Hello?

- It's Will?

00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:49,538
Mom, it's Will?

631
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,939
Who is this?

632
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,150
- What have you done to my boy?
- What? What?

633
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:55,735
Give me back my son!

634
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:59,530
Hello?

635
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,865
Hello, who is this?

636
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:03,701
Hello? Who is this?

637
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:06,245
Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?

638
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:07,997
- It was him.
- Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

639
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:09,290
- Yes.
- What did he say?

640
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,500
He just breathed. He just breathed.

641
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,544
- And was someone else there?
- I...

642
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,339
- Mom, who was there? Who was it?
- It was him.

643
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,133
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

644
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:21,820
Will!

645
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:25,306
- Will!
- Byers!

646
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:28,160
I've got your X-Men 134!

647
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,978
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

648
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,313
Seriously, Dustin?

649
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,690
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

650
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,484
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

651
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,587
No, you're just being a big sissy!

652
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:42,573
Did you ever think Will went missing
because he ran into something bad?

653
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:45,534
And we're going to the exact
same spot where he was last seen?

654
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,454
- And we have no weapons or anything?
- Dustin, shut up.

655
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,539
I'm just saying, does
that seem smart to you?

656
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,750
Shut up. Shut up.

657
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,502
Did you guys hear that?
