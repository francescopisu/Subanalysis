1
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,791
Nancy!

2
00:00:10,069 --> 00:00:11,694
Nancy!

3
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:13,154
Come on, come on.

4
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:14,840
Nancy!

5
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:18,034
Where are you?

6
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:21,180
Jonathan! Jonathan!

7
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:23,349
Jonathan!

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,769
Jonathan, I'm right here!

9
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:28,586
Nancy!

10
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:32,149
Nancy!

11
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,801
Jonathan, where are you?

12
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,512
Jonathan!

13
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:39,305
Jonathan!

14
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,516
Jonathan, I'm right... I'm right here!

15
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:43,434
Where are you?

16
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,144
- I'm right here!
- Jonathan!

17
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,605
I'm right here! Nancy!

18
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:51,901
- Just follow my voice!
- Jonathan!

19
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:55,255
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

20
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,577
Nancy!

21
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,542
Nancy?

22
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,129
Nancy.

23
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:40,259
Nancy! Follow my voice!

24
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,182
Nancy?

25
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:55,673
- Jonathan!
- Nancy!

26
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:13,918
I got you.

_

29
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,299
I just don't understand
why we're coming out here.

30
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,081
She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.

31
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:41,487
That's... that's not it.

32
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:45,241
Oh, really? Because no girl
would ever blow off King Steve.

33
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:47,994
She was acting weird. I
mean, something was wrong.

34
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,996
So what? Like, you're worried about her?

35
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:53,499
- What?
- Aw, you are.

36
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,294
- Aw, Steve has a heart.
- Would you just... Stop.

37
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:58,238
- Oh, Stevey's in love.
- Would you just shut up?

38
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,380
- Who knew?
- Shut up!

39
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,816
Jeez.

40
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:04,820
Damn. Sorry.

41
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,619
So this is it, huh? Princess' castle.

42
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,373
I'll just be a minute.

43
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,004
Look, we gotta go through this again.

44
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:51,599
- I told you everything that I saw.
- Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,018
- Upstairs or downstairs?
- Upstairs.

46
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:55,228
There was a laboratory.

47
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,132
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

48
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:00,525
There was this kid's room.

49
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:04,278
- How do you know it was a kid's room?
- More like a prison.

50
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,781
So why would you think
it was a kid's room, then?

51
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:08,241
Because, I told you,

52
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,876
the size of the bed,
there was a drawing,

53
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,035
there was a stuffed animal...

54
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:12,918
You didn't say there was a drawing.

55
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,102
Yeah, there was a drawing
of a... an adult and a child.

56
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:17,083
- It said "Eleven" on it.
- Was it good?

57
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,418
It was a kid's drawing,
Joyce. It was stick figures.

58
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:27,194
Wasn't Will.

59
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:37,371
Earl...

60
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:40,231
The night that Benny died,

61
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:45,611
Earl said he saw some kid
with a shaved head with Benny.

62
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:49,448
Now, I pressed him, he said
it might be Will, but maybe...

63
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,325
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

64
00:05:51,326 --> 00:05:53,744
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

65
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:55,913
she claims to have
lost her daughter, Jane.

66
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,416
She sued Brenner, she
sued the government...

67
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,894
Now, the claims came to
nothing, but what if...

68
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:05,089
I mean, what if this
whole time I've been...

69
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,858
I've been looking for Will...

70
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,903
I've been chasing after some other kid?

71
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:29,673
Nancy!

72
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,651
Better?

73
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:52,612
Yeah.

74
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:57,492
Is this okay? Uh, I
found it in the closet.

75
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:01,103
I can go home. I just figured...

76
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:03,165
Yeah, no. I...

77
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:07,544
I don't wanna be alone.

78
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,673
- Do you?
- No. Uh... no.

79
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,627
Can you just come up here?

80
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:55,217
Yeah.

81
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:09,064
- Do you want the lights off, or...
- On.

82
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:11,566
Yeah.

83
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:16,780
You know, it...

84
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,616
it can't get us in here.

85
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,581
We don't know that.

86
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,091
Uh, yeah, it's Ives. Terry
Ives. That's with a "Y."

87
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:38,111
Yeah, I got a pen. Hang on.

88
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,073
Mmm-hmm.

89
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:44,725
Mmm-hmm.

90
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:47,978
Great, thanks. I really
appreciate this, Frank.

91
00:09:47,979 --> 00:09:50,081
Say hi to the boys
for me, too, would you?

92
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,115
Did you get it?

93
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:01,134
- I got it.
- Okay.

94
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,114
Oh...

95
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:25,200
Hey.

96
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:27,702
Hey.

97
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:30,914
Couldn't sleep?

98
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:37,337
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

99
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:41,967
keep seeing that... thing.

100
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:46,471
Wherever I was, that place...

101
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:50,124
I think that it lives there.

102
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,060
It was feeding there.

103
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,188
Feeding on that deer.

104
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:58,632
That means that if...

105
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:01,152
if Will and Barbara...

106
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:06,241
Hey.

107
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,994
My mom said she talked to Will.

108
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:12,396
If he's alive, there's
a chance Barbara is, too.

109
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:14,499
That means that she's trapped...

110
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,918
in that place.

111
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,656
We have to find it again.

112
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,718
You wanna go back out there?

113
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,594
Maybe we don't have to.

114
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:29,955
When I saw it, it was
feeding on that deer.

115
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:33,167
- Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
- Right.

116
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:37,338
And it seems to hunt at night,
like a... a lion or a coyote.

117
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,149
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

118
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,402
It's always alone, like...

119
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:44,511
like a bear.

120
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:47,932
And remember at Steve's,
when Barb cut herself?

121
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:51,602
- And then, last night, the deer...
- Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

122
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:52,912
One sec.

123
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:56,357
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

124
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:58,400
That's one drop of blood in a million,

125
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,736
and they can smell it
from a quarter mile away.

126
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:03,506
So you're saying it can detect blood?

127
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:06,593
It's just a theory.

128
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,596
We could test it.

129
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,808
But if it works...

130
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:16,686
At least we'll know it's coming.

131
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:22,466
Honey, are you up?

132
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:25,052
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

133
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:27,680
I, uh, made some blueberry pancakes.

134
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,449
I'll be down in a second.

135
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,987
Your mom doesn't knock?

136
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:58,502
- Hi. Scott Clarke?
- Uh, yes.

137
00:12:58,503 --> 00:13:00,629
The same Scott Clarke
who teaches science and AV

138
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,093
- at Hawkins Middle?
- The very same.

139
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:03,215
Oh, wonderful.

140
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:06,802
And we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

141
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:08,804
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

142
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:11,807
as well as how-to articles,
which the kids write themselves.

143
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:13,309
Oh, that's neat.

144
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,293
What we're really trying
to do here, Mr. Clarke...

145
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,687
Uh, please, call me Scott.

146
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:18,314
Scott.

147
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:22,318
What we're trying to do here, Scott, is
to connect kids from all over the state

148
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,403
and give them the
support and encouragement

149
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,488
to pursue careers in technology.

150
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:29,392
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

151
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,910
I agree, yes. Completely.

152
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,997
So, you know any kids you
think might wanna participate?

153
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,809
Oh, I have a few in mind.

154
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:51,263
I just... I can't believe
she didn't come back.

155
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,349
- She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.

156
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,976
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

157
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:58,228
- She didn't betray us.
- Mike, calm down.

158
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:00,612
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.

159
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:03,233
- Mike, this isn't your fault.
- Yeah, it's Lucas'.

160
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,455
It wasn't his fault, either.

161
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:07,613
- It wasn't his fault?
- No.

162
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,406
So you're saying he
wasn't way out of line?

163
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,033
- Totally, but so were you!
- What?

164
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,785
- And so was Eleven.
- Oh, give me a break!

165
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,036
No, Mike, you give me a break!

166
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:16,580
All three of you were being
a bunch of little assholes!

167
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:18,207
I was the only reasonable one.

168
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,959
But the bottom line
is... you pushed first.

169
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,920
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood...

170
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,755
No! No way! I'm not shaking his hand.

171
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:26,382
- You're shaking his hand!
- No, I'm not.

172
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:29,510
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.

173
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:33,406
Obey or be banished from the
party. Do you wanna be banished?

174
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:35,366
- No.
- Good.

175
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:38,977
Where are we going?

176
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,355
Where do you think?
We're going to get Lucas.

177
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,374
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

178
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:02,060
Today is a very special day.

179
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,854
Do you know why?

180
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:10,610
Because today, we make history.

181
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:14,697
Today, we make contact.

182
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:08,358
Here you go.

183
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,503
Ah... yum.

184
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,923
Okay. Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

185
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,034
Where is Nancy? I thought
she was coming down.

186
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:19,328
She is.

187
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:22,456
Uh, she was. I don't know.

188
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:24,917
Nancy, what's taking so long?

189
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,627
Nancy?

190
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:29,397
Nancy, come on.

191
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,578
Nan...

192
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,563
What do you want?

193
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,695
I drew first blood, so...

194
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:34,796
Okay, I'll shake.

195
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,697
On one condition.

196
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:38,824
We forget the weirdo and
go straight to the gate.

197
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,325
- Then the deal's off.
- Fine!

198
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,119
- Fine!
- No, no, not fine!

199
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,513
Guys, seriously?

200
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,849
Do you even remember what
happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

201
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:53,755
We couldn't agree on what path
to take, so we split up the party

202
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:55,757
and those trolls took us out one by one.

203
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:58,569
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

204
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:01,513
So we stick together, no matter what!

205
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:06,518
Yeah, I agree. But this is the
party, right here in this room.

206
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,522
- El is one of us now.
- Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

207
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,858
Never will be. She's
a liar, a traitor...

208
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,735
She was just trying to keep us safe!

209
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:16,639
She didn't mean to hurt
you. It was an accident!

210
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,654
An accident?

211
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,698
All right, accident or not...

212
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,825
- admit it, it was a little awesome.
- Awesome?

213
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:23,827
Yeah, she threw you in
the air with her mind!

214
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:25,621
I could have been killed!

215
00:18:25,622 --> 00:18:28,498
Which is exactly why we
need her. She's a weapon!

216
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:31,162
Do you seriously wanna fight the
Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

217
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:33,128
That's like R2-D2 going
to fight Darth Vader.

218
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,106
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

219
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:39,259
If you two wanna waste your time
looking for a traitor, go ahead,

220
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,655
'cause I'm not spending my
time on her anymore. No way!

221
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:47,118
I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.

222
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:23,887
It's okay, Eleven.

223
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:27,450
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

224
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,620
They're just here to watch.

225
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,481
Don't focus on them.

226
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:37,126
Stay in here, like before.

227
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,796
Yes, Papa.

228
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:48,245
Now, remember. Whatever
it is, it can't hurt you.

229
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:51,933
Not from here. So there's
nothing to be frightened of.

230
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,144
It's reaching out to you...

231
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,046
'cause it wants you.

232
00:19:58,047 --> 00:19:59,756
Hmm?

233
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:01,067
It's calling you...

234
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,903
so don't turn away from it this time.

235
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:06,322
I want you to find it.

236
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,491
Understand?

237
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,493
Yes.

238
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:46,154
Are you lost?

239
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,950
Is your mom here?

240
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:54,620
Your dad?

241
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:58,582
Mouth breather.

242
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:12,722
- What should we do?
- Uh...

243
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,184
Call the police.

244
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,215
Excuse me. Young lady! You
know you have to pay for those!

245
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,008
Hey! Stop right...

246
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:26,510
Please.

247
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:28,678
You have to pay for those!

248
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,282
Stop right there! Thief! Thief!

249
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,875
Can I help you?

250
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:01,002
Hi, we're looking for Terry
Ives. Does she live here?

251
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:04,065
- Who's asking?
- The Hawkins chief of police.

252
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:10,762
And you want to talk to my sister?

253
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,699
Well, if your sister's Terry
Ives, then, yeah, we do.

254
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:17,352
Okay, well, you can come in,

255
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:19,563
but if you want Terry
to tell you anything,

256
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:21,731
you're about five years too late.

257
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:26,212
Terry, you have some visitors.

258
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,824
Hello. My name's Joyce Byers.

259
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:33,952
Uh, this is Hopper. We
drove over from Hawkins.

260
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:37,414
Um, you see, uh, my son...

261
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:40,750
he's been missing for almost a week now,

262
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:44,004
and, um, we were wondering
if we could talk to you

263
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,714
about your daughter, Jane?

264
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:49,819
If there's anything that you could
tell us about when she was taken...

265
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:52,613
What was your relationship
with Dr. Brenner?

266
00:22:53,514 --> 00:22:54,907
You guys keep in touch?

267
00:22:57,435 --> 00:22:59,603
This is, uh... this is him.

268
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:02,147
This is Will.

269
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,983
Uh, you may have seen
him on... on the news.

270
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,319
- Uh...
- What's wrong with her?

271
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,131
I told you, you're wasting your time.

272
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,318
This is weird without Lucas.

273
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,297
- He should've shaken my hand.
- He's just jealous.

274
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,340
What are you talking about?

275
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:57,970
Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

276
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:01,831
He's your best friend, right?

277
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:05,919
- Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
- It's fine. I get it.

278
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,696
I didn't get here
until the fourth grade.

279
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,506
He had the advantage
of living next door.

280
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:10,924
But none of that matters.

281
00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:13,677
What matters is that
he is your best friend.

282
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:16,240
And then this girl shows up and
starts living in your basement,

283
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:18,304
and all you ever want to
do is pay attention to her.

284
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:20,642
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. And you know it.

285
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:23,311
And he knows it. But no
one ever says anything

286
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:25,855
until you both start punching
and yelling at each other

287
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,400
like goblins with
intelligence scores of zero.

288
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:31,152
- Now everything's weird.
- He's not my best friend.

289
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:34,906
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, he is, but so are you.

290
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,409
- And so is Will.
- Can't have more than one best friend.

291
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,202
- Says who?
- Says logic.

292
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:42,890
Well, I call bull on your logic,
because you're my best friend, too.

293
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,916
Okay.

294
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:50,547
Whoa.

295
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:52,924
You don't think...

296
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,444
Uh... definitely.

297
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:10,608
Are you ready?

298
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,445
She was a part of some study in college.

299
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,905
- MK Ultra?
- Yeah, that's the one.

300
00:25:15,906 --> 00:25:19,743
Was, uh, started in the '50s.

301
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:21,244
By the time Terry got involved,

302
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:24,539
it was supposed to be ramping down,
but the drugs just got crazier.

303
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,166
Messed her up good.

304
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:28,602
This was the CIA that ran this?

305
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:34,299
You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M."

306
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,842
They'd pay... you know,

307
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:38,887
a couple hundred bucks
to people like my sister,

308
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:42,640
give 'em drugs,
psychedelics. LSD, mostly.

309
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,519
And then they'd strip her naked and
put her in these isolation tanks.

310
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,438
- Isolation tanks?
- Yeah.

311
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,565
These big bathtubs, basically,

312
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:53,276
filled with salt water, so
you can float around in there.

313
00:25:53,277 --> 00:25:56,029
You lose any sense of, uh...

314
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,908
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

315
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:03,286
They wanted to expand the
boundaries of the mind.

316
00:26:03,287 --> 00:26:04,746
Real hippie crap.

317
00:26:04,747 --> 00:26:07,415
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

318
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:08,750
The thing is, though, is that

319
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:10,919
she didn't know she was
pregnant at the time.

320
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,521
Jane.

321
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,402
Do you have any pictures of her?

322
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:23,490
I don't think you guys understand.

323
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:26,785
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

324
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:34,984
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

325
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:41,074
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

326
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:43,952
like she's gonna come home someday.

327
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:48,516
Says she's special.
Born with "abilities."

328
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,393
Abilities?

329
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:56,047
You read any Stephen King?

330
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:03,680
You guys look scared, actually.

331
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:06,617
I mean, it's all make-believe.

332
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,519
What... what kind of abilities?

333
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,313
Telepathy, telekinesis...

334
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:16,210
You know, shit you
can do with your mind.

335
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:20,238
That's why the big,
bad Man stole Jane away.

336
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,781
Papa!

337
00:27:21,782 --> 00:27:24,868
Her baby's a weapon,
off fighting the commies.

338
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:29,122
You know, the doctors all
say it's a coping mechanism.

339
00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:30,915
You know, to deal with the guilt.

340
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,978
Do you think there is any chance
she could be telling the truth?

341
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:37,338
About having had the kid.

342
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:40,216
There is no birth certificate,
nothing from the hospital.

343
00:27:40,217 --> 00:27:43,386
Doctors and nurses all
confirm that she miscarried.

344
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:46,657
Yeah, but that could've
been covered up. Right?

345
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,661
Like I said, you and Terry
would've gotten along.

346
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:14,751
Oh, man.

347
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:07,529
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

348
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,397
What you kids doin' with all this?

349
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:18,832
Um...

350
00:29:21,652 --> 00:29:24,696
- Monster hunting.
- Huh.

351
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:29,093
"Monster hunting"?

352
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,472
You know, last week...

353
00:29:33,998 --> 00:29:37,375
I was shopping for a new top
I thought Steve might like.

354
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,294
It took me and Barb all weekend.

355
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:43,256
It seemed like life or death,
you know? And... and now...

356
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:45,901
You're shopping for bear
traps with Jonathan Byers.

357
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,945
Yeah.

358
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,447
What's the weirdest part?

359
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:52,783
Me or the bear trap?

360
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:56,019
You. It's definitely you.

361
00:29:57,521 --> 00:29:59,373
Hey, Nance!

362
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:02,942
Can't wait to see your movie.

363
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:04,420
What the hell was that?

364
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:07,214
I don't know.

365
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:11,969
What?

366
00:30:14,455 --> 00:30:16,164
What?

367
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:17,850
Hey! Where are you going?

368
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:22,187
Nancy, wait!

369
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,067
Nancy!

370
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,618
- I can't believe it.
- These kids!

371
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:39,037
Jesus.

372
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:43,459
Wow.

373
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:49,739
Wait!

374
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,407
Tommy, you write like a three-year-old.

375
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:53,791
- Shut up!
- I didn't know you could spell.

376
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,519
Aw, hey there, princess!

377
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:05,189
Uh-oh! She looks upset.

378
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:08,716
- Oh!
- Damn!

379
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:10,134
What is wrong with you?

380
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,878
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

381
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:13,137
I was worried about you.

382
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,641
I can't believe that I was
actually worried about you.

383
00:31:15,642 --> 00:31:18,643
- What are you talking about?
- I wouldn't lie if I were you.

384
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:21,896
You don't want to be known
as the lying slut now, do you?

385
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:23,207
Speak of the devil.

386
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,542
Hi.

387
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:28,378
You came by last night?

388
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:31,948
Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize?

389
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:34,784
Look, I don't know what you think
you saw, but it wasn't like that.

390
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:38,246
What, you just let him
into your room to... study?

391
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:40,915
Or for another pervy photo session?

392
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,779
- We were just...
- You were just what?

393
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,465
Finish that sentence.

394
00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:49,191
Finish the sentence.

395
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,700
Go to hell, Nancy.

396
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,892
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

397
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:01,519
You know what, Byers? I'm
actually kind of impressed.

398
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,663
I always took you for a
queer, but I guess you're just

399
00:32:03,664 --> 00:32:05,231
a little screw-up like your father.

400
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:07,984
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
that house is full of screw-ups.

401
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:09,569
You know, I guess I
shouldn't really be surprised.

402
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,862
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

403
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,113
- Jonathan, leave it.
- I mean, your mom...

404
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:14,031
I'm not even surprised what
happened to your brother.

405
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,158
Steve, shut up!

406
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:16,242
I'm sorry I have to
be the one to tell you,

407
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:18,666
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire...

408
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,666
Steve!

409
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,418
Oh!

410
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:27,104
Steve.

411
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:29,922
Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys!

412
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:32,186
- Get off of him, seriously!
- Kick his ass, man!

413
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:34,287
Get off! Stop!

414
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,888
Get in there, he's
going to hurt himself!

415
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:39,742
Hey. Hey! Get out of here! Get
out of here! Get out of here!

416
00:32:43,604 --> 00:32:46,147
Jonathan, stop! Stop!
You're going to hurt him!

417
00:32:46,148 --> 00:32:48,191
Jonathan, stop!

418
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:50,401
- Cops!
- Guys... Jonathan, get off of him!

419
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,653
- Stop it!
- Cops! Come on!

420
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:54,655
- Stop it! Come on!
- Cops!

421
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:56,908
- You have to stop!
- Just go, Carol!

422
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:58,451
Stop it!

423
00:32:58,452 --> 00:33:00,435
Hey, he's had enough, man!
I said he's had enough!

424
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,996
- Kids! All right!
- Stop it!

425
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,082
Oh! My nose!

426
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,959
Calm him down!

427
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,629
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

428
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,591
Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh. Come
here, little guys! Come here!

429
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,259
- Get off!
- I got this one!

430
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,280
Get back here! Get back
here, you little punks!

431
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:27,313
Good gift for a college student...

432
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:35,532
Well, thank you for your
time. We appreciate it.

433
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,833
Hmm, yeah, I'm sorry I
couldn't be of more help.

434
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,888
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

435
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:51,688
Hey...

436
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:54,316
What?

437
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:56,443
We're gonna find him.

438
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,657
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

439
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:04,517
We're close.

440
00:34:04,518 --> 00:34:09,605
Twelve years? Twelve years
she's been looking for her...

441
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:11,608
And then she shows up at
Benny's five nights ago,

442
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:12,901
which means we've got a chance.

443
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:14,461
You know what I would give?

444
00:34:15,404 --> 00:34:17,738
For a chance?

445
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,549
You know what I would give?

446
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:22,110
Hey, Chief, you there?

447
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:24,262
- Hey, Chief?
- Yeah, go ahead.

448
00:34:24,288 --> 00:34:26,122
Yeah, a fight broke out here and...

449
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:29,417
- Cal, I don't have time for this.
- It's Jonathan Byers.

450
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:31,561
You haven't seen Joyce, have you?

451
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:46,350
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

452
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,561
You, yes. Him, no.

453
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:50,897
He assaulted a police officer.

454
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:53,361
Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

455
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:55,484
You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

456
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:57,778
He's not my boyfriend.

457
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:00,382
I think you better tell him that.

458
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:02,116
What?

459
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:04,970
Only love makes you
that crazy, sweetheart.

460
00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:07,889
And that damn stupid.

461
00:35:16,298 --> 00:35:17,733
Found some ice.

462
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,278
Thanks.

463
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:36,376
Everything okay?

464
00:35:38,028 --> 00:35:39,254
Yeah.

465
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,965
Everything's fine.

466
00:35:54,962 --> 00:35:56,897
El!

467
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,817
Eleven!

468
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,156
- Eleven! El!
- El!

469
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,016
Eleven!

470
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:10,327
Eleven!

471
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,190
- Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
- What?

472
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:17,375
El!

473
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,419
El?

474
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:25,217
Hey, there, Frogface.

475
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,159
Toothless.

476
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,120
Shit! Run, Mike!

477
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:31,264
- What?
- Run! Come on!

478
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,499
You're dead, Wheeler.

479
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,292
Move, Mike!

480
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,978
Mike, come on, run!

481
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:56,123
Cramp!

482
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:57,875
Just keep going!

483
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,144
Keep going!

484
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:06,735
Shit!

485
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:10,614
- Stay back!
- Don't come any closer!

486
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,810
Nice throw, numbnuts.

487
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,815
Get off! Get off me!

488
00:38:20,816 --> 00:38:22,775
Let him go! Let him go!

489
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:25,820
- Stay back, or I cut him!
- What do you want?

490
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:27,113
I want to know how you did it!

491
00:38:27,114 --> 00:38:28,568
How I did what?

492
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:29,944
I know you did something to me.

493
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:31,843
Some nerdy science
shit to make me do that.

494
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:33,178
You mean piss your pants?

495
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:35,830
Our friend has superpowers,

496
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:38,332
and she squeezed your
tiny bladder with her mind.

497
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:39,792
Shut up!

498
00:38:39,793 --> 00:38:42,211
I think I should save Toothless
here a trip to the dentist.

499
00:38:42,212 --> 00:38:44,004
Help him lose the
rest of his baby teeth.

500
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:45,923
Let him go. Let him go!

501
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,217
I'll let him go, sure.

502
00:38:48,218 --> 00:38:50,594
But first... it's your turn.

503
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:51,804
My turn for what?

504
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:53,531
Wet yourself.

505
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:56,350
- What?
- Jump...

506
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:58,894
or Toothless here gets an
early trip to the dentist.

507
00:38:58,895 --> 00:39:00,330
Stop! No!

508
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,127
I'll cut him right now!

509
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,073
All right, just hold on! Hold on!

510
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:13,492
Mike, don't do it. I don't
need my baby teeth, Mike!

511
00:39:13,493 --> 00:39:15,452
Mike, seriously, don't!

512
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,222
Mike, don't do it!

513
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:38,142
Seriously, don't do it,
man! Seriously, don't!

514
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,120
Troy, I don't think
this is a good idea, man.

515
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:42,563
Mike, don't!

516
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:46,275
Dentist's office opens in five...

517
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:48,795
Four! Three!

518
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:52,656
- Two!
- Mike!

519
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:53,758
One!

520
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,501
Holy shit.

521
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:17,490
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

522
00:40:45,794 --> 00:40:48,254
She broke my arm! My arm!

523
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:49,398
Go.

524
00:40:50,507 --> 00:40:52,564
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

525
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:53,300
Go!

526
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:55,320
Yeah, that's right! You better run!

527
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:58,514
She's our friend and she's crazy!

528
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:00,975
You come back here and she'll kill you!

529
00:41:00,976 --> 00:41:05,020
You hear me? She'll kill
you, you sons of bitches!

530
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,165
She'll kill you, you hear me?

531
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:24,558
El, are you okay?

532
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,244
El?

533
00:42:27,187 --> 00:42:30,064
Mike... I'm sorry.

534
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:32,625
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

535
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:35,086
The gate...

536
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:40,383
I opened it.

537
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:45,472
I'm the monster.

538
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,541
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

539
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:51,210
You saved me.

540
00:42:51,211 --> 00:42:54,189
Do you understand? You saved me.

541
00:43:33,962 --> 00:43:37,732
I have eyes on 'em now.
They're heading home.
