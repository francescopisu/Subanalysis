00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:38,375
Earth is the only planet we
know of where life exists.

3
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:44,135
And, here, it does so in abundance.

4
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,415
The jungle is Eden.

5
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,974
It covers less than 6%
of the Earth's surface

6
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,134
but it's home to half of all

7
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:01,975
the plants and animals on land.

8
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:09,134
Jungles have just the
right amount of light,

9
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:14,535
water and nutrients, and they
have had every day for millennia.

10
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:21,975
Life here should be easy.

11
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:32,375
This is an indri.

12
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:37,215
It's a primate, like us.

13
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:42,535
And these forests in
Madagascar are its home.

14
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,295
But to survive here...

15
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:55,295
...it has to face one major challenge.

16
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:03,615
Paradise is crowded.

17
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,895
Life fills every niche.

18
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:17,534
And, at any one time, a staggering
variety of species and countless

19
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:22,095
individuals are striving
for space and food.

20
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:33,534
Like every jungle animal,

21
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:37,094
indri have to find their own way to survive

22
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:40,215
in the most competitive place on Earth.

23
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,815
Jungles are complex places...

24
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:14,815
...tangled three-dimensional worlds
created by lush tropical vegetation.

25
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:24,095
90% of the animals here spend
their whole lives up in the trees.

26
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:28,855
And each of them has to find
its own way of getting around.

27
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:36,415
Hanging 100 feet above the
ground, a spider monkey.

28
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:46,814
They travel in family groups and
find everything they need in the top

29
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,455
storey of the jungle.

30
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:53,055
Up here isn't a place
for the faint-hearted.

31
00:03:56,495 --> 00:04:00,614
With long limbs and a prehensile
tail that can grip like a hand,

32
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,135
they're built for climbing.

33
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:13,775
But imagine having to learn
these skills as high up as this.

34
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:22,975
One third of spider monkeys
never make it to adulthood.

35
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:29,215
This youngster is only a few months old.

36
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:34,855
Her future depends on her ability to climb.

37
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,134
Playing on a practice tree with
her older brother and sister,

38
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:44,695
she's already learning to use
her tail as a safety line...

39
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:51,095
...under her father's close watch.

40
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:09,454
She's keen to join in the game
but she's the youngest and,

41
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:12,615
as is the way of things,
she's not always welcome.

42
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:21,735
So she chooses her own place to play.

43
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:30,334
But not all trees are the same.

44
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:34,095
This one is for more advanced climbers.

45
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:46,215
Enthusiasm? Certainly!

46
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:53,575
Technique?

47
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:58,495
Room for improvement.

48
00:06:01,855 --> 00:06:05,934
Meanwhile, some of her family have
moved on to look for a new patch of

49
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:06,975
fresh food.

50
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:12,695
The top of the canopy isn't for youngsters.

51
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:19,214
But Father's not looking and the
temptation to join the others is

52
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:20,255
irresistible.

53
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:30,014
She'll need to be careful.

54
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,935
A fall from here would mean certain death.

55
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:44,895
It's the first time she's been
as high as this on her own.

56
00:06:56,335 --> 00:07:00,335
As she climbs still higher, the
branches get thinner and thinner.

57
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,775
Her tail has caught her...

58
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:32,175
...but now she's stuck in mid-air,
unable to reach any other branch.

59
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,735
Father, however, was watching.

60
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,014
He's big and strong enough to form a
bridge with his body so that she can

61
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,055
climb to safety.

62
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,295
Lesson learned.

63
00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:37,455
But it's not just monkeys that
live here, up in the treetops.

64
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:50,535
And, if you are small, finding the
right tree can mean a home for life.

65
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,534
He's a Draco lizard.

66
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:02,295
He's only the size of a
pencil and he eats ants.

67
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:14,734
This one tree could provide him
with all he will ever need...

68
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:16,575
a conveyor belt of food.

69
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:22,575
It's a perfect place to settle down.

70
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:31,015
Well, it would be...

71
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:35,095
...but there's already someone here.

72
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:48,334
This larger male is the tree's owner.

73
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:50,495
And Dracos don't share.

74
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:01,815
The owner's flag is a warning.

75
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:07,815
Trespassers won't be tolerated.

76
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,175
The owner's not only intimidating...

77
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:16,575
...he's prepared to battle.

78
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:30,575
A dead end.

79
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:34,735
Safety is a long way away.

80
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:39,135
Now he must choose.

81
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,055
Fight...

82
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:47,095
...or flee?

83
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:08,815
Only in the jungle do you find
lizards that can soar like dragons.

84
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:16,375
He can travel over 100
feet in a single leap.

85
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:22,295
It's a very fast and efficient
way to move through the jungle.

86
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:34,855
Maybe this new tree will have
food and no resident owner.

87
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:46,855
Everything in the jungle
has to compete for space.

88
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:55,175
Only 2% of the sun's
rays reach the ground...

89
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,574
...so even the plants
must battle for the light

90
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:00,135
they need if they're to grow.

91
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:12,095
300 years ago, this Hura
tree began its race for light.

92
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:19,414
And every day since, it has absorbed
the water and sunshine it needed to

93
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,495
grow into a giant.

94
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:34,935
It has succeeded in doing what
every tree must do to survive...

95
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:39,055
...rise above the gloom
of the jungle floor.

96
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:51,455
And, what is more, its success
has given life to others.

97
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:05,615
Its branches now carry 1,000 other plants.

98
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,174
These particular ferns,

99
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:15,495
figs and orchids live only on
the branches of other trees.

100
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:24,535
1,000 plants growing on one single tree.

101
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:30,975
Throughout the forest, this
story is repeated endless times.

102
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,854
As a consequence, jungles are home

103
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:41,775
to more species of plants
than anywhere else on Earth.

104
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:47,015
And they, in turn, support
a wealth of animals.

105
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:56,855
In Ecuador, the competition
is at its most intense.

106
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:02,215
Here, there are 100 species
of hummingbirds alone...

107
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:07,135
...all fighting for nectar.

108
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:13,454
Each flower only has a
small amount at any one time,

109
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,695
and so it's first come, first served.

110
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:25,334
One hummingbird has gone to
great lengths to avoid conflict

111
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:26,855
with other species.

112
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:35,735
Swordbills are the only bird with
a beak longer than their body.

113
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:42,774
And some flowers are too elongated
for the other 99 species of

114
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,095
hummingbirds here to feed from them.

115
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,414
A swordbill's extraordinary beak, however,

116
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:03,455
enables it to reach the
places that others can't...

117
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:11,655
...the top of this flower, where
the sweet nectar is produced.

118
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:17,975
It has found a solution that means
it doesn't have to join the fight.

119
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:24,974
And, as each long flower blooms, it
gives the swordbill a fresh supply

120
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,095
of food all to itself.

121
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:46,855
But having a beak longer than
your body does have its drawbacks.

122
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,375
For a start, it's tricky to keep it clean.

123
00:16:06,855 --> 00:16:10,495
Harder still, how do you
preen your body feathers?

124
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:14,974
Unlike the other hummers,

125
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:18,215
swordbills can't reach their
feathers with their beak.

126
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,935
The only option, a good old scratch.

127
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:49,735
It's a little unrefined...

128
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:56,455
...but a small price to pay
for an exclusive food supply...

129
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:04,814
...especially when feeding times
are only too frequently interrupted

130
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,854
by storms.

131
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:16,974
Jungles are the richest places on Earth

132
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:19,335
because of one remarkable fact...

133
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:24,455
...they make their own weather.

134
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:34,735
Every day, water rises from the
surface of the leaves as vapour.

135
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:40,255
It's as if the trees breathe out clouds.

136
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:46,335
They gather over the
forest until, finally...

137
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:50,295
...they burst.

138
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:08,855
Rain is the lifeblood of every jungle.

139
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:22,335
And all have to do their best
to endure the daily downpour.

140
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:08,414
In some jungles, like here in Brazil,

141
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:12,774
it rains so much that, for
part of the year, the trees are

142
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:14,455
almost totally submerged.

143
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:27,175
The forest floor is 30 feet
below the water's surface.

144
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:36,455
This is a mysterious world, a
place few people have ever explored.

145
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:49,615
We have much to discover about the
animals for which this is home...

146
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:59,135
...including some you might never
expect to find amongst trees.

147
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:17,775
Here, 1,000 miles from
the sea, are dolphins.

148
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:28,015
A newly identified species of river
dolphin found nowhere else on Earth.

149
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:46,774
In these black, tangled waters, they
have become almost totally blind,

150
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,854
so they move slowly,

151
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:53,535
carefully using their sonar to
scan the forest floor for fish.

152
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,495
If this forest can hide
a new species of dolphin...

153
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:06,815
...what else might there
be here, awaiting discovery?

154
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:15,454
At the shallow margins
of the flooded jungle,

155
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:18,335
rivers flow through lush vegetation.

156
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:26,535
Here, food is so abundant,
it supports giants.

157
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:31,935
Capybara, the biggest
rodents in the world...

158
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:40,255
...giant otters the size of a man...

159
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:47,654
...and the rulers of these rivers...

160
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,055
...caiman.

161
00:21:51,815 --> 00:21:54,734
They grow to ten feet
long and kill anything

162
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:56,735
they get between their jaws.

163
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:05,215
But there are more artful hunters...

164
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:09,695
...drawn here from the surrounding forest.

165
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:25,735
A jaguar, the supreme jungle predator.

166
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:35,895
The river marks the
edge of his territory...

167
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:40,535
...but here he has competition.

168
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:05,455
He's now in the territory of a female.

169
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:15,015
She has ruled this stretch
of river for five years.

170
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:19,935
This is her place to hunt.

171
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,455
Capybara are strong and wary.

172
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:57,695
The key is stealth.

173
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:20,535
She needs to get within
three feet if she's to pounce.

174
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:44,495
Not this time.

175
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:57,415
She's not the only female here.

176
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:03,575
Each part of this jungle's edge
is ruled by a different queen.

177
00:25:14,575 --> 00:25:19,535
Few places on Earth have enough
food to support so many big cats.

178
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:47,935
The male hunts in a different way.

179
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:59,615
Weighing almost 300 lbs,
it's hard to be stealthy...

180
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:05,814
...and with so many other jaguars around,

181
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,575
he doesn't bother with wary capybara.

182
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:17,135
He seeks a different prey.

183
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:43,294
He's become a killer

184
00:26:43,295 --> 00:26:44,735
of killers.

185
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:15,255
Jaguars have the most
powerful bite of any cat.

186
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:22,175
And he knows the caiman's
most vulnerable point...

187
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:25,935
...the back of its skull.

188
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:57,694
Hunters living in the dense
understorey of the jungle

189
00:27:57,695 --> 00:28:00,175
come in all shapes and sizes.

190
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,695
But they share a problem.

191
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:14,695
How to tell what is a
plant, and what is prey.

192
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:22,334
This is a game of hide and
seek that can be won or lost

193
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:24,055
in the blink of an eye.

194
00:28:54,255 --> 00:28:57,894
The long contest between predator and prey

195
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:01,535
has produced mimicry
of astounding accuracy.

196
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:23,495
A leaf-tailed gecko
masquerading as lichen.

197
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:52,895
Some animals take camouflage
a stage further still...

198
00:29:57,215 --> 00:29:59,294
...and these streams in Costa Rica

199
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:02,055
are home to one of the most remarkable.

200
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:14,815
A glass frog.

201
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:28,454
A male, and tiny, no
bigger than your fingernail

202
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:31,655
and almost entirely transparent...

203
00:30:33,695 --> 00:30:35,255
...as he needs to be.

204
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:43,534
Almost everything that walks
past here could eat him,

205
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:45,055
even a cricket.

206
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:54,174
His best chance is to stay
absolutely still and trust that

207
00:30:54,175 --> 00:30:56,255
the cricket looks right through him.

208
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,254
Danger passed,

209
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,694
and that's just as well,

210
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:27,775
because he is a father...

211
00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:33,415
...and he's guarding
some very precious eggs.

212
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:41,214
For the last few weeks,
females, one after the other,

213
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:44,495
have visited him and entrusted
him with their offspring.

214
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:50,535
Some are now almost ready to hatch.

215
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:58,374
There are several clutches on
the leaf, and those at the top,

216
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,735
the most recently laid,
are barely a day old.

217
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:11,375
But in the jungle, there's
always someone out to get you.

218
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:22,135
This wasp is a specialist
hunter of frogs' eggs.

219
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:28,335
It's noticed the wriggling
tadpoles at the bottom of the leaf.

220
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:35,215
He mustn't move.

221
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:39,254
The youngest eggs are the most vulnerable,

222
00:32:39,255 --> 00:32:40,855
and he can't guard them all.

223
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:04,655
But these tadpoles are not as
helpless as they might appear.

224
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:17,454
Incredibly, the unhatched
tadpoles can sense danger,

225
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:22,455
and the oldest and strongest wriggle
free and drop into the stream below.

226
00:33:40,255 --> 00:33:42,974
The eggs at the top of the leaf, however,

227
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:46,694
are still too young to hatch,

228
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:49,095
and now the wasps know they're there.

229
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:57,895
But the male's back looks very
like the youngest cluster of eggs...

230
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,775
...and that seems to confuse the wasps.

231
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:30,575
Using his own body as
a decoy is a huge risk.

232
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,575
The wasp stings could kill him.

233
00:35:01,575 --> 00:35:04,775
He's managed to save most of his young.

234
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:14,294
He'll have to remain on
guard for another two weeks,

235
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:19,295
but in the jungle, just surviving
the day can count as a success.

236
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:35,414
With the coming of the night,

237
00:35:35,415 --> 00:35:39,095
a new cast of jungle
characters takes to the stage.

238
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:47,455
Flying insects begin to glow
as they search for mates.

239
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:56,535
Fungi, unlike plants, thrive in
the darkness of the forest floor.

240
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:03,494
They're hidden until they begin to
develop the incredible structures

241
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,095
with which they reproduce.

242
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:11,854
Each releases millions
of microscopic spores

243
00:36:11,855 --> 00:36:14,015
that drift invisibly away.

244
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:24,214
Many have fruiting bodies that reach
upwards to catch any feeble current

245
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,295
there might be in the clammy air.

246
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:33,774
But this one, as it grows,

247
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,215
becomes luminous.

248
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:51,495
Why fungi light up has
remained a mystery...

249
00:36:58,295 --> 00:36:59,535
...until now.

250
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:11,654
Scientists studying the
brightest fungi in the world

251
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:13,975
think they may have an answer.

252
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:22,215
Like a beacon, the light attracts insects.

253
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:30,815
From far and wide.

254
00:37:38,935 --> 00:37:43,494
To this click beetle, a bright
light means only one thing...

255
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,974
a female click beetle,

256
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,495
so he flashes in reply.

257
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:03,255
But he doesn't get the
reception he was expecting.

258
00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:13,215
Confused, he starts searching for
a female, and that helps the fungus.

259
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:19,415
By the time he gives up, he's
covered in the fungus's spores.

260
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:23,734
And, as he continues
his quest for a female,

261
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:26,935
he carries these spores to
other parts of the forest.

262
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:35,015
And there are even stranger
things glowing in the jungle night.

263
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:43,775
These are the multicoloured
lights of a railroad worm.

264
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:49,935
It's not really a worm, but a
poisonous, caterpillar-like beetle.

265
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:56,895
The yellow lights warn other
creatures to keep out of its way.

266
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:09,295
It's hunting for millipedes.

267
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:24,175
When it finds the trail of one,
it switches off its yellow lights.

268
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:33,935
Now it only has a red light on its head.

269
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:42,295
Millipedes can't see red light.

270
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:52,935
So, to them, the railroad worm in
stealth mode is virtually invisible.

271
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:08,055
And that is the end of the millipede.

272
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:24,454
Competition in the jungles
forces animals to specialise

273
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,494
in every aspect of their life,

274
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,055
including courtship.

275
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:36,134
This has produced some of the most
beautiful and elaborate displays

276
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:37,615
on the planet.

277
00:40:39,975 --> 00:40:45,414
A male red
bird-of-paradise,

278
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:49,015
competing to attract a female by dancing.

279
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:53,255
One has come to survey what's on offer.

280
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:13,254
She is an independent lady,

281
00:41:13,255 --> 00:41:18,454
and she will select whichever
male takes her fancy.

282
00:41:34,415 --> 00:41:35,815
She makes her choice.

283
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:57,255
But now she doesn't seem quite so sure.

284
00:42:05,575 --> 00:42:10,495
No? Perhaps he's just a little too keen.

285
00:42:23,815 --> 00:42:26,095
Maybe he'll have better luck tomorrow.

286
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:38,695
Red birds-of-paradise
display in the treetops.

287
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:45,975
Other members of the family dance
in the gloom of the forest floor.

288
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:52,655
This is a Wilson's
bird-of-paradise.

289
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:57,495
He's brightly coloured, but
about the size of a sparrow.

290
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:06,014
He's lived most of his life
alone, but now he's an adult,

291
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:08,615
and he too needs to attract a mate.

292
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,055
This little patch of
light might help him do so.

293
00:43:22,535 --> 00:43:25,654
First, he tidies things up.

294
00:43:25,655 --> 00:43:30,654
Showing off in this jumble
of leaves wouldn't be easy,

295
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:34,975
and his beauty will stand out
better against a plain background.

296
00:43:43,015 --> 00:43:47,654
He doesn't want bright leaves
to divert a visitor's attention.

297
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:49,055
They all need to go.

298
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:54,255
Even the green ones.

299
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,975
Especially the green ones.

300
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,094
His stage is set.

301
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:14,574
A central pole, and a
little patch of light.

302
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:15,615
It's perfect.

303
00:44:19,695 --> 00:44:23,014
And now, he must hope
a female hears his call.

304
00:44:34,575 --> 00:44:36,775
He can wait here for weeks on end.

305
00:44:46,695 --> 00:44:48,695
At last, a female.

306
00:44:51,495 --> 00:44:53,775
Time to take up position.

307
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:59,695
She will judge him by the
brightness of his feathers.

308
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:08,174
But for the female to see him at his best,

309
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:13,774
he needs her to perch
directly above his stage,

310
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:15,175
under the light.

311
00:45:18,735 --> 00:45:22,015
This might be his only chance to shine.

312
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:33,094
Now, when she's looking directly
down on him, he reveals a display

313
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:34,935
for her eyes only.

314
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:43,414
In the gloom of the forest floor,

315
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:47,215
he is a dazzling blaze of iridescent green.

316
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:51,775
The brightest leaf in the forest.

317
00:46:00,295 --> 00:46:01,895
And that does the trick.

318
00:46:12,015 --> 00:46:16,254
Each animal must find its own
way of surviving the competition

319
00:46:16,255 --> 00:46:17,775
of the jungle.

320
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:35,054
This crowded world is so full of
invention that almost all kinds

321
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:39,415
of animals on land can trace
their origins back here...

322
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:45,975
...including us.

323
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:54,255
These forests in Madagascar are
home to one of our distant cousins.

324
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:03,254
This female indri has fought to
keep this particular patch of forest

325
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:06,654
safe for herself and her family.

326
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,494
Every morning, the family
come together to sing,

327
00:47:20,495 --> 00:47:24,455
their way of reminding others
that this is their home.

328
00:47:30,775 --> 00:47:34,214
Indri are so closely adapted to living here

329
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:37,095
that now they can live nowhere else.

330
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:46,134
For them and the billions of animals
with whom they share their home,

331
00:47:46,135 --> 00:47:48,655
the jungle is a sanctuary.

332
00:47:52,975 --> 00:47:54,815
But this is changing.

333
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:02,734
Even in the ten years since the
head of this family was born,

334
00:48:02,735 --> 00:48:06,774
one million hectares of the
rainforest have been destroyed

335
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:10,334
in Madagascar alone,

336
00:48:10,335 --> 00:48:14,055
and, with it, half the indri
families that once lived there.

337
00:48:19,695 --> 00:48:24,334
The local people say the indris
are our brothers and their song is

338
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:28,415
a call to remind us that we,
too, once depended on the jungle.

339
00:48:37,655 --> 00:48:41,815
This Eden is still a
place of wonder and magic.

340
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:50,855
Something, surely, worth protecting.

341
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:12,454
Jungles are still some of the
least explored places on Earth,

342
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:14,854
and with good reason.

343
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:16,815
They are testing places to work.

344
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:23,094
Here in the flooded forests of Brazil,

345
00:49:23,095 --> 00:49:27,535
the team are on the trail of a newly
discovered species of river dolphin.

346
00:49:29,215 --> 00:49:33,095
So little is known about it that
just finding it will be a challenge.

347
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:40,774
Their base for five weeks is a hut
on the only bit of dry land around,

348
00:49:40,775 --> 00:49:43,134
but it's already occupied.

349
00:49:43,135 --> 00:49:45,694
It appears someone's been making a nest.

350
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:47,014
A resident rat.

351
00:49:47,015 --> 00:49:51,134
- Hello, little rat.
- And on the food cupboard...

352
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:53,975
Hello. Are you a bit shy?

353
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:02,055
If the housemates are hostile,
the hitchhikers are even worse.

354
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:06,055
A large spider.

355
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,535
Oh, my God.

356
00:50:09,935 --> 00:50:13,774
And a colony of aggressive
red ants looking for a ride.

357
00:50:13,775 --> 00:50:15,814
Shall we knock into them?

358
00:50:15,815 --> 00:50:19,534
They'll board the boat
like a bunch of pirates,

359
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:20,975
and they'll gnaw our faces off.

360
00:50:24,295 --> 00:50:26,054
That might not be quite true,

361
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:29,535
but intimidating animals are
the least of their problems.

362
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:34,414
The flooded forest is not only vast,

363
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:38,974
it's impenetrable, and this new
species of dolphin could be anywhere

364
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:43,215
in 150,000 square miles
of tangled treetops.

365
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:47,015
But the crew have a plan.

366
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,814
Dolphins use sound to find their
way through the flooded forest

367
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,855
by making clicks. Sonar.

368
00:50:54,975 --> 00:50:58,894
Waterproof microphones allow the
crew to eavesdrop on the dolphins,

369
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:00,455
and so follow them.

370
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:06,215
But that's easier said than done.

371
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:12,854
So, this is the clear path.

372
00:51:12,855 --> 00:51:15,655
Can you see it? There.

373
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:26,294
It takes them a week to get their
first glimpse of this new species,

374
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,855
and even then, it lasts less than a second.

375
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:34,575
There appears to be only one dolphin.

376
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:42,415
And, frustratingly, it can pop
up anywhere without warning.

377
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:48,254
Been looking through the water
and seeing bodies kind of appear

378
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:52,055
out of the murk, and then disappear again.

379
00:51:54,975 --> 00:51:58,815
Eventually, the dolphin leads the
crew to an open gap in the forest.

380
00:52:09,455 --> 00:52:11,895
We made it! Yay!

381
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:18,575
Here, at last, there may be a chance
of getting something in the can.

382
00:52:26,095 --> 00:52:30,695
Their first shot, but again, a
single breath, and then it's gone.

383
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:38,814
- Hello, you.
- With the dolphin as close as this,

384
00:52:38,815 --> 00:52:41,334
the crew can try a different technique...

385
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:43,895
towing an underwater
camera behind the boat.

386
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:50,295
Dolphin literally just
came up parallel to it.

387
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:54,814
The problem is that the water
is so murky, that the dolphin is

388
00:52:54,815 --> 00:52:57,855
almost invisible, even when
right next to the camera.

389
00:53:05,255 --> 00:53:07,854
However, now the dolphin
is in this channel,

390
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:09,695
the crew can try a different tack.

391
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,055
Michael Sanderson is a drone operator.

392
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:26,454
As long as the dolphin's in open water,

393
00:53:26,455 --> 00:53:28,775
it might be possible to
follow it from the air.

394
00:53:32,815 --> 00:53:35,454
We've worked out the
dolphins seem to be here,

395
00:53:35,455 --> 00:53:39,495
and we can do the drone work,
so this is our kind of best bet.

396
00:53:40,495 --> 00:53:43,214
Leaving Michael and his
drone on the sand spit,

397
00:53:43,215 --> 00:53:45,175
the crew head back to open water.

398
00:53:46,415 --> 00:53:49,135
But this is called the
flooded forest for a reason.

399
00:53:52,175 --> 00:53:54,174
The rain here can be torrential,

400
00:53:54,175 --> 00:53:56,974
and although storms normally pass quickly,

401
00:53:56,975 --> 00:53:59,175
this one is clearly not a normal storm.

402
00:54:04,615 --> 00:54:06,494
Is it not working?

403
00:54:06,495 --> 00:54:09,414
The motor has broken, and
with the boat flooding,

404
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:10,935
the crew must head for the bank.

405
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,134
It looked like the
rainstorm was going to pass,

406
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,334
and it hasn't passed at
all. It's very, very heavy,

407
00:54:22,335 --> 00:54:24,655
and I'm soaked through to the skin.

408
00:54:28,655 --> 00:54:32,334
They're stranded, the
kit is getting drenched,

409
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:35,694
trees are falling, and Michael
is trapped somewhere down-river.

410
00:54:35,695 --> 00:54:39,534
This is the hardest rain
I've ever seen in my life.

411
00:54:39,535 --> 00:54:43,214
- It's incredible.
- I'm hoping Michael's all right.

412
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:46,494
And there's been tree fall
all up around behind us.

413
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:49,374
Michael's down there on
a tiny little sand spit,

414
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,615
with the other boat,
with his opticopter out.

415
00:54:53,855 --> 00:54:55,255
Kind of scary.

416
00:54:57,655 --> 00:54:58,894
After two hours,

417
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:02,534
a break in the storm gives Michael
a chance to rejoin the team.

418
00:55:02,535 --> 00:55:06,614
Just got caught in one of the
heaviest storms I've ever seen.

419
00:55:06,615 --> 00:55:11,734
Got up to this much water on
the tarp, and the other one, so

420
00:55:11,735 --> 00:55:14,334
I don't know if this is
going to live any more,

421
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:16,974
because that was on the floor.

422
00:55:16,975 --> 00:55:20,294
It looks like it's game over for the drone.

423
00:55:20,295 --> 00:55:22,415
Yeah, it was pretty scary, wasn't it?

424
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:28,255
Over the next 12 hours, the
storm returns again and again.

425
00:55:29,855 --> 00:55:31,614
If this bad weather continues,

426
00:55:31,615 --> 00:55:34,575
the crew may not be able to
get back out to the dolphin.

427
00:55:40,175 --> 00:55:42,894
The next morning,

428
00:55:42,895 --> 00:55:46,215
clear skies, and the
drone might be fixable.

429
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:50,694
But the longer it takes, the
more chance that the dolphin

430
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,814
will have returned to the flooded forest,

431
00:55:53,815 --> 00:55:55,695
and then it'll be back to square one.

432
00:55:58,415 --> 00:56:00,455
But finally, their luck is in.

433
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,335
The dolphin is still there.

434
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:09,294
For the first time, they
have a chance to film

435
00:56:09,295 --> 00:56:12,614
from the water and the
air, and finally discover

436
00:56:12,615 --> 00:56:15,015
what this elusive animal is really doing.

437
00:56:16,695 --> 00:56:19,814
They were in the boat and they
were looking around and going,

438
00:56:19,815 --> 00:56:22,054
"Yeah, there are some bubbles."

439
00:56:22,055 --> 00:56:25,934
We were flying with the drone
and we could see dolphins,

440
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:30,574
and while they thought they could
only see one dolphin, we saw five.

441
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:32,694
And they had no idea.

442
00:56:32,695 --> 00:56:35,934
The crew are surprised to find
these dolphins aren't solitary,

443
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:38,694
but come together to hunt as a team.

444
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,854
You're starting to see stuff with
the drone that you suddenly go,

445
00:56:41,855 --> 00:56:44,174
"I thought there was
one dolphin there," and

446
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:47,974
then you count that there are five
and then you're looking in one place

447
00:56:47,975 --> 00:56:50,694
and they're all behind
you, laughing at you.

448
00:56:50,695 --> 00:56:54,134
This new perspective has
given the crew a first glimpse

449
00:56:54,135 --> 00:56:56,174
into a mysterious jungle animal

450
00:56:56,175 --> 00:56:59,655
in one of the least-known
corners of the Earth.

451
00:57:08,135 --> 00:57:12,615
Next time... a land of extremes
that pushes life to the limit.

452
00:57:14,855 --> 00:57:18,495
Animals have extraordinary ways of
dealing with the hostile conditions.

453
00:57:20,215 --> 00:57:24,694
Creating the most epic
survival stories on Earth.

454
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:26,335
These are deserts.
