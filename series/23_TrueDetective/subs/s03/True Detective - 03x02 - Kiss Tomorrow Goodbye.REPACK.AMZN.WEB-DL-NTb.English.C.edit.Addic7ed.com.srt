1
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:08,601
Could you tell us about
November 7th, 1980?

2
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:09,738
I remember everything.

3
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:14,403
Will and Julie went riding
their bikes around 4:00.

4
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:17,236
Supposed to go by a friend's
house, kid says he never saw 'em.

5
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:18,444
What did you do?

6
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:20,027
You're their mother, where were you?

7
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:21,444
I am entitled to a life!

8
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:23,111
How long have you folks
been sleeping separate?

9
00:00:23,113 --> 00:00:25,640
Dan left last May,
then I took the couch.

10
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:27,238
- Dan?
- My cousin.

11
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:29,823
You're having memory problems, right?

12
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:31,074
What?

13
00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:32,341
You have memory problems.

14
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:34,695
Henry's coming with
the people from the TV.

15
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:36,469
So, you caught the case back in '80?

16
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,927
Didn't work again 'til 90.

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,957
And your wife's book

18
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,429
was considered a classic
of literary non-fiction.

19
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:43,888
I teach English. Will's
a student of mine.

20
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:45,903
There's a few of the older boys.

21
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:47,861
They make it hard on the others.

22
00:00:47,863 --> 00:00:49,486
Last name is Woodard,

23
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:51,778
saw him riding around when
I was looking for the kids.

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,945
What's your partner doing?

25
00:00:52,947 --> 00:00:55,613
Man was a long-range
reconnaissance in 'Nam.

26
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,528
I found the boy. There's
no sign of the girl.

27
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,328
Two months ago, the burglary

28
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:02,867
and only one set of prints.

29
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,993
Julie Purcell.

30
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:05,113
She's alive?

31
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:32,242
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

32
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:29,986
You have the autopsy report.

33
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:32,446
I don't need to go over that.

34
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,486
Blunt force trauma...

35
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:38,738
and a cervical fracture.

36
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:42,736
Somebody broke his neck.

37
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:44,446
Brought him to that cave.

38
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:48,446
Folded his hands, I guess.

39
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:52,820
Alan.

40
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:55,027
Talk to me about
Oklahoma. You have to, man.

41
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:56,609
Wayne, this isn't the time...

42
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,777
How many sets of prints were taken?

43
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,109
Do they know she was one of
the robbers and not a customer?

44
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:04,818
If they found her, you wouldn't
even be talkin' to me, right?

45
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,361
Do they have video surveillance?

46
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:08,289
Mr. Hays, the purpose of this deposition

47
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,903
is to give your statement,
not to extract one from us.

48
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:14,528
I'm pretty easygoin',
but go away already.

49
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,861
I don't think I will.

50
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:19,453
Look, we're not at
liberty to divulge details

51
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:21,902
of an ongoing police investigation,

52
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,152
nor to share discovery items with anyone

53
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:25,861
other than the prosecutor's office.

54
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:27,653
Now, you can talk to them,
if they'll talk to you...

55
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:31,236
All right, stop.

56
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,444
Wayne.

57
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:35,653
Finish up today, all right?

58
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:38,319
Then after, we'll speak.

59
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,523
I'm sayin'...

60
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,942
we'll talk. Okay?

61
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:48,528
Now, you were sayin'.

62
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,820
You questioned people during this time.

63
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,364
- Right?
- Do you know another way to do it?

64
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:58,820
The father worked at Wilson Body Works,

65
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:01,027
where they used to make
parts for school buses.

66
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:03,152
We talked to everybody there.

67
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:06,361
Employed about a hundred
people from West Finger.

68
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:08,695
The dolls were their own thing.

69
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:11,321
Wasn't gettin' us anywhere, either.

70
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,611
Thank you very much.

71
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:23,486
That guy collected garbage, Woodard.

72
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,069
We talked to him too.

73
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:29,194
I saw the kids. They were
pedaling into the sun.

74
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,947
Headed west?

75
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:35,945
We went by your place.

76
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:38,069
You sorta collect things, huh?

77
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,403
I salvage trash that I can sell.

78
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:42,569
You don't need to make
it sound better than that.

79
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:46,444
You got any other properties?
Anywhere you keep things?

80
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,069
I don't have anyplace else.

81
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:51,569
What'd you do before this?

82
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:54,486
Before you collected scrap.

83
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:58,986
Uh, came back from overseas. '72.

84
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:01,194
Did some carpentry.

85
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,736
Construction dropped off.
Things didn't work out.

86
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,611
My marriage. Stuff.

87
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,569
I was gone too long.

88
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:11,361
About four years ago she left me.

89
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:13,279
Took the kids.

90
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,569
I was motor pool.

91
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:20,403
My man here was a LRRP. Two tours.

92
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:24,655
Detective Hays. They called
him Purple Hays over there.

93
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,027
You miss your family?

94
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,903
I... Yeah.

95
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:33,444
I miss being someone that way...

96
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,405
a way I could have a family.

97
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:38,277
You were recon?

98
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,903
Seventy-fifth Infantry.

99
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,152
Sergeant.

100
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,194
You must be pretty insane.

101
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:47,736
Volunteerin' for that.

102
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:50,279
I didn't think about it
much, tell ya the truth.

103
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,111
I ain't one of them burnouts.

104
00:06:56,113 --> 00:07:00,179
Ya know, comes back bustin'
guys up, gettin' high.

105
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:01,903
And I ain't a bum.

106
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:04,319
I keep a house. I pay my way!

107
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,822
Hey. I ain't judgin', man.

108
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:11,778
Look, I punch in and out.

109
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,861
I put on a suit in the mornin'.

110
00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:16,027
And bein' honest...

111
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:19,446
I don't have much of a life.

112
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,528
So why?

113
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,403
Why punch in?

114
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:26,903
Why the suit? Why...

115
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,571
I don't ask myself questions like that.

116
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,154
Could be I'm too
chickenshit, Mr. Woodard.

117
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,695
It ain't my world.

118
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:41,277
Less than yours, even.

119
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,029
But I did pretty good
at following orders.

120
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:47,319
Now...

121
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,632
You ever do this?

122
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,008
I miss when "Don't get killed"

123
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,810
was the only thing on my to-do list.

124
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,820
It's hard to unplug from that.

125
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,321
I spent a year comin' down.

126
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,405
Just to go back over it, you
sure you didn't see anything?

127
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,945
I told you.

128
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:15,361
I saw the teenagers out there, too.

129
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:17,903
I was goin' in the other direction.

130
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:20,370
You like kids, generally?

131
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:23,439
Do...

132
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:25,942
What the fuck's the
right answer to that?

133
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:30,110
You think I...

134
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:33,569
Listen, I got two kids, okay?

135
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:35,238
Where are they?

136
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:38,111
I don't know.

137
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:40,027
She didn't tell me.

138
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:42,361
And I haven't gone lookin'.

139
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:45,569
If I'd never left...

140
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:48,029
I think it'd have been fine.

141
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,569
But to go, and come back...

142
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:55,778
I just couldn't put myself back
in that old story, that's all.

143
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,988
And I couldn't leave
it, either. Ya know?

144
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,945
You ever been someplace
you couldn't leave,

145
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:06,695
and you couldn't stay...

146
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:09,571
both at the same time?

147
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,446
Do you remember the place?

148
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:26,905
I remember.

149
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:41,277
I can tell you all that
none of us will rest

150
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,528
until we achieve justice in the matter.

151
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,820
Our detectives are hard at work,

152
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:49,194
and this is priority
one for law enforcement

153
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:52,903
in Washington County
and Northwest Arkansas.

154
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:54,720
Now, it's temporary,

155
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:57,116
but we're gonna have to have
a curfew for a little while.

156
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,630
It's important that we keep
an eye on our kids right now,

157
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,129
and we want to make sure you
know where they are at all times,

158
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:05,486
and that they're indoors by 8:00.

159
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:09,027
Now, we can't really say too
much about the investigation,

160
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:11,486
but I'm here to answer
any questions I can.

161
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:14,361
Well, I don't let mine
go near Devil's Den.

162
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,945
Everybody knows you got
something happenin' in it.

163
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:18,376
Bums, junkies.

164
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:20,403
Queers meet up out there.

165
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:22,653
You have a question, sir?

166
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,945
I wanna know what y'all are
doing to break up that stuff.

167
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:26,986
Clean up that park!

168
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:28,444
What about these junkies?

169
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:30,861
You got heroin in Arkansas now.

170
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,069
Right now our focus is tryin'
to find this little girl

171
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:35,528
and bring her home.

172
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,695
We're considering every possibility.

173
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:39,194
And what about that fella

174
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:41,775
always diggin' through
everybody's trash?

175
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:43,860
Mr. Kindt, can you tell us

176
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:45,611
if they think the girl is still alive?

177
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:47,861
It's our hope that she's alive, yes.

178
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:51,725
But again, I really can't discuss any
of the details of the investigation.

179
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:55,986
Now, our detectives have a
pair of Xeroxes to pass out.

180
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,653
One is a picture of Julie Purcell.

181
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:02,889
The other is the kind of
backpack that the boy, Will, had.

182
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:05,111
It's red and has his name on it.

183
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:08,361
Now, if anyone has any
information of potential interest,

184
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:09,820
no matter how far afield,

185
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:11,403
share it with us.

186
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,319
And trust that we will not
let this terrible, cowardly act

187
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:16,111
go unpunished.

188
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:18,986
Your old boss got
real vocal around then.

189
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:21,736
Gerald Kindt had an election
comin' up the next year.

190
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:25,903
I know. I guess that works to
some point in your petition.

191
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:29,113
It's worth notin', I
think, his motivations.

192
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:31,653
Well...

193
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:34,078
now he's fuckin' State Attorney General.

194
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:38,790
But we didn't work for
him. He was your boss.

195
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:41,113
Oh, not for a good while now.

196
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:46,403
The broken neck is clear.

197
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,277
But the way the arms were folded...

198
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,405
- I know.
- And the other thing.

199
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:52,259
The hell are those dolls for?

200
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:55,610
Correct. Look familiar, some way.

201
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:58,444
Like the kind of thing at country fairs.

202
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:01,778
What do you get from
that crowd in there?

203
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,903
They're worried.

204
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:10,861
Could be thinkin' it
coulda been a neighbor.

205
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:15,695
Had 'em sign in. Saw some
shifty eyes in there, but...

206
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:17,905
may be my redneck radar.

207
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,449
I don't know.

208
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:23,277
Excuse me.

209
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,488
- Hi.
- Hey.

210
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,655
You found him, didn't you?

211
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,403
You look like you haven't
slept in a couple days.

212
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:53,822
Work to do. How's it at school?

213
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,697
Sad.

214
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:00,321
People are scared.

215
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:07,319
Well...

216
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,154
been askin' about this.

217
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,528
We haven't gotten anything.

218
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,321
I don't know, you
knowin' the kids and such.

219
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,695
You ever seen anything like this?

220
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:23,069
Seen a kid with a doll like this?

221
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,361
Uh, maybe. I don't know.

222
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:29,321
Looks like something you'd find
in a craft store or something.

223
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:34,697
I... I haven't seen any
of the kids with them.

224
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:37,657
Can I keep this?

225
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,860
Uh, sure.

226
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:41,820
I'll ask around with the kids,

227
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,947
maybe check with the other teachers.

228
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,617
All right. Thanks.

229
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,653
Uh...

230
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,446
Amelia.

231
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:57,738
- Okay, I gotta go.
- All right.

232
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,196
Be safe.

233
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:08,319
Now, this family...

234
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:10,501
Haven't we spent 
enough time with this?

235
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,530
It's helpin' me.

236
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,361
Bringin' things back.

237
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,238
How's that?

238
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:32,694
Your mother.

239
00:14:34,378 --> 00:14:36,628
I, uh...

240
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,695
I have trouble seein' her sometimes.

241
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,653
Or, uh... I know who she is,

242
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:47,947
but the parts of our lives, pieces...

243
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:51,822
I can't picture 'em.

244
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:56,653
You think Mom wants
you to keep doin' this?

245
00:14:56,655 --> 00:14:59,988
It's bringin' things 
back. Goin' over the case.

246
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:02,736
I'm rememberin' things.

247
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:05,446
My life. Your sister.

248
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,286
You know when the last
time I saw Rebecca?

249
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:20,822
Mom's funeral?

250
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:26,697
I think you talked on the
phone a few months back.

251
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:43,154
You sure you wanna keep
talkin' to the TV people?

252
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,403
That woman, the director...

253
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,319
I wanna know what she's after.

254
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,945
What they might know now.

255
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:57,820
She said she'd, uh, show
me somethin' next time.

256
00:15:57,822 --> 00:15:59,861
She's baitin' ya, Dad.

257
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:03,196
Do you think she cares at
all about you or who did it?

258
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:08,569
She just wants people
to watch her shitty show.

259
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:11,653
And I think...

260
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:14,277
Mom would want you to move on.

261
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,363
Enjoy the family you have around you.

262
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:21,486
Well...

263
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:25,728
she and I always had different
ideas. I remember that.

264
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:34,736
Wayne. Roland.

265
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:38,069
Special Agents Burt
Diller and John Bowen.

266
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:40,736
Thanks, Detective, we'll
get these back ASAP.

267
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,403
Want you to know we have no intention

268
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:45,173
of impeding or usurping
your investigation.

269
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:47,119
This is a Task Force.

270
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:49,569
One unit with a common goal.

271
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:51,569
Feds are gonna take the
lead with the kidnappin'.

272
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:54,240
You two are still point
on the death investigation.

273
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:56,991
Both of which will hopefully
lead to the same solution.

274
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:58,558
Everybody shares everything.

275
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,194
We'll be doing debriefs
first thing every mornin'.

276
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:02,717
Everybody turns in dailies.

277
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,673
How you guys wanna go forward?

278
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:07,370
We got a multi-state
APB out on the girl.

279
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:10,165
Checkpoints along state
lines. Agents advised.

280
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:15,822
Let us get caught up.
We'll figure our next move.

281
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:18,527
Time?

282
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,653
You two have somewhere to be?

283
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,947
We got a funeral to get to.

284
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:49,945
I know we spoke on the phone, but...

285
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:52,319
want to touch base
on a couple of things.

286
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,486
What's that?

287
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:57,027
I haven't been out here since last May.

288
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:59,277
You stayed in the boy,
Will's, room, right?

289
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,111
Yeah. Told you I did.

290
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,569
You leave a couple magazines behind?

291
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:05,095
Under the mattress?

292
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:08,902
Ohh, damn. Yeah, maybe I did.

293
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:10,695
Should I, uh...

294
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:13,486
- Never mind.
- You recall anything

295
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:15,194
from the time you spent in the house

296
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:16,945
might be worth mentioning?

297
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:19,653
Like you ever see anybody
talkin' to the kids?

298
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:21,945
Any adults you didn't recognize?

299
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:26,152
Nah. Nah, can't say I
recall anything like that.

300
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:29,069
Them kids, they kept
to themselves a lot.

301
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:31,778
The house was a pretty tense place.

302
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,027
You can probably tell, Lucy
and Tom aren't real happy.

303
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:36,986
Before any of this.

304
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:40,845
Will and Julie, they play
outside the house a lot?

305
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:44,361
Yeah. I think so. I don't think
they liked being around there.

306
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:48,444
You know, Mom and Dad
angry all the time.

307
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,528
Were you pretty close to Will and Julie?

308
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,653
I don't know. We got along.

309
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:03,695
I played with them a couple times.

310
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:06,403
They didn't see me much
before I stayed here.

311
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:08,111
But they were good kids.

312
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,321
What do you think of Tom?

313
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,569
He's an all right guy.

314
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,666
I feel sorry for him.

315
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:20,085
I felt for him even before all this.

316
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:24,069
I mean, in my opinion,

317
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:26,738
Lucy always needed, like, a strong male.

318
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:31,986
You stayin' in town long?

319
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:34,236
Nah, I gotta get back to work.

320
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:37,069
Family could probably use you around.

321
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:38,736
I can't get the time off.

322
00:19:38,738 --> 00:19:41,736
It's not like there's
a lot I can do for 'em.

323
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:43,361
And the night of?

324
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:46,071
Your neighbor can
confirm you were at home?

325
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,611
I don't know if they can or not.

326
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:54,403
But you could check with the
Starlight Bar in Springfield.

327
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:56,986
I had a couple there after
work, and then I went home

328
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,277
and watched CHiPs.

329
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,695
You wanna search my place?

330
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,470
Would that be okay?

331
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:06,224
Sure.

332
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:09,068
But maybe...

333
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:11,822
you should be out there
tryin' to find my niece.

334
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:17,321
I'm gonna get back to Lucy.

335
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,152
Like we said over the phone,

336
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:30,444
we hadn't seen or talked with
the kids since last Christmas.

337
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:33,238
Nearly a year ago.

338
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:36,152
She doesn't like us.

339
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:37,695
That's Lucy, you mean?

340
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:40,064
'Loise, let's don't, now.

341
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,732
Why not now?

342
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:45,193
Why not just say it?
The children are lost.

343
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:47,444
Yes, I mean Lucy.

344
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,569
She runs around on Tom, you know.

345
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,903
Every marriage has its own story.

346
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,236
Nobody knows except the two involved.

347
00:20:54,238 --> 00:20:56,530
Bull. She was a terrible...

348
00:20:57,613 --> 00:20:59,319
You know,

349
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:02,653
there's been some wonderin' about Julie.

350
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:04,236
Don't. Not today.

351
00:21:04,238 --> 00:21:05,820
Tom was workin' offshore.

352
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:08,725
Could have been weldin' in
Texas when Julie was conceived.

353
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:12,319
- Now, I've wondered...
- Goddamnit!!!

354
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:15,780
Not today, Eloise. Not today.

355
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:21,029
Hey.

356
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,363
Why don't the two of y'all
get out of my house for today?

357
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:29,894
Mom, Dad.

358
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:48,528
Yes, I got it now.

359
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,194
There's a web forum that posts

360
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:51,736
about real-life criminal cases,

361
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:54,528
things that are unsolved or unresolved.

362
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,154
They have a whole section
on the Purcell case.

363
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,029
This is what people do now?

364
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:08,403
They go in lots of directions.

365
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:10,403
Did you know at various times since,

366
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:12,986
large-scale pedophile rings
connected to people of influence

367
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:14,861
were uncovered in the surrounding areas?

368
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:17,405
Do you know about the Franklin scandal?

369
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:20,778
No.

370
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,569
It's been theorized that the straw dolls

371
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:26,403
are a sign of pedophile
groups, like the crooked spiral.

372
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,453
I don't think that's right.

373
00:22:32,154 --> 00:22:36,736
Can I ask, with what happened in
1990 and you leaving the force,

374
00:22:36,738 --> 00:22:38,941
did you ever feel
your leads and theories

375
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:41,025
were discounted because of your race?

376
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:45,778
Not particularly, no. Why?

377
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,861
I'm interested in the
intersectionality of marginalized groups

378
00:22:48,863 --> 00:22:52,405
within authoritarian and
systemic racist structures.

379
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:01,194
Well, anyways, those...
Those dolls from the scene,

380
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:03,027
they were a significant lead.

381
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:06,986
Amelia. She's the one
helped us out with that.

382
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:08,780
Got us that lead.

383
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:21,986
Have you seen a doll
that looks like this?

384
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:23,945
- No.
- Not you?

385
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:26,488
Okay, well, you let me
know if you do, okay?

386
00:23:40,405 --> 00:23:41,945
Mike.

387
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:44,947
Have you seen this doll before?

388
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:48,569
H-Halloween.

389
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:51,986
Somebody was passing them
out at trick-or-treat,

390
00:23:51,988 --> 00:23:53,154
I think.

391
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:57,653
Julie... she got one.

392
00:23:57,655 --> 00:24:02,611
This Halloween you went
trick-or-treating with her?

393
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:06,611
We met her and her brother
and... and some other kids.

394
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,697
We live on the next street over.

395
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:14,738
It's okay.

396
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,027
Tom?

397
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:38,069
Tom!

398
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,550
Tom!

399
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,361
Hey, what... what...

400
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:44,236
What ya doin' back up here, brother?

401
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:45,695
'Talkin' about?

402
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:48,154
This is my usual shift. Four years.

403
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,897
What's you're fuckin'
problem? My dick showin'?

404
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:09,027
Hey, Tom.

405
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:12,069
You sure you wanna
be back at work today?

406
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:15,863
I been workin' full-time
since I was fourteen years old.

407
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:21,238
You want me to sit at home
with this shit in my head now?

408
00:25:25,947 --> 00:25:28,820
How long you motherfuckers
gonna stare at me?!

409
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:32,444
Somebody got something to say about me?!

410
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:34,403
My family?!

411
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:36,236
Huh?! Somebody know somethin' I don't...

412
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:39,236
Tom? Hi.

413
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:42,569
We didn't plan on havin'
you back this soon.

414
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:44,820
Well, I gotta earn a livin'.

415
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:48,486
Well, the thing is, we, uh...

416
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:50,444
we put you on leave.

417
00:25:50,446 --> 00:25:52,027
Well, I didn't ask for that, okay?

418
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:55,569
Now, I gotta work. You
tellin' me I can't work?

419
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:58,509
Look, with everything that's happenin',

420
00:25:58,512 --> 00:25:59,947
it's a little disruptive.

421
00:26:01,237 --> 00:26:03,777
People have other things on their mind?

422
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,486
These machines?

423
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:08,446
That's how accidents
happen. You know that, Tom.

424
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:12,822
I'm the guy nobody wants to be, huh?

425
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,863
I'm the fuckin' joke, right?

426
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,653
You shouldn't look at it like that.

427
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:25,863
But you ain't comin' back
to work right now, Tom.

428
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:33,152
Well, fuck everything, anyway!

429
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:35,861
Yeah, fuck each of ya!

430
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:38,154
I quit!

431
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:45,939
You remember which house
was givin' these out?

432
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,863
Who else got one?

433
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,311
Mike...

434
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:58,697
did you see her get the doll?

435
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:01,986
No, ma'am.

436
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:04,486
When did you see she had it?

437
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,486
It was like at the end.

438
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:09,027
We were all showing what we got,

439
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,548
and she had the doll in
her trick-or-treat bag.

440
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,340
Did you stay in the neighborhood,

441
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:15,132
or did you drive somewhere?

442
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,219
We just walked.

443
00:27:19,697 --> 00:27:23,029
Thanks, Mike. You're really helpin'.

444
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:25,436
Hey.

445
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:27,486
What'd you go as for Halloween?

446
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:29,444
Luke Skywalker.

447
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:30,986
Cool, man.

448
00:27:30,988 --> 00:27:33,571
My partner, he loved that movie.

449
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,403
Say...

450
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:56,903
were you with Julie and
her brother the whole night?

451
00:27:56,905 --> 00:28:01,444
Or was there ever a time
y'all went different ways?

452
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:06,236
Yeah. They'd been to a couple
houses before we met up.

453
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:09,569
But I don't think she had the doll then.

454
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:12,194
How 'bout the rest of the night?

455
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:16,069
We mighta split up once or twice.

456
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,986
But... not for long.

457
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,444
I saw her talking to people.

458
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,279
Adults, maybe.

459
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:26,236
They were two ghosts.

460
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,238
Just in big sheets.

461
00:28:30,063 --> 00:28:32,605
You don't know who the ghosts were?

462
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:38,113
Can you show us where it was y'all went?

463
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:41,571
Here.

464
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:25,318
You musta had some good times.

465
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:29,319
- When y'all meet?
- Hmm...

466
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:33,027
thirteen years back.

467
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:35,988
We got married 'cause she was pregnant.

468
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:40,695
How long you knew her before?

469
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,571
Not long.

470
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:47,403
Got married three months after we met.

471
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:50,528
The Fort Smith courthouse.

472
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,666
Me and Lucy, we...

473
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:57,548
We never really knew each other,
we just... well, had the kids.

474
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,736
My kids. Will and...

475
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,863
Are we gonna find Julie, or what?

476
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:28,152
'Cause I can't live through this, man.

477
00:30:28,154 --> 00:30:31,279
Neither of us can.

478
00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:37,363
If we're not gonna find
her, I just need to know now.

479
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:45,937
I can't go to sleep...

480
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,738
...and I can't wake up.

481
00:30:52,738 --> 00:30:55,569
Now, you're sayin' last week, Halloween,

482
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:56,903
girl got one of these dolls,

483
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:59,027
and then you found two of
them at the crime scene?

484
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:01,111
It's an identifier, boss.

485
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:02,903
So what do you want to do?

486
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:06,820
We wondered maybe let's put
it out on the TV or paper.

487
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:09,186
Ask everybody if they seen one of those,

488
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:11,736
or know who makes 'em around here.

489
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:14,986
But that'd tip our hand.
We're not ready for that.

490
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:16,280
What's better...

491
00:31:16,283 --> 00:31:19,111
There's 114 households
in the marked area

492
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:20,820
and the subdivision near it.

493
00:31:20,822 --> 00:31:22,444
We do total surveillance.

494
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:25,152
We have people searchin'
every single house.

495
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:28,277
Oh, come on. You don't have enough
for one warrant, much less a hundred.

496
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:32,027
No warrants. Say, two days, maybe three.

497
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:34,199
Every detective we have.

498
00:31:34,202 --> 00:31:36,366
Pull in more feds, you want.

499
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:39,069
Everybody just knocks and
asks if they can search.

500
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:41,653
Say it'll help with the Purcell case.

501
00:31:41,655 --> 00:31:44,111
People won't like it...

502
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:46,194
but a lot, I bet...

503
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,069
a lot of people let us look around.

504
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:50,069
We keep surveillance.

505
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:52,236
See if somebody starts actin' hinky.

506
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:55,163
Nobody escapes the net.
Our guy panics or somethin',

507
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,416
we do it fast... Without announcement.

508
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,944
Even if you find anything,

509
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:00,820
it could be problematic at trial.

510
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:02,642
This is about the girl, not a trial.

511
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,111
Something happened on
Halloween, that night.

512
00:32:06,113 --> 00:32:07,903
She gets that doll.

513
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:09,778
A week later, she and
her brother are gone,

514
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,695
and you got two of those
things on the scene.

515
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:14,053
Maybe the perp just
brought 'em somewhere.

516
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:16,486
You know? Maybe the dolls
belonged to the girl.

517
00:32:16,488 --> 00:32:20,152
It's all maybes, man. You do
the maybe that gives you a shot.

518
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,119
No, it's thin.

519
00:32:22,122 --> 00:32:26,194
And our constituents here, they
value privacy and property rights.

520
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,361
They aren't just gonna acquiesce

521
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,822
to random searches of their homes.

522
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:33,860
There's other ways to approach it.

523
00:32:33,863 --> 00:32:36,861
If we bring in the public,
it stirs up the town

524
00:32:36,863 --> 00:32:39,027
and lets our guy know
what we're thinkin'.

525
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:42,697
Maybe he takes off. Maybe he just
kills her... if he hasn't already.

526
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:47,444
We can just do it fast.

527
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:49,863
People will get over it.

528
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:53,695
Warren.

529
00:32:53,697 --> 00:32:55,905
Just give us some time, Roland.

530
00:33:21,905 --> 00:33:23,945
Been runnin' this sting.

531
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:26,903
Truck stop next door. Prosts and drugs.

532
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:29,444
I was gonna check this
guy out at some point.

533
00:33:29,446 --> 00:33:32,194
He asked one of the workin' girls

534
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:33,736
if they had any younger friends.

535
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:36,611
And another said he asked her, too.

536
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:40,194
Came in here lookin'
for special magazines.

537
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:42,897
Ted LaGrange. Pulled his file.

538
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,069
He got outta Wrightsville a while back.

539
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:46,748
Carnal knowledge of a minor.

540
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:49,905
Enticing a minor. Buncha shit.

541
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,488
Callin' himself "Robert" somethin' now.

542
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:58,113
Thanks, Rich.

543
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,945
Man...

544
00:34:02,947 --> 00:34:05,613
you gotta come in here every day?

545
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,446
Welcome to Vice.

546
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:22,986
♪ I love my man ♪

547
00:34:22,988 --> 00:34:26,446

00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:38,528
I haven't seen you here before, have I?

551
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,611
I'm usually at the VFW.

552
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:44,528
♪ I'm a liar if I say I won't... ♪

553
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,820
Want to thank you for everything
you did today with the kid.

554
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:52,736
He wasn't talkin' to us
'til you opened him up.

555
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:55,277
Real grateful for that.

556
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:58,653
He was broken up about it.

557
00:34:58,655 --> 00:35:01,488
I think he had a crush on Julie.

558
00:35:02,863 --> 00:35:05,653
Why'd you give me that picture?

559
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:07,986
The doll.

560
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:10,653
Instinct, I guess.

561
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:13,196
I knew the kids weren't talkin' to us.

562
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,196
You were in the war?

563
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,695
You're a cop,

564
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:24,444
so you want to know more about a
person, you just look 'em up, huh?

565
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:26,363
Pretty much.

566
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:29,530
Did you look me up?

567
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,822
Thought about it, though.

568
00:35:42,154 --> 00:35:44,569
I was born here.

569
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:47,111
I went to U of A.

570
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:50,319
Dropped out my junior year.

571
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:52,778
Went west with a friend.

572
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,736
We got in with some people.

573
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:57,238
I was in this scene, San Francisco.

574
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:03,905
Anti-war, kind of fringe Panther stuff.

575
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,403
Some things happened, not good.

576
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:11,653
And then I was alone.

577
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:16,071
'74, I came back home, got my degree.

578
00:36:21,196 --> 00:36:23,196
I grew up in Conway.

579
00:36:24,238 --> 00:36:26,071
My mom worked on a farm.

580
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:30,236
I spent two years in the jungle,

581
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:32,238
a lot of it I was alone.

582
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:37,363
I hunt a lot now. Alone.

583
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,386
I'm a vegetarian.

584
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,611
That's a real shame.

585
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:46,738
If you're a Democrat, don't tell me.

586
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:52,488
You like teachin'?

587
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,780
Sometimes.

588
00:36:56,947 --> 00:37:00,111
I want to be a writer.

589
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:01,780
Write books.

590
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:05,736
I don't read enough.

591
00:37:05,738 --> 00:37:08,446
I like Batman and Silver Surfer.

592
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:14,361
I had this sorta
dyslexic thing growin' up.

593
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:16,569
Was that hard?

594
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:18,861
They said I was dumb.

595
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,863
My mom wasn't havin' any of that.

596
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:28,319
That poem you were
teachin'. I looked it up.

597
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:31,403
- Oh, yeah?
- I read it.

598
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:34,613
I'm not ready to talk about
it yet, but I have thoughts.

599
00:37:35,947 --> 00:37:38,822
- Share when you want.
- All right.

600
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:43,319
You ever been married?

601
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:44,697
No.

602
00:37:46,405 --> 00:37:47,486
You?

603
00:37:47,488 --> 00:37:50,321
I was engaged. Seven months.

604
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:53,236
I broke it off.

605
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,611
I didn't want to be married, I realized.

606
00:37:55,613 --> 00:37:59,613
- I don't wanna get married.
- No?

607
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,528
Guy the other day said I must be crazy.

608
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:11,653
Thing is, and I've thought
of this for a while...

609
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:14,528
I think I might be.

610
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,363
Like how?

611
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,027
I wear clip-on ties
'cause I'm preoccupied

612
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:26,528
with this idea of getting
strangled with one.

613
00:38:29,613 --> 00:38:31,530
Is that too much?

614
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:37,194
This year, twice,

615
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:39,194
I've been to St. Louis

616
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:41,528
and I've stayed at this hotel,

617
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,194
and I've pretended I'm someone else.

618
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:48,820
I go out, meet new people,
and I am someone else.

619
00:38:48,822 --> 00:38:53,403
Different name, different
background, different job.

620
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:54,900
Twice.

621
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:59,447
Hmm.

622
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:06,403
You drink too much?

623
00:39:06,405 --> 00:39:08,903
I don't know.

624
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:11,446
I might get drunk twice a month.

625
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:15,611
Three times.

626
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:18,736
I like to laugh, is the thing.

627
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,986
Hey. Raise it up?

628
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:28,027
Hurry. Quick.

629
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:31,027
...information in the
Purcell murder-kidnapping,

630
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:32,820
we go to the Washington
County courthouse

631
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:35,277
- earlier this afternoon.
- Don't do it.

632
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:37,149
We believe the missing girl,

633
00:39:37,152 --> 00:39:40,111
Julie Purcell, was
contacted by her abductor

634
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:42,839
while she participated
in Halloween last week.

635
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:45,299
We're sharing a graphic

636
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,613
of the area where she and her
brother went trick-or-treating.

637
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:50,495
Now, our investigation suggests

638
00:39:50,498 --> 00:39:52,444
that someone who saw her on Halloween

639
00:39:52,446 --> 00:39:54,485
has special knowledge of this case.

640
00:39:54,488 --> 00:39:57,736
- Givin' it away.
- Anyone who saw anything suspicious...

641
00:39:57,738 --> 00:40:00,902
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry, I...

642
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:03,542
I gotta go. Goddamnit.

643
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:06,194
Are you saying the children
knew their kidnapper?

644
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:10,019
I'm not at liberty to
reveal that at this time.

645
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:16,361
I knew they wouldn't listen to me.

646
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:18,986
But you shoulda stopped that.

647
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:22,695
Me? What am I supposed to do?

648
00:40:22,697 --> 00:40:24,319
You were there.

649
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,695
I'm sayin', I talk,
it don't mean anything.

650
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:30,069
Don't matter if I'm right.

651
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:33,069
You, at least, you talk,
it means somethin' to 'em.

652
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:34,653
Might consider what you're saying.

653
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:36,111
You mighta stopped 'em from doing that.

654
00:40:36,113 --> 00:40:39,303
Bullshit. Who knew
until it was on the TV?

655
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,820
Why didn't you stop 'em?

656
00:40:40,822 --> 00:40:44,277
They ain't my tribe, man.
Take care of your shit.

657
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:47,027
Tribe? Where you think you are, asshole?

658
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,814
- I know where I am.
- Do ya?

659
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:50,470
It don't sound like it.

660
00:40:50,473 --> 00:40:53,695
Son, I know where I am in a
way you will never understand.

661
00:40:53,697 --> 00:40:55,444
Are you high, Purple Hays?

662
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:57,695
'Cause you're makin'
about as much goddamn sense

663
00:40:57,697 --> 00:40:59,277
as my grandmother's dementia.

664
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:00,820
No, I'm sayin' I know where I am.

665
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,655
Hey, good for you.

666
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,863
Was all I could think of.

667
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:37,113
You got somethin' else?

668
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:42,945
Vice gave me a dude near
Fort Smith to look at.

669
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:44,738
I pulled his file.

670
00:41:46,425 --> 00:41:47,759
What is it?

671
00:41:53,196 --> 00:41:55,571
You can read for yourself.

672
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:09,571
You wanna go get him?

673
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,446
I wanna go get him.

674
00:42:15,863 --> 00:42:19,152
We might as well keep watch out here.

675
00:42:19,154 --> 00:42:21,853
Check the guy out in the mornin'.

676
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:23,690
Toss his place first.

677
00:42:31,988 --> 00:42:33,822
We should get bennies.

678
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,321
Stayin' up all night.

679
00:42:40,154 --> 00:42:43,113
Glove box. Red-and-blue ones.

680
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:48,903
Prosecutin' attorney decided...

681
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:52,194
best thing was to take our single clue

682
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:54,489
and spread it all over the town.

683
00:42:56,363 --> 00:42:59,861
And that got us a few hundred
false tips the first couple of days.

684
00:42:59,863 --> 00:43:03,111
That's when it all
started with the town.

685
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,488
Just panic.

686
00:43:10,113 --> 00:43:14,196
Lived in their
imaginations now, you see?

687
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:35,152
Everybody was scared.

688
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:37,253
That included us.

689
00:43:55,238 --> 00:43:56,488
Hi.

690
00:43:57,857 --> 00:43:59,773

Uh, wha... what's the...

We'll tell ya on the way.

No, it's not me, I swear to God!

701
00:44:32,571 --> 00:44:34,277
You're wrong about this.

702
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:36,403
You shouldn't have brought me here.

703
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:38,736
This get you off, mister, huh?

704
00:44:38,738 --> 00:44:41,613
You entertain fantasies of
strappin' white men to posts?

705
00:44:43,154 --> 00:44:45,571
- Now and then, yeah.
- Really?

706
00:44:46,696 --> 00:44:48,819
Uhh!

707
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:50,820
Talk about your fantasies.

708
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:52,564
Then he'll tell ya his.

709
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:55,360
Theodore LaGrange.

710
00:44:55,363 --> 00:44:57,611
It's Ted, yeah?

711
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:59,822
Ted, you been out a bit over two years.

712
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:03,094
I know what you're doing,
and I haven't done anything.

713
00:45:03,097 --> 00:45:04,803
Released from Wrightsville.

714
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:07,444
You got Little Rock up the road.

715
00:45:07,446 --> 00:45:09,947
Why'd you come way out here, Ted?

716
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:14,444
And why you callin'
yourself Robert Hebert?

717
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:17,236
I-I wanted a new start.

718
00:45:17,238 --> 00:45:19,947
They keep you in protective
custody in Wrightsville?

719
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:23,355
Hmm. Figured.

720
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,861
Guys who mess with kids,

721
00:45:26,863 --> 00:45:29,611
they don't usually make it
out with all their parts.

722
00:45:29,613 --> 00:45:31,695
Tell me how you mess with kids.

723
00:45:31,697 --> 00:45:33,653
The boy and the girl.

724
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:36,486
Your landlady said you didn't
come home last Friday night.

725
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:37,962
- What?
- The 7th.

726
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:41,126
That's not... I was
out. I-I was just out.

727
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:43,960
Help me understand what it
was like for you in the moment.

728
00:45:43,963 --> 00:45:46,611
Let me feel your side of it. Okay?

729
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:49,027
Tell me why you killed the boy.

730
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:52,528
I didn't! I never seen him
before he was on the news.

731
00:45:56,905 --> 00:45:59,655
You'll wanna explain to me
where you were that night.

732
00:46:01,697 --> 00:46:05,653
Help me see your side of things.

733
00:46:05,655 --> 00:46:08,361
What'd you do on Halloween
night? Where were you?

734
00:46:12,071 --> 00:46:14,403
Well...

735
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:17,820
we're here to listen
when you want to share.

736
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:21,611
Aaaaah!

737
00:46:43,486 --> 00:46:44,695
Yes.

738
00:46:44,697 --> 00:46:46,569
He's here Mondays and Fridays.

739
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:49,111
We do storytime twice
a week in the evenin's,

740
00:46:49,113 --> 00:46:50,695
and he plays guitar for it.

741
00:46:50,697 --> 00:46:54,361
But his name's Robert
Hebert, not what you said.

742
00:46:54,363 --> 00:46:56,528
And he worked on the 7th? Last Friday?

743
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,778
Yes. Mm-hmm.

744
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,653
You know what time he left that night?

745
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,695
Probably about 8:00 or after.

746
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:05,277
He helped us put up
the tables and chairs.

747
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:06,861
Did he do something?

748
00:47:06,863 --> 00:47:10,071
You're not gonna see this guy anymore.

749
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,537
If you do, give us a call, okay?

750
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:21,486
Robbery was a couple of months ago.

751
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:24,569
All I know for sure is
that her prints showed up.

752
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:26,444
It's like you said...

753
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:28,695
They don't know if she was a customer

754
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:30,653
or part of the break-in.

755
00:47:30,655 --> 00:47:32,986
Was it a partial or a full?

756
00:47:32,988 --> 00:47:34,238
Full.

757
00:47:35,405 --> 00:47:36,780
It was her.

758
00:47:38,947 --> 00:47:40,595
They had video surveillance?

759
00:47:40,598 --> 00:47:42,861
They smashed the camera in the pharmacy.

760
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:45,236
Store's got footage goin'
back three days prior.

761
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:47,986
We subpoenaed it, but we have to wait.

762
00:47:47,988 --> 00:47:50,611
Somebody watchin' the store
in case she comes back?

763
00:47:50,613 --> 00:47:54,277
My understandin', Sallisaw
PD's focused on the robbery.

764
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:56,289
And I wouldn't say the locals are a

765
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,360
crackerjack investigative
team or anything.

766
00:47:59,363 --> 00:48:01,027
So nothin'.

767
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:03,069
Man's family didn't have the resources

768
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,446
for an investigator...

769
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,321
but obviously, we'd like to find her.

770
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,736
What about Arkansas PD?
They lookin' for her?

771
00:48:17,738 --> 00:48:19,603
There's nobody on the case yet.

772
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:21,548
Kindt's office will have to look at it

773
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:23,902
since they'll be defending
our motion to overturn,

774
00:48:23,905 --> 00:48:26,403
but right now, no.

775
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:28,611
I don't think so.

776
00:48:28,613 --> 00:48:31,655
You all right goin' up
against your old boss?

777
00:48:33,196 --> 00:48:35,154
It's overdue.

778
00:48:47,738 --> 00:48:49,152
Talk to Roland?

779
00:48:49,154 --> 00:48:51,363
We have an appointment.

780
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:54,613
He's done well.

781
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:57,655
He has.

782
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:19,985
You wanna execute him?

783
00:49:19,988 --> 00:49:22,695
We can bury him right out
here, I don't give a shit.

784
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:26,486
Throw him off a
bridge... Nobody'll care.

785
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:29,986
Put him in holding,
get his parole violated.

786
00:49:29,988 --> 00:49:31,903
He'll be back in Wrightsville tomorrow.

787
00:49:31,905 --> 00:49:35,736
- Full sentence.
- If you say so.

788
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:37,611
Talk shit about us...

789
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:40,611
I'll have monstrous niggers
fuck him to death in his cell.

790
00:49:41,865 --> 00:49:45,144
D'you hear me, boy? You
will bleed black cock.

791
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:53,738
Gotta catch up, man. Just
spent the day on this bullshit.

792
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:03,269
That was a vivid description
of prison rape. Jesus.

793
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:05,403
Could tell he had the racial thing.

794
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:07,444
Remember what he said in the barn?

795
00:50:07,446 --> 00:50:10,238
Still... it's gonna haunt me.

796
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:17,446
D-12, do you copy?

797
00:50:21,238 --> 00:50:23,027
Copy, dispatch.

798
00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:26,029
Lieutenant Twiggs wants
y'all at the Purcell place.

799
00:50:27,988 --> 00:50:29,403
What's up?

800
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:31,947
Someone said the family got a note.

801
00:50:35,863 --> 00:50:38,113
Copy. On the way.

802
00:50:54,905 --> 00:50:56,988
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

803
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,733
_

804
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:22,152
Hey. Hey!

805
00:51:22,154 --> 00:51:24,611
Did you see? They sent me the galleys.

806
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:25,988
That's great.

807
00:51:27,488 --> 00:51:29,822
You got a little loose after work?

808
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:33,123
How was the deposition?

809
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:34,418
It was fine.

810
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:45,830
It's as much about us as anything.

811
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,027
And I think her and me, it was as close

812
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,863
as she could give the
thing a happy ending.

813
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,361
After the events of 1990,

814
00:51:58,363 --> 00:52:01,736
and what happened with
Julie and her father,

815
00:52:01,738 --> 00:52:04,069
you left the PD.

816
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:06,861
Did you believe that concluded the case?

817
00:52:06,863 --> 00:52:10,820
Did you feel the investigation
ended too abruptly?

818
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:14,037
She wrote six novels
after. This was her first.

819
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:19,194
Uh, very... to a cop,

820
00:52:19,196 --> 00:52:21,945
very impressive eye for detail.

821
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:23,611
Have you read it?

822
00:52:23,613 --> 00:52:26,717
Mr. Hays, did you have
theories after what happened

823
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,162
with Julie Purcell
and her father in '90?

824
00:52:29,165 --> 00:52:30,803
Theories that weren't in line

825
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:32,387
with your superior's directives?

826
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,485
I heard what you asked.

827
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,695
The answer is...

828
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:41,279
I never stopped coming up
with theories about that case.

829
00:52:42,405 --> 00:52:44,695
And I hit Todd and Dave into home,

830
00:52:44,697 --> 00:52:46,655
and when I went over, we won.

831
00:52:46,658 --> 00:52:49,151
Coach saw, and came and
talked to me about baseball

832
00:52:49,154 --> 00:52:50,947
when I get older.

833
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:57,542
- That's fantastic, Henry.
- Mm-hmm.

834
00:52:57,545 --> 00:52:59,240
You're gonna be very athletic.

835
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,407
You already are.

836
00:53:13,988 --> 00:53:16,903
The publisher said we can issue
an update for the paperback

837
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:19,528
once this appeal goes to trial.

838
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,905
Yeah?

839
00:53:25,154 --> 00:53:28,152
You're a bit out of it tonight.

840
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:29,611
The kids noticed.

841
00:53:29,613 --> 00:53:32,238
You can't be that way in front of them.

842
00:53:33,613 --> 00:53:35,905
- I'm not drunk.
- What's going on?

843
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:39,979
What happened with the deposition?

844
00:53:41,446 --> 00:53:43,905
They overturning the conviction?

845
00:53:47,113 --> 00:53:49,446
Julie Purcell is alive.

846
00:54:02,154 --> 00:54:05,319
Thought for sure you'd all beat us here.

847
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:07,486
What is that, huh?

848
00:54:07,488 --> 00:54:08,986
What's that mean?

849
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:21,545
_

850
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:26,413
Well, what's it mean?

851
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:28,165
Hmm?

852
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:43,029
You want more chicken, Wayne?

853
00:54:48,655 --> 00:54:50,861
Thanks for the spread, Heather.

854
00:54:50,863 --> 00:54:52,778
This is wonderful.

855
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,736
Are you feelin' all right?

856
00:54:54,738 --> 00:54:56,277
Uh...

857
00:54:56,279 --> 00:54:58,365
He's been goin' back through that case.

858
00:54:58,368 --> 00:54:59,618
Mom's book.

859
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:03,695
I never read the whole thing.

860
00:55:03,697 --> 00:55:06,530
Couldn't stand I was in it so much.

861
00:55:08,613 --> 00:55:10,861
Goin' back over the story, it's good...

862
00:55:10,863 --> 00:55:13,361
Makin' me work my brain, I mean.

863
00:55:13,363 --> 00:55:15,405
Leadin' me to other stuff.

864
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:22,903
Maybe you guys could see
about gettin' Rebecca out here.

865
00:55:22,905 --> 00:55:25,071
I'd like to see her.

866
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:29,736
She's in L.A., Dad.

867
00:55:29,738 --> 00:55:31,903
When did that happen?

868
00:55:31,906 --> 00:55:34,045
What's she doin' out there?

869
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,082
She's playin' music, Wayne.

870
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:42,569
She okay? You talk to her?

871
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:45,071
I talked to her a few weeks ago.

872
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:49,444
Think she'd come back home for a visit?

873
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,444
She don't like it here, Dad.

874
00:55:52,446 --> 00:55:54,053
Why not?

875
00:55:55,822 --> 00:55:57,820
I just don't think it suits her.

876
00:55:57,822 --> 00:56:00,778
- She never liked it.
- She didn't?

877
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,778
Hey!

878
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,152
One more time, okay?

879
00:56:07,905 --> 00:56:10,027
Shh. Eat.

880
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:13,655
It's goin' by pretty quick.

881
00:56:15,446 --> 00:56:17,446
Don't I know it.

882
00:56:20,947 --> 00:56:24,403
Maybe you guys could see
about gettin' Rebecca out here.

883
00:56:24,405 --> 00:56:26,446
I'd like to see her.
