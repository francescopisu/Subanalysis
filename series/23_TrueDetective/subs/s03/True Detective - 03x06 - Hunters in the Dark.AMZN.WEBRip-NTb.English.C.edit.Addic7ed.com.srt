1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,147
Back up!

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:05,692
What happened out there?

3
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:09,064
Do you know if somethin' happened?

4
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:10,565
Does she look familiar?

5
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:13,398
- This is my baby girl?
- What do you think?

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,064
Were you aware that one of the officers

7
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,161
who processed the
Woodard scene went missing

8
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:19,023
during the second investigation?

9
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:20,872
There's no fucking way that backpack

10
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,148
was in that crawlspace
when that mortar went off.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,926
Tells some story of how she's a princess

12
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:27,523
from the pink rooms. Said
she, uh, lost a brother.

13
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:29,016
They're looking for me.

14
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:33,476
Tell him to leave me alone.
The man acting like my father!

15
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,106
Children should laugh.

16
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:37,007
There wasn't a lot of
laughter around here.

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,523
I know Lucy wrote it

18
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:40,189
when that director
showed me some pictures.

19
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:42,831
Dan O'Brien's body was
found in a drained quarry.

20
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,609
How you gonna talk to these people?

21
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:48,000
We done what we done.

22
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:50,823
I remember what we done,
I remember not to say.

23
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:52,160
You walked away.

24
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:54,946
Not this time.

25
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:24,132

26
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,457
Helluva day when a gunfight's
the second most excitin' thing

27
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,868
that happens to you.

28
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:47,981
I was trying to hold out.

29
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,066
Make you wait a bit.

30
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:54,900
You seem like the type
that kinda thing matters.

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,732
You don't have to do that.

32
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,732
What?

33
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:04,690
Check and see if I'm judgin' you.

34
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,233
I'm not.

35
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,734
I was so glad you weren't hurt.

36
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,150
Came close.

37
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:33,108
First time I fired my weapon on the job.

38
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,941
You fired your weapon
before, in the war?

39
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,607
I wanna hear about your stuff.

40
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:50,108
How you got here, your past.

41
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:54,064
Honestly...

42
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,983
I never give it thought.

43
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,859
One thing I learned, the war?

44
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:06,275
Life happens now.

45
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,817
Then later's now, y'know?

46
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:13,150
It's never behind you.

47
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,732
And I'm not avoidin'
the question, just...

48
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:21,483
really don't spend
time rememberin' stuff.

49
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:27,939
That's like a superpower to me.

50
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:31,773
I can't even understand
that. How do you do it?

51
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:33,650
Hmm. Just lucky, I guess.

52
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:01,732
Tell him to leave me alone.

53
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:05,148
- I-I know what he did.
- Who?

54
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,939
The man on TV acting like my father!

55
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,023
Can you tell me where
you're calling from?

56
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:14,440
Where's my brother? Will?

57
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:15,898
I don't know what he did with him.

58
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,981
That certainly sounds
like an indictment.

59
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:24,565
And according to the file, he
didn't have an alibi the night of.

60
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:27,773
You two never kicked
that very hard, did you?

61
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:29,148
You ignored that?

62
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:33,106
We need to go at him, hard.

63
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:35,939
Freddy Burns saw the boy
alone out in them woods

64
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:38,273
when we still had Tom
workin' on his car.

65
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,398
Me and Ted can take a shot,

66
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,148
y'all want to observe.

67
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,106
No.

68
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:45,400
We'll do it.

69
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,981
I don't know what that call was,

70
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,106
but no way we could be that wrong.

71
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:04,611
Wanna give it to Morelli?

72
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,440
No.

73
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:08,898
Them others'll eat him alive.

74
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:24,230
What's it mean?

75
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,111
- That was her, wasn't it?
- Sit down, Tom.

76
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:28,611
I don't wanna sit down right now.

77
00:06:28,614 --> 00:06:30,322
It's not a request.

78
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:36,749
What're you lookin' like that for?

79
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,580
Something you want to
tell us, Mr. Purcell?

80
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,814
What?

81
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,815
However long it's
been, this is the time.

82
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,981
While you're talkin'
to a couple of friends.

83
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:47,939
'Cause they bring in the other guys,

84
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,732
it's gonna get bad.

85
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,315
Tell us your side.

86
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:54,317
We can help. Make a case for ya.

87
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:57,108
My side?

88
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,525
Everybody knows my side.

89
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:04,317
You...

90
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,817
You think... me?

91
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:17,148
Back in '80, the night of the incident.

92
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,442
Couple of neighbors saw you workin'
in the garage, early evenin'.

93
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,064
Don't have anybody saw you after 6:30.

94
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,525
Saw me?

95
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,025
Roland...

96
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,189
Lieutenant West.

97
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,356
You go somewhere back then?

98
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,523
You leave the house
and forgot to tell us?

99
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,189
N-No.

100
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:47,999
No. I went back inside,
I had a couple beers,

101
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:52,023
and listened to the Cardinals
game, same as I told you.

102
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:53,699
Julie's room.

103
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:57,814
There's a little hole in her wall

104
00:07:57,817 --> 00:08:00,983
came out back of Will's closet.

105
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,018
- A what?
- Like a peephole.

106
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,773
For spyin'.

107
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:10,398
Ever look in on her? Julie?

108
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,900
Maybe while she was gettin' dressed?

109
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:17,064
Some question, wasn't there,

110
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,994
whether she was yours?

111
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,203
Lucy passed it around
a lot, what we hear.

112
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:23,248
Listen, she... she...

113
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,314
I held...

114
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:29,231
I fed her, got up in the night.

115
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:32,814
She's mine. That child is mine.

116
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,150
How could you, after
everything you know,

117
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:37,485
you think I could do
something like that?!

118
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,064
Do... you?!

119
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,968
- Did you give her to somebody, Tom?
- What?

120
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:45,522
- Was she tryin' to get away from you?
- What?

121
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,523
Somebody helpin' her out
of a situation with you?

122
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,510
- What?! Why?!
- Did Will know, did he catch you?

123
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:51,589
Why! Why! Goddamn, why would I?!

124
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,999
You know they weren't playin'
with that neighbor kid.

125
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:57,440
Who were they meetin' at Devil's Den?

126
00:08:57,442 --> 00:09:01,108
I don't know. I don't know
anything you're talkin' 'bout!

127
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:08,815
No, no, no, no...

128
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:11,440
Tell us about it.

129
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,106
We wanna help you.

130
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:15,273
But we can't if you don't talk to us.

131
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,275
I don't know.

132
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,273
Usually I do.

133
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,273
But I don't know.

134
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,981
I can't believe we missed this.

135
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:33,981
I mean, could he have
colluded with Woodard?

136
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:37,693
Come to that, could he have planted
the items in Woodard's house?

137
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:43,523
There's no evidence
right now for an arrest.

138
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,167
Hold him for the 24.

139
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,523
Start diggin' for anything
that points in his direction.

140
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:50,189
I'm gonna give you a
warrant for his place.

141
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:53,481
We need to check out where
that call came from, too.

142
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:56,857
Get busy. We missed it once...

143
00:09:56,874 --> 00:09:58,707
we're not losin' him now.

144
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:05,817
The phone call was viewed
as a major turn, correct?

145
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:12,327
Law enforcement seemed to
consider it as an indictment,

146
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,483
particularly in light
of... what happened.

147
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:22,734
What happened?

148
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:25,317
Huh?

149
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:29,815
After questioning, Tom
Purcell was held in jail.

150
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:33,231
What did investigators
do after that phone call?

151
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,356
That was her, wasn't it? Julie?

152
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:38,898
Mm-hmm.

153
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,815
Call came from a truck
stop outside Russellville.

154
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:45,106
We pulled a partial off of a pay phone.

155
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:46,525
Hers.

156
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,897
You didn't want to tell the
bosses about the backpack?

157
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,231
You were pretty
convinced it was planted.

158
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,692
It was planted.

159
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,066
I didn't wanna give 'em
that to use on him yet.

160
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:17,019
Hey.

161
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,231
Hey.

162
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,650
Had to change. Gotta go back out.

163
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:21,778
Okay.

164
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,567
Missin' my old clip-ons.

165
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:29,567
Shit.

166
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,941
You're not in elementary school anymore.

167
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,648
Where you goin'?

168
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,817
I have things to do.

169
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:46,815
New book.

170
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,932
What new book?

171
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,690
Sequel.

172
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:53,773
It's about the current investigation.

173
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:57,773
I thought you wanted
to work on a novel next.

174
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,106
The publisher wants this bad.

175
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,857
They think it's too good an opportunity.

176
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:06,773
I get troubled callin' what
happened an "opportunity."

177
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,908
That's their word.

178
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:12,507
We can't expect the world to conform

179
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,713
to Wayne Hays's moral semantics.

180
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:17,814
Right.

181
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,815
Well, it's an opportunity
for you, isn't it?

182
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:23,231
Back to Major Crimes.

183
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,648
Keeping your own hours.

184
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,483
We get clear on this, I'll be home more.

185
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:32,293
Will you?

186
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:34,564
Seems like this suits you better.

187
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,317
Running free.

188
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:40,231
Just tryin' to do my job right.

189
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,481
So that's my imagination...

190
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:46,231
seeing you like you
can't breathe in here?

191
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,315
Yeah, it's your imagination.

192
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,939
Telling yourself stories
about me, my motives.

193
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:53,565
I could tell stories...
Why you're all of a sudden

194
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,815
workin' on a book you already wrote.

195
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,191
What you lookin' for out
there, you're not findin' here.

196
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:09,291
We dug into Tom...

197
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:11,231
the father, yeah.

198
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:14,189
His place. Talked to his bosses.

199
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:18,356
I remember talkin' to y'all back then.

200
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:21,900
Yeah, he quit before the
school bus factory closed.

201
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,481
Tell you the truth...

202
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:28,315
he was on his way out

203
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,564
even before what happened.

204
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,188
Why's that?

205
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:35,523
Caught him drinkin' on
the job. More than once.

206
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:38,398
Machines are dangerous around that shit.

207
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,148
Always askin' for a loan. And, y'know...

208
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,064
didn't quite get along
with the rest of the guys.

209
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,898
How do you mean?

210
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,939
I didn't want to say
anything back then, but...

211
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:53,900
a few of the boys had around
saw him goin' into a queer club.

212
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:57,726
They got on him a lot, after.

213
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:18,705
_

214
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:28,513
So he's not the saint-of-all-sufferin'.

215
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,358
Everybody's got weaknesses.

216
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:36,213
Don't mean he did that to his kids.

217
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:38,965
Lookin' less and less to
me like they were his kids.

218
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,481
Devil's Den was a homo cruisin' spot.

219
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:46,064
The kids weren't
supposed to be out there.

220
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,857
- If Tom was...
- Fuck off.

221
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:51,859
We know they were meetin'
somebody else out there.

222
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:54,447
Tom wouldn't do that.

223
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,063
- This.
- Hey.

224
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,400
If he wouldn't, then we'll clear him.

225
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,580
But we gotta get this right.

226
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,289
You saw at the station.

227
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:06,459
Kindt and Blevins are hot for it.

228
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:10,156
If it's not him...

229
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,989
we clear him.

230
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:14,407
But we don't stop.

231
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,700
Take it all the way this time.

232
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,659
I remember 1980.

233
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:00,490
You're supposed to be at home.

234
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:01,741
Detective Hays.

235
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:05,531
Your shooting cleared. No surprise.

236
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:07,906
What's the latest on Roland?

237
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:10,031
Gets to keep the leg.

238
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:14,156
Won't be the same, but it's a lot
better than Diller and Bowen got.

239
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,781
They found the boy's
backpack. Girl's shirt.

240
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:19,739
Both at Woodard's place.

241
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:22,156
Yeah, it was him.

242
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,749
What?

243
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,698
No, somethin's wrong here.

244
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,573
If it was him, that ain't all of it.

245
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:34,444
Other people involved.
Kids were meetin' somebody.

246
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:37,047
- Jesus Christ, you were there.
- Wayne.

247
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,881
You see what's happenin' out here?

248
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:41,893
Press is makin' the
county a Hee-Haw sideshow.

249
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,381
May have gotten some help with that.

250
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:45,839
Okay, Detective, stick to the evidence.

251
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:48,131
And it only goes one way.

252
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,381
Even makes sense for the kidnap note.

253
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:52,673
Cut-out words, misspelling.

254
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:54,048
It was Woodard.

255
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,881
Then where's the girl?

256
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:59,089
He had a couple of oil drums
he made into an incinerator.

257
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:01,131
Evidence suggests he burned the body.

258
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:03,968
- Are we sure?
- She's dead.

259
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:07,765
Let's not draw out the
family's pain any longer.

260
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:10,715
Our official position is,
Woodard murdered both children.

261
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:13,131
That's it. Take some time.

262
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,715
- Probably a medal in this.
- Warren.

263
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:18,839
I don't wanna take time. I don't give
a shit about medals. I'm telling you...

264
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:23,256
Enough. He killed 10 people,
Wayne. You were there.

265
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:25,390
It's done.

266
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:29,561
This community needs to heal,
Detective. We're the first step.

267
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:34,147
And state law allows conviction in
absentia under special circumstances.

268
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,405
Our offices are gonna need all evidence,

269
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,717
investigative records... Everything.

270
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:42,923
Twelve people.

271
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:45,590
What?

272
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:50,131
You puttin' the kids on him,
that means he killed 12 people...

273
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:52,091
not 10.

274
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,258
Just so you keep your stories straight.

275
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:01,507
The cousin, Dan O'Brien.

276
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:05,881
His remains were found in a
drained quarry in southern Missouri.

277
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,425
Do you think this could connect to Tom?

278
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:11,374
I don't know.

279
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:13,215
Couldn't say.

280
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:16,131
Well, what happened with Tom,

281
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,131
Lucy, now her cousin Dan...

282
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,465
We also had to talk to all the cops

283
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:23,839
worked the Woodard scene back in '80.

284
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:27,964
I believe that's what we
did next, or around then.

285
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,726
Because the thought was that Tom
may have planted the evidence there?

286
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:35,798
Well, we had to look at the possibility.

287
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,089
Or...

288
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:41,133
maybe they worked
together, him and Woodard.

289
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,131
You know...

290
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:48,509
it's terrible what this
work makes you ponder.

291
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:52,133
Don't you think?

292
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:56,749
Mighta seen him. Hard to say.

293
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:59,077
Had a lot of looky-loos
around the place.

294
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,024
And you're the one found the backpack?

295
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,340
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I found it.

296
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:07,006
Then Harris said looked like that boy's.

297
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:09,006
- That's Harris James?
- Yep.

298
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,964
Says he left the force.

299
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:12,548
Oh yeah, long time ago.

300
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,966
You know what he's doin' now?

301
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,048
"Chief Security Officer."

302
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,838
How do I get somethin' like that?

303
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:37,089
Well, I moonlighted
security at the plant

304
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:39,541
for about five years
when I was a patrolman.

305
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:41,042
When the spot opened up here,

306
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,880
I was in the right place.

307
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:45,881
I don't know why a lieutenant'd
want to switch careers.

308
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:50,465
That matter, I don't know I ever
heard a lieutenant working the field.

309
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:53,048
It's a special situation.

310
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,089
If I get your salary, I'll
switch to any career they say.

311
00:20:57,091 --> 00:21:00,298
What, you look at my paycheck?

312
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,006
Pretty depressing from my end.

313
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:08,757
You took the job May '81?

314
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,423
That's right.

315
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:13,377
We're backtrackin'. The Purcell case.

316
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:17,715
Got it down you were
the one spotted the bag.

317
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:19,486
No, I didn't find it.

318
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:23,465
I was the first to think I
recognized it... off the APB.

319
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:27,590
Well, we've been wonderin' why it
took two days to find that backpack.

320
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,881
Took God six days to make the world.

321
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:32,590
I can believe it took a bunch of GEDs

322
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,590
two days to find a backpack.

323
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,091
Hmm.

324
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,757
The kids' father.

325
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,423
You ever see him out there

326
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:45,673
when you were processin' the scene?

327
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:47,757
Yeah, as a matter of fact I saw him

328
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,881
in the field across
the street. Watchin'.

329
00:21:50,883 --> 00:21:53,590
What was he doin'?

330
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:55,260
Just starin'.

331
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:58,423
Stood there lookin' at the
house, or what was left of it.

332
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:00,798
Long time.

333
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,048
You know, the kids' mother
used to work up here.

334
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,089
Back in '79.

335
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,467
Well, unless she worked 10 to 6
in the morning, I never saw her.

336
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:12,298
That was y'all, right?

337
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,173
The shootout?

338
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:17,215
That's my fuckin' limp.

339
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:20,507
Why'd you leave Highway Patrol?

340
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:24,173
Why'd I give up hemorrhoids
and 15K a year? I don't know.

341
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,634
That question keeps me up nights.

342
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:38,658
What's the job involve?

343
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:41,236
Money like that.

344
00:22:41,252 --> 00:22:43,340
Hog thieves?

345
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:46,721
People tryin' to steal
the secret chicken recipe?

346
00:22:50,342 --> 00:22:52,673
"Securing without compromise

347
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,173
the integrity of corporate assets

348
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:58,757
while guarding against
hazards to daily operations."

349
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,186
But I'll admit, now and then I miss

350
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:04,923
whilin' away my days cruisin'
around, eatin' donuts.

351
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,173
I don't eat donuts.

352
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:09,715
I can tell.

353
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:12,050
You got a good body, Detective.

354
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,298
Appreciate your time.

355
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,509
We'll get outta your hair.

356
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:28,632
I thought it took God seven
days to make the world.

357
00:23:28,634 --> 00:23:31,381
He rested on the seventh.

358
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:33,964
I always thought he shoulda
put the extra day in,

359
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:35,759
instead of half-assin' it.

360
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,757
Harris James?

361
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,465
He was one of the officers who
processed the Woodard scene.

362
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:46,048
He disappeared... During
the 1990 investigation.

363
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,048
Huh.

364
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,048
You know what happened to him?

365
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,964
No. But the mother, the father.

366
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,340
The cousin's body being found now.

367
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:58,590
All the dead at Woodard's.

368
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:00,548
This former cop worked the scene.

369
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,381
I wonder if one day

370
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,425
they'll drain a quarry with him in it.

371
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,258
I wouldn't know, Miss.

372
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:13,798
But what you just did
is called speculation.

373
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,798
That leads to projection, we call it.

374
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,632
Twists what you see, obfuscates truth.

375
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:20,715
Have you sat back at any point

376
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:22,619
over the last two
decades and thought about

377
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:26,164
the sheer number of fatalities
surrounding this case?

378
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:36,256
Uh...

379
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:39,757
I'm afraid I... I
need to stop for today.

380
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,131
I'm sorry, can you give us five
more minutes? I didn't mean to press.

381
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,258
You're fine. I'm just done.

382
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,697
All I meant...

383
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,530
Doesn't the simple body count
point toward something bigger...

384
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,104
- Stop. He's done.
- I'm getting to the point.

385
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:56,591
Then you should have
gotten to it sooner. Okay?

386
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,298
Thanks so much for your help.

387
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,590
Do you work with a lot of young girls?

388
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,340
We get a fair amount.

389
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:11,757
Runaways, girls trying to
get away from bad homes.

390
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,800
We just lose so many.

391
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,798
I can't say I recognize her.

392
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,759
But that's not the best picture, is it?

393
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:28,008
The idea is maybe it's
this little girl, grown up.

394
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:34,675
Here we are.

395
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:41,175
Yeah, we were in the same group.

396
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:43,673
That was, um,

397
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,673
four or five months ago, I think?

398
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:49,006
Why did she leave?

399
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:52,340
Things had gotten kind of shaky.

400
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,298
Drugs.

401
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,385
One of the guys had gotten
some of the girls to trick.

402
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,509
Just got... ugly.

403
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:05,131
I dropped out a couple weeks after Mary.

404
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:07,590
She called herself "Mary"?

405
00:26:07,592 --> 00:26:09,381
Sometimes.

406
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:12,048
Or, um, Mary-Julie.

407
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:17,048
And sometimes Mary July,
like Julie, but July.

408
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,383
Like summertime, she said.

409
00:26:20,383 --> 00:26:22,548
She had different names.

410
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,215
She ever talk about herself?

411
00:26:28,217 --> 00:26:31,173
Talk about home? Where she came from?

412
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,923
She mentioned something about
"living in the pink rooms"?

413
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:39,342
Or... Or, uh... uh, "a
queen in a pink castle."

414
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:43,215
You know what I think?

415
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:46,423
I think she didn't know who she was.

416
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:48,841
I think she just pretended.

417
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,925
You oughta write a book.

418
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:57,925
Write about what
happens to kids out here.

419
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:01,883
What happens to girls.

420
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:13,091
D-12, you around? Over.

421
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:20,548
D-12. We're here.

422
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,233
Got a call on the hotline.

423
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:24,757
Guy says he wants to
talk to Lieutenant West.

424
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,133
Says he knows him.

425
00:27:27,675 --> 00:27:29,839
What guy? Who?

426
00:27:29,841 --> 00:27:31,634
Gave us a number to call.

427
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:35,467
Go ahead.

428
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:00,881
Y'all still together?

429
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,632
Right on.

430
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:04,675
You're a hard man to find.

431
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,966
Where you been?

432
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:12,507
Time being what it
is, I imagine you boys

433
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:14,548
would rather I stick to what's relevant.

434
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,839
Which is that justice might finally
be done for Lucy and her kids.

435
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:22,010
Gonna need you to make
your fuckin' point, Dan.

436
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:25,838
My point is Tom goin' on TV,

437
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:27,869
Julie bein' alive.

438
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,006
Now, there are questions
that you cannot answer

439
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,715
without what information I know.

440
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:33,632
You know somethin' you're not sayin',

441
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:35,666
we can put you away right now.

442
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:37,006
Or we can take you somewhere,

443
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,477
kick the hell out of
you till we're convinced

444
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,519
that you're as full of
shit as you look to me.

445
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:47,381
- I want $7,000.
- I want a boat.

446
00:28:47,383 --> 00:28:51,381
It's clear from the news that y'all
don't know any more now than you did then.

447
00:28:51,383 --> 00:28:53,632
But when you can deliver
to me that amount,

448
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:55,715
you're gonna know a whole lot more.

449
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:58,759
I imagine a whole lot of your
confusion's just gonna clear right up.

450
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:06,881
You're workin' on gettin' you're
head bounced off that fuckin' curb.

451
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:10,432
I been gettin' the shit beat outta me

452
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:12,173
since I was two years old.

453
00:29:12,175 --> 00:29:14,964
Way before Lucy came to live with us.

454
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,507
- Live with you?
- Yeah.

455
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:20,215
She moved in, she was
four. After her mama passed.

456
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:25,342
Her and I, we sorta shared a lot
of milestones, growin' up. Hmm?

457
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:32,797
First time we talked,

458
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,298
it was clear that you
can't speak without lyin'.

459
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,256
Why should we believe you now?

460
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:41,632
Hey, you ignore me if you want.

461
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:43,340
But if you guys try musclin' me,

462
00:29:43,342 --> 00:29:45,923
this ain't gonna work
out for anyone, hmm?

463
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:48,983
Look, I got you out here because
you lookin' for Julie again,

464
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:51,423
that means that right now, there
are people tryin' to make sure

465
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:53,489
that none of your questions
can ever be answered.

466
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,659
What people?

467
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:59,839
People who do not renegotiate.

468
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:03,116
People it was in their interest,
make Lucy look like she OD'd.

469
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,634
What, you sayin' she was murdered?

470
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,215
Lucy, she had this problem...

471
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:13,423
Self-defeatin'. Hmm?

472
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:15,729
She didn't know when to stop pushin'.

473
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,256
She'd push till she got what she want,

474
00:30:18,258 --> 00:30:21,131
and then she'd keep on pushin'
till she got what she didn't want.

475
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,561
Y'all ever know anybody like that?

476
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:25,377
Let's throw him in the hole for a week,

477
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,794
see what he remembers then.

478
00:30:26,797 --> 00:30:29,047
You think she has a week, hmm?

479
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,465
I'll just remember that I'm a
sick person who got called away,

480
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:35,340
carried up in his imagination,
tellin' stories to the police.

481
00:30:35,342 --> 00:30:38,131
And while y'all are threatenin'
me and beatin' me and whatnot,

482
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:41,173
what you're really doin' is makin'
sure that the truth of what happened

483
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,923
vanishes from the face
of the fuckin' planet.

484
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,783
What happened to her have
anything to do with Tom?

485
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:51,632
Man, y'all are really
far off, aren't you?

486
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:54,131
You think that I'd be scared
of stickin' my head above ground

487
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:56,368
'cause of that little cocksucker? Shit.

488
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,202
The people you're sayin' hurt Lucy...

489
00:30:58,205 --> 00:31:00,298
That involve the kids?

490
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,548
What... What am I...
Yes, goddamnit. Yes.

491
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,048
It's... It's all about the kids.

492
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,881
And my way is the only
way this works for us.

493
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:11,035
Now, you procure my
funds, we meet back here,

494
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,765
say, tomorrow, maybe the next day,

495
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:14,839
you're gonna see the
solution to your problems.

496
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:17,798
It's gonna take more'n a couple
days to put that money together.

497
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,650
You ain't got much longer'n that.

498
00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:21,108
Like I keep sayin',

499
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:23,215
you ain' the only
ones lookin' for Julie.

500
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,172
You can't be so fucked in
the head where you're thinkin'

501
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:38,715
we're gonna let you walk outta here.

502
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:44,381
Hey, maybe I misspoke, hmm?

503
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,182
I mean, look at me.
This basket case junkie,

504
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:50,808
can't tell night from day,
takin' up your valuable time.

505
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:53,351
I mean, probably I'm just a
crazy man you should ignore.

506
00:31:53,354 --> 00:31:56,759
Oh, I speak crazy. I'm fuckin' fluent.

507
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,564
Tick-tock. Clock's tickin' for
our girl out there, Detectives.

508
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,524
And them others that
are lookin' for her,

509
00:32:06,527 --> 00:32:08,479
they got a serious
head start on you all.

510
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:15,465
Look, I'll call you...
Day after tomorrow.

511
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:19,760
Unless you all would rather we keep
havin' this fuckin' staring contest.

512
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:36,673
Maybe I'm a Nervous Nellie,

513
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:39,215
but I catch any cops followin' me,

514
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:40,883
this shit's off.

515
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:44,091
Thanks for breakfast.

516
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,425
Believe this?

517
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:05,752
Think he's tellin' the truth?

518
00:33:05,755 --> 00:33:08,462
I think we need to get the
phone records from Lucy's hotel.

519
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:11,756
Two years back. Yeah.

520
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,740
Think we need to figure out
exactly where Tom was when she died.

521
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,576
He didn't like Tom for it.

522
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:23,131
Well, I also think we oughta see about

523
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,634
requisitioning that seven thou.

524
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:29,564
Keep eyes on this trash.

525
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:41,091
Go on. You're gettin' out.

526
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,715
I wanna see Lieutenant West.

527
00:33:45,717 --> 00:33:47,361
That's not my problem.

528
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:03,465
That was the lieutenant.

529
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:05,550
They just had lunch with our dirtbag.

530
00:34:07,508 --> 00:34:10,838
- How's that?
- The uncle or whatever. Dan O'Brien?

531
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,715
Met him some diner.

532
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,465
Says he has the whole
story, wants a payout.

533
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:18,256
Fuck that. Give me an
hour in a room with him.

534
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:20,539
And they want us to get phone records.

535
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:23,375
Diamond Cactus Motel
in Paradise, Nevada.

536
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:26,173
Two years back. Lucy's phone records.

537
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:28,881
Yeah, that's good use of our time, huh?

538
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:30,256
Where's O'Brien now?

539
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:32,035
They gave us a plate to run,

540
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:33,997
but sounds like he's still in the wind.

541
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:44,948
You're acting like a child.

542
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:46,512
I'm not acting like a child.

543
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:48,621
You don't give a shit
about anybody but yourself!

544
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:51,402
Okay, forget it! This was a mistake.

545
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:05,175
Hey.

546
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:08,464
You're smokin' now?

547
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:11,717
Seemed like time to
stop deprivin' myself.

548
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,798
You gonna keep goin' on with her...

549
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,925
after she's done filmin'?

550
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,255
What do you mean?

551
00:35:39,265 --> 00:35:42,265
Have a hard time seein'
you in New York City.

552
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:52,173
How'd you know?

553
00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:54,300
I'm still your daddy, boy.

554
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,966
Additionally, I was once a
fair-to-middin' detective.

555
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:08,131
I feel bad.

556
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,507
Heather. I mean, she's a...

557
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:13,590
she's a good woman, ya know?

558
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:15,592
She know about it?

559
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,784
I gotta tell her, huh?

560
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,797
Are you leavin' her?

561
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,340
No.

562
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:29,964
You're endin' the other thing.

563
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:34,006
There's something be said
for truth just hurtin' her.

564
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:37,590
Causin' pain 'cause you feel guilty.

565
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:39,507
Is that fair?

566
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:42,006
You feelin' better, she feelin' worse?

567
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:44,507
I never did anything
like this before, Pop,

568
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:45,802
I want you to know that.

569
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:48,800
I didn't plan it. Y'know, she just...

570
00:36:50,634 --> 00:36:53,590
She was just... She was exciting.

571
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:55,298
They're excitin', all right.

572
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,550
And me and Heather, it's
not like it used to be.

573
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:03,509
Nothin' stays like it used to be.

574
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:12,340
I been lookin' at myself a lot.

575
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:17,091
And, um, I'm askin' this
question for me, so I know.

576
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:19,550
What?

577
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:23,264
Did you find, um...

578
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,557
that I, uh...

579
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:33,047
Did I teach you to withhold?

580
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,175
I don't understand the question.

581
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,381
I didn't intend that.

582
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:43,883
I didn't realize it was happening.

583
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:53,383
I got those addresses you wanted...

584
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:57,057
the names.

585
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:00,966
What are you plannin'?

586
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:09,798
Before you ever knew me, I...

587
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:11,926
I wasn't scared much.

588
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,265
I wasn't a fearful man.

589
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:20,390
I did things some
people even called brave.

590
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,258
Y'all made a coward of me.

591
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:28,592
I been terrified since
the day you were born.

592
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,091
Maybe you know what I mean.

593
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:39,798
Can't shrink from it.
Can't be stingy, son.

594
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,507
People you love...

595
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:46,131
Can't hold it back, see?

596
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,759
Can't hold back anything.

597
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:53,467
I gotta make a phone call, Pop.

598
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:20,297
Due to the shocking and
horrific events three days ago,

599
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,131
our offices have reached a conclusion

600
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:26,673
in the case of Will and Julie Purcell.

601
00:39:26,675 --> 00:39:31,757
New evidence suggests that Brett
Woodard murdered both children.

602
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:35,839
Now, we will pursue a
conviction in absentia,

603
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:39,173
due to the terrible
nature of his crimes,

604
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:41,340
and it is our hope

605
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:43,246
that the community will begin to heal

606
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:45,206
from these events which
have shaken us all.

607
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:47,537
Have they found the girl's remains?

608
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,006
We have evidence, but I don't wish to
say more under the present circumstances.

609
00:39:51,008 --> 00:39:52,923
Was Woodard under investigation?

610
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:55,839
He was very much a person of
interest. We were lookin' at him.

611
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:58,423
Were you close to an arrest,
is that why he snapped?

612
00:39:58,426 --> 00:39:59,858
I believe it's very likely

613
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,459
that the pressure, maybe the guilt,

614
00:40:01,462 --> 00:40:04,279
drove him to explode before
he could be brought to trial.

615
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:07,473
But make no mistake...
That was an act of suicide

616
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:09,846
where he wanted to take as
many with him as he could.

617
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:13,338
Brett Woodard was
interrogated early on, correct?

618
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:16,214
Why wasn't he held during
the time of questioning?

619
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:18,006
A lack of evidence.

620
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:19,715
We are bound by our common law,

621
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,798
which preserve the rights
of all men, even those

622
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:24,425
as malignant and as
vicious as Mr. Woodard.

623
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:31,005
Mrs. Purcell. Do you have
a statement at this time?

624
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:33,131
Leave me the fuck alone is my statement.

625
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:35,792
- Do you feel justice has been done?
- Justice?!

626
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:38,573
The fuck are you talking about?
What's that even mean, huh?

627
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:40,548
- Here? Now?
- Mrs. Purcell...

628
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,784
Just leave her alone.
This is harassment.

629
00:40:42,787 --> 00:40:45,104
It's my job. I'm just trying
to get the story right.

630
00:40:45,107 --> 00:40:46,757
If I don't, someone
else'll get it wrong.

631
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:48,131
That is no excuse.

632
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:49,757
The fuck do you want, teacher?

633
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:51,982
I just want to apologize
for how we left things...

634
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:55,756
Don't apologize to
me. Ever. For anything.

635
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:58,465
You two bitches, you
two talk to each other.

636
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:00,423
Make up a story on your own.

637
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:36,133
Be ironic, that shitbird clears Tom.

638
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:45,088
It's somethin', isn't it?

639
00:41:45,091 --> 00:41:47,300
How quick this town died.

640
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:50,841
Didn't die. Got murdered.

641
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:53,917
We oughta look at who else

642
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,673
mighta planted the backpack and shirt.

643
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:59,048
Coulda been anybody.

644
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,798
But I wouldn't clear Tom
just yet. The man had secrets.

645
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,256
Get back to the office, wanna
look up that church program.

646
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,634
More co-workers.

647
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:14,506
Wait. Where we goin'?

648
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:16,753
I'm takin' you home. Whatcha think?

649
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:18,459
I'm not goin' home. I'm workin'.

650
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:20,048
It'll still be there in the mornin'.

651
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,381
Come on, man. O'Brien?

652
00:42:23,383 --> 00:42:24,964
We got the scent.

653
00:42:24,966 --> 00:42:26,881
Let's get back, strategize,

654
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:29,715
maybe talk to somebody in Vice
about the queer underground.

655
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:31,590
Just stop, all right?

656
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:34,131
You don't wanna go home, don't go home.

657
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:35,964
But don't make it the job.

658
00:42:35,966 --> 00:42:37,440
Maybe we just work it different.

659
00:42:37,443 --> 00:42:39,215
Oh, yeah, we work it different.

660
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:41,170
- I just said.
- And I agreed.

661
00:42:41,173 --> 00:42:43,381
That's why I'm where I'm at, and you...

662
00:42:43,383 --> 00:42:45,006
What?

663
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:47,173
Me what?

664
00:42:47,175 --> 00:42:48,841
You're you.

665
00:42:50,466 --> 00:42:52,584
- Pull over.
- What?

666
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:53,959
Stop the fuckin' car.

667
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,256
What are you, a prom queen?

668
00:42:55,258 --> 00:42:56,487
I hurt your feelin's,

669
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,865
you're just gonna storm off?

670
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:03,131
You fuckin' kiddin' me?!
This kindergarten shit?

671
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:04,673
Where you think you're goin'?

672
00:43:04,676 --> 00:43:06,784
I don't care so much about my timecard.

673
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:07,883
I'm workin'.

674
00:43:12,778 --> 00:43:15,151
People see your black
ass skulkin' around,

675
00:43:15,154 --> 00:43:17,050
you're gonna get yourself shot!

676
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:20,258
Prick.

677
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,172
Tom Purses.

678
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,131
Fuck you doin' here?

679
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:10,173
Smart mouth.

680
00:44:10,175 --> 00:44:12,964
For a smart guy, you're awful sloppy.

681
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:15,215
Same place you used to come to slam meth

682
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:17,548
when you weren't leechin' off of us.

683
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,800
Don't really feel like
catchin' up just now, Tommy.

684
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,797
Hey, you know, there's
a rest stop up the road.

685
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,673
Saw a glory hole in the back stall,

686
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:37,133
you need somethin' to do.

687
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:43,221
Heard you're wantin' a payout.

688
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,768
Let's pretend each of these
bullets is a thousand bucks.

689
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:47,340
Hold on now, Tom.

690
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:49,298
You ain't got no problem with me.

691
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,881
I know we ain't been buddies,
but you got no call for this here.

692
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:53,465
You know something, you son of a bitch!

693
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:55,964
What is it?! What are
you sellin' the cops?!

694
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:58,010
Just point that gun down now, Tom.

695
00:44:58,013 --> 00:45:00,340
Please. You're makin'
me real nervous here.

696
00:45:01,675 --> 00:45:04,673
You been drinkin', man?
I thought you quit that.

697
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:07,048
- What do you know?
- Nothin'! Just nothin'!

698
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,549
- Bullshit!
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

699
00:45:09,552 --> 00:45:13,173
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'll tell ya. I'll tell ya.

700
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:15,175
Hold on.

701
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,147
Get up, motherfucker.

702
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,381
Unhh!

703
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:44,173
I'm gonna shoot your dick off.

704
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:47,159
And then your knees, and
then maybe your ears...

705
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,833
What the fuck are you
talkin' about, man?

706
00:45:48,836 --> 00:45:51,870
Julie! When you stayin' in Will's room,

707
00:45:51,873 --> 00:45:53,435
you were spyin' on her.

708
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:55,215
Made a peephole in Will's closet

709
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:56,507
so you could watch her get dressed.

710
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:58,301
I never... I would never...

711
00:45:58,304 --> 00:46:00,276
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

712
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:03,248
I'll figure out where to put
the last bullet when I get there.

713
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:05,999
Goddamnit, listen to me. Listen to me!

714
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:13,673
I don't know nothin' about no peephole.

715
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:17,089
All right? I'd never
do nothin' like that.

716
00:46:17,091 --> 00:46:20,006
- Julie? She was...
- Where is she?!

717
00:46:20,008 --> 00:46:21,757
- I don't know!
- Where's my daughter?!

718
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:24,089
- I don't know!
- You lyin' motherfucker!

719
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:27,518
You ever ask yourself where
Lucy got the money to run off?

720
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:30,757
Or what she was livin' off for all
them eight years before she died?

721
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:33,757
- Hmm?
- Say what you're sayin', goddamnit!

722
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:37,757
I'm sayin'... I'm sayin'
I know who was payin' her.

723
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:40,089
Listen, man, I know who was payin' her

724
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:42,423
and who would have a problem
if she asked for more.

725
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,256
That's all I was gonna
give the cops, man!

726
00:46:44,258 --> 00:46:47,021
That's all I was gonna
give the cops. A name. Shit.

727
00:46:47,024 --> 00:46:48,732
Just a man's name.

728
00:46:51,883 --> 00:46:53,883
All right, you dumbshit.

729
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:57,759
Give me a reason not to murder you.

730
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:03,550
They were passin' notes.

731
00:49:07,717 --> 00:49:09,881
Little notes were the kids.

732
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:13,550
The hole in the wall.
That's what it was for.

733
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:17,302
That's right. That's correct.

734
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,759
Yeah, that director woman.

735
00:49:23,924 --> 00:49:26,922
She mentioned Harris James. Again.

736
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,838
Are you sure you know
what you're doin' with her?

737
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:35,759
Well, if I don't...

738
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:40,215
What'd O'Brien tell us?

739
00:49:40,217 --> 00:49:42,465
"I'm just a sick man."

740
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:50,506
I got a list of the... names, addresses.

741
00:49:50,509 --> 00:49:52,340
A former domestic,

742
00:49:52,342 --> 00:49:54,173
Hoyt's house.

743
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,256
Harris James' widow.

744
00:49:56,258 --> 00:49:59,300
What you think we're gonna do?

745
00:50:05,634 --> 00:50:07,175
Take a leak.

746
00:50:57,675 --> 00:50:58,966
Roland?

747
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:04,175
Hey, man.

748
00:51:09,342 --> 00:51:10,759
How ya doin'?

749
00:51:12,509 --> 00:51:14,465
Good, man.

750
00:51:14,467 --> 00:51:16,550
How you doin'?

751
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:20,464
Uh, all right.

752
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:23,381
All right.

753
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:27,715
You been spendin' a lot
of time in here, I guess.

754
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,425
I don't think I sleep much.

755
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:39,632
What?

756
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:41,383
Do me a favor.

757
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,590
Go to the window.

758
00:51:44,592 --> 00:51:48,925
See if there's a dark sedan
idlin' down the street.

759
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:51,675
Okay.

760
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:09,757
Naw, man.

761
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,592
Nothin' out there.

762
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,925
All right.

763
00:52:20,383 --> 00:52:22,923
You been seein' a car?

764
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:27,592
How ya been, Roland?

765
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,115
Been doin' some readin'.

766
00:52:31,118 --> 00:52:32,910
Oh, yeah.

767
00:52:34,342 --> 00:52:36,381
I never read it all the way.

768
00:52:36,383 --> 00:52:39,381
She never minded.

769
00:52:39,383 --> 00:52:41,300
Good-lookin' woman.

770
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:44,509
That she was.

771
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,675
Yeah.

772
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:54,966
It's 2015, isn't it?

773
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,300
That's right, pal.

774
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:02,893
"A lost child is a void

775
00:53:02,896 --> 00:53:06,423
that echoes backwards
and forwards in time.

776
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:09,839
It encompasses not just the
rooms you were in with them

777
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,215
and are no longer,

778
00:53:12,217 --> 00:53:16,089
or even those rooms you
will never enter together.

779
00:53:16,091 --> 00:53:18,881
The negation is deeper.

780
00:53:18,883 --> 00:53:23,964
It is the knowledge that in every room
you enter for the rest of your life,

781
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:27,507
they should be there, and are not.

782
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:31,217
And your memories of them
become totems to that absence.

783
00:53:32,965 --> 00:53:35,005
A lost child...

784
00:53:35,008 --> 00:53:38,800
is a story that's never allowed to end."

785
00:53:43,717 --> 00:53:46,143
Mrs. Hays will answer a few questions,

786
00:53:46,146 --> 00:53:49,298
and afterward she'll be
signing copies right here.

787
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,089
Thank you.

788
00:53:51,091 --> 00:53:53,167
Ah, are there any questions?

789
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,089
They sayin'...

790
00:53:56,091 --> 00:53:58,923
the girl alive now?

791
00:53:58,925 --> 00:54:01,698
There were fingerprints
found recently, yes.

792
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:05,636
I'm writing about the
new investigation now.

793
00:54:06,731 --> 00:54:10,498
You got any idea where she is?

794
00:54:12,731 --> 00:54:14,107
Do they?

795
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:19,008
Uh, no. Nobody does.

796
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,717
- Are you...
- And what about your book?

797
00:54:25,383 --> 00:54:27,131
You got any theory here?

798
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:31,381
You got some idea 'bout where she's at?

799
00:54:31,383 --> 00:54:33,076
Well, this...

800
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:37,215
I wrote it when she was believed dead.

801
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:39,089
So you don't know nothin'.

802
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:41,798
You just...

803
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,685
you just makin' your money...

804
00:54:43,688 --> 00:54:45,185
and milkin' they pain.

805
00:54:45,188 --> 00:54:46,875
Sir, the author has never claimed...

806
00:54:46,878 --> 00:54:48,378
Shame on you, woman!

807
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:04,883
Dolls.

808
00:57:40,592 --> 00:57:42,091
The hell?

809
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,717
Julie?
