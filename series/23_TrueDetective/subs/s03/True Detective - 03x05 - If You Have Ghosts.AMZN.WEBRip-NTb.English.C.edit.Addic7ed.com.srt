1
00:00:04,017 --> 00:00:06,758
And everything pointed
to a girl being dead.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,243
We were wrong.

3
00:00:08,245 --> 00:00:09,492
Let's find out why.

4
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:12,113
The way Will's body was...

5
00:00:12,116 --> 00:00:15,031
It's almost as if there was
an element of affection in it.

6
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,239
I found this spot they
played in the woods.

7
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:18,575
They were meeting somebody.

8
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,865
Julie had been excited
about seeing an aunt?

9
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:23,740
She doesn't have any aunts.

10
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:25,323
The dolls. Somebody bought 'em.

11
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,531
All we know, man's got a dead eye.

12
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,408
Sound like anybody in the community?

13
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:32,434
Mr. Whitehead. Where were
you the night of the 7th?

14
00:00:32,437 --> 00:00:34,239
They trying to fix me up!

15
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:35,659
Calm the fuck down!

16
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:38,615
If word's out now this girl's alive,

17
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:40,571
there's a real possibility
there's people somewhere

18
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,113
don't want that to remain the case.

19
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:43,698
Drained quarry in southern Missouri.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,156
Dental records identify
the remains as Dan O'Brien.

21
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:48,281
What I really need is
for you to find Roland.

22
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:49,989
I need his memory, son.

23
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,031
We got a hit on the bike. Freddy Burns?

24
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:54,648
I know brothers inside
will tear your guts up.

25
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:57,950
Woodard! You was warned off them kids!

26
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,070
We comin' in! You ain't comin' out!

27
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:03,116
Back up!

28
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:31,156

29
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,865
We're doin' an APB,

30
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,615
but we're keepin' the public out of it.

31
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:48,617
That'd hurt us if she
don't want to be found.

32
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,406
Like Wayne said,

33
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:55,281
somebody else might
be lookin' for her too.

34
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:58,239
We're sending it to Oklahoma.
The Missouri State Police.

35
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:00,740
How much do we think this is really her?

36
00:03:00,742 --> 00:03:02,490
I think it's her.

37
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:04,989
Show it to the father,
see what he thinks.

38
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:08,323
He don't know what she looks
like now any more'n we do.

39
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:10,615
He could make it into
her, even if it's not.

40
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,825
Just give him somethin'
else to hurt about,

41
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:15,406
and I ain't gonna do that to the man.

42
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:17,450
So we don't know it's her.

43
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,114
We find her, we can ask.

44
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:22,390
What else?

45
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:24,015
I got the file on the mother, Lucy,

46
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:25,718
from Clark County Sheriff's.

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,072
August 12th, 1988.

48
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,657
Housekeeping found her,

49
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,226
motel in Paradise, Nevada,

50
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:33,726
right outside Vegas.

51
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:35,977
She'd been stayin'
there 'bout three weeks.

52
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,947
The OD fits.

53
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,490
Right. Old news.

54
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:43,406
The cousin, Dan O'Brien... No luck yet.

55
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:45,782
Did nine months Missouri
Eastern Correctional.

56
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:47,782
Bad checks. '85-'86.

57
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:50,948
Have him in Vegas, '87.
Then he drops off the map.

58
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,865
Vegas, like Lucy.

59
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:58,281
- Morelli?
- Yeah, uh, found a few former residents,

60
00:03:58,283 --> 00:04:01,073
just repeated what they
remember, nothin' jumped out.

61
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:03,305
Had one guy said a
plainclothes took his statement,

62
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:06,296
but there's no record of that interview.

63
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,989
Excuse me, uh, Lieutenant West.

64
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:12,198
They're wantin' me to make a statement.

65
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,989
- That's Lucy.
- You shouldn't be here, Tom.

66
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:16,710
- That picture.
- You don't wanna see that.

67
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:17,843
Come on, now.

68
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,697
I never saw it, man,
didn't really know it...

69
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,281
- I'll tell ya about it...
- Who's that?

70
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,176
Who's that, Lieutenant?
Is that someone...

71
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,116
- Lieutenant, who is that?
- Listen to me.

72
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,740
Calm down, Tom.

73
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,906
All right, I'm sorry.

74
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,904
I never, uh...

75
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:38,156
I never saw that room.

76
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,073
Is that where she was livin'?

77
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:42,907
You shouldn't've seen
that. Try and forget it.

78
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,698
What are you doin' here?

79
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,239
They wanted me to make
a statement. On TV.

80
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,531
So I...

81
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,507
Do you know somethin' you haven't...

82
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,239
What are you lookin' at Lucy for?

83
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:55,781
We're just gettin' started.

84
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:58,698
I told you, Tom, we find
something out, I'll let you know.

85
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,281
Yeah, but that girl. The
black-and-white picture.

86
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:02,698
Who was she?

87
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,823
- Does she look familiar?
- Shut up.

88
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:07,408
- Here, look close.
- Who is this?

89
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,289
Is this my baby girl?

90
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:13,582
What do you think?

91
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:15,709
Get back in the squad room. Now.

92
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:24,991
You need to go home.

93
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,573
I'm gonna give you a call later.

94
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,075
All right?

95
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:32,030
Who is this?

96
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,742
Is that her?

97
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,533
Is that what she looks like?

98
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,700
Tell me.

99
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:01,189
You were in that, huh?

100
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:13,283
Woodard!

101
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,615
Woodard!

102
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:20,950
Get out here!

103
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,617
Woodard!

104
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:27,447
We comin' in

105
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,875
if you ain't comin' out!

106
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,295
What's goin' on here?!

107
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,782
Back up!

108
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,242
What's happening? Huh?

109
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,325
Unh!

110
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:55,659
Let's go!

111
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,657
Aaah!

112
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:06,698
Freeze!

113
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:13,114
Aw, fuck! Gaah!

114
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,490
Stay put.

115
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:16,950
Ya think I'm fuckin' goin' somewhere?!

116
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,490
- That you, Sergeant?
- Put it down, man.

117
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,531
I gotcha.

118
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,033
Just put it down.

119
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,323
I had you.

120
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,782
Out front.

121
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,825
That double-tap on the door?

122
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:06,991
I don't miss 'less I mean to.

123
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,200
All right.

124
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,540
Let me return the favor.

125
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:16,742
Put it down, and I'll
walk you out of here.

126
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:21,114
I might've been within my rights...

127
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:22,874
'fore I took out those cops.

128
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:27,406
We'll get you help, man.

129
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:30,533
Got all kinda veteran affairs
shit can work in your favor.

130
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:37,116
I don't want it to work in my favor.

131
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:44,865
You gon' put this on me, huh?

132
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,575
Nobody made you take the job.

133
00:08:50,415 --> 00:08:52,415
I'll put one in your knee.

134
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,158
Then I'll kill you.

135
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:00,823
I'm'a count to three, in my head....

136
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:04,281
and when I hit three...

137
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:06,784
I'm gonna give you a full burst.

138
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:13,114
I'm countin', Sarge.

139
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,283
Hey, hey, hey!

140
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,950
I'm speakin' to Julie now

141
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:49,198
in the hopes that she's out there.

142
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,239
Julie, if you see or hear this,

143
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:55,948
please, please call.

144
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,659
Call me or call the police number.

145
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,657
I'm sorry I let these years go by.

146
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:05,323
But I love you forever, Julie,

147
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:08,823
and we just want to
know that you're okay.

148
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,907
And for you to know that...

149
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:14,448
you can come home.

150
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,531
And if somebody's keeping
you from coming home,

151
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,365
we won't stop lookin'
for you, sweetheart.

152
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:24,198
I'll never stop now.

153
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,323
And anyone who might know
anything about my daughter,

154
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:30,865
I ask you to please come forward.

155
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,573
The police have got a hotline,

156
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:37,200
and there'll be a reward for any
information that leads us to her.

157
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:42,073
Please, keep Julie in
your prayers. God bless.

158
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,865
Do you now believe that
Mr. Woodard was innocent?

159
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:46,075
What about the evidence?

160
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,197
I don't know.

161
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
I-I just know that...

162
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:53,781
my daughter's out there, and...

163
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:56,281
for so long I thought she wasn't.

164
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:59,098
Do you think the police fumbled
the initial investigation?

165
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,414
Mr. Purcell won't be
taking questions right now.

166
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,490
Mr. Attorney General,
what about this petition

167
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:06,156
to have the original
conviction overturned?

168
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:07,765
The possibility of the Purcell girl

169
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,615
being alive doesn't
change our conclusion

170
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:13,875
that Brett Woodard murdered Will
Purcell and kidnapped his sister.

171
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:16,629
Now, what he may have done
with her, we can't know.

172
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:18,406
David and Josie Woodard

173
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:20,615
want their father's name cleared.

174
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:23,657
Now, we all understand the
violence Brett Woodard committed,

175
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,934
and view it as the reaction of a man

176
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,740
persecuted by the violence of others.

177
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:30,573
And regardless, we
insist he is not guilty

178
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:32,490
of hurtin' those children.

179
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,176
We contend his posthumous
conviction was fraudulent

180
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,907
and a significant dereliction of duty

181
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,907
on the part of the
prosecutin' attorney's office.

182
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:40,950
Is this a mandate against Gerald Kindt?

183
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:42,531
It's a mandate against
the lack of due process

184
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:44,406
that could allow somethin'
like this to happen.

185
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:46,265
- Excuse me.
- What about the evidence

186
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:48,238
found at the Woodard place...

187
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,615
Where was this Perry Mason shit in '80?

188
00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:54,907
Even bein' a lawyer, you ought
to know this is outta line.

189
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:56,948
Press is the only
language he understands.

190
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,448
You're tellin' me you didn't
enjoy that look on his face?

191
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,114
It's not about you, or your old boss.

192
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:05,116
Maybe consider that man tryin'
to get his daughter back.

193
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,907
- Those his kids?
- Uh-huh.

194
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:15,617
They know who I am?

195
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,698
Motherfucker made me carry his water.

196
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,323
Like I need more of them memories.

197
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:31,789
It's good to see you back
on the job, Detective Hays.

198
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,989
Freddy around?

199
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:51,198
He's changing oil.

200
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,323
Can't take anything new.

201
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,158
We're old friends.

202
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,656
Who remembers?

203
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:01,449
I saw the Trash Man guy, Woodard,

204
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:03,239
but he was headin'
away from Devil's Den.

205
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,448
Them two kids was ridin' towards it.

206
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,093
Don't mean anything.

207
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,280
He coulda doubled back.

208
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:12,200
Yeah, sure. I mean, he did it, right?

209
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:16,406
And you're the one killed him, huh?

210
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:17,989
I seen you in the paper back then.

211
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:20,698
We just wanted to know if
you remembered that night.

212
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:23,743
Maybe you could take
us through it again.

213
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:27,530
You must be a stone-cold killer, huh?

214
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:31,039
- Plenty tough with teenagers.
- That night,

215
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:34,662
you told us Will was
alone when you saw him.

216
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:37,447
Where was the girl?

217
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,698
- Where was the sister?
- How would I know?

218
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,988
He was all nervous, like,
"I can't find my sister.

219
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,239
I don't know where they went."

220
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,867
"They"?

221
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,739
He said "they"?

222
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:50,658
I'm pretty sure he did.

223
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:53,387
I don't know, you wanna slap
me around some, make sure?

224
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,198
He give you any indication
who they might be?

225
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,867
You two can't be very good at your job.

226
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:03,281
Comin' back ten years later,
try hangin' this on me.

227
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,406
Nobody's hangin' anything on you.

228
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:08,156
Maybe killer here wants to see
can he make me piss my pants.

229
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:11,406
That don't seem like a very tall order.

230
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:12,950
Come on, then.

231
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:17,239
Bounce me off the walls,
you black motherfucker.

232
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:19,851
'Cause you think there's
something you can do to me,

233
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:21,906
you might wanna take
another look at my life.

234
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,701
Hold on, now.

235
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:27,073
Mr. Burns,

236
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,573
I understand your hard feelin's.

237
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:31,492
But we just needed you to remember.

238
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:34,325
And not for nothin'.

239
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,865
Things might be what they are...

240
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:43,114
'cause you're the type like
bullyin' somebody weaker than you.

241
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,575
Hmm. And you don't?

242
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,784
I was a teenager, me.
What's your excuse?

243
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,283
I wanna thank you for
your help, Mr. Burns.

244
00:14:56,965 --> 00:15:00,131
Maybe you let me know,
you remember anything else.

245
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,950
Mrs. Burns.

246
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,325
Don't you wanna call me
a shit-heel twerp again?

247
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,320
Tell me how I'm gonna get ass-raped?

248
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:33,323
Believe that guy?

249
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,200
Actin' like I ruined his life?

250
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,988
Please explain to me all the
hardships and tribulations

251
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:44,283
of bein' a white man in this country.

252
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:55,909
Verified Woodard's location,
which don't mean much.

253
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,991
But "they"...

254
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:06,030
Makes me think we need to
get back on who those kids

255
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,531
were meetin' in the forest.

256
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,365
I'm gonna tell you, when I was his age,

257
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:14,743
age he was in the room with
us, I was in the fuckin' jungle.

258
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:19,365
And them toys we found in the woods?

259
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,031
We need to run those
unknown prints again.

260
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:24,179
They didn't even have a database in '80.

261
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:26,098
I made the kid skip college?

262
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,700
So what do you think?

263
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:34,742
I think that whole
generation's a bunch of pussies.

264
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:38,784
You left Mena, 16.

265
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:42,075
You been on the streets this whole time?

266
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,072
I been all over.

267
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:47,156
Went as far west as
Boulder a few years back.

268
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:49,073
You said you recognize this woman?

269
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,948
Yeah. With the same crew a while.

270
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,114
You know, other kids.

271
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:56,823
We had a good little family.

272
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:59,031
But she didn't stay long.

273
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,865
What's her name?

274
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,323
Mary, she said.

275
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,073
Mary July.

276
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:06,031
Was that her real name? I don't know.

277
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:07,989
She tell you anything about herself?

278
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:09,740
Where she was from?

279
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,907
I wasn't close with her or anything.

280
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:13,156
A little nutty.

281
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,531
How's that?

282
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,448
Like, couldn't get straight
on what year it was.

283
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,164
Tell some story how she's a
secret princess or somethin'.

284
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,332
Any idea where she mighta gone?

285
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,782
No, sir. Really.

286
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,968
I'd try talkin' to workin' girls.

287
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:29,448
A lot of 'em end up trickin'.

288
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,281
She ever do drugs?

289
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,782
Not that I saw.

290
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,615
Some of her stories,
seemed like she used.

291
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:38,865
She's, uh... a "princess."

292
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,865
From "the pink rooms."

293
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:43,031
I don't know.

294
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,865
Hey. said she'd lost a brother.

295
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:47,281
She was lookin' for her
brother. That's right.

296
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,657
- Did she...
- What happened with her brother?

297
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:51,615
She say?

298
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:54,343
I think they got put apart
when she was young, I dunno.

299
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:56,865
- She act like she was runnin' from anybody?
- I don't know.

300
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,156
You hear that kind of thing, but...

301
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:01,450
everybody on the road's
runnin' from somebody.

302
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:05,239
Write down names.

303
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:08,492
Anybody in that crew with ya,
anybody else mighta known her.

304
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:12,490
They're not in trouble.

305
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,367
And they'll get a favor
to call in with the police.

306
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,782
Mary July?

307
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:29,562
Don't know that's our girl.

308
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:31,322
It's her.

309
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:33,031
The missin' brother. That's her.

310
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,657
I'm just sayin'...

311
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:36,657
don't want us fixatin'.

312
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:41,073
Hey. Till we find her, this is her.

313
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:43,825
Hookers and runaways. Let's go.

314
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:49,698
- What about...
- Spent a few days all over the place.

315
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,698
- ...called "Mary."
- Runaways, workin' girls.

316
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,031
- Ask you a coupla questions.
- Nobody knew.

317
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,907
Or maybe they did, but
nobody talked to us.

318
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:02,028
Were you aware that one of the officers
who processed the Woodard scene,

319
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:04,365
Harris James, went missing in 1990

320
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,533
during the second investigation?

321
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:09,749
Who?

322
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,575
No.

323
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,075
No, I didn't.

324
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,666
Who was that?

325
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,617
The field statements said
you talked to him in '90.

326
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:41,281
A lot people around this thing are dead.

327
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,290
A lot of people gone.

328
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,075
People do that, miss.

329
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:52,408
Most people I ever knew are gone.

330
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:10,365
Foxwood.

331
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,531
They've done all right, huh?

332
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,476
Hate these suburbs.

333
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,138
Like a plastic factory.

334
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:27,981
Hello, hello! Welcome!

335
00:20:27,984 --> 00:20:30,158
I'm so glad to meet y'all. I'm Lori.

336
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,450
- Come on in.
- Hey.

337
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:35,950
Hey.

338
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:38,450
All right.

339
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:44,445
Your home is beautiful. It really is.

340
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:45,737
Well, thank you.

341
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,988
We got it after his promotion.

342
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:50,114
Man been rentin' his whole life.

343
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,365
I said, "You're an adult.
You can afford to own a home."

344
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,615
Too much commitment for this one.

345
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:57,490
Naw, just, like, if
somethin's needs fixin',

346
00:20:57,492 --> 00:21:00,323
I pick up the phone and
say, "Fix this shit."

347
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,989
Now I gotta fix this shit.

348
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:06,323
You two been together
this whole time? Since '80?

349
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:07,823
I saw these two meet.

350
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:09,615
And I saw you two meet.

351
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:12,073
I messed with him a bit
first time he saw you.

352
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:13,882
We were together two years,

353
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:15,490
and then we split.

354
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:17,239
And about three years later,

355
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:20,406
we run into each other at the IGA.

356
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:24,490
So this time now, we're on five years.

357
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,984
I add 'em together.

358
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:29,822
I say seven years with a
little vacation in between.

359
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:31,700
So when's the big day?

360
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,156
Well, that is touchy.

361
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:36,865
Don't be comin' to my
house to break bread,

362
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,325
thinkin' you're gonna stir shit up.

363
00:21:42,788 --> 00:21:44,995
How's the case going?

364
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:47,574
I saw Tom on the TV.
Have you been able...

365
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:50,070
Nobody wants to talk about that.

366
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:52,113
Well, I'm curious too.

367
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:55,179
It's just the first week. We
got some stuff we're lookin' at.

368
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,124
It's incredible she's alive.

369
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,113
Do you know anything? Where she's been?

370
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:01,406
You see how late I been workin'.

371
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:03,114
Maybe let's forget about it tonight.

372
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:05,989
We found a runaway. The guy knew her.

373
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,031
We tried askin' others, street kids,

374
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:10,695
but they ain't talkin' to us.

375
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:12,987
Have you tried that women's
shelter on Pine Street?

376
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,572
Can't really get into it,
stuff bein' classified and all.

377
00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:18,575
- Oh, come on...
- Would ya stop?

378
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:24,438
I'm sorry.

379
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,163
I'm a writer, I can't help it.

380
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,582
Right. He said. You have a book.

381
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:32,697
Yeah, it comes out next week.

382
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,531
It's all about the case.

383
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:37,408
And us.

384
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:42,490
Well, I would love to read that.

385
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:44,615
Well, I was gonna bring y'all a copy,

386
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:45,907
but he stopped me.

387
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:48,075
Gifts shouldn't flatter the giver.

388
00:22:50,408 --> 00:22:53,448
We'll talk later about
what you been up to.

389
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,948
Lori, you grew up around here?

390
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,615
Little Rock. I came here for college.

391
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:01,077
"What I've been up to."

392
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,405
What'd you study?

393
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:05,823
Poultry science.

394
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:07,949
They make rocket fuel outta chickens.

395
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:10,015
What are you talking about?

396
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:12,227
Jesus. You don't quit.

397
00:23:22,116 --> 00:23:23,450
Excuse me.

398
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:35,991
You have a lovely home.

399
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:42,200
Thanks.

400
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:52,865
"There surely exists
a mutable area of soul

401
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:56,989
where grief is
indistinguishable from madness.

402
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:59,490
Standing above the box
of her children's things,

403
00:23:59,492 --> 00:24:03,323
she wept and clutched her chest.

404
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,640
'This wasn't a happy home.

405
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:08,113
Children should laugh, you know?

406
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:10,659
And there wasn't much
laughter around here.'"

407
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:17,192
"Should laugh."

408
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:20,075
"Children should laugh."

409
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,541
"Children should laugh."

410
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,700
Oh...

411
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:47,700
The fuck?

412
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,283
Ohhh.

413
00:24:57,116 --> 00:25:00,116
Babe, I shoulda read
this a long time ago.

414
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:49,073
- Thanks so much, Mom.
- Oh, you're welcome.

415
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:51,698
Mmm! Always happy to see my grandkids.

416
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:52,789
I know they love it, too.

417
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,571
Aw...

418
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:56,614
Becca's gettin' a cold.
She just went down,

419
00:25:56,617 --> 00:25:58,490
but you might want to
pick up some NyQuil.

420
00:25:58,492 --> 00:25:59,950
- Sure.
- All right.

421
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:03,448
- Thanks again.
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:17,113
- You didn't tell her about the divorce?
- What?

423
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:20,257
How you referred to me the
other day as your ex-husband.

424
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,825
In Sallisaw.

425
00:26:23,187 --> 00:26:26,615
What? You went to Sallisaw?

426
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:28,239
Why didn't you tell me?

427
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:32,283
Why would I? I didn't
just go to Sallisaw.

428
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,700
I found footage of her. Julie.

429
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,991
Yeah. I got her on film now.

430
00:26:41,742 --> 00:26:43,158
You have?

431
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:47,823
- You didn't tell me?
- Are you state police?

432
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:51,239
Seemed like you were gettin'
real comfortable, havin' secrets.

433
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:55,031
I let this dumb detective
think I was single.

434
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:58,156
He talked. So what?

435
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,867
Maybe I thought you took
this a little more serious.

436
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:04,239
Now I know. No sweat.

437
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:06,114
You know what this is?

438
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:07,948
You trying to control me.

439
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,948
Now you're running
around doing your thing,

440
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,293
you want me home, washing
clothes, making dinner.

441
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:18,865
This will shock you,
but I have bigger dreams

442
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,538
than just making a house
for you to brood in.

443
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:23,523
I did nothin' but support you,

444
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:26,316
whole time, years, while you
worked on that fuckin' book.

445
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,983
Yeah, as long as I was around,

446
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:30,257
saw to the kids, kept your house.

447
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,216
Well, now you're all over the place,

448
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,974
meetin' interesting men, tellin'
'em about your ex-husband.

449
00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:38,392
Do you really think that I did
something with that detective?

450
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:39,520
I think...

451
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:43,823
No, I don't.

452
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:46,073
But I think you're a tourist, okay?

453
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:48,448
I think you're a voyeur.

454
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,909
Lifting yourself up
on people's bad luck.

455
00:27:55,158 --> 00:27:57,460
That's not what I do. Or did.

456
00:27:57,463 --> 00:27:59,713
Mm-hmm. Yeah. You...

457
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:02,989
I think you use people.

458
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:04,740
Like we're all stories to you,

459
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:07,406
and you use 'em to make
yourself bigger than us.

460
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:09,075
I see you too, baby.

461
00:28:10,283 --> 00:28:13,281
Y-You're using this case to avoid home.

462
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:14,859
You're smoking again...

463
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,359
Smellin' my clothes now, Ma?

464
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,151
We're all just things in your way.

465
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,238
Ten years, and you never got me right.

466
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,281
You never got yourself right.

467
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,948
Stop pretending that you're too dumb
to know that you're full of shit.

468
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,281
Well, soon as you dig your
way out, lend me the shovel.

469
00:28:29,283 --> 00:28:31,296
What's wrong, baby girl?

470
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:34,422
She's sick. She can't breathe.

471
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,881
Oh...

472
00:28:35,884 --> 00:28:38,614
you're all stuffed up, huh, sweetie?

473
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:41,202
I can run out, get some medicine.

474
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:44,072
We've got Vick's and some nose spray.

475
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:46,408
I wanna be in your bed.

476
00:28:48,116 --> 00:28:50,615
Why don't we all go get in the big bed?

477
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:52,343
Can Mom read a story?

478
00:28:52,346 --> 00:28:53,907
Sure, baby.

479
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:56,659
Let's get in bed. Henry, you wanna come?

480
00:28:58,283 --> 00:29:00,698
Mom? Dad?

481
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,116
What do "we do not"?

482
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:10,116
We do not say goodnight
without "I love you's."

483
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:14,285
I love you.

484
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:36,158
Wait. Ame? Becca?

485
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:40,108
Oh, no.

486
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:43,448
Where are ya?

487
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,865
Becca. Henry. Becca!

488
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:49,909
Where'd you go? Huh?

489
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:53,698
Where's my family?

490
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,281
"'They fed me behind
bars from an iron pan

491
00:29:57,283 --> 00:29:59,062
till one night I felt that

492
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:01,447
I was Bagheera, the Panther,

493
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,907
and no man's plaything,

494
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:06,531
and I broke the silly lock
with one blow of my paw

495
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:08,615
and came away.

496
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:11,698
And because I had
learned the ways of men,

497
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,615
I became more terrible in
the jungle than Shere Khan.

498
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,198
Is it not so?'

499
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,531
'Yes, ' said Mowgli.

500
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:24,448
'All the jungle fear Bagheera...

501
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,659
All except Mowgli.'"

502
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:37,448
"'Though thou art a man's cub, '

503
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,156
said the Black Panther, very tenderly,

504
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:43,907
'and even as I returned to my jungle,

505
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:47,657
so thou must go back to men at last...

506
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:50,198
to the men who are thy brothers,

507
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,742
if thou are not killed in the Council.'"

508
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:03,072
I announced myself and
told him drop the weapon.

509
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:05,950
He said when he counted three,
he was gonna turn and fire.

510
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,615
I let him get to two.

511
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,782
More'n I would've given him.

512
00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:13,450
More'n he deserved.

513
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:16,718
I went through this twice already.

514
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:18,448
I know how it goes,

515
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,450
but maybe give me some space.

516
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:26,210
What's happenin'? How is he?

517
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:28,073
He's stable. He's out of surgery.

518
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:29,820
Won't know about the leg till morning.

519
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:33,054
Look, we need the statement
again, while it's all fresh.

520
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:38,238
Do not fuckin' speak to
me till tomorrow mornin'.

521
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:39,825
At the earliest.

522
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,731
Oh, God. Are you okay?

523
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:48,531
It's all over the news,
all these people dead.

524
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,989
Fuckin' cracker shot Roland.

525
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,406
Might lose his leg.

526
00:31:52,408 --> 00:31:53,989
What happened?

527
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:56,073
A-Are you okay? You're hurt? You...

528
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:58,700
What? I'm fine, it's my partner's.

529
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:06,200
What happened out there?

530
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:10,533
I'm sure it'll be on the news.

531
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:13,865
I wanna see him.

532
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:16,198
- I wanna see my partner.
- No. No. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

533
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,950
He's sedated.

534
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:22,991
Just...

535
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,224
Sit down.

536
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:26,685
I don't wanna sit down.

537
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,788
You wanna go somewhere? Talk about it?

538
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,325
Talk about what?

539
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:40,865
You can't do anything here.

540
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:43,367
Let's go, get you cleaned up.

541
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:04,033
What's that you're wearin'?

542
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:09,033
That smell.

543
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,533
Ivory soap.

544
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:18,700
Chalk dust.

545
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:24,241
You wanna get outta here?

546
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,823
Wanna take a shower?

547
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:46,710
You want something to drink?

548
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:53,367
Are you hungry?

549
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:10,950
What are you doing?

550
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:03,950
Come over here.

551
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:02,742
There was a set of prints
in these files. They're gone.

552
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:09,657
Pretty old. Sure they were in there?

553
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:13,239
I put it there myself! Box
been sittin' there ten years!

554
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:15,075
I'm the one handed it over.

555
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:17,448
Don't know what to tell ya.

556
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,573
Shit gets misfiled all the time.

557
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:22,382
I'm tellin' you, this is
where they're supposed to be.

558
00:36:22,385 --> 00:36:24,425
We had a set of unknowns
taken from these toys...

559
00:36:24,428 --> 00:36:26,511
The unknowns aren't here anymore.

560
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,615
You got a log book? Anybody
looked at these since then?

561
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:36,156
Since 1980? Books only
go back a few years.

562
00:36:36,158 --> 00:36:38,075
Let me look at it anyway.

563
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:40,984
Go get 'em!

564
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,450
Harris. Got something here.

565
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:01,740
That looks like that boy's backpack.

566
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:04,659
From the all-points, the dead boy.

567
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,507
Motherfucker.

568
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,312
It's planted.

569
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:49,940
It's bullshit.

570
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:53,382
You get any sleep last night?

571
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:55,571
There was no real trial,
so nobody looked hard.

572
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:57,864
I know I didn't. But
there's no fuckin' way

573
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:01,265
that backpack was in that
crawlspace when that mortar went off.

574
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:03,143
It's pristine.

575
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:07,323
How long it take to process
the scene? Three days?

576
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:10,323
Plenty of time to put it there.

577
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:13,531
What about the shirt?
Why is it burnt up?

578
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:14,989
I thought on that.

579
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:18,073
They needed to sell
the girl was dead, see?

580
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:19,782
Somebody was movin' fast.

581
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:22,989
When that shootout happened,
somebody saw an opportunity.

582
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:26,114
And our side slammed
the fuckin' door shut.

583
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:29,090
What about Alan's people?

584
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:30,740
Why didn't they say anything?

585
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:34,948
State keeps puttin' off the
subpoena. They haven't seen it.

586
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,450
It's all bullshit.

587
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:39,656
What are we sayin'?

588
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:41,114
I don't know.

589
00:39:41,116 --> 00:39:42,865
Coulda been somebody sneak in overnight.

590
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:46,825
I'm just sayin', nobody was
compelled to look too hard.

591
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:56,617
I don't know what to
do with this right now.

592
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,101
We bring this to Blevins or Kent...

593
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:03,465
they shut us down for doin' the exact
opposite of what we're supposed to do.

594
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:06,156
Oh, come on, man. It's too big
for that political bullshit.

595
00:40:06,158 --> 00:40:08,323
It ain't bullshit to the Man.

596
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:11,659
You ever learned that, you wouldn't've
been on a desk last ten years.

597
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:20,784
Lieutenant West.

598
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,955
When was this?

599
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:30,948
All right.

600
00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:32,826
Bring it over. Yeah.

601
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,283
I'm serious about this,
Roland. This is huge.

602
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:51,323
That was Briggs.

603
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:54,989
Call came on the hotline last night.

604
00:40:54,991 --> 00:40:57,325
Says we need to hear it.

605
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,991

00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,948
they know you ain't lookin' for a cook.

625
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:40,239
You listenin' to me, little man?

626
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:42,281
I'm tryin' to help you out.

627
00:42:53,408 --> 00:42:56,448
Look here. Another stray.

628
00:43:04,242 --> 00:43:08,156
True, he's got flaws,

629
00:43:08,158 --> 00:43:10,531
but we'll hear him out.

630
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:14,288
You sure this is his place?

631
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,166
Yeah, I phoned.

632
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:19,033
Why?

633
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:22,950
He was always what you
call a people person.

634
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:27,573
Never saw him have any
use for the outdoors.

635
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:29,659
Let's go see.

636
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:34,281
Give me just a second.

637
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:45,114
When was the last time I saw him?

638
00:43:45,116 --> 00:43:47,033
I don't really know, Dad.

639
00:43:51,249 --> 00:43:55,541
Hey. Maybe now's not
the best time to do this.

640
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,825
Y'all in the right place.

641
00:44:02,415 --> 00:44:04,832
You're lookin' good, Purple.

642
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:07,823
Who's that old man with you?

643
00:44:10,535 --> 00:44:11,868
Yeah.

644
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:18,572
He might be a little
shaky, is all I'm sayin'.

645
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,575
Or he might think that, uh...

646
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:25,200
I don't know, he might
be a little shaky.

647
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:30,864
He don't remember the
last time he saw you.

648
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:33,533
He remember why I'm pissed at him?

649
00:44:35,241 --> 00:44:38,283
Mm-mm. I don't think so.

650
00:44:40,408 --> 00:44:42,239
Sir...

651
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:46,156
can I tell you... From experience...

652
00:44:46,158 --> 00:44:48,200
It doesn't do any good.

653
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:51,361
Well...

654
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:55,075
...maybe I forgot, too.

655
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,031
Where you keep your medals and whatnot?

656
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:15,365
The White River.

657
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:18,448
What about that picture with Clinton?

658
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,448
Mighta lined the kennel with it.

659
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,531
Thought you hated dogs.

660
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:25,659
My best friend's a dog.

661
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:31,615
Got pictures or somethin'?

662
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:33,937
Let me get a look at your kids.

663
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,274
Don't have no kids, man.

664
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:39,490
You and that woman.

665
00:45:39,492 --> 00:45:41,323
Uh...

666
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:44,406
Name escapes me. Uh...

667
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,617
y'all got married.

668
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:50,822
You're thinkin' of someone else.

669
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:53,156
You never got married?

670
00:45:53,158 --> 00:45:54,991
Not once?

671
00:45:56,075 --> 00:45:57,865
I'd'a...

672
00:45:57,867 --> 00:45:59,657
sworn you were married.

673
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:01,989
Well...

674
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:05,989
you don't talk to somebody for 24 years,

675
00:46:05,991 --> 00:46:08,659
you're gonna miss some shit.

676
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,325
Come on.

677
00:46:41,115 --> 00:46:42,530
Go on, have a seat.

678
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:08,281
State Police hotline.

679
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,448
Hello?

680
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,198
You're looking for me.

681
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,698
I saw on the television.

682
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,657
What's your name, ma'am?

683
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:22,031
I saw him on the television.

684
00:47:22,033 --> 00:47:26,365
Leave me alone. Make him leave me alone.

685
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:29,031
Ma'am, is this about Julie Purcell?

686
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:32,156
Do you have information
about Julie Purcell?

687
00:47:32,158 --> 00:47:35,073
That's not my real name.

688
00:47:35,075 --> 00:47:37,740
What is your name, ma'am?

689
00:47:37,742 --> 00:47:40,489
Tell him to leave me alone.

690
00:47:40,492 --> 00:47:42,406
I...

691
00:47:42,408 --> 00:47:43,948
I know what he did.

692
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,140
Who?

693
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:49,155
The man on TV acting like my father!

694
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:52,198
Can you tell me where
you're calling from?

695
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,907
Where's my brother? Will.

696
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:57,156
I don't know what he did with him.

697
00:47:57,158 --> 00:47:59,823
What who did with him, ma'am?

698
00:47:59,825 --> 00:48:02,031
We left him resting.

699
00:48:02,033 --> 00:48:04,156
What she sayin'?

700
00:48:04,158 --> 00:48:05,615
What's that mean?

701
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:07,948
Can you tell me where you are?

702
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,907
We can take care of you, ma'am.

703
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:11,865
No, you won't.

704
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:14,281
You work for them.

705
00:48:14,283 --> 00:48:17,573
Tell him to leave me alone! It...

706
00:48:19,617 --> 00:48:22,490
He took me, and I'm never coming back.

707
00:48:22,492 --> 00:48:25,156
Ma'am, can you stay on the line, please?

708
00:48:25,158 --> 00:48:26,820
Could you talk to me?

709
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:28,281
Just leave me alone!

710
00:48:29,749 --> 00:48:32,374
Ma'am. Hello?

711
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:36,033
Are you there?

712
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,523
What's she sayin'?

713
00:48:42,526 --> 00:48:44,156
I mean, that was her.

714
00:48:44,158 --> 00:48:46,158
Man, where is she?

715
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:51,991
Lieutenant West.

716
00:48:55,923 --> 00:48:57,423
Roland.

717
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:04,617
You talkin' to those TV people?

718
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:09,784
I hung up on 'em several times.

719
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:14,406
They're deep in it.

720
00:49:14,408 --> 00:49:17,573
Didn't want anything to come back on us.

721
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:19,533
"Anything"?

722
00:49:21,075 --> 00:49:23,700
Like... killin' a man?

723
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:28,073
Well, is it...

724
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:29,742
comin' back?

725
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,533
No, so far.

726
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,991
But that director
showed me some pictures.

727
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,989
Yep.

728
00:49:41,991 --> 00:49:45,448
Dan O'Brien's body was
found in a drained quarry...

729
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,700
southern Missouri.

730
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:51,700
They're onto somethin'
about Harris James.

731
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,948
How you gonna talk to these people...

732
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,657
we done what we done?

733
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:03,218
You don't know what you might say.

734
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:04,945
Or might remember.

735
00:50:06,366 --> 00:50:09,032
If I remember what we done,
I'll remember not to say.

736
00:50:12,918 --> 00:50:15,752
Other thing I found out. Me.

737
00:50:18,867 --> 00:50:21,740
That note sent to the parents,

738
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:24,281
letters cut out?

739
00:50:24,283 --> 00:50:28,365
Lucy wrote it. The mother.

740
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:30,114
Why?

741
00:50:30,116 --> 00:50:31,648
How you know that?

742
00:50:31,651 --> 00:50:33,649
Some things Ame quoted in the book.

743
00:50:33,652 --> 00:50:36,443
Things the mother said.
I'll show you. They line up.

744
00:50:39,282 --> 00:50:41,988
Why would she do that?

745
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:43,460
I think...

746
00:50:43,463 --> 00:50:47,251
You look at the note,
what it's sayin'...

747
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:51,155
think she was tryin'
to make Tom feel better.

748
00:50:51,158 --> 00:50:53,573
Tryin' to get him to let go.

749
00:50:53,575 --> 00:50:56,782
'Cause she already had, way before.

750
00:50:56,784 --> 00:51:00,114
Ah, so what? So what if she did?

751
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:02,825
We already knew she had
some connection to...

752
00:51:04,947 --> 00:51:07,489
...that guy whose name you just said.

753
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,825
He came to see me.

754
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:16,657
Day after what happened.

755
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:18,156
Hoyt.

756
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,492
What?

757
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:25,989
You never told me that.

758
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:28,615
I made a decision.

759
00:51:28,617 --> 00:51:31,093
Yeah. Had other things to think about.

760
00:51:31,096 --> 00:51:33,219
Includin' a family.

761
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:34,988
I let it go.

762
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:36,659
What'd you get from him?

763
00:51:37,991 --> 00:51:40,116
Nothin', I think.

764
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,238
He knew about what we done.

765
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:50,450
Seemed like he was in the
dark on some stuff, too.

766
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:54,492
I can't, uh...

767
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,231
I... really can't remember.

768
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:06,241
Passed away some years back.

769
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,667
You walked away.

770
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,825
Not this time.

771
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:21,659
This what you come to see me about?

772
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:24,448
Twenty-five years.

773
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,575
What, you doin' old man fantasy camp?

774
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:30,948
You think you...

775
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,323
Think you can just roll up here

776
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:35,490
and I'll be all, "Golly gee, partner!

777
00:52:35,492 --> 00:52:37,906
Let's grab our junior
detective clue-finders

778
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:39,563
and have an adventure!"

779
00:52:51,283 --> 00:52:52,784
You...

780
00:52:55,575 --> 00:52:57,073
You know, '80?

781
00:52:57,075 --> 00:52:59,073
We stopped bein' partners.

782
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,406
You get married.

783
00:53:00,408 --> 00:53:03,116
It's natural for people to drift apart.

784
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:08,241
This right now? This ain't that.

785
00:53:10,158 --> 00:53:12,365
All this time.

786
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:15,198
You never picked up the phone.

787
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,323
Never dropped by for a beer.

788
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:20,782
Never said you're fuckin' sorry once.

789
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:22,073
Roland...

790
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,948
And I was gonna put that shit aside.

791
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,198
Have a drink with ya.

792
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,573
Reminisce.

793
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:34,114
Maybe just watch the dogs play
and the sun go fuckin' down.

794
00:53:34,116 --> 00:53:36,116
But look what you're doin'.

795
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:39,323
How many of those you go through a week?

796
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:41,239
Hey, fuck you, man!

797
00:53:41,241 --> 00:53:44,823
I'm fine...

798
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:46,617
alone out here.

799
00:53:49,957 --> 00:53:52,749
No woman. No kids.

800
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,283
And no old friends.

801
00:54:00,033 --> 00:54:03,991
So that means I get to drink
exactly as much as I want to!

802
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:08,666
You don't judge me, motherfucker!

803
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:12,238
I know you.

804
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:14,180
I know what you did.

805
00:54:14,183 --> 00:54:15,933
What I did.

806
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:19,155
You talkin' 'bout my drinkin'?

807
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:21,950
I'd whip your ass if
it wouldn't kill ya.

808
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:27,534
And you still ain't apologized,

809
00:54:27,537 --> 00:54:29,245
Roland.

810
00:54:31,283 --> 00:54:33,158
I don't remember.

811
00:54:35,325 --> 00:54:36,700
I'm sorry.

812
00:54:38,832 --> 00:54:41,791
I'm sorry, but I just can't remember.

813
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,367
I don't... I...

814
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,200
I, uh, I can't...

815
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,200
Can't remember my life, man.

816
00:54:55,575 --> 00:54:58,367
I can't remember my wife...

817
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:03,823
I-I don't know.

818
00:55:03,825 --> 00:55:06,198
If you tell me I...

819
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:11,172
I did something wrong,
well, okay. I'm sorry.

820
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,406
It's all right.

821
00:55:12,408 --> 00:55:14,158
I'm sorry.

822
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:18,698
Uh...

823
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,865
I-I got this, uh...

824
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:24,156
this file I'm workin' on,

825
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:27,200
and, uh, I read it every mornin'.

826
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,110
And, uh...

827
00:55:30,113 --> 00:55:32,408
But I'm missin' so much.

828
00:55:37,575 --> 00:55:40,448
But you remember some stuff.

829
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,573
I mean...

830
00:55:42,575 --> 00:55:45,239
you know me, right?

831
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:48,700
Nah, it's... other things.

832
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:53,344
Hey, look.

833
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:57,000
You need help killin' time,

834
00:55:57,003 --> 00:55:58,504
I'm your man.

835
00:56:00,075 --> 00:56:03,239
I come up with ways to kill time

836
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:06,114
ain't nobody ever thought of.

837
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:08,219
You wanna drink? Talk?

838
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:14,391
Watch a ball game?

839
00:56:14,394 --> 00:56:17,364
I'm right here.

840
00:56:17,367 --> 00:56:20,950
But I don't want to dip so
much as a toe back in that shit.

841
00:56:24,116 --> 00:56:25,922
She still be out there.

842
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,447
Ohh, don't give me that.

843
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,325
Half the cases you ever
worked never closed.

844
00:56:33,784 --> 00:56:36,156
You quit the job.

845
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:37,448
I was there.

846
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,031
There were other
considerations at the time.

847
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:43,304
I just, uh...

848
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:45,347
between me and Ame.

849
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:49,906
And before I'm a...

850
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:52,114
droolin' fuckin' squash plant,

851
00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:54,406
and with whatever brains I got left,

852
00:56:54,408 --> 00:56:56,657
I'm gonna finish this.

853
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:02,531
No.

854
00:57:02,533 --> 00:57:04,124
Yes.

855
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:05,791
No.

856
00:57:05,794 --> 00:57:07,128
Oh, yes.

857
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,116
No, man.

858
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,450
Come on.

859
00:57:16,742 --> 00:57:18,991
Stir some shit up with me.

860
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,031
How is it your son
don't have you locked up?

861
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:31,101
He don't know how fucked up I am.

862
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:32,977
Hmm.

863
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,155
Well, I got bad news.

864
00:57:36,158 --> 00:57:39,657
Your condition's worse than you think.

865
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:42,304
You imagine two old
motherfuckers like us

866
00:57:42,307 --> 00:57:45,057
doin' anything other
than pissin' our pants?

867
00:57:47,116 --> 00:57:48,573
Come on.

868
00:57:48,575 --> 00:57:51,991
This is some sad... senile shit.

869
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:54,575
Hmm.

870
00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:00,490
Seventy-year-old black man...

871
00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:02,865
goin' batshit crazy, runnin' around

872
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:05,325
with a badge and gun.

873
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:08,575
You shouldn't miss that.

874
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:15,367
Well, I could use a laugh.

875
