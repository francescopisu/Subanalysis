2
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,300
It's just like the paperwork
says. Read the report.

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,560
Our feeling is that the prosecution

4
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,840
didn't make a full accounting
or mount a suitable case.

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,940
So we have to do that now...

6
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,800
get the full accountin'.

7
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,900
_

8
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,940
_

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,300
Around the end of the first
week, family got the note.

10
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,279
Envelope's handwritten,

11
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,220
so this isn't a brainiac.

12
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,780
Processing stamp's from a
post office in Farmington...

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,340
that could have been
dropped in any mailbox.

14
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,670
We're puttin' men out there to canvass.

15
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,420
You see this?

16
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,340
Twiggs said they've been

17
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,020
fielding calls from Martians all day.

18
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,300
What's the Ozark Children's Outreach?

19
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,000
Some charity.

20
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,320
You think it's true?

21
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,140
Girl's alive?

22
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,170
I think she is.

23
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,580
What were you focusing on prior?

24
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,170
Neighborhood surveillance.
Like it says in the report.

25
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,250
Right, yeah. Uh...

26
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,920
"All day." Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,420
But you guys didn't get to the
house till after everybody else.

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,980
I mean, you'd have got there first

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,140
if you were in the
neighborhood, wouldn't you?

30
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,200
Well, mighta taken the call late, or...

31
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,300
I'm a little fuzzy.

32
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,140
Wayne probably has a better memory.

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,820
The picture doesn't show anything new.

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,779
Nothing that suggests a blackout,

35
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,300
and that's good.

36
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,800
Since your CT scan looks clean,

37
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,460
I think the concern
right now is the need

38
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,460
to adjust your lifestyle
to what's happening.

39
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,750
I wasn't...

40
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,680
He explained it wrong.

41
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,250
Didn't drive in my sleep
or any kind of "state."

42
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,640
I mean...

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,900
at the time, I...

44
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,600
I believe I-I did know what I was doin'.

45
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,740
It's only I forgot later.

46
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,199
We're just gonna have to
do some things differently.

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,400
OK, Dad?

48
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,170
I went up there for a reason.
I just can't remember.

49
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,800
It's not like I'm losin' it.

50
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,360
Do you remember the rest
of dinner at my place?

51
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,500
Remember me driving you home?

52
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,140
Yeah.

53
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,320
Heather drove you home.

54
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,000
Now we're playing "gotcha."

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,660
Mr. Hays, your son loves you.

56
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,400
Our only concern is for your well-being.

57
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,590
I know my son loves me, Doctor.

58
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,120
But thanks for walking me through that.

59
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,590
The place you found yourself.

60
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,140
Do you know why you might
have wanted to go there?

61
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,540
Does it have any significance?

62
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,900
Yeah. It did.

63
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,980
He did a couple
interviews for this show.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Been talkin' about an old
case took place out there.

65
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,680
- What, you rattin' on me?
- What, are you workin' a case?

66
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,080
It was never fully solved.

67
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,170
People don't remember being babies...

68
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,540
it's good we get to revisit
this stage at the end.

69
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,740
Mr. Hays, believe me,

70
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,380
I can understand your
frustration with the disease.

71
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,750
A disease you can't even say what it is.

72
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,550
We can say what it almost certainly is.

73
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,640
I told you.

74
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,580
You try puttin' me in a
home, I'll off myself.

75
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,000
Put it out your head.

76
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Don't you want to know?

77
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,340
You do.

78
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,820
And she needs help, doesn't she?

79
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,160
Julie.

80
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,550
Yeah.

81
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,380
You know, it was just a
case when I caught it.

82
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,000
I didn't know it'd be my last.

83
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,550
You with the book these last years...

84
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,170
I feel like I'm...

85
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,000
tired of this thing being in our lives.

86
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,380
Like when we met.

87
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,600
I mean, Saturday night,
your mom's got the kids...

88
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,420
got this thing sittin' between us.

89
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,680
So what do you want to do?

90
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,050
I don't know.

91
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,700
There was a motel back there.

92
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,960
We could just drink and
have sex all night.

93
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,800
Boy, that'd be great.

94
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,640
Alan said so far they have
her prints on the counter

95
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,840
and some shelves in the main area.

96
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,250
Were there any behind the pharmacy?

97
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,100
He didn't know. Sallisaw PD's got it.

98
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,060
Shouldn't you talk to them?

99
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,130
May come back on me.

100
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,670
It's not like if they check,
someone's gonna have my back.

101
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,700
What if I talk to them?

102
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,840
Sallisaw.

103
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,380
An author with a book about the case.

104
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,460
I have galleys, I'm legitimate,

105
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,140
I bet I could get 'em to share with me.

106
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,250
- I doubt it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

107
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,340
I'll get done up,

108
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,800
bookish but sexy,

109
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,660
intimidated by those big, tough cops.

110
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,740
This is, like...

111
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,660
Afro Hart to Hart? That it?

112
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,710
Come on.

113
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,919
Wanna use the pay phone,

114
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,320
we're here? Check on the kids?

115
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,460
Why don't I call from the motel?

116
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
We need to walk it back.

117
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,560
Re-examine it all.

118
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,280
It's like a thing's staring right at us.

119
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,550
Got that feelin' myself.

120
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,279
The Purcells.

121
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,959
Said they were gonna play
with their neighbor,

122
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,960
- the Boyle kid.
- Yeah?

123
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,760
But he said they didn't have any plans.

124
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,520
Why would the Purcell kids lie
about meeting the Boyle kid?

125
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,420
What were they up to?

126
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
What were they really doin'?

127
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Back to the kids.

128
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,540
Talk to the parents again,

129
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,240
the Boyle kid, any others knew 'em.

130
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,800
Go back through the house again, right?

131
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,360
Yeah, right on.

132
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,400
That's good, man.

133
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,560
Get that teacher to help with the kids.

134
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,120
Wayne had the idea them
kids would tell him stories.

135
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
And he was correct.

136
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,170
Y'all fucked a good detective there.

137
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,340
You know that, right?

138
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,050
I wouldn't argue with you.

139
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,639
But it wasn't me.

140
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,379
Probably didn't even
give you shit for it

141
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,999
when you saw him, huh?

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,760
I can't say he did, no.

143
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,920
Purple Hays. My man.

144
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,460
Tried to get him transferred
over here twice, ya know?

145
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,300
Blocked both times by
the major's office.

146
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,420
Told me not to ask again.

147
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,620
Feels like we should stay on point.

148
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,960
I'm makin' a point, son.

149
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,210
You played with Will
and Julie a lot, huh?

150
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,560
Not really. I mean,

151
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,940
I hung out with Will at school a little.

152
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,040
But y'all hung out after school.

153
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,660
His dad said y'all played after school.

154
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,620
No, sir. We didn't play much.

155
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,280
I mean, I told him he
could come over sometime

156
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,579
to see the new puppy, but that's it.

157
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,259
He's home after school.

158
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,479
Or at basketball now.

159
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,940
He don't go out playin' much.

160
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,999
You said they played a lot...

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that neighbor, Ronnie Boyle?

162
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,880
Yeah, well...

163
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,090
three, four times a week.

164
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,700
They're best friends.

165
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,220
Did Ronnie ever come
over here to the house?

166
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,960
Did you ever see him when
the kids get together?

167
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,300
Um, no...

168
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,420
I guess not.

169
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,960
I mean, I know him and
his parents from school.

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,090
And they'd go over to his place.

171
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,700
Well, actually, looks like they
didn't really play together.

172
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,320
What is this...

173
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,800
What's this mean?

174
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,460
Why aren't you out
there lookin' for her?

175
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,620
That's where she is.
Out there. She's alive.

176
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,320
The letter said she's out there.

177
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,460
Feds are runnin' a wide
search, Mr. Purcell,

178
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,460
and they have a lot more manpower.

179
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,600
We're just trying to focus
on what's personal.

180
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,630
Would you folks be all right

181
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,880
if we started going back
through some of their things?

182
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,519
We're afraid now we...

183
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,460
we mighta overlooked somethin'.

184
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,540
What?

185
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,380
We just don't know, ma'am.

186
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,660
_

187
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,160
_

188
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,200
_

189
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,880
We'll process this stuff

190
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,750
and get it back to ya.

191
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,500
Don't lose it, OK?

192
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
We won't.

193
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,880
Say, one of you used
to work at Hoyt Foods?

194
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,210
Yeah, I did.

195
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,500
On the chicken line.

196
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,140
Quit a year or two ago.

197
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,840
Make better money in
tips at the Sawhorse.

198
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,020
Why?

199
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Just asking.

200
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,880
Thank you, now.

201
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,119
So Wayne opened up that the kids

202
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,440
weren't doin' what they said they were.

203
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,359
With that big reward,

204
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
brought everybody out the woodwork.

205
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,210
You see Wayne much anymore?

206
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,050
Not at all, really.

207
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,480
And I don't know why.

208
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,940
No hard feelin's, though?

209
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,170
Not between him and me.

210
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,750
We were good friends, as I see it.

211
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,850
I think it was...

212
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,600
once we stopped workin' together,

213
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,380
we just stopped.

214
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,740
Sometimes it's like that with people.

215
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,750
Dad, can I get a Transformer?

216
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,960
No.

217
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,280
Can we get something from the toys, Dad?

218
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,210
- If it's cheap?
- No.

219
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,920
Where the hell's the charcoal?

220
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,080
- How about if it's only a dollar?
- No.

221
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,170
Stores aren't supposed to be this big.

222
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,600
Can we at least go look at the toys?

223
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,500
No. You guys have to stay with me.

224
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,880
So we're tryin' to update
the book, if possible.

225
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,720
Hearing about her prints
at the drugstore,

226
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,340
it's very significant.

227
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,880
How'd you hear about that?

228
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,670
My ex-husband.

229
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,580
He's a cop in Arkansas.

230
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,440
Always had a thing for cops, I guess.

231
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,260
We got a few partials
and a lot of fulls.

232
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,300
We verified it with the state crime lab.

233
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,960
It's definitely a match.

234
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,420
Were any of her prints
found behind the pharmacy?

235
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,899
No.

236
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,740
But we didn't get to keep
workin' the scene, neither.

237
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,800
End of the day,

238
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,500
store just wanted to
get back to business.

239
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,779
So hers were just the shelves.

240
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,279
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,100
We only focused on the robbery,
and that was months ago.

242
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,210
I'm about to clock out.

243
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,060
You wanna grab a bite? We
can talk more about it?

244
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,710
All right.

245
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,700
Hey... I think we're done.

246
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,460
That was awful, right?

247
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,380
Since you guys were so good,
I'll let you get one thing.

248
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,590
- Yes!
- Feel better, sad guy?

249
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,000
Where's your sister?

250
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,160
She was right behind me. I don't know.

251
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,840
Come on.

252
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,460
Becca!

253
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,800
Becca!

254
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,750
Becca!

255
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,800
Becca! Becca!

256
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,179
Becca! Becca!

257
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,839
... please come to customer service.

258
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,300
Look for the nearest
Wal-Mart representative

259
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,940
and ask them to bring you
to customer service.

260
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,099
- Rebecca Hays.
- It's been ten minutes.

261
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,000
Need to lock down the store.

262
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,940
- Shut all the doors, nobody in or out.
- Uh...

263
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,000
Listen to me. I'm a cop. State Police.

264
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,899
Lock down the store now.

265
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,340
I'll make an announcement,
give me the mic.

266
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,659
Sir, I don't think that you...

267
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,160
- Give me the mic!
- Hi.

268
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,680
- Where were you?
- I don't know.

269
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,500
They were giving out chips in one place,

270
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,020
and I stopped to eat some,
and y'all were gone.

271
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,140
Goddamnit, you can't
do that! You hear me?!

272
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,880
Don't fuckin' do that, Rebecca!

273
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,800
Oh...

274
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,340
OK. OK.

275
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,420
Let's go. Let's just go home.

276
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,590
We were happy to help.

277
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,300
Especially once we heard she
was a former employee of ours.

278
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,380
Just, it led to a lot of false tips.

279
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,750
You know, it's better to
coordinate this kind of thing

280
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,320
between our offices.

281
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,090
But we did.

282
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,760
The board cleared it with the
county prosecutor's office.

283
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,400
I don't see any pictures of y'all
puttin' up rewards for anybody.

284
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,160
Up till now, we've
tended to help families

285
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,590
with children that needed
medical treatment.

286
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,110
But with it all over the
news, and knowing the mother

287
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,420
used to be in our family of workers,

288
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
the board voted to contribute.

289
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,460
When did this outreach start?

290
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,160
Mr. Hoyt endowed the foundation

291
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,000
after they lost their granddaughter
a couple of years ago.

292
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,560
Mother worked on the chicken
line. Where's that building?

293
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,460
Uh, let's see...

294
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,800
it would be one of...

295
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,380
those two.

296
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,820
You know what would help?

297
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,380
Names and dates of hire

298
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,670
for every employee that
works at this plant.

299
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,800
That's nearly 700 people.

300
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,320
Faster we get 'em back, the better.

301
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,660
All right. Sure. Of course.

302
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,670
We'll start getting it
together right now.

303
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,360
And the big man... Mr.
Hoyt... he ever here?

304
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,499
Well, hardly, no.

305
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,300
Mr. Hoyt's been in Africa
since mid-October.

306
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,550
- Safari.
- Oh, yeah?

307
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,300
My partner's a bit of a hunter himself.

308
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,640
_

309
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,520
State PD. Task Force.

310
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,280
Uh-huh.

311
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,420
The girl's bein' held at a
snake farm in Huntsville?

312
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,420
And how do you know this, ma'am?

313
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,460
Listen, we closed right now,

314
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,740
but do me a favor-call
back in the mornin'.

315
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,050
This number,

316
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,340
and ask for Agents Bowen or Diller.

317
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
FBI.

318
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,180
Tell 'em what you're tellin' me.

319
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,170
All right, now.

320
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,480
Lady seen Julie Purcell in a dream.

321
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
She say her dreams always come true.

322
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,900
All this stuff's about that game.

323
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,630
Couldn't find his dice, but...

324
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm not seein' anything.

325
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,420
Except he played a lot...

326
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,710
and them other kids didn't
play with him, huh?

327
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,119
_

328
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,220
Who gave Julie the doll,
met 'em in the woods?

329
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,200
Who played the game with Will?

330
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,820
Where'd they go after school?

331
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,460
They were meant to be
with that neighbor.

332
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,820
So what was your next move?

333
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,630
Shut down the park,
except for search parties.

334
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,960
They were still doin' 'em every day.

335
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,840
Mostly volunteer.

336
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,590
State park's about 2500 acres.

337
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,100
So, how does it work?

338
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,250
Spot patterns.

339
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,460
Disturbance, flattening.

340
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,100
It's there, you just
have to look for it.

341
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,050
Bent grass, compressed ground.

342
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,600
You tracked men in the war?

343
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,710
I did.

344
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,420
Did you march?

345
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,550
I did.

346
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,630
Funny how the protests stopped
once the draft ended.

347
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,960
Hey, that, uh, poem you were teaching...

348
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,340
Yeah. You had some thoughts about it?

349
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,920
He says you call the story Time.

350
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,800
But you can't say its name.

351
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,420
Why is that?

352
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,750
I think it's because

353
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,760
we're in time... and of time...

354
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,130
but to name...

355
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,340
You separate yourself from
something when you name it,

356
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,260
and I think he means we can't
be separated from time.

357
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,180
Oh.

358
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,670
I thought he meant it was
like the name of God.

359
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,200
You know, how the Hebrews weren't
supposed to say God's name.

360
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,170
Oh.

361
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,550
Think maybe we should
have dinner sometime?

362
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,820
- Hey.
- Hi.

363
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,050
Those Sallisaw boys couldn't
stop tellin' me stuff.

364
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,130
I was pretty tremendous.

365
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,420
I think I have a future at this.

366
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:33,210
- You're reading it! Finally.
- Not really.

367
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,080
Keep seeing my name.

368
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,260
Are you drunk?

369
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,420
No, I'm...

370
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,900
I had a drink at dinner.

371
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,899
This detective took me out to eat.

372
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,040
- Oh, terrific.
- No, actually,

373
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,170
I got a lot of info from him.

374
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,559
Listen, her fingerprints were found

375
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,700
just on the shelves in
the cosmetics aisle.

376
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,020
Looks like she was probably a customer.

377
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,560
They had the prior week's
surveillance footage,

378
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,550
I think they're gonna let
me take a look at it.

379
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,160
I didn't get any of the shit you want.

380
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,340
At Wal-Mart.

381
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,800
OK.

382
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,920
Did something happen?

383
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,340
- Are the kids all right?
- The kids are fine.

384
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,660
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

385
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,130
But one thing. One favor.

386
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,650
Do not come bouncin' in
here, half in the bag,

387
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,920
all giddy about this shit.

388
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,380
Can you do that?

389
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,150
Can you summon the mental resolve

390
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,300
to shut up about this shit with me?

391
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,540
If you feel this way, you don't
have to talk to me like that.

392
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,200
- You could just tell me.
- You've been told.

393
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,859
Why don't you go check on your kids

394
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,640
since you haven't seen 'em all day.

395
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,619
- They're supposed to be in bed.
- Fuck off.

396
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,379
I'm with them five times
the amount you are

397
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,209
for a job that treats you like shit.

398
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,660
I don't really feel like tradin'
curses. I said my piece.

399
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,550
I'm not gonna stop, Wayne.

400
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,630
Patrol's got the scene.
Forensics is on the way.

401
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,500
That's where the boy died.

402
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,800
Somebody carried him to the cave.

403
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,710
The office checked the field reports.

404
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,050
Nobody talked to this guy.

405
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:19,040
And the farm road's not on our maps.

406
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,960
I already talked to your people.

407
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,300
Man came here the next day.

408
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,520
What man?

409
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,550
Was he police? Sheriff's?

410
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,210
Man in a suit. Showed me a badge.

411
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,480
Asked me about those missin' kids,

412
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,520
if I'd seen anything.

413
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,860
Can you describe him?

414
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,660
A normal guy. White. A suit.

415
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,820
Showed me a badge.

416
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,780
What'd you tell him?
Did you see anything?

417
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,060
I told him I seen those kids 'fore.

418
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,630
Two or three times. They come
down my road and into the woods.

419
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,780
Couple afternoons I seen 'em.

420
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,820
- You see anybody else?
- Yeah.

421
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,080
Told him I seen a car out
here a couple times.

422
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,460
Nice one. Brown. Man and woman.

423
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,170
Uh, but it... but it
wasn't the same day.

424
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,170
What'd they look like?
The man and woman.

425
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,820
Like y'all.

426
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,840
Black and white.

427
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,960
Man was Negro.

428
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,220
I couldn't see faces.

429
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,170
Now, most times,

430
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,660
you gotta be lookin' for our place...

431
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,840
but sometimes people come out here.

432
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,000
Sir?

433
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,540
You mind we search your property?

434
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,260
Yes, sir, I mind.

435
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,480
Don't you need a warrant
for somethin' like that?

436
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,840
If you make us get one.

437
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,720
I think you'll have to, son.

438
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,600
Can I ask...

439
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,260
do you feel there was sufficient
coverage of the neighborhood

440
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,300
during the canvassing?

441
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,000
Yes, I do.

442
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,640
We brought whatever we had.

443
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,000
General rule is, you start
close, then work your way out.

444
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,820
Did officers conduct multiple interviews

445
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,080
- with all potential witnesses?
- Yes. Mm-hmm.

446
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,720
And, uh, I feel like, honestly,

447
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,080
everyone was givin' everything they had.

448
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,279
Well, we have people who say

449
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,160
they were never
questioned by the police,

450
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,900
although they remember the
officers going door to door.

451
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,320
Hmm.

452
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,750
I don't know.

453
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,250
If anyone got overlooked,
it was a mistake.

454
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,720
We had over a hundred law
enforcement officers out there.

455
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,660
Some residents did get talked
to three or four times.

456
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,780
But nobody spoke to these people.

457
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,820
And we found two who both
separately claim to have witnessed

458
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,520
a very nice brown sedan driving
around the neighborhoods,

459
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,880
and later, away from Devil's
Den on the day of the murder.

460
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,750
Brown sedan?

461
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,040
A witness said police
talked to him once,

462
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,750
and he told them about the
car, but they never came back.

463
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,670
And there's no mention of the
sedan in the field reports.

464
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,240
Another said police
never took a statement,

465
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,530
but they both noticed the car
because it was new and upscale,

466
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,460
and that was unusual for the area.

467
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,800
And that the vehicle
kept driving around.

468
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,540
Treads.

469
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,120
I remember. Treads.

470
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,400
Another former resident, Charles Snyder,

471
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,550
said two weeks before, he reported
that his boy and a friend

472
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,560
had told of a black man
with a scar, in a suit,

473
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,680
at the cul-de-sac where the
kids played near Devil's Den.

474
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,920
No one ever came back to question him.

475
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,680
None of this is mentioned
in the official reports.

476
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,620
This alone, don't you think,
points to serious flaws

477
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,960
in the investigation from the beginning?

478
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,880
What's goin' on?

479
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,460
Really.

480
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,500
You have some new evidence?

481
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,160
Are you lookin' for Julie?
You find somethin'?

482
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,500
- That's enough for today.
- No, I'm all right.

483
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,479
- I think we're doing well.
- I'm sure you do.

484
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,050
You see his distress?
This man is ill, Elisa.

485
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,580
- Henry...
- That is enough.

486
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,680
For today.

487
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,680
Over there.

488
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,920
Other side of the tree line.

489
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,980
It's hard to find. Kinda hidden.

490
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,800
That's where they played.

491
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,600
We need to process these toys.

492
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,160
Can bag the toys, but we need
pictures to show the parents.

493
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,670
Hey.

494
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,940
Get up.

495
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,420
What's goin' on?

496
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,840
What are you doin',
skulking around here?

497
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,200
Wha...

498
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,750
We got kids playin' out here,

499
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,200
and we don't need you
lurkin' around 'em.

500
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,880
My kids and two others say you
keep comin' around that field

501
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,140
where they all play.

502
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,380
What are you comin' around the kids for?

503
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,300
I'm not.

504
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,960
I don't.

505
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,579
- I have kids.
- No, you don't.

506
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,900
And we don't want you around, ya hear?

507
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,799
I live here! I have rights!

508
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,130
I fought for your fuckin'
rights, you asshole...

509
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,440
You're a goddamn bum.

510
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,060
You stay away from these kids.

511
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,800
And stay out of our neighborhood!

512
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,760
You hear me now, boy?

513
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,040
You don't come around here no more.

514
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,880
We don't see you,

515
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,900
and God help you if you talk
to another child out here.

516
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,060
Get the fuck outta here!

517
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,880
So how's life in charge?

518
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,250
Ahh.

519
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,630
It's got its good and bad.

520
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,590
You talked to 'em? Alan's firm?

521
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,400
Yeah, they approached me.

522
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,250
The guy's kids hired them, he said.

523
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,360
But you support it?

524
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,100
Reopenin' it?

525
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,380
They tell you about the fingerprints?

526
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,800
Yeah.

527
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,590
You have any idea what that means to me?

528
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,670
I have to imagine.

529
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,440
But yes, sir.

530
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,160
You know, I...

531
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,880
I think of Lucy.

532
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,090
I wish she was still
around to hear this.

533
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,480
Two years ago now.

534
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,840
Alan had her file.

535
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,920
I had the body brought back from Vegas.

536
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,670
What about you?

537
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,750
How you doin' with all this now?

538
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,550
I'm still sober.

539
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,660
Five years.

540
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,800
I know.

541
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,670
I'm proud of you, man.

542
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,000
So, uh... I got my Higher Power,

543
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,420
and he's putting this
in front of me now.

544
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,500
Cream and extra sugar still?

545
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,060
Yes, sir. Like a dessert.

546
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,500
How about the other one?

547
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,500
Your partner. He still around?

548
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,040
He's on the job.

549
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,960
Hasn't been in major
crimes in a long time.

550
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,500
Anyways, yeah, me and him...

551
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,200
kinda lost touch.

552
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,560
You didn't have to check
on me, Lieutenant West.

553
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:34,210
You've done more for me
than just about anybody.

554
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,960
Pulled me out of that
hole five years ago.

555
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,560
Nah.

556
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,760
You done good.

557
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,880
Can I ask you for somethin'?

558
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,400
You can ask.

559
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,320
Would you pray with me?

560
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,250
God...

561
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,260
save me from anger.

562
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:22,300
God... save me from resentment.

563
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,220
God, save me from my
judgments and prophecies,

564
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,440
my... my need to control.

565
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,840
I have known You by the
hawk and the dove...

566
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,500
and I live at your infinite compassion.

567
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,800
Lord,

568
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,280
guard what I hold dear,

569
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,550
and let me never hold too dearly

570
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,840
anything of this world.

571
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,090
Amen.

572
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,250
Brown sedan.

573
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,960
Farmer talked about a...

574
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,250
brown sedan...

575
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,880
'80..

576
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,050
We knew.

577
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,880
Was that who... they played with?

578
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,050
Hmm.

579
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,840
She wrote a bit about how
the games we found...

580
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,420
got people worried that
kids were gettin' killed

581
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,130
playin' this stuff...

582
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,250
or something...

583
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,250
Henry was, uh,

584
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,440
five or six, I think,
when she started writing.

585
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,300
Becca would have been...

586
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,020
three or four.

587
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,100
Scientists now theorize

588
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,170
an infinite number of
dimensions outside our own.

589
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,860
Einstein said past, present, and future

590
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,720
are all a stubbornly
persistent illusion.

591
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,590
Ohh... Oh, God.

592
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,300
And are you waking up to that illusion?

593
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,880
Now, while things fall apart,

594
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,960
are you starting to see them clearly?

595
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,000
And at the end of all things...

596
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,860
are you awakening to what you withheld?

597
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:50,750
Did you confuse reacting with feeling?

598
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,900
Did you mistake compulsion for freedom?

599
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,710
Please, not... not like this.

600
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,640
And even so...

601
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,820
did you harden your heart
against what loved you most?

602
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,170
Not like this.

603
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,090
Not like this.

604
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,880
Oh, sweetheart.

605
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,020
Did you think you could just go on

606
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,750
and never once have to look back?

607
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,640
Please, I... I don't deserve this. I...

608
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,340
Whatever's happening,
I-I don't deserve this.

609
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,760
No, you don't.

610
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,050
But it's happening anyway.

611
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,590
I'm so sorry.

612
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,670
Where is it? I...

613
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,940
How much... do I have to lose?

614
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,880
Everything.

615
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,940
Same as everybody else.

616
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,460
I lost Becca.

617
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,600
No, you didn't.

618
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,980
Not the way you think.

619
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,660
You're worried what they'll find.

620
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,630
What you left in the woods.

621
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,680
Finish it.

622
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,340
Got a message. The lieutenant
wanted to meet you.

623
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,550
Movin' up in the world.

624
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,300
No. I don't recognize 'em.

625
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,840
I think. I mean...

626
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,760
I know I didn't buy any of these.

627
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,980
Ma'am?

628
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,460
I don't think so.

629
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,660
I don't really remember.

630
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,780
I'm the one bought 'em toys.

631
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,880
I don't recognize any of those.

632
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,560
This about the reward?

633
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,210
Someone called us.

634
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,340
What's it have to do with?

635
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,300
Where'd you find these?

636
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:58,170
Looks like the kids had this kinda...

637
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,880
play area hidden out in the forest.

638
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,840
Found these toys there.

639
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,960
They could be anybody's.

640
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,090
Had the kids' prints on 'em.

641
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,670
Another set of prints we can't ID.

642
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,780
And more of those straw dolls.

643
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,280
They were meetin' somebody?

644
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,760
Like some adult?

645
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,090
Maybe. Yes, sir.

646
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,600
What are these?

647
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,200
We haven't seen this.

648
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,710
It's an old baby album.

649
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,780
He brought it out. I...

650
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,860
I can't look at it.

651
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,520
Roland?

652
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,100
It's the same.

653
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,660
What's this one from?

654
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:34,800
That's Will's first communion.

655
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,670
He was ten.

656
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:42,960
What?

657
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,660

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,800
or did it come with the pigmentation?

681
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:38,380
I think, unlike some others,
I lacked a big fuckin' mouth.

682
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,239
Hell, with affirmative action,

683
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,840
you coulda been my boss by now.

684
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,210
Guess if I'd been clumsy
enough to get shot,

685
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,420
I'd be playing golf most days

00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,800
