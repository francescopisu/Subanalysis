How'd a water stain get there?

37
00:01:52,624 --> 00:01:55,726
It rained maybe twice
this last year.

38
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:59,230
It's like everything's
papier-mÃ¢ché.

39
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:04,936
Stop thinking.

40
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,272
I don't like being on a ledge.

41
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:11,475
Nobody gets rich
on their own money.

42
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:14,712
I never really knew
what to do with it.

43
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:18,282
Money.

44
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,919
<i>I see that about myself.</i>

45
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:28,926
You always said
you want lots of land.

46
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,228
Yes,

47
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:33,596
but you need children
to leave it to.

48
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,467
It's never really yours.

49
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:38,936
You don't take it with you.

50
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,638
<i>You don't take
anything with you.</i>

51
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,308
Just yourself,
whatever that was.

52
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:49,479
I've worked my whole
life, same as you.

53
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:53,149
And not being poor is
better than the opposite.

54
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,823
My old man back in Chicago,

55
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:03,960
when I was a kid...

56
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,263
he used to lock me in the basement
when he'd go on a bender.

57
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,666
Usually last the night.

58
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:12,902
Let me out the next day.

59
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,436
Thought he was keeping
me safe, I guess.

60
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,941
This one time, I was six...

61
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:23,678
he puts me down there

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,381
and I wake up

63
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:29,184
and it's locked.

64
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:31,552
It had happened before.

65
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:36,624
Anyways, I guess
he ended up arrested.

66
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:37,825
I guess.

67
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:39,527
God, baby.

68
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:42,096
Well...

69
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,331
by the second morning...

70
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,734
I was out of food.

71
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:53,007
The third day,
the lightbulb burned out.

72
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,643
Pitch-black in there.

73
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:00,881
That's when the rats
started coming out.

74
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:04,750
I dozed off and...

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,056
I felt the thing, you know,
nibbling my finger.

76
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,231
I woke up.

77
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:21,066
It was, you know,
chewing my finger.

78
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:25,904
What did you do?

79
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:28,873
I grabbed it in the dark
with my hands

80
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,875
and I started smashing it.

81
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:34,913
And I just kept smashing it...

82
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,450
till it was nothing
but goo in my hands.

83
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:49,726
Two more days I was in there...

84
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:52,863
in the dark...

85
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,067
till my dad comes home.

86
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:12,448
Sometimes I wonder how many
things you have like that...

87
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:17,419
that I don't know about.

88
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:20,755
Ever since, I wondered

89
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:23,292
what if he never comes home?

90
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:29,498
What if I'm...

91
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:35,036
still in that basement

92
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:36,738
in the dark?

93
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:47,515
What if I died there?

94
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:58,326
That's what that reminds me of.

95
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:00,161
<i>What?</i>

96
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:04,864
That water stain.

97
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:11,438
Something's trying
to tell me that

98
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,673
it's all papier-mÃ¢ché.

99
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,610
Something's telling me
to wake up.

100
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,480
Like...

101
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,520
like I'm not real.

102
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,657
<i>Like I'm only dreaming.</i>

103
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:39,031
TOD between 4:00 and 9:00 AM
morning of the 26th.

104
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,000
Tox shows Xanax, alcohol,

105
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:45,037
also had gonorrhea,
for what it's worth.

106
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:46,939
Hydrochloric acid on his eyes.

107
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,441
Burn pattern tells us
he was on his back.

108
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,076
Lack of spray around
the orbital cavity

109
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,444
indicates precision.

110
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,213
Some kind of glass
eyedropper, maybe.

111
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:57,014
He's our body.

112
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,850
I don't see that changing, so
why don't you all fill me in?

113
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,353
Victim is a key figure
in a state's investigation.

114
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,489
- What state investigation?
<i>- Newly formed.</i>

115
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,391
We're looking into
various allegations

116
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,092
made against Vinci
in the papers.

117
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:11,962
Vinci detectives have been on Caspere
as a missing person for two days.

118
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,665
We have the man's house
which was burglarized.

119
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,133
<i>You want to shut us out,</i>

120
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,435
<i>we'll continue our
investigation autonomously.</i>

121
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,772
In Vinci, so everybody can keep
their little corners to themselves,

122
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,042
but, ladies and gentlemen,
PD is solving this case.

123
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:29,346
I understand Ventura. How does
the state have any claim here?

124
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:32,482
Our officer found the body.

125
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:35,519
<i>This could get you out from under, Woodrugh.
That actress bullshit.</i>

126
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:37,287
You'd be detailed
as a state's investigator.

127
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:40,324
<i>The Caspere homicide
is your public investigation.</i>

128
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:42,759
<i>Looking into Vinci PD</i>
<i>is your confidential mandate.</i>

129
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,361
Gathering intel
for a grand jury.

130
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:48,331
This probe is very important
to the governor's office.

131
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:50,200
Say this goes your way.

132
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,535
How's it play for my boy
here once the dust settles?

133
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:54,804
Everything shakes out,

134
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,540
you'll be offered a chance
to remain investigator.

135
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,775
In line for a state
detective shield.

136
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:02,645
<i>We can wipe away</i>
<i>all that admin hassle.</i>

137
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,148
When this is over,

138
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:09,385
can I just go back
to being on the bike?

139
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,455
<i>You can see abrasions
on his wrists and ankles,</i>

140
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:14,590
lividity on his torso.

141
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:17,325
He was bound upside down.

142
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,795
<i>Or close to it.</i>

143
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:22,131
<i>Attorney general's
office has concerns</i>

144
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:24,466
about obfuscation
on the part of Vinci PD.

145
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,335
<i>Detective Bezzerides, you'll
be primary commander of the detail.</i>

146
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:29,872
Secondary is gonna be
a Vinci guy, Velcoro.

147
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,407
Your DB was into
a lot of LA County money.

148
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:35,610
His house was broken into,
so you're going to Vinci.

149
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:37,979
Vinci detective with you,
word is he's bent.

150
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:40,715
Work him. Leverage
something to turn him.

151
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,817
We'll have a full state
probe up inside a week.

152
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:45,553
Caspere's death is a window
into everything.

153
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:47,756
And what is everything exactly?

154
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,690
You know anything
about the city of Vinci?

155
00:08:54,963 --> 00:08:58,632
<i>It started out as a
vice haven early 1900s.</i>

156
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:01,269
<i>Went industrial in the '20s.</i>

157
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:04,405
<i>Pushed out residents</i>
<i>from manufacturing zones.</i>

158
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:09,042
<i>Worse air polluter</i>
<i>in the state.</i>

159
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:13,814
<i>Annually emits or processes 27
million pounds of toxic waste.</i>

160
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,953
<i>Reds tries
to stop my grandfather</i>

161
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,122
<i>from industrial rezoning.</i>

162
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:25,225
<i>Same thing.</i>

163
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,728
<i>Geldof's been after us since
we won the last EPA suit.</i>

164
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:31,898
It's about money,
Detective Velcoro.

165
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:33,099
<i>Caspere was
one of the architects</i>

166
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,500
<i>of the community</i>
<i>renewal initiative.</i>

167
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:36,903
Passing legislature,
our city gets to keep

168
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:40,840
75% of its county tax
revenue for eight years.

169
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:42,908
- And what's that worth?
- <i>About $900 million.</i>

170
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:44,610
Being kept from
the county general fund.

171
00:09:44,945 --> 00:09:46,078
<i>Hell, Ernst, it's our money.</i>

172
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,449
Vinci's a goddamn success story
in a depressed economy.

173
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,984
<i>State's gonna use the homicide
to dig into whatever they can, Ray.</i>

174
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:55,254
Wherever the Caspere case goes,
we need you running point.

175
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:58,324
Control the sprawl. Control
the flow of information.

176
00:09:58,658 --> 00:10:01,327
Dixon is secondary to you
staging out of Vinci.

177
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:05,597
<i>You'll be working under a Ventura
detective commanding the task force.</i>

178
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:10,069
That clear to you, Detective?

179
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,738
10-4, Lieutenant.
Just one question.

180
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:15,374
Am I supposed
to solve this or not?

181
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:21,413
Just no surprises,
Detective Velcoro.

182
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:24,349
Ray accepts dualities
must be effected

183
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:28,253
<i>to serve public interests.</i>

184
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,121
I really do.

185
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:34,092
<i>- Bound?</i>
<i>- Vinyl fabric.</i>

186
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,627
You can see the edge of the
buckle's imprint on both wrists.

187
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,196
Tape residue.

188
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:41,132
Pelvic wounds are from a
12-gauge at point-blank range.

189
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,567
<i>Some kind</i>
<i>of Super-X heavy load.</i>

190
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,737
<i>Came after the eye stuff.</i>
<i>Official COD is heart attack.</i>

191
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:48,972
- <i>Trauma-induced.</i>
<i>- A coup de grace.</i>

192
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,641
<i>Lividity
indicates he was placed</i>

193
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:52,276
<i>in upright position</i>
<i>after death.</i>

194
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:53,611
<i>Spent a few hours that way.</i>

195
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:56,246
Nothing under his nails,
no prints.

196
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:59,249
No trace at all?

197
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:10,394
His eyes? What the fuck kind
of modus operandi is that?

198
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:11,795
Doc said it was
hydrochloric acid.

199
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:14,731
And a shotgun blast happened.

200
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,567
Torture. Somebody wanted
to know something.

201
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:18,668
Yeah, his house was tossed.

202
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:21,538
Somebody's making a move.

203
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,474
What?
What does that mean?

204
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,108
You knew Caspere?

205
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,478
There's deals
being done upstate.

206
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:31,714
- A lot of money moving around.
- <i>What deals?</i>

207
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:34,951
- You pull my string? Is that how this works?
- <i>Jesus, Frank.</i>

208
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:36,718
The more I know, the better
I can deal with this.

209
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:37,987
This is what you deal with.

210
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:40,489
Caspere was important to
this thing I have going on.

211
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:42,224
I've got to clean it up now.

212
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:44,994
So you beat the bushes
until you figure it out.

213
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:46,895
You ain't no sheriff's brownie.
You're a detective.

214
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:48,864
Who's your best informant?

215
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,298
Are you serious?

216
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:52,935
Fucking hell, Raymond.

217
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:10,352
<i>Leave!</i>

218
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:11,252
<i>Leave!</i>

219
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:13,588
<i>Danger!</i>

220
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:20,428
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Fuck me.

221
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:46,553
<i>So good to see you.</i>

222
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:48,655
Why don't you visit me more?

223
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:51,058
Just busy.
The job.

224
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:54,361
The job. We haven't
had dinner in ages.

225
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:56,162
That's why I brought
you this, Ma.

226
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:57,864
Don't give me that Ma shit.

227
00:12:58,198 --> 00:12:59,866
It's too late for us
to start all that now.

228
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,268
Well, you ought
to eat something.

229
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:05,171
Oh, I don't touch bread.

230
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,306
Peel that skin off
for me, Paulie.

231
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:12,111
So strong.

232
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:17,517
I saw your old prom date
the other day.

233
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:19,385
She got fat.

234
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:20,753
I remember her.

235
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:22,855
Couldn't wait to have
somebody's baby.

236
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:26,159
She was nice.
She was nice to me.

237
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:31,063
All the girls are nice
to you, Paulie.

238
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:33,498
You haven't figured
that out by now?

239
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:39,137
Want to stay tonight?

240
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:40,773
We can watch a Clint movie.

241
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,576
You can have your old room.

242
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:45,544
I'm working on something.

243
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:48,780
- Just came to see--
- Who is she, you scamp?

244
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:51,616
You rake.

245
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,252
You got hound's blood
just like your daddy.

246
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:56,688
I'm not gonna
be around for a while.

247
00:13:57,022 --> 00:13:59,091
I've got to work
around LA and the coast.

248
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,861
- Special detail.
- Mm.

249
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:06,864
Then stay.
We can play cards.

250
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:08,833
You can have your old room.

251
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,106
You been getting any more shifts
at the restaurant lately?

252
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:19,843
Not with my carpal tunnel.

253
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:22,279
I'd lose my state check anyway.

254
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,915
I thought Bill was letting
you work off the books.

255
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:28,385
Oh, Bill? Don't talk to me
about that motherfucker.

256
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,591
<i>Are you gonna give yourself up...</i>

257
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,892
...or do this
the hard way?

258
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:37,828
<i>There ain't no easy with me.</i>

259
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:39,162
<i>You know that.</i>

260
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:42,232
Damn. I so hate making a mess.

261
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,134
A lot of paperwork, you know.

262
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:46,103
It messes with you.

263
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:49,239
<i>Screw you.</i>
<i>I did my time in prison.</i>

264
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,873
We're listing contents
against insurance audits.

265
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:25,774
See what was stolen.

266
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:31,180
Well, somebody was looking for something.
Would explain the torture.

267
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,283
Maybe. Guy really thought
about fucking a lot.

268
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,296
Do you mind?

269
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,769
Psychiatrist appointments.

270
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:56,437
He was seeing a shrink.

271
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,673
<i>We need to call every
appointment in that calendar.</i>

272
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,510
Should check all those circled
dates against his GPS.

273
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,479
<i>Yeah.</i>

274
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:14,822
You pull off that e-cig.
Not a lot of people do.

275
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,757
This place gets
a day-to-day influx

276
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,126
of 70,000 people, right?

277
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,660
Where do they live?

278
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:23,563
I tried one once. It felt
like it was smoking me.

279
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:27,300
A real cigarette wouldn't
make you feel like that.

280
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:32,071
Maybe it was just
a little too close

281
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:35,308
to sucking a robot's dick.
I don't know.

282
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,592
Caspere was my
bank on this thing.

283
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:55,494
My disposal company
set this up.

284
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:57,496
Chemical runoff.
We took the risk.

285
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:00,266
And that risk afforded you the
chance to buy into the corridor.

286
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,468
But I'm telling you,
that buy was never made.

287
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:05,371
Caspere had me down for 12
parcels below Monterey.

288
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:08,340
Frank, I can only account for
what purchases Caspere completed.

289
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,842
- Are you saying that I--
- Mr. McCandless,

290
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:14,212
Mr. Caspere had effectively
sold Mr. Semyon the land

291
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:16,348
<i>while acting as a
short-term holding company.</i>

292
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,885
All we're trying to do is
ensure the deal for our parcel

293
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:21,853
goes through despite
Caspere's tragedy.

294
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:24,055
If you got this transaction
legally documented,

295
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:26,291
- it shouldn't be hard.
- You know we have issues.

296
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,827
If we had a fucking paper trail,
we'd be doing this through banks.

297
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,429
Well, otherwise I'd say you're
in the unenviable position

298
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,131
of being owed money
by a dead man.

299
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:35,133
That's $5 million of my money.

300
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,101
<i>Hold it, we were</i>
<i>given to understand</i>

301
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,069
that our partnership
was with Catalast.

302
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,172
Had Mr. Caspere made payment,
it would have been.

303
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,208
And your name would have been added to the
corporate charter for the development.

304
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,377
- But he didn't.
- How do I know that?

305
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:48,279
We're not gangsters, Frank.

306
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,348
<i>This is unacceptable.</i>

307
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:52,950
Since Caspere's remaining
interests have been voided,

308
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:55,286
I can provide you the
same parcel, same price.

309
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:57,788
- Seven million.
- The same?

310
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,023
We were quoted 10.

311
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:00,324
Not by me.

312
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:07,064
Motherfuck.

313
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:08,933
Motherfuck me.

314
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:14,170
We sold off our Vinci assets
to put in with Caspere and...

315
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:18,342
I went liquid for this deal.

316
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:20,577
What can I tell you, Frank?
It sounds like Mr. Caspere

317
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:22,412
was playing fast and loose
with your capital.

318
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,381
I can offer you
the buy-in again,

319
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:26,182
but it sounds
like you're short.

320
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,683
I can get it back.

321
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:30,419
Find another stake,
it'd be worth your while.

322
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,288
Excuse me.

323
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:39,996
Shit.
Seven he says?

324
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:42,098
Seven's the same
as 10 to me at this point.

325
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,266
Can't round off zero.

326
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:57,380
Am I diminished?

327
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:59,514
Is that my message
to the goddamn--

328
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,088
My business partner
takes my money,

329
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,823
gets tortured and murdered,

330
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:11,326
and what?

331
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:14,396
I'm waiting on this Velcoro
burnout to make like Rockford?

332
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:19,868
Get everybody.

333
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,471
Stan, Ivar, his cousins,
our Glendale people.

334
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,640
Fucking Blake, wherever
the fuck he's been.

335
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,742
Frank, we can look
at your remaining assets.

336
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,478
I don't have
any fucking assets.

337
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:33,314
The house and the poker room
were double mortgaged.

338
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:38,052
This was fucking everything.

339
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,122
That's what you meant.
Frank, why did you--

340
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,557
Leave it.
I'll get it back.

341
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:47,395
Every dime.

342
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:52,999
That was maybe a month ago.

343
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,802
September.

344
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:57,638
Celebrated breaking ground
on the Red Line extension

345
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:02,476
and the imminent production
of a major Hollywood movie.

346
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:06,146
Big news for the city.
And Ben had a hand--

347
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,316
Could you tell us anything about
Mr. Caspere's demeanor at the party?

348
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,385
Was he with someone?
A date?

349
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:18,425
A woman he had been seeing.

350
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,728
I think.

351
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,331
Can't quite recall her name.

352
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:30,035
- Ernst?
- A Miss Tascha, I believe, sir.

353
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,972
He see a lot of girls? Enough
you wouldn't know her name?

354
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:36,576
I believe Ben maintained
an active social life.

355
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,712
<i>We didn't often</i>
<i>cross paths that way.</i>

356
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,715
We only met over business.

357
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,418
You wouldn't have any
pictures from the party, sir,

358
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,620
by any chance?

359
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,256
Something to help us
identify the girl.

360
00:20:56,228 --> 00:20:57,696
Mr. Caspere was dedicated
to his community.

361
00:20:57,964 --> 00:21:00,665
A community of 95 residents.

362
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:04,068
He didn't seem distressed
by anything last you saw him?

363
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:07,005
No, just the usual headaches.

364
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:10,842
County can't forgive
our independence.

365
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:13,144
And you didn't talk to him much

366
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:14,778
outside of business
get-togethers?

367
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,848
And cabinet meetings
occasionally.

368
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:20,118
Well...

369
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:22,086
thank you, Your Honor.
That'll do us.

370
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:25,256
Do you recall what time Mr. Caspere
left your house night of the party?

371
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,659
I believe around 11:00,
maybe 12:00.

372
00:21:29,093 --> 00:21:31,194
- Around the time things broke up.
- With Miss Tascha?

373
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:33,363
Thank you, Your Honor.

374
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:35,132
Thank you, Detective.

375
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,301
I'd like to see this solved
as soon as possible.

376
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,643
<i>Got his bank
records, phone calls.</i>

377
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,412
<i>Don't know if he had</i>
<i>any of the lines, though.</i>

378
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:50,447
Starting to think he must
have kept other accounts.

379
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:53,950
Hey, kid, just save it
for the debrief.

380
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:55,952
Why are you here?

381
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:57,854
You're not even
an investigator, right?

382
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:01,758
Special detail.
State owns the case.

383
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:05,227
Found his lawyer, too. Had to
hump all over LA for this shit.

384
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:08,297
Oh, and this one fag
at the bank

385
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,700
tried, like, hitting on me.

386
00:22:10,968 --> 00:22:12,301
Almost clocked the guy.

387
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,170
Yeah?
Why would you do that?

388
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:16,973
Hey, no trouble here, stud.

389
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:19,175
Just leave me
out of it, all right?

390
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:42,497
His insurance had these forms.

391
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:45,166
Items likely stolen
from Caspere's place,

392
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:47,035
we can put out
pawn sheets on them.

393
00:22:48,905 --> 00:22:49,905
What'd you guys get?

394
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:53,741
The young man here,
he got a dynamite anecdote.

395
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:57,878
Last withdrawal
was five days ago.

396
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,747
<i>Nothing jumps except this.</i>

397
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:02,950
Once a month,
$4,000 cash withdrawal.

398
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,591
Let me see this.

399
00:23:15,964 --> 00:23:17,732
The withdrawals seem
to come around the time

400
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,600
of these blank days
in his calendar.

401
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,604
- Did you get his GPS?
- Yeah.

402
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:27,774
Here.

403
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,178
There's nothing on those dates.

404
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:34,348
Car didn't go anywhere. Says
his Mercedes was a lease.

405
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:37,484
- Well, that makes sense.
- Not city. Catalast Group.

406
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:38,952
Why'd Catalast lease him a car?

407
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,825
Maybe somebody
should call them.

408
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,969
You tight with him?

409
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,703
I'm not tight with anybody.

410
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:04,410
Can I pick up here tomorrow?

411
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:06,779
Sure.

412
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,630
I gotta go.

413
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,841
- What?
- These coordinates.

414
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,343
They're up north.

415
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,346
Monterey County,
Fresno, Gilroy.

416
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,348
A lot of them on weekends.

417
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,429
Hey.

418
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,997
Where's Chad?

419
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,902
He's not coming.

420
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,305
What? Why?

421
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,041
You're gonna ask me why? Really?

422
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,409
You fucking prick.

423
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,010
What, that thing at the school?

424
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,012
I apologized to Chad and
it's between me and him.

425
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,048
That's not the end of the
story and you know it.

426
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,516
- How's that? - The police said that
someone beat up Wit Conroy.

427
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:23,720
Said it had something to do
with a schoolyard altercation.

428
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,088
Well, I don't know
anything about that,

429
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,824
but sometimes a good beating
provokes personal growth.

430
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,060
It's not like you know
any other way, right?

431
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:32,695
God damn it.

432
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,898
Chad gets anxious when
he has to be around you.

433
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,100
Do you get that?
Do you even see it?

434
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,503
That's bullshit.
I-- we talk,

435
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:43,506
we build models, we write
letters, I got him this recorder.

436
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
And how many times
has he written you back?

437
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,443
He needs me, all right,
even if he doesn't know it.

438
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:49,712
And if he gets anxious, it's
probably because he knows

439
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:51,614
he's gonna have to listen to his
mom talk shit about his dad.

440
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:55,384
Yeah.
You're bad, Ray.

441
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:56,952
You're a bad person.

442
00:25:57,287 --> 00:26:00,222
- And you're bad for my son.
- Don't say that.

443
00:26:00,423 --> 00:26:03,159
You know me.

444
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:06,395
We had something and--

445
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:08,664
What I done for you, things
started to slip away from me--

446
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:10,098
No, you didn't
do that for me, Ray.

447
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,701
Don't you dare say
that you did that for me.

448
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:14,202
I had a right
by any natural law.

449
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:15,970
I had a right.

450
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:24,946
I came to tell you
this in person.

451
00:26:25,214 --> 00:26:27,015
Richard didn't want me to.

452
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:29,083
I'm getting an emergency
writ for supervised visits.

453
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:31,652
What? No.

454
00:26:31,954 --> 00:26:34,388
We're petitioning
for sole custody.

455
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:36,424
What?

456
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:37,692
No, why?

457
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,161
Because this can't go on.

458
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:42,530
It can't.

459
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:44,932
I mean, look at yourself.

460
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:47,635
You will not-- no.
Please, please, don't.

461
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:50,571
You used to have
something, a decency.

462
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:53,207
You were good at being decent

463
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:55,576
until something happened.

464
00:26:55,977 --> 00:26:58,378
<i>You were fine as long</i>
<i>as everything else was fine.</i>

465
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:01,748
But then something happened and you
weren't strong enough to stay decent.

466
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:03,650
- And now--
- You won't get away with it.

467
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:06,820
I will burn this entire fucking
city to the ground first.

468
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,225
I'll petition for a
paternity test, too, Ray.

469
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:14,294
- If you make me.
- Don't. Please. Please, don't.

470
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:16,463
Don't do that, please.

471
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:19,265
God damn it, look,
he's-- he's all I--

472
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:21,000
all right, I'm a piece of shit,

473
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:23,302
but that boy is all I have
in my entire shitty life.

474
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,705
No, babe.

475
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:28,441
Then don't you know
he deserves better?

476
00:28:08,915 --> 00:28:11,482
Oh, fuck.
Son of a bitch.

477
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:14,286
Some asshole just rear-ended my car.
Look, you mother-- ah!

478
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,589
Fuck.

479
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:22,092
Son of--

480
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,928
Oh, fuck.

481
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:29,066
Next time, we put you in trunk.

482
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:39,943
Oh, fuck!

483
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:42,779
Jesus, buddy.
What was that about?

484
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,381
Oh, God, thank you.
Fuckin' me--

485
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:48,718
Why would somebody come
after you like that, guy?

486
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,386
I mean, that was crazy, right?

487
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,655
I don't know.
They just--

488
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:54,257
What did you do
to piss somebody off?

489
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:56,259
- Can you think of anything?
- What does that mean?

490
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:58,027
I don't know what that means.
I'm asking you.

491
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:00,896
What you might have did to get
guys like that after you.

492
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:03,032
Wait, do I know you?

493
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:05,368
I've never seen you before,
but I saw the whole thing.

494
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:07,403
And I wish we could
figure out what you did.

495
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,272
Like some kind of behavior that guys
like that would have issue with.

496
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,508
Like mouthed off
or made a gesture

497
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,710
or you run a book
in Vinci sweatshops.

498
00:29:14,978 --> 00:29:17,045
What?
Is that what this is?

499
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:20,148
Is what what what is? Is
that what you think this is?

500
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:23,786
It just seems to me like you
pissed off some serious people.

501
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:27,222
Maybe you ought
to take more care.

502
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:28,890
Just a thought, pal.

503
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:51,513
Velcoro and Bezzerides to see Dr. Pitlor.
We called ahead.

504
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,604
You do surgeries here?

505
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:19,272
Only cosmetic.

506
00:30:19,674 --> 00:30:21,775
The clinic employs a small
group of medical professionals

507
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:23,977
who cover a variety
of services.

508
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:28,615
This is quite a shock.

509
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:32,618
Anything he might have
told you that indicated

510
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:35,221
trouble, enemies?

511
00:30:37,191 --> 00:30:41,194
The reputation of this clinic rests
on its discretion, Officers.

512
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:43,696
Confidentiality.

513
00:30:43,964 --> 00:30:46,132
Your patient was murdered.

514
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,000
He's got no living family.

515
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:55,641
Somebody burned out
his eyes with acid, Doc.

516
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,853
Well, of course
I am willing to help.

517
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:10,755
I would hope I can, at least.

518
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:12,624
What were you treating him for?

519
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:16,061
A number of things.
Neuroses, anxiety,

520
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:18,897
a painful past like many.

521
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,432
Guilt.

522
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:22,968
Guilt over what?

523
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:25,637
Ben had a weakness
for young women.

524
00:31:25,938 --> 00:31:28,139
Paying for them,
more specifically.

525
00:31:28,507 --> 00:31:31,076
He frequented escorts,
although it ignited in him

526
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:33,211
tremendous shame
and self-loathing,

527
00:31:33,545 --> 00:31:37,348
which resulted in further
damaging tendencies.

528
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:41,352
- Old cycles.
- How long had he been seeing you?

529
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:43,854
About three years.

530
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:46,724
Was he making any
progress, his therapy?

531
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:47,925
I like to think so.

532
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:49,594
His relapses were less frequent

533
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:52,096
and he didn't compound them
with further damaging behavior.

534
00:31:52,464 --> 00:31:54,999
His habit, did he ever
mention any girls by name?

535
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:57,701
Favorite service?
Favorite girl?

536
00:31:58,136 --> 00:32:01,138
No, not that I recall, but I'd be
willing to go back over my notes.

537
00:32:01,472 --> 00:32:04,975
What about the name Tascha?
He ever mention her?

538
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:09,479
Did he ever mention violence?
Trouble with a girl, a pimp?

539
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,283
He was sexually obsessed,
but he was not aggressive.

540
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:16,886
More... passive.

541
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:23,593
That's about as detailed as I'll
get airing Ben's personal issues.

542
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:27,997
This was helpful.
Thank you.

543
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:34,403
Your ID said
Antigone Bezzerides.

544
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:38,207
Are you related to Elliot
Bezzerides by any chance?

545
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:40,877
- You know him?
- I used to a bit a long time ago.

546
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:42,945
I did some social theory
with the Good People.

547
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:45,347
He had a daughter, I remember.

548
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,849
Good Lord, was that you?

549
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:50,452
I left all that behind.

550
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,421
It was a fucked-up place.

551
00:32:52,755 --> 00:32:55,224
Well, all kinds
of secrets in the world.

552
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,092
All kinds of truth.

553
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,961
Five kids living there
when I was growing up.

554
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:02,230
Two are in jail now,
two committed suicide.

555
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:03,899
How's that for social theory?

556
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:07,169
- And the fifth?
- She became a detective.

557
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:29,890
<i>To curb public
speculation in this homicide,</i>

558
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:32,493
<i>it's become necessary</i>
<i>to announce that our offices</i>

559
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:35,462
<i>are conducting a criminal probe
into the incorporated city</i>

560
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:38,099
of Vinci in LA County.

561
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,634
<i>This investigation is long overdue.</i>

562
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:43,137
<i>And we ask all state</i>

563
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:46,140
<i>and city officials</i>
<i>to cooperate...</i>

564
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:48,843
Attorney general
just announced a shakedown.

565
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:54,881
You're not supposed
to bring that here.

566
00:33:55,082 --> 00:33:57,718
It's short 10.

567
00:33:58,018 --> 00:34:00,420
When you took over
from Gene Slattery,

568
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:02,055
we established terms.

569
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:05,024
Short wasn't part of it, Frank.

570
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:06,659
I'm pulling
some stuff together.

571
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:08,261
Adding revenue streams.

572
00:34:08,528 --> 00:34:09,562
I just need a couple of weeks.

573
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,165
I sold the rent farms
and waste disposal business

574
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:14,134
to pull together the corridor money.
You know that.

575
00:34:14,434 --> 00:34:15,969
You still owe
the poker room kickback.

576
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,071
Sell some of that land
if you need to.

577
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:20,706
Caspere died with
my money in his pocket.

578
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:25,244
I've had outside interest
re: the poker room.

579
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:27,313
Think they can turn
a higher gross.

580
00:34:27,614 --> 00:34:30,149
- <i>Higher vig.</i>
<i>- What outside interest?</i>

581
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,352
Just so you know,
it's a seller's market.

582
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,724
You seriously gonna
bust my balls over 10 Gs?

583
00:34:39,092 --> 00:34:41,393
I kept this place tight
as a drum six years.

584
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:44,830
<i>Who squashed the undocumented
workers alliance?</i>

585
00:34:45,064 --> 00:34:46,131
That hit and run?

586
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,000
Your son's face
was so coke-dusted

587
00:34:48,234 --> 00:34:49,434
he looked like a clown.

588
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:51,970
Tony, yeah.

589
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:56,641
My son, I fear,

590
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,611
is losing his fucking mind.

591
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:02,514
Like his departed mother.

592
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:06,518
Some people can't handle
the deep trip.

593
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:08,787
<i>I fear he is a destroyer.</i>

594
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:12,423
<i>In my day, you understand, it was
about consciousness expansion,</i>

595
00:35:12,657 --> 00:35:15,126
tracing the unseen web.

596
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:18,429
Children are a disappointment.

597
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:21,299
Remain unfettered, Frank.

598
00:35:23,168 --> 00:35:24,802
They closer on
who killed Caspere?

599
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:31,408
Catalast is taking over
his action.

600
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:33,677
Everything's happening.

601
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:37,214
My farkakte offspring I will
set up with a club in Oakland.

602
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:39,650
Let him be
a boy prince elsewhere.

603
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:42,152
Whoever killed Caspere,
they have my money.

604
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,621
- How's that?
- <i>The holding company is empty.</i>

605
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:47,958
The land was never purchased and
I'm fucked out of my life's work.

606
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:50,393
Now I need a direction
to turn, Austin.

607
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:52,829
Or I may just start
pulling down walls.

608
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:58,168
That doesn't sound like
a smart play, <i>gever.</i>

609
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:00,603
Innuendo is nobody's friend.

610
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:04,306
You're not worried whoever did Caspere
might be part of something bigger?

611
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:07,076
Muscling in on the corridor,
secret handshakes and whatnot.

612
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:10,613
Ben had his own charity
and what punched his ticket

613
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:13,949
could have come from
some personal pocket.

614
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:19,355
Nobody muscles me, Frank.

615
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:22,091
<i>State attorney</i>
<i>will get his piece,</i>

616
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,826
Caspere will get closed,
the world will turn

617
00:36:25,061 --> 00:36:27,062
uncaring of our struggles.

618
00:36:32,502 --> 00:36:36,304
They close Caspere,
I want a tip.

619
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,473
I want time alone
with the guy that did it.

620
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:43,978
You are industrious, Frank.

621
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:46,548
I want to see you
make it through this.

622
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,684
Who wants to move
on the poker room?

623
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:52,320
Kickback's an extra
15 next week, Frank.

624
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:54,355
22.50 the week after.

625
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,490
You don't come through then,

626
00:36:56,825 --> 00:36:58,927
<i>I have to entertain</i>
<i>other interests.</i>

627
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:00,929
It's business.

628
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:03,431
Sure.

629
00:37:16,678 --> 00:37:19,146
Now this is making
some sense, right?

630
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:20,848
It explains his home decor.

631
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,151
Nine to one the cash withdrawal
every month was a hooker blowout.

632
00:37:24,518 --> 00:37:26,619
Guy's regularly in touch
with criminal elements.

633
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:31,091
Pimps,

634
00:37:31,426 --> 00:37:32,725
they break in,
tortured him somewhere.

635
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:34,428
Probably trying
to get access to assets.

636
00:37:34,728 --> 00:37:36,496
I think it's more
twisted than that.

637
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:38,565
What was done to him,
that shit in his house.

638
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:41,400
He's into a lot of stuff
we're just scratching.

639
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:45,304
Well, we can have Woodrugh
work prosts, escort services.

640
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:46,940
He'd be smooth for that.

641
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:50,643
Sure.

642
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:57,183
You know that expression
about flies and honey?

643
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,119
Mmm. The fuck do I want
with a bunch of flies?

644
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,154
Well, you don't have flies,
you can't fly-fish.

645
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:18,303
What is this fucking place?

646
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,707
Suburban flight,

647
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:24,576
heavy manufacturing
moves inland or overseas,

648
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:26,411
plants close.

649
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:28,413
Except here, a bunch
of good capitalists

650
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:30,348
ran in for cheap leases,
tax incentives,

651
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:33,318
<i>immigrant labor,</i>
<i>sweatshop economics.</i>

652
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:34,652
You don't have
a problem with that?

653
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,755
No, my strong suspicion is
we get the world we deserve.

654
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,662
Why are you here?
This place?

655
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:50,434
I did time in the LA Sheriff's.

656
00:38:50,668 --> 00:38:52,869
I just needed better pay.

657
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:55,906
Regular hours.

658
00:38:56,106 --> 00:38:58,474
I had a son.

659
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,915
They told you
about me, I'm sure.

660
00:39:05,282 --> 00:39:07,551
Yeah, bosses said
you're a solid investigator.

661
00:39:07,952 --> 00:39:11,120
I know you wouldn't think it,
but I don't bullshit.

662
00:39:11,388 --> 00:39:12,621
What would you say if you did?

663
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,424
Can I tell you what you
may or may not have heard,

664
00:39:14,824 --> 00:39:16,959
but almost definitely will
hear about my busted marriage?

665
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:19,662
Rumors have me killing this
piece of filth hurt my wife.

666
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:21,764
Same rumors put me in hock
to a Southland mob.

667
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,466
And if you know who to ask,
you might hear I like to wet

668
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,034
now and then from a
number of bad habits.

669
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:26,969
- Any of that true?
- Oh, yeah.

670
00:39:27,236 --> 00:39:29,872
- Which parts?
- Bad habits.

671
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:33,576
Never lost one yet.

672
00:39:35,344 --> 00:39:36,679
You?

673
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:39,715
Oh, I don't distinguish
between good and bad habits.

674
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,250
What's with all the knives?

675
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:44,619
Could you do this job
if everyone you encountered

676
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,355
could physically overpower you?

677
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:48,890
I mean, forget police work.

678
00:39:49,258 --> 00:39:51,126
No man could walk around
like that without going nuts.

679
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:53,528
So they're equalizers.
Makes sense.

680
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:56,098
<i>No, I'd still wear them</i>
<i>if I wasn't on the job.</i>

681
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:58,733
Fundamental difference
between the sexes

682
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:02,403
is that one of them can kill the
other with their bare hands.

683
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,872
Man of any size
lays hands on me,

684
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:06,774
he's gonna bleed out
in under a minute.

685
00:40:08,844 --> 00:40:11,613
Well, just so you know,
I support feminism.

686
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:14,548
Mostly by having
body image issues.

687
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:23,857
What's that thing
Pitlor mentioned?

688
00:40:24,126 --> 00:40:25,826
Your dad, the Good People?

689
00:40:26,194 --> 00:40:29,896
It was this, like,
commune around Guerneville

690
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:32,032
in the late '70s, '80s.

691
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,501
Hippie shit.

692
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:36,603
You had to look out
for yourself, huh?

693
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:46,947
That's you.

694
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:07,599
Look, I'm trying to effect
transparency between us.

695
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:09,434
The reason being...

696
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:13,372
I don't know if you know this,

697
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,508
but us, the investigation,

698
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,410
I don't think
it's supposed to work.

699
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:20,412
Why is that?

700
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:22,113
<i>State attorney's investigation.</i>

701
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:25,350
They must have tapped you.
You know, the kid, too.

702
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:27,786
Why wouldn't they have a team of
state grand jury investigators

703
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:30,322
working Vinci instead
of just you and the kid?

704
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,525
Why wouldn't the SA do a
full-court press on this?

705
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:39,964
You want honest?

706
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:42,667
Tell me, how
compromised are you?

707
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:55,846
Anyways, good night.

708
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,250
What is that?
Why didn't you tell me?

709
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,721
- What the fuck?
- <i>Hmm?</i>

710
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:38,722
_

711
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,426
'Cause that right there is a
bunch of unbridled horseshit.

712
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,129
<i>You read about the girl.</i>

713
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:47,730
Goes to jail
for one more fuckup,

714
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,067
tries to say I did something wrong.
That's it.

715
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:52,701
Then why didn't you tell me?

716
00:42:53,036 --> 00:42:54,436
'Cause I don't want
to think about it.

717
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,239
- Are you gonna lose your job?
- No.

718
00:42:56,606 --> 00:42:58,241
I got a new assignment
through the state attorney.

719
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:00,309
I'm gonna be a detective after.

720
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,578
Listen, this paper
talks about you

721
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:04,380
being in this Black
Mountain Security thing.

722
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,949
I told you, I don't
talk about the desert.

723
00:43:08,351 --> 00:43:10,786
But this Black Mountain Security,
they did things, bad--

724
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:24,699
So that's it?
You're just taking off?

725
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:26,902
Come on, I just told you.

726
00:43:27,236 --> 00:43:29,771
I got to go to LA
to work for a while.

727
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:32,674
Special detail.
Special investigator.

728
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:34,742
- That's it.
- God, you smell like a bar rag.

729
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,645
They say vodka don't smell,
but that's bullshit.

730
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:39,714
You smell just like my uncle.

731
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:41,616
I'm just going
down south a while.

732
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:44,319
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- That's it.</i>

733
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:46,887
- <i>And your apartment?</i>
<i>- Still there, Em.</i>

734
00:43:50,258 --> 00:43:52,392
What are you doing?

735
00:43:57,332 --> 00:44:00,434
I can't do this anymore.
I tried.

736
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:06,307
It's work.

737
00:44:06,574 --> 00:44:08,542
It's a good thing, Em.

738
00:44:08,676 --> 00:44:11,345
No.

739
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,747
You barely talk.

740
00:44:14,148 --> 00:44:16,115
I don't know your family.
You don't want to know mine.

741
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:17,651
- Who are you?
- Oh, fuck off.

742
00:44:17,952 --> 00:44:19,353
Who the fuck
am I supposed to be?

743
00:44:19,754 --> 00:44:21,521
- I don't know who you're supposed to be.
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>

744
00:44:21,756 --> 00:44:24,290
Yeah, fuck off.
Go.

745
00:44:24,658 --> 00:44:27,827
God, whatever happened
to you, I can't fix it.

746
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:30,830
There's nothing wrong with me.

747
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:35,434
I'll call you this weekend.

748
00:44:35,802 --> 00:44:38,537
Don't. I don't want to
hear from you, Paul.

749
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,873
You can't give me
more than this.

750
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,442
You're not--
you're not right.

751
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,012
Sometimes I'm with you
and I can tell that...

752
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,316
Fuck it.

753
00:44:51,518 --> 00:44:52,685
I gotta go.

754
00:44:52,886 --> 00:44:54,620
Don't come back.

755
00:44:54,855 --> 00:44:57,990
It's on you, not me.

756
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:00,993
I can't see you again, Paul.

757
00:45:01,227 --> 00:45:03,028
You hurt me seeing you.

758
00:45:05,965 --> 00:45:08,133
You're doing this.

759
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:10,969
This isn't me doing this.

760
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,871
This isn't me.

Frank.

769
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:19,469
Surprised you're visiting
this pit you stuck me with.

770
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:22,572
It's hard work up in here.

771
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,875
I gotta say, being back
in here, I don't miss it.

772
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:27,409
Seems like a headache
looking back.

773
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:28,744
Fucking right it's a headache.

774
00:46:29,045 --> 00:46:32,348
Vendors, purchase
orders, licenses.

775
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:35,050
Every one of these bitches
think this is "Pretty Woman."

776
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:40,389
I need to know if any
of your girls knew a guy

777
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:42,257
liked young trim.

778
00:46:42,558 --> 00:46:45,827
Maybe, like, a few months ago.

779
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:49,064
He booked a date at his place.

780
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,801
In Vinci?
The big house?

781
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:57,238
No, this place small.
In Hollywood.

782
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,607
Took-over home.

783
00:46:58,908 --> 00:46:59,808
You remember where it was?

784
00:47:00,075 --> 00:47:02,811
Go ahead, girl, speak.

785
00:47:05,815 --> 00:47:07,348
I write them down.

786
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,451
Danny says you pay
attention to streets,

787
00:47:10,685 --> 00:47:11,986
always know where you are.

788
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:17,625
This guy, he do anything scary?

789
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:19,527
Anything might have
pissed somebody off?

790
00:47:19,761 --> 00:47:21,429
No.
He kind of...

791
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,898
weak, you say?

792
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,667
Just want to watch.

793
00:47:26,968 --> 00:47:28,468
Write it down
where you met him.

794
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,577
I hope this goodwill does not go
unnoticed on your end, Frank.

795
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:39,112
Everybody needs friends, see?

796
00:47:45,653 --> 00:47:47,921
<i>This is Hollywood
Division Vice Squad.</i>

797
00:47:48,389 --> 00:47:50,690
<i>Please leave your message after the
beep and we'll get back to you.</i>

798
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:53,160
<i>This is Detective Bezzerides</i>

799
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:56,296
with state police detail 93009.

800
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,819
I was hoping to speak
with a vice detective--

801
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:02,035
<i>If you are satisfied
with your message, press one.</i>

802
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:21,737
_

803
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:12,335
- Yeah. <i>- Yo, you remember</i>
<i>that missing girl?</i>

804
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:13,870
I talked to her old roommate.

805
00:49:14,238 --> 00:49:16,172
Said Vera last called her
a couple months ago.

806
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,074
Asked if anybody'd
come around looking for her.

807
00:49:18,575 --> 00:49:22,445
<i>I checked her phone records and a
call came from a Guerneville address.</i>

808
00:49:22,713 --> 00:49:23,813
How's it going down there?

809
00:49:24,115 --> 00:49:25,515
<i>It's a pain in the ass,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

810
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,216
<i>Not much so far.</i>

811
00:49:27,584 --> 00:49:29,718
<i>It's-- might be a
hooker job, some pimp.</i>

812
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:32,821
Let me let you go.
Catch up tomorrow?

813
00:49:32,989 --> 00:49:34,457
<i>Sure.</i>

814
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,125
Bye.

815
00:49:58,014 --> 00:49:59,581

How's that for detecting?

823
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:04,344
Caspere had another house.
Place he brought girls.

824
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:07,347
- You check it out?
- No, I don't want to go near it.

825
00:51:07,748 --> 00:51:10,483
And my people ain't exactly
proficient in evidence handling.

826
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,218
<i>Figured you'd go in as police,</i>

827
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,120
<i>see what you can, see what
I might need to know.</i>

828
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,223
Grab anything that pushed towards
Caspere's dealing with land purchases.

829
00:51:17,524 --> 00:51:19,259
Yeah, what's going
on with that?

830
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,027
Money. Place is about to
be worth a whole lot more.

831
00:51:22,328 --> 00:51:25,164
- This is Hollywood.
- So?

832
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:29,001
Listen, I've been
wanting to ask you,

833
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:30,702
things shake out like I expect,

834
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:35,574
this time next year,
might be Chief of PD-- Vinci.

835
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:37,476
How'd that be?

836
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:40,078
Chief? I don't
want that, Frank.

837
00:51:40,513 --> 00:51:42,481
Did I ask you if you want that?
What's up with you, huh?

838
00:51:42,782 --> 00:51:44,716
I'm lining stuff up
for you here.

839
00:51:45,017 --> 00:51:46,652
That job pays 300K a year.

840
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:49,788
You could hire a hell of a
family lawyer for that.

841
00:51:50,055 --> 00:51:53,525
That right there.

842
00:51:55,761 --> 00:52:00,564
You-- you remember
how we got together?

843
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:02,133
I remember you dumping a body.

844
00:52:02,434 --> 00:52:06,171
The reasons for all
this, all that,

845
00:52:06,438 --> 00:52:08,606
might not exist for me anymore.

846
00:52:08,774 --> 00:52:11,375
You see?

847
00:52:11,643 --> 00:52:14,444
I got no reason
to keep at this.

848
00:52:14,779 --> 00:52:17,414
Meaning you'd consider
life in prison, what,

849
00:52:17,615 --> 00:52:18,748
a positive?

850
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,483
No, I ain't saying that either.

851
00:52:20,885 --> 00:52:22,986
What, you have other options
here I'm not privy to?

852
00:52:23,288 --> 00:52:25,923
Everybody's got the one option,

853
00:52:26,157 --> 00:52:27,991
you want it bad enough.

854
00:52:29,493 --> 00:52:30,694
You used to be a hard man.

855
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:33,262
- I'm tired.
- Then get some sleep.

856
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:36,599
After you check the place out.

857
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:38,768
Get back to me.

858
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:40,637
And, Ray...

859
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:46,342
I don't want to hear
you talk like that again.

860
00:53:00,123 --> 00:53:01,757
You want another beer, Ray?

861
00:53:02,024 --> 00:53:05,494
No, I-- I gotta
take off, I guess.

862
00:53:05,762 --> 00:53:08,230
He's keeping you busy.

863
00:53:08,431 --> 00:53:10,098
Yes, ma'am.

864
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:21,209
You ought to take some time.

865
00:53:21,377 --> 00:53:23,278
A vacation.

866
00:53:23,612 --> 00:53:25,247
Have you ever been
to San Miguel de Allende?

867
00:53:25,514 --> 00:53:27,215
- No.
- That's where I'm from.

868
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:32,020
Mountains, waterfalls,
this plaza.

869
00:53:32,321 --> 00:53:34,555
Well, that sounds really nice.

870
00:53:34,857 --> 00:53:37,525
Maybe I could show it
to you sometime.

871
00:53:37,893 --> 00:53:41,228
I think the only way I get
a vacation is if I croak.

872
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,163
You should get
another job, then.

873
00:53:43,465 --> 00:53:45,366
It's too late
for that, darlin'.

874
00:53:47,503 --> 00:53:49,036
That and about
a million other things.

875
00:53:55,743 --> 00:53:57,244
Your money.

876
00:53:59,915 --> 00:54:01,681
