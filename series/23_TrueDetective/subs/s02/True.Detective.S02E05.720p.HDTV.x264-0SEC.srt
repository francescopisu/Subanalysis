28
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:01,567
<i>since the alleged murderers of
Vinci city manager Ben Caspere</i>

29
00:02:01,602 --> 00:02:05,838
<i>engaged police in one of the deadliest
shoot-outs in state history.</i>

30
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:07,707
<i>The so-called</i>
<i>Vinci Massacre</i>

31
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:10,743
<i>was determined closed</i>
<i>by Attorney General Geldof,</i>

32
00:02:10,778 --> 00:02:14,113
who used the conference to announce
his candidacy for governor.

33
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:17,850
Benjamin Caspere was
a corrupt individual

34
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:20,486
<i>and he was killed by</i>
<i>the dangerous psychopaths</i>

35
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,405

38
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:30,279
<i>I can finally only come</i>

39
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:13,489
<i>No comment

40
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:17,243

_

43
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:27,503
Help you with something?

44
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:30,590
Security, hmm?

45
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,341
Frank Semyon.

46
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:35,678
Stick with what you know.

47
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:38,848
You didn't have to quit.
I told you that.

48
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:42,218
None of that went down right.

49
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,687
State came in.

50
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:46,689
Better to walk
before they make you run.

51
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:48,808
We'd have helped you with that.

52
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,776
Geldof closed the case.
You're clear.

53
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:53,145
He's saying the
Mexicans did Caspere?

54
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:58,451
Anybody come to you
asking about that?

55
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:00,119
Caspere, the Mexicans?

56
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:03,289
You and Teague, he talk to you much
when you were working together?

57
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:05,324
What did you come
here for, Lieutenant?

58
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:07,877
Learned some things
about Dixon.

59
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:09,161
Wondered if you knew anything.

60
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:11,631
Anything about what things?

61
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,418
He had a lot of photographs,
some other stuff.

62
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,170
Might've been into some people.

63
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:27,430
Bought another Charger.

64
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:29,098
Yeah.

65
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,685
I appreciate a good rut.

66
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:35,571
Well, I gotta tell you--
sorry about this--

67
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,657
but these row houses

68
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:40,276
are reserved
for municipal employees.

69
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:43,195
And now that you're not one...

70
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:45,081
You fucking evicting me?

71
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,416
Hey, I got them
to give you 60 days.

72
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:49,502
And I wanted to come
tell you myself.

73
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:50,786
Come on, Ray,

74
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:53,422
you don't want
to live here anymore.

75
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:01,764
I gotta go to work.

76
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,215
Sure.

77
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:19,782
<i>Thank you.</i>

78
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,249
This is short 200.

79
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:41,459
I told you about this.
What do I tell Mr. Frank?

80
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:47,570
He can buy beer,
he can pay the rent.

81
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:57,770
Tell him to have it tomorrow
or I'll put you on an ICE bus.

82
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:59,939
<i>Immigration, do you understand?</i>

83
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:01,941
Okay.

84
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:09,365
Jesus Christ.

85
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,787
Sexual harassment's
a political tool.

86
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,123
You pay a compliment,
a chick lawyers up.

87
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:19,208
That shit's about looks, too.

88
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:22,044
Difference between something like
what I'm here for and flirting

89
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:23,379
is how good-looking
a dude is.

90
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:25,014
How's that fucking fair?

91
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:28,634
Now, this reflex to project
blame upon the victim

92
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:32,605
is going against the sorts of
habits we want to encourage.

93
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,776
Detective Bezzerides, how do
you feel about your actions?

94
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:40,529
Can I just ask, what the
fuck are you doing here?

95
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,200
Who wouldn't want her sexually
harassing you? Am I right?

96
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,318
See, that kind of thing there

97
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,704
could be considered
inappropriate.

98
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,906
What?
It was a compliment.

99
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,376
Oh, it's all right.
It's all right.

100
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:56,379
I understand.

101
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,831
But I don't know.

102
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:01,417
I mean, what can I say?

103
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,836
I...

104
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:07,640
just really like big dicks.

105
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,893
Yeah.

106
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:12,561
It's not just length.

107
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:16,148
Everybody's always
talking length, but-- it's fine.

108
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:20,436
I mean, girth, too.

109
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:24,323
I really want to have trouble
handcuffing the thing, like.

110
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:26,776
Um, I'm not sure--

111
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:29,195
you know,
that might be taken--

112
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:31,163
What?

113
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,199
I thought you wanted
me to share.

114
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,785
This is a safe circle, right?

115
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:37,787
- Hell, yes, it is.
- Hey, let her share, man.

116
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,455
- <i> Yeah.</i>
- <i> Yeah.</i>

117
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:45,511
<i>This man just received
a commendation for bravery</i>

118
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:47,797
<i>for one of the worst firefights
in LA County history.</i>

119
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:51,434
I don't think anyone would argue
Mr. Woodrugh's facility for killing.

120
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:52,388
All right, damn it--

121
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,746
We're amenable to putting
this entire matter behind us.

122
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:58,057
I just want to forget that this
terrible thing ever happened

123
00:07:58,109 --> 00:08:00,025
and get on with
getting my life back.

124
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:03,863
I did not do anything.

125
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:06,031
And I am innocent.

126
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:09,151
Black Mountain.
Pandhar village.

127
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:12,071
I wasn't there.

128
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:13,739
I wasn't at Pandhar.

129
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,825
How many men did you kill then?

130
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:18,577
How many at Vinci?

131
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:22,414
<i>We want any violation
involving this incident dropped.</i>

132
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:26,418
And we want Miss Lindel's earlier
probation violation expunged.

133
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:28,587
That was your publicist, right?

134
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:31,841
Got the tabloids
to try smearing him?

135
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:34,927
And now you feel okay
about dropping the allegation?

136
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,596
I've learned a lot in therapy.

137
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:39,265
I'm listening
to my higher power.

138
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,267
I saved lives in Vinci.

139
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:43,769
Oh, and did they fully account

140
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:46,188
for whose bullets
killed those civilians?

141
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,158
Yeah, they did.

142
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:52,495
I just don't want what happened
to me to happen to anybody else.

143
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,498
Detective Woodrugh works
insurance fraud now.

144
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:57,833
So you got him off the street.

145
00:08:57,869 --> 00:08:59,418
Congratulations.

146
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,670
<i>Are we still talking?</i>

147
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,789
<i>You're going for the
deal, so take it.</i>

148
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,424
She is a fucking liar.

149
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,210
<i>I think we're past
all the name-calling.</i>

150
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:12,381
<i>We could still pursue</i>
<i>a civil case, Mr. Woodrugh.</i>

151
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:15,718
Detective Woodrugh.

152
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:18,938
Rate's changed.

153
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:21,473
I need you to offer me
an old-times'-sake price.

154
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:24,143
Frank, man, this economy?

155
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,028
Start me a tab, Lloyd.

156
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:34,787
Frank Semyon?

157
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:37,456
Who are you?

158
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:40,659
Our name is Gonzales.
We work here.

159
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:46,131
How's that, friend?

160
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,884
We had an arrangement
with Santos.

161
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,838
Nobody's seen him.

162
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,506
Long time now.

163
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,259
We heard.

164
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,345
So it is time to ratify
our arrangement.

165
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:06,268
We never had one.

166
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,990
And I don't need partners.

167
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:16,445
Door's in
the same place, amigo.

168
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,540
Can I help you, Cisco Kid?

169
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:46,442
The fuck?

170
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:48,894
Frank, what the fuck
are you doing in here?

171
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:51,113
Ship seems a little
loose today.

172
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,034
Micro naps, Frank.

173
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:56,869
Michelangelo took 'em.

174
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:00,205
You remember Archeron
Waste Management?

175
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,740
You sold it off.

176
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:05,077
After we sprinkled that corridor
valley with heavy metals.

177
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,712
So?

178
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:09,715
So it's closed.

179
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,751
The guy I sold it to,
Ali Komunyakaa,

180
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:15,337
who I never saw finish a beer,

181
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:19,091
gets drunk and drives
off a hillside in Ventura.

182
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:22,695
All of a sudden.

183
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:25,771
Not everyone has our
physical fortitude, Frank.

184
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,252
Like Caspere.

185
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,821
Ben was king fuck
of pad pulling.

186
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:33,907
You deal with pimps,

187
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,826
you get pimpish results, Frank.

188
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,747
Couple months back,

189
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,501
you said that there were outside
interests looking at the poker room.

190
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:47,337
Who?

191
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,339
Foreign interests.

192
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:54,010
Some fuck.
I don't remember.

193
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:57,514
I haven't been in touch since.

194
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,682
Your boy hasn't
moved to Oakland.

195
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:00,934
I've noticed.

196
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,936
No.

197
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,021
But you moved to Glendale.

198
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,523
Shame, that.

199
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:08,358
Mm-hmm.

200
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,527
And your kid Tony.

201
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:14,197
My family ain't
your concern, boychik.

202
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:17,333
You've been running girls
through the poker room.

203
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,203
<i>Not so much</i>
<i>as a heads up to me.</i>

204
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,425
Penance is an extra
five a month.

205
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,927
Get out of my office, Frank.

206
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,180
Next time, wait
for an invitation.

207
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,850
I'll let you get back
to your process, then,

208
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,718
Michelangelo.

209
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:40,023
Mr. Semyon.

210
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:43,276
You don't direct me,
Khe Sanh motherfucker.

211
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:44,766
I'm Chinese.

212
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:47,530
Ben, go stand in front
of the fucking tank.

213
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,699
Mr. Velcoro
was a person of interest

214
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,568
in a state investigation
into corruption.

215
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,069
<i>Which yielded nothing.</i>

216
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,321
And after the firefight
in Vinci, he resigned

217
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,657
<i>under scrutiny and pending</i>
<i>a charge on substance abuse.</i>

218
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,375
<i>That's anecdotal hearsay.</i>

219
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,412
There's no record of my client
being reprimanded for drug use.

220
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,609
Would you submit
to a blood test, Mr. Velcoro?

221
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,179
Absolutely, Your Honor.

222
00:13:06,214 --> 00:13:07,133
Finally, Your Honor,

223
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,636
we are contesting
Mr. Velcoro's paternity

224
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:12,505
<i>and wish to establish whether he
even qualifies for father's rights.</i>

225
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:14,307
<i>- Objection.</i>
- Fucking assholes.

226
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:15,842
<i>You're not helping
your case, Mr. Velcoro.</i>

227
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,010
<i>Mrs. Brune was the victim</i>
<i>of an assault</i>

228
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,678
<i>during the period</i>
<i>of conception.</i>

229
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,514
<i>She believes the rapist to be the
biological father of her child.</i>

230
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:24,517
I raised that boy.
Am raising him.

231
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,319
It doesn't matter
where he comes--

232
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:28,104
Our position is that
it matters a great deal.

233
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,192
I trusted you.

234
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,327
- I trusted<i> you.</i>
- What does that mean?

235
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:37,363
I'll instruct the parties to refrain
from addressing one another.

236
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:38,998
Period.

237
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,751
<i>Now, I'm going to order a
paternity and toxicology test.</i>

238
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:43,253
<i>I'm ordering</i>
<i>supervised visitation</i>

239
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:46,289
<i>until both the paternity and
toxicology results are in.</i>

240
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,958
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

241
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,127
What, I gotta get a stranger
to chaperone me and my son?

242
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,347
<i>I've delivered my verdict.
Don't push me, Mr. Velcoro.</i>

243
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:57,634
Any revision at this point
would not be in your favor.

244
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:16,736
She never looked at me
like that before.

245
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:18,705
Like she hated me.

246
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,373
You really gonna test clean?

247
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:22,075
Yeah.

248
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,494
Yeah, 60 days now.

249
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,964
I want to fight this
however I can.

250
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:30,250
Then pull some more
cash together.

251
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,169
Tax-free or not, this
is gonna get expensive.

252
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,314
<i>You need more money?</i>

253
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:47,183
<i>I need more money.</i>

254
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,185
We're war rationing.

255
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:50,987
More work, then.

256
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:54,023
I can, you know, do
double shifts at the Lux.

257
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:55,858
This is for your kid?

258
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,493
Mm-hmm.

259
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,780
I might have a job for you.

260
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:02,615
The guy who bought
the waste company

261
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,118
we used in the corridor died.

262
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,704
Place has been cleaned out.

263
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,789
I'm gonna start listening
to the hot feeling

264
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:12,592
I got in the back of my neck.

265
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:14,043
I want you to tail Blake.

266
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:16,262
<i>I want to know what his
life is outside of me.</i>

267
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,598
I can do that.

268
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:22,302
What's your feeling?

269
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,053
Running girls?

270
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,939
Am I in confession?

271
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,808
No.

272
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,361
Just, um, never
seemed like you.

273
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,313
Maybe you're just not
very perceptive.

274
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,617
Ask you something?

275
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:41,954
You think those Mexes
really did Caspere?

276
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,075
I don't know.

277
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:49,495
It was bullshit
surveillance and...

278
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:53,966
the crash pad was a
fucking meth factory.

279
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,761
Caspere died

280
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,930
with five million
of my dollars cash.

281
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:12,268
Stan's killed.

282
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,071
I'm squeezed out
of the rail corridor.

283
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:18,608
The enemy won't
reveal itself, Raymond.

284
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,945
Stymies my retribution.

285
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,915
It's like, uh...

286
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,785
blue balls in your heart.

287
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,340
I'll see about
some shifts at the Lux.

288
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:35,958
But follow Blake.

289
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,511
He's gotten too smooth
for my peace of mind.

290
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:56,479
Oh, Paulie.
Oh, no.

291
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:58,948
I'm getting married.

292
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:01,150
I love her.

293
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:12,745
Her name is Emily.

294
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,580
How pregnant is she?

295
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:16,666
Almost four months.

296
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:20,052
Mother of God.

297
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,759
Of all the stupid...

298
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:32,181
You're a good-looking
white man.

299
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:35,184
And you want to get
in shoot-outs and...

300
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,187
become somebody's husband.

301
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:40,523
You could do anything you want.

302
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:43,493
Okay.

303
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,917
If I was a man,
I'd have had the world.

304
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,370
Dumb bastard.

305
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:12,188
No, no.

306
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:14,056
No, no, no.

307
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,025
No. Fuck.

308
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,616
You took it.

309
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:25,368
How the fuck could you?

310
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:27,069
Took what, Paulie?

311
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,572
You know what!

312
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,575
The money!

313
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:35,077
The money I brought back
from Afghanistan.

314
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,080
20 fucking thousand
dollars, Cynthia.

315
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:42,251
That bag?
Oh, Paulie.

316
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:44,837
You've been back four years.

317
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,639
I thought that was
something you left for me.

318
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:50,476
Something I--
I hid for, what, you to find?

319
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:53,763
That's my stake.

320
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,348
I'm having a kid.

321
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,316
Well, how would I know that?

322
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:00,653
I fucking bled for that money.

323
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,439
What did you do with it, slots?

324
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:06,526
Now listen.

325
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,744
You knew I was out of work.

326
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,364
I had every reason
to expect a little help.

327
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,032
I'm making a family.

328
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:14,917
I know that don't mean shit
to somebody like you,

329
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,786
but it fucking matters to me!

330
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:21,007
Don't you fucking tell me
I don't care about family.

331
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:23,042
I was a dancer,

332
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,211
but I carried you.

333
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:28,965
And I brought you up alone.

334
00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:32,184
You could have been
a scrape job.

335
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,021
You wouldn't even know
whose it was.

336
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:41,110
You ruined my career,

337
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:44,480
you ungrateful asshole.

338
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:49,318
I carried you for nine months

339
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,822
and I've been
carrying you ever since

340
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,874
with your weirdness.

341
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,628
You're strange.

342
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:01,797
All your good friends,
the boys.

343
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:06,385
Yeah, I know about you, Paulie.

344
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,220
Yeah, I know.

345
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:12,508
You shut your fucking mouth.

346
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,562
You fucking poisoned cooze.

347
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:24,987
Paul.

348
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,024
Paulie?

349
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,276
Wait.

350
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:36,332
I got this last week. The
police never found anything.

351
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,285
And you-- you said
you'd look into it.

352
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:42,338
She left this,
what, at a PO box?

353
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,206
Attached to my old address.

354
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:46,208
The bill took a while
to find us here.

355
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,211
<i>When I paid it,</i>
<i>they gave me the contents.</i>

356
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:51,297
You settling in okay?

357
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:00,022
<i>What's it mean?</i>

358
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,474
Looks like a party.

359
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,359
Did you follow up
with Sheriff's?

360
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:07,947
They got nothing.
I hear nothing.

361
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:10,533
I didn't want
to hand this over.

362
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:13,569
I thought--
when we talked,

363
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,455
I thought I could trust you.

364
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,632
Shit.

365
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,853
Fuck me.

366
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,405
Ain't you been warned
about that kind of talk?

367
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,366
Sorry you're down here.

368
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:04,120
And I know you don't believe it, but
I never put you under that bus.

369
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,505
Sheriff already knew
about you and me.

370
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,124
I took full responsibility.

371
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,843
Yeah, sure.
You're a real prince.

372
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:13,295
You'll be out of here
in a few months.

373
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,017
Look, somebody was trying
to do you, girl.

374
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:20,886
And if you had a few more friends, it
might have been harder to get done.

375
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:26,142
Hey, hey.

376
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,729
You remember that foreclosure
we served a couple months back?

377
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,647
The missing girl, Vera.

378
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,149
Yeah.

379
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,868
You said you had looked into her
old roommate's phone records,

380
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:38,320
found an address where
Vera last called from?

381
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:41,624
Yeah, it was up north.

382
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,993
Could you get me that?

383
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:46,378
You're here now.

384
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,916
Help me out with this
and I promise

385
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:54,053
to do a fearless and
searching moral inventory.

386
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,974
All right.

387
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:32,958
Loyalty's important

388
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,711
and usually painful.

389
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:39,682
One day you might find
cause to ask yourself

390
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:42,852
what the limit is to some
pain you're experiencing

391
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:45,304
and...

392
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:48,307
you'll find out
there is no limit at all.

393
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:52,228
<i>Pain is inexhaustible.</i>

394
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:56,732
It's only people
that get exhausted.

395
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:45,307
- Tony, how are you?
- Osip.

396
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,476
Always a pleasure.

397
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:49,845
Approval is most essential.

398
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:51,897
Let me see.

399
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:52,708
These books are bullshit.

400
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:56,045
Whatever they were actually making
here, I can't figure it out.

401
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,081
<i>That's expected.</i>
<i>We can wipe that clear.</i>

402
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,668
How about you?
How are you doing?

403
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,920
Where is this Santos character?

404
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,422
Used to own the place.

405
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,640
Wherever he is,
he ain't coming back.

406
00:27:08,676 --> 00:27:11,510
This is backslide city, Frank.

407
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:15,564
<i>I know what's going on out
there in the poker room now.</i>

408
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,733
We're not just running some club.
Come on.

409
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:22,488
What's happening now
is we are surviving.

410
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:25,107
All right?
We are rebuilding.

411
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:28,160
You were almost out of this
kind of thing when we met.

412
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:30,412
It was like you had a design.

413
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:34,283
That design does not work

414
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:38,370
once someone has stolen
all of our money.

415
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:41,924
The design does not work
when I am knee-deep in dirt.

416
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:44,343
You don't bring a kid
into a situation like this.

417
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:47,129
To what?
Where is this going?

418
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:49,214
Excuse me?

419
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:51,633
I thought this was a you
and me thing, first off.

420
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:54,803
It is, but it has to be about
something more than this.

421
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:56,388
God, Frank, I helped, I know,

422
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,807
but I don't want to be some
fucking gangster's wife.

423
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,443
You know that word bothers me.

424
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,229
Because, me, I didn't
ask for this world.

425
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:08,233
I took it as--
"gangster"?

426
00:28:09,703 --> 00:28:12,654
I was born drafted on the
wrong side of a class war.

427
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:14,706
So fuck that gangster shit.

428
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:18,043
You're a pimp now, Frank.
A dealer.

429
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,878
I don't mix with those people.

430
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:21,880
You know that.

431
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:25,334
I'm trying to stay above water
long enough so that we can--

432
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,670
those people, everything they
do, they would do anyway.

433
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:31,673
Crime exists contingent
on human desire.

434
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:33,725
These were the avenues left me.

435
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:36,178
And what's the expiration
date for all this?

436
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,513
Our child?

437
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,314
Our child is part
of the design.

438
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,517
And being legitimate
is part of the design.

439
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,353
Right now it's on hold.
You love me?

440
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,822
Then you're with me.

441
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:50,075
And maybe...

442
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,778
you love me
if you're not with me.

443
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,864
I understand.

444
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:58,033
But say so

445
00:28:58,035 --> 00:29:00,786
so we don't have to be
on these goddamn eggshells.

446
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:03,589
Like I'm not me
and you're not you.

447
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,799
I don't think
I can have kids, Frank.

448
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:17,386
<i>I've been pretending that
it might not be that way.</i>

449
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:19,605
<i>I thought maybe--</i>

450
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,559
but I went to the doctor alone.

451
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,561
<i>I had more than one.</i>

452
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,863
I had more than
one operation, I mean.

453
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:29,565
- I had three.
- Three?

454
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,066
- The fuck are you--
- <i> In my 20s.</i>

455
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:34,953
We don't think I can have one, a child.
I can't.

456
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:37,322
You--

457
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:40,459
You.
But why now, huh?

458
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:43,996
Maybe I'm less appealing
in current circumstances.

459
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,915
Why not tell me this when
I'm on top of the world?

460
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:49,251
Well, now I'm me.

461
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:52,054
And you're you.

462
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:55,257
And here we both are
out in the open.

463
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,092
So who loves who?

464
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,403
<i>This chicken looks good.</i>

465
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,689
<i>Did you use that recipe or...?</i>

466
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:13,108
- I did, yeah.
- Carlotta's recipe?

467
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,828
I did. I hope it comes out
as well as she makes it.

468
00:30:16,864 --> 00:30:18,614
- Here.
- Very nice.

469
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,250
- Oh.
- Thank you.

470
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:22,951
Thank you.

471
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:26,205
You know, we were just saying
that it'd be a good idea

472
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,924
for Mami to come stay with us
a while after the baby comes.

473
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,843
<i>And the wedding?
Speed up, I say.</i>

474
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:33,712
<i>You're doing it,</i>
<i>get on with it.</i>

475
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:35,464
<i>And you're gonna want me here.</i>

476
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,266
You have no idea
what you're in for.

477
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:39,468
Long nights.
No sleep.

478
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,303
Might get kind of cramped.

479
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:44,389
<i>I'll take the sofa in the living room.
I don't complain.</i>

480
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:48,310
An entire week on a boat, I'm four.
I don't complain.

481
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:51,063
Down in the hull eight days.

482
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,898
- Mama.
- What?

483
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,866
Is he gonna arrest me?

484
00:30:54,902 --> 00:30:57,986
Thank Jesus they got you
off that motorcycle.

485
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:01,156
Much better.
And you wear a suit now.

486
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:03,158
He's very handsome.

487
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,503
A couple of months back.

488
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,838
When I talked about adoption.

489
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,006
Jordan, I don't want--

490
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,842
I was thinking
about you as a kid,

491
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:23,395
what it would have meant

492
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,647
if somebody had
looked out for you.

493
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,317
If somebody had
taken care of you.

494
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:29,985
There's no bandwidth
for that right now.

495
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,354
I'm with you, Frank.

496
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:34,356
I love you.

497
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:38,026
But I don't want to see you
lose who you've become.

498
00:31:38,078 --> 00:31:40,028
And I don't mean the money.

499
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:44,333
And I want to thank you
for seeing me like that.

500
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:47,202
It fucking tears me up the way
you're having to live now.

501
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:49,338
My problem is with you
not coming to bed.

502
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:53,625
With both of us being half
in the bag each night.

503
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:55,794
I will find a way out.

504
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:59,548
The adoption,
you were so definite.

505
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,386
I think you were saying no
to the kid that you once were.

506
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:07,389
You were saying he was
somebody else's problem.

507
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:19,568
I'm going home.

508
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:25,290
You should make
some time to join me.

509
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,652
♪ waking up is harder... ♪

510
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:56,855
Spent all day in state's
evidence control.

511
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:59,574
Then Vinci PD.

512
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,443
Nobody had an answer.

513
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:03,245
<i>They just vanished.</i>

514
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,781
Well, looks like them.

515
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:08,617
But these would have to be
taken before Caspere died.

516
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,454
How you been?

517
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,423
Drinking more.

518
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,627
My hands get fucked up.

519
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:21,046
Shake, like.
You?

520
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:23,215
Talking to myself a lot.

521
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,851
Sticking to booze, though.
That's new.

522
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:34,426
So the diamonds from Caspere's safe
deposit went missing from evidence.

523
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:37,796
It ain't exactly unheard of.

524
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:40,932
This girl's missing.

525
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:44,803
Disappeared shortly before
Caspere's body turned up.

526
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:47,389
What did we keep hearing
about escort parties?

527
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:49,474
Powerful men.

528
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:52,861
I couldn't make them all,
but that's a state senator.

529
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,730
Look at this one.

530
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,531
Caspere.

531
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,734
This ain't the type of
party allows cameras.

532
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,286
What do you think?
Some kind of blackmail?

533
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:04,623
You really think
we cleared the Caspere case?

534
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,375
Those Mexicans?

535
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:10,045
They had items from
Caspere's house there.

536
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,713
Fingerprints.
What do you care?

537
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,549
These people put you
in a cage, Bezzerides.

538
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,803
This girl's gone missing.

539
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,172
Nobody cares.

540
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:23,975
The interior's poisoned
and suddenly worth billions,

541
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:26,011
nobody cares.

542
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:28,647
Bunch of people
got shot to shit,

543
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:31,233
nobody fucking cares.

544
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:37,773
Well, I'm not a cop anymore.

545
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,192
And you're not
a detective last I heard.

546
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:46,031
Nope, you do security
for some comeback mobster

547
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,365
and I log evidence.

548
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,701
I do consultation.

549
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:53,505
And you should get out.
You're too good for 'em.

550
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,707
You hear about the kid?

551
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:58,710
I mean, fraud investigations?

552
00:34:58,712 --> 00:35:01,630
He was a fucking
god warrior that day.

553
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,466
Yeah.
I talked to him.

554
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:07,052
He's miserable.

555
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:08,220
Belongs in the field.

556
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:10,272
Then he should quit, too.

557
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:15,443
Why didn't Dixon make that
place for a cookhouse, huh?

558
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:17,479
I don't know.

559
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:19,114
'Cause he's a wet brain alky.

560
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:22,284
I have this new program, see.

561
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:24,452
Because my powers of influence

562
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:27,823
are so meager in this
sublunar world of ours,

563
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,209
I try to limit the people
I can disappoint.

564
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:32,627
And I make sure
to know the difference

565
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,213
between my obligations
and somebody else's.

566
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:45,590
♪ breaking up is harder ♪

567
00:35:45,642 --> 00:35:48,977
♪ than it seems... ♪

568
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:51,730
Don't do that.
It was-- it was--

569
00:35:51,765 --> 00:35:54,399
it was good seeing you.

570
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:56,601
I didn't realize
you had been on my mind.

571
00:35:58,272 --> 00:36:02,741
<i>♪ pictures on the mantel ♪</i>

572
00:36:02,776 --> 00:36:07,028

Some Lee Marvin movie on TCM.

576
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:33,555
Maybe something light.

577
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:35,941
I don't care what we watch.

578
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:08,924
What's it matter?

579
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,976
Your boss moved off all this.

580
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:13,395
- Pretty cleanly, too.
- That's my point.

581
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,597
We closed the Vinci investigation
and Geldof announces

582
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:18,183
a governor's run with a
suddenly massive war chest.

583
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:20,018
So he had his hand out.
That what this is?

584
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,520
You holding your hand out?
Where's my cut?

585
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:25,357
A real attorney general could
do a lot of good in this state.

586
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,691
Has she got to you
with her missing girl?

587
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:29,611
And you, what, are you
just looking for trouble?

588
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,865
I need to be in the field.

589
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:35,867
I'm not happy either
how things played.

590
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:39,120
<i>Geldof's actions are the
clearest indication of collusion</i>

591
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:42,257
between the Vinci power structure
and the larger state institutions.

592
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:44,426
And it wouldn't hurt
your job prospects

593
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,544
having dirt
on the future governor.

594
00:37:46,546 --> 00:37:50,715
I'm putting together a confidential
special investigation.

595
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:53,385
Stated goal is to track
down Irina Rulfo,

596
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,303
the girl who pawned that shit,
brought you all to this place.

597
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:57,389
You know she was
never brought in.

598
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:58,890
What's the real purpose?

599
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:01,476
Finding out who killed Caspere.

600
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:03,228
<i>Uncovering evidence</i>
<i>of collusion</i>

601
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,030
<i>between Vinci PD,</i>
<i>mayor's office,</i>

602
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:06,815
AG, and any other state bodies.

603
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,533
You know I'm not a cop anymore.

604
00:38:08,568 --> 00:38:10,402
You have your PI license.
I checked.

605
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,987
I could detail you
as a state attorney's

606
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,905
investigator
into a missing person.

607
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:17,075
I need people who aren't
gonna ping on our radar.

608
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,243
Word gets out
what we're looking for,

609
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,828
they could shut it down
like last time.

610
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,380
I got a job.

611
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,418
Thanks, but no.

612
00:38:27,587 --> 00:38:29,421
That job gonna get you
your kid back?

613
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:34,759
What do you know about him?

614
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:37,062
I know it's not
looking good for you.

615
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:39,931
State Attorney's office
could intercede

616
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:42,317
on your behalf
with Family Services.

617
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:44,436
Recommendations, testimony.

618
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,939
I could make sure
you keep your boy.

619
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:56,114
Well, they never found
the camera and the hard drive.

620
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,618
I don't think the person
who shotgunned me

621
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,089
was one of those maniacs
at the shoot-out either.

622
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,124
While we're talking...

623
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:11,963
I want to look at some
of this land up north.

624
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:14,265
Might have a line on those
hooker parties, too.

625
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,551
A lot of money there.

626
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:19,471
If it's a place, deals go
down, we need to look at it.

627
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:20,889
You can't be cleared for this.

628
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,390
<i>She's taking vacation time.</i>

629
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:25,026
I'm placing her as a
confidential investigator.

630
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,978
Means I don't have
to register her.

631
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,730
I can follow up
on the diamonds.

632
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:31,116
Why Caspere had them.
Why they're missing.

633
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:32,951
Why the girl had
photographs of them.

634
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:35,703
I guess my million-dollar
question is why me?

635
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:37,789
You're out of the system.

636
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:40,575
You know Vinci PD.

637
00:39:40,627 --> 00:39:43,328
Properly motivated, you're a
good bet to get the dirt.

638
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:47,298
<i>Think it over, Velcoro.</i>

639
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:51,386
Never too late
to start all over again.

640
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,767
You let me keep my kid,

641
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,569
I'm in.

642
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:11,439
Get started.
You're on the clock.

643
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:13,024
I want daily reports.

644
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:17,912
Wasn't it you who thought I was
the worst of these people?

645
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:22,917
Saw that rumor about you
killing a guy was bullshit.

646
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,953
Figured maybe
the rest of it was, too.

647
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,205
How'd you decide
it was just a rumor?

648
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:29,374
I thought you knew.

649
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,043
They caught the guy.

650
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:35,547
<i>I assumed maybe</i>
<i>your ex told you.</i>

651
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,935
What do you mean
caught the guy?

652
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,387
A few weeks back,

653
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:45,440
guy got pulled in for
sexual assault in Venice.

654
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:47,559
DNA matched six unsolved rapes,

655
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:50,728
<i>including</i>
<i>your ex-wife's kit.</i>

656
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:54,232
<i>He'll get life, sounds like.</i>

657
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,907
Get results.

658
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,243
I'll make sure
you keep your kid.

659
00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:35,735
<i>Frank, thanks for coming.</i>

660
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:38,605
My position is you
people owe me some land.

661
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:41,074
I'd have a hard time
convincing my board of that.

662
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:45,245
Imagine word
of how that corridor's

663
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,114
gotten bought up
over the past five years.

664
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:50,533
How exactly it came
to be so cheap.

665
00:41:57,008 --> 00:41:59,375
I can't see that
being of any interest.

666
00:41:59,427 --> 00:42:04,380
A waste removal service poisons park and
farmland along the central valleys.

667
00:42:04,432 --> 00:42:06,766
A major California landowner

668
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,552
<i>committed to real estate</i>
<i>development steps in.</i>

669
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:11,721
You're reaching.

670
00:42:11,756 --> 00:42:15,775
Archeron Waste Management
is dissolved.

671
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:19,445
The guy I sold it to
ran himself off the road.

672
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:21,781
You know anything about that?

673
00:42:22,984 --> 00:42:25,034
There might still be
something for you.

674
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,736
Why I called.

675
00:42:26,738 --> 00:42:29,239
Let me ask, have you
ever heard of Caspere

676
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:33,710
possessing
a collection of films?

677
00:42:33,745 --> 00:42:35,962
Home movies.

678
00:42:35,997 --> 00:42:37,797
A hard drive full of them.

679
00:42:39,301 --> 00:42:42,051
If you're interested
in doing something for us...

680
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:45,805
it could put you
back in the corridor.

681
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:51,427
Somebody's got that hard drive.

682
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:55,064
I know the police never found
it in either of his houses.

683
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,766
What about the Mexicans?

684
00:42:56,768 --> 00:42:58,101
Did Caspere?

685
00:42:58,103 --> 00:42:59,402
I'm no detective,

686
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:01,738
but it might be
a good place to start.

687
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:04,107
If you believe they're
the ones that did it.

688
00:43:10,782 --> 00:43:13,283
Five parcels,

689
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:15,118
gifted,

690
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,253
I find that hard drive.

691
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:48,318
Oh, yes, I remember you.

692
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,621
Correct?
How can I help you?

693
00:43:51,656 --> 00:43:54,457
I'm here to help you, Doc.

694
00:43:54,492 --> 00:43:58,077
I'm here to help you keep all
that cosmetic work intact.

695
00:43:59,664 --> 00:44:01,881
I can't imagine we have
anything to talk about, sir.

696
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:04,334
I fully cooperated
with you last we spoke.

697
00:44:04,336 --> 00:44:06,469
Well, maybe that's on me

698
00:44:06,504 --> 00:44:08,721
not asking the right questions.

699
00:44:12,677 --> 00:44:16,012
You and Chessani, girls,
human trafficking.

700
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:17,931
You do their implants,
nose jobs.

701
00:44:17,983 --> 00:44:21,150
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

702
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:22,769
I'm a psychiatrist.

703
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:25,939
With a secondary concentration
in reconstructive surgery.

704
00:44:25,991 --> 00:44:27,857
You, Chessani, Caspere,

705
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:30,326
you went back farther
than you made out.

706
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:33,696
The girls, spill.

707
00:44:33,748 --> 00:44:36,950
Your compensatory
projection of menace

708
00:44:37,002 --> 00:44:38,868
is a guarantor of its lack.

709
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,921
And it says something
about the depths

710
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:44,040
of your misperceptions.

711
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:03,276
Kind of day I've had,

712
00:45:03,311 --> 00:45:06,396
seeing you pop a few stitches
might start to make up for it.

713
00:45:06,398 --> 00:45:09,365
<i>Pin-eyed motherfucker.</i>

714
00:45:09,401 --> 00:45:11,617
Hooker parties.

715
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:15,038
What you'd call affluent men.

716
00:45:15,073 --> 00:45:16,739
Caspere attended.

717
00:45:18,243 --> 00:45:19,292
Go.

718
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:22,495
I just--
I just do work on girls.

719
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:24,247
Make eights into 10s.

720
00:45:24,249 --> 00:45:26,666
Make sure they have the proper
prescriptions, that's it.

721
00:45:34,509 --> 00:45:36,142
The parties are a safe place,

722
00:45:36,177 --> 00:45:37,760
a conclave
for men of influence.

723
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:41,514
Talk motivations or I'll dig
into that face-lift and yank.

724
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,988
Caspere concocted the idea of
the parties with Tony Chessani.

725
00:45:49,024 --> 00:45:51,941
<i>Tony's a pimp</i>
<i>with political ambition.</i>

726
00:45:51,993 --> 00:45:55,194
His father doesn't participate
in the gatherings.

727
00:45:55,246 --> 00:45:56,946
Tony's service
makes him friends

728
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:59,165
with those men of affluence
you mentioned.

729
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,118
Lays the groundwork for deals
that Caspere facilitated.

730
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,336
What else?

731
00:46:03,371 --> 00:46:05,955
I th-- I think both men
used the occasions

732
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:09,292
to compile potential blackmail
material on their guests.

733
00:46:09,294 --> 00:46:12,512
Rumored Ben had footage

734
00:46:12,547 --> 00:46:14,630
of various important people.

735
00:46:14,632 --> 00:46:15,965
<i>McCandless.</i>

736
00:46:16,017 --> 00:46:17,633
Who?

737
00:46:17,685 --> 00:46:19,552
He's the president of Santa
Clara Railroad Company.

738
00:46:19,604 --> 00:46:22,021
It's smaller now.
Called Catalast.

739
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:30,863
You go back with the Chessanis.

740
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:36,035
You put his first wife
in a mental hospital.

741
00:46:36,071 --> 00:46:38,821
Yeah, I did every--

742
00:46:38,823 --> 00:46:41,157
I did everything--

743
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:45,628
I did everything
I could for Helene.

744
00:46:47,382 --> 00:46:49,298
Certain traditions
of the Chessani patriarchs

745
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:52,085
she had a difficult time with.

746
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:54,170
They are...

747
00:46:54,222 --> 00:46:58,174
you might say,
a highly inventive family.

748
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:11,571
Might be tough to
get back into that scene.

749
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:14,857
But not impossible, right?

750
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:17,276
Look for the pieces
that are solid,

751
00:47:17,328 --> 00:47:18,528
that haven't been
hollowed out yet

752
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,530
with, like, a smooth surface.

753
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:24,250
Say you lost
your job, whatever.

754
00:47:24,285 --> 00:47:27,036
Just some story. You need
to work the next party.

755
00:47:27,038 --> 00:47:30,923
I don't-- I don't know if I can get
in touch with those girls.

756
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:33,960
They weren't exactly stable.

757
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:36,262
I'm getting
really good at this.

758
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:37,847
Not like hers.

759
00:47:37,882 --> 00:47:41,050
If you can get a line
on an invite,

760
00:47:41,102 --> 00:47:43,469
I need to look into it.

761
00:47:43,521 --> 00:47:45,521
This girl's missing.

762
00:47:45,557 --> 00:47:47,223
There's other stuff.

763
00:47:47,225 --> 00:47:49,308
Something else?

764
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,943
After that shooting?

765
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:52,979
You haven't talked about it.

766
00:47:53,031 --> 00:47:56,232
Dad asks and says that
you won't call him back.

767
00:47:56,234 --> 00:47:58,401
I'm busy.
Work.

768
00:47:59,904 --> 00:48:03,573
I wondered why you were so
hot to hit the beach today.

769
00:48:05,076 --> 00:48:08,544
I tried weighing if it was
worth the price of a lecture.

770
00:48:10,665 --> 00:48:12,882
I'm not in a spot
to give those.

771
00:48:15,086 --> 00:48:16,669
Did I tell you
I got into CalArts?

772
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:20,423
You--
that's great.

773
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:21,924
Awesome.

774
00:48:21,976 --> 00:48:23,426
Thank you.

775
00:48:23,478 --> 00:48:26,229
- Congratulations. Jeez.
- Thanks.

776
00:48:27,732 --> 00:48:31,267
I should, uh--
I should buy you dinner.

777
00:48:33,438 --> 00:48:38,107
Maybe I can reach out to a couple
of the girls that I knew before.

778
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:43,496
For the straight up purpose of
getting<i> me</i> into that party, okay?

779
00:48:43,531 --> 00:48:46,749
Aren't you supposed
to be behind a desk?

780
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:49,335
I just started my vacation.

781
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:52,171
Going anywhere special?

782
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:54,290
Yep. Guerneville.

783
00:48:54,342 --> 00:48:55,925
You homesick?

784
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,795
For a place you hate, you never
really got that far away.

785
00:49:19,651 --> 00:49:21,817
<i>An excess of boron
produces the color.</i>

786
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:24,320
<i>Now, most of your colored</i>
<i>diamonds are of low quality,</i>

787
00:49:24,372 --> 00:49:27,657
<i>but something like these</i>
<i>with such a rich hue,</i>

788
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:29,659
it's just very rare.

789
00:49:29,661 --> 00:49:31,160
And the cut, octahedron,

790
00:49:31,162 --> 00:49:33,546
these must almost
certainly be stolen.

791
00:49:33,581 --> 00:49:35,164
I told the other
policeman the same.

792
00:49:36,718 --> 00:49:38,551
What other policeman?

793
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:40,503
Oh, a few months back,
a detective came by

794
00:49:40,555 --> 00:49:42,221
with pictures
of identical diamonds.

795
00:49:42,257 --> 00:49:46,175
Wanted to know if anybody had come
around maybe trying to sell them.

796
00:49:46,177 --> 00:49:47,843
I told him I read
the pawn sheets regular

797
00:49:47,845 --> 00:49:49,345
and I haven't seen them listed.

798
00:49:49,347 --> 00:49:52,265
He tells me they don't want
the stolens on any sheets.

799
00:49:52,317 --> 00:49:55,101
So he gives me his card,

800
00:49:55,153 --> 00:49:56,852
says to let him know
if I hear anything.

801
00:49:56,904 --> 00:49:59,322
- You still have that card?
- Yeah.

802
00:50:01,943 --> 00:50:04,944
He was a portly man.
Smelled like bourbon.

803
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:09,498
<i>Flatulent, too.</i>

804
00:50:09,534 --> 00:50:11,367
Hmm.

805
00:50:13,538 --> 00:50:17,740
<i>The thing is, when Dixon
came around about the diamonds,</i>

806
00:50:17,742 --> 00:50:20,994
it would have been before we
found the safety deposit box.

807
00:50:21,046 --> 00:50:23,546
So he knew about the diamonds
before we found them.

808
00:50:23,581 --> 00:50:26,215
And in which case, why not
put them on the hot sheets?

809
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:29,052
My ex-partner
got this address

810
00:50:29,087 --> 00:50:31,421
where the missing girl
last called from.

811
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:35,258
Spot was on Caspere's GPS, too.

812
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:37,810
Mmm.

813
00:50:37,846 --> 00:50:40,313
Seems like a happening place.

814
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:45,151
Used to be this commune here

815
00:50:45,186 --> 00:50:47,603
on the River Valley.

816
00:50:58,783 --> 00:51:00,750
Why did you say--

817
00:51:02,253 --> 00:51:04,537
so that man that you tracked
down, that was a lie?

818
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:08,091
No, I--
I don't understand.

819
00:51:08,126 --> 00:51:10,460
They caught him weeks ago.

820
00:51:10,462 --> 00:51:13,046
Called me in.

821
00:51:13,098 --> 00:51:14,797
Richard came with me.

822
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:18,017
He's a serial rapist.

823
00:51:18,053 --> 00:51:21,104
DNA matched the kit that
they took on me back then.

824
00:51:22,307 --> 00:51:24,107
Did you just make it up?

825
00:51:24,142 --> 00:51:26,642
What you said?

826
00:51:28,646 --> 00:51:31,314
I...

827
00:51:31,316 --> 00:51:33,449
Why?

828
00:51:33,485 --> 00:51:36,119
Why would you do that?

829
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:37,987
So-- so, what?

830
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:41,874
So you can make me think that you
were protecting me or something?

831
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,327
It's--

832
00:51:44,379 --> 00:51:46,712
it's not--
it's not what I--

833
00:51:46,748 --> 00:51:49,665
That ruined everything, Ray.

834
00:51:50,802 --> 00:51:53,386
That ruined you.

835
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:58,057
That's why I have to have
the paternity test.

836
00:51:59,677 --> 00:52:02,011
I have to know.

837
00:52:02,981 --> 00:52:05,848
I have to know so I can...

838
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,733
put it all where
it's supposed to be.

839
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:10,853
I don't want to live
this fantasy

840
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:13,072
about Chad with you anymore.

841
00:52:14,075 --> 00:52:15,858
He should have the truth

842
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,693
when he's ready.

843
00:52:17,745 --> 00:52:19,779
This--

844
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:21,614
this fake story

845
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:23,366
where we made
a family has to end.

846
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,212
He set me up.

847
00:52:36,214 --> 00:52:37,880
Frank.

848
00:52:37,882 --> 00:52:40,600
I don't know
what that means, Ray.

849
00:52:54,983 --> 00:52:56,899
You serious?

850
00:52:56,951 --> 00:52:58,901
About the adoption?

851
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:04,073
It meant something
to me, what you said.

852
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:09,996
I want to thank you
for telling me that.

853
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:16,969
We both could have used
different parents.

854
00:53:31,436 --> 00:53:34,437
Don't worry about kids now.

855
00:53:34,439 --> 00:53:36,856
This is between you and me.

856
00:53:55,927 --> 00:53:58,344
Seems like nobody's been home.

857
00:54:16,364 --> 00:54:17,730
Want to call local?

858
00:54:17,815 --> 00:54:19,448
<i>Get us in here?</i>

859
00:54:31,663 --> 00:54:33,496
Now we're following birds.

860
00:54:33,498 --> 00:54:35,998
Carrion birds.

861
00:54:50,064 --> 00:54:52,481
You smell that?

862
00:54:52,517 --> 00:54:54,567
What, bird shit?

863
00:55:30,605 --> 00:55:32,521
It's arterial spray.

864
00:55:35,393 --> 00:55:37,109
<i>Jesus.</i>

865
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,568
The ceiling's clean.

866
00:55:47,238 --> 00:55:49,572
No water stains.

867
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:59,131
I like it here.

868
00:56:00,585 --> 00:56:03,169
Really.

869
00:56:03,221 --> 00:56:05,971
We didn't need all that room.

870
00:56:06,007 --> 00:56:08,307
Don't talk like that.
Come on.

871
00:56:10,395 --> 00:56:14,063
There's a guy,
McCandless, Catalast...

872
00:56:14,098 --> 00:56:16,232
Leave business.

873
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:22,738
We should sell the clubs.

874
00:56:26,577 --> 00:56:28,911
Buy a farm.

875
00:56:28,946 --> 00:56:32,948
Grow organic produce.

876
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,084
I could see us as farmers.

877
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,002
Mmm.

878
00:56:37,038 --> 00:56:38,871
You would run for a plane

879
00:56:38,923 --> 00:56:40,790
the first time
you smelled shit.

880
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:43,092
Trust me.

881
00:56:45,213 --> 00:56:47,129
I worked as a picker.

882
00:56:48,966 --> 00:56:52,101
I was 14.

883
00:56:52,136 --> 00:56:53,886
15.

884
00:56:56,023 --> 00:56:57,857
You don't want
to grow anything.

885
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:20,880
What about this guy?

886
00:57:22,216 --> 00:57:25,668
There's something I might
be able to do for him.

887
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,636
If I can,

888
00:57:27,672 --> 00:57:30,256
we can get it all back.

889
00:57:30,308 --> 00:57:32,341
Do you trust him?

890
00:57:32,393 --> 00:57:34,343
I trust self-interest.

891
00:57:40,852 --> 00:57:42,518
Stay here.

892
00:57:44,238 --> 00:57:47,356
I'm fucking coming!
Shut the fuck up!

893
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:15,801
Got a fucking problem?

894
00:58:15,887 --> 00:58:17,553
You alone?

895
00:58:17,555 --> 00:58:20,055
Yeah. Why?

896
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,727
You and me need to talk.
