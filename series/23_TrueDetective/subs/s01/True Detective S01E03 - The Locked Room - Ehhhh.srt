00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:01,455
_

2
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:03,769
You know, she's always been
in some kind of trouble.

3
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:05,651
I thought things
were getting better.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,149
Got away from Charlie.

5
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:09,273
She called up here
for you not too long ago.

6
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:11,684
She come out
she's going to become a nun.

7
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:14,281
What'd you do last night?

8
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:15,983
I was out with girlfriends.

9
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:18,287
I can't meet a nice man at home.

10
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:21,171
There is nowhere else
I want to be.

11
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:22,880
I wonder if you even
know you're lying.

12
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:24,429
Come on!

13
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:27,015
I got a whodunit where
my two detectives are stalling,

14
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,915
and I got a task force
wants to take it off our hands.

15
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:31,943
So Cohle didn't want
to give it to the task force.

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,987
- Did you?
- No.

17
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:36,680
I heard of this place.
Kind of trailer park.

18
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:37,920
Called "The Ranch."

19
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:39,029
Something happened to a girl.

20
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:40,890
We need to know if
any of you knew her.

21
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:42,462
Yeah, that's Dori.

22
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:45,438
You got any idea where she might have
been staying the last few weeks?

23
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:47,227
She'd been going to church.

24
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:50,646
I was hoping maybe she
just turned things around.

25
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:52,048
_

26
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:53,403
Place is trashed.

27
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,338
This ain't no kinda anything.

28
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:57,422
Marty.

True Detective - 1x03
"The Locked Room"

47
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:17,377
You were as blind to Him
as your footprints in the ashes,

48
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,111
but He saw you.

49
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,647
He saw you
in those dark corners.

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,511
He heard you--

51
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:29,477
Oh, my brothers,
He heard those thoughts.

52
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,749
Yes!
Preach it.

53
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:34,651
- Amen!
- Yes!

54
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:36,452
Yes.
Glory.

55
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:39,985
You are stranger to yourself,
and yet He knows you...

56
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,888
- Amen.
- Yes. He does, sir.

57
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,256
...and when your heart hardened,
made you liken to the stone,

58
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:47,758
and broke you from His body,

59
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,756
which is the stars
and the wind between the stars,

60
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,324
He knew you.

61
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,128
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

62
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,823
He knew you.
That is forever.

63
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:58,160
Amen, brother!

64
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:01,262
This world is a veil...

65
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:03,596
- Amen.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:06,604
- Tell them.
- Hallelujah.

67
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:10,468
...and the face you wear
is not your own.

68
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:13,538
Parish FD said
the church burned down

69
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,073
4 months earlier, no prints,

70
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:20,378
put out an APB
on Friends of Christ.

71
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:25,421
Week later,
we were in Franklin,

72
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:29,157
um, Revival Ministry,

73
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,831
old-time religion.

74
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:34,799
You can imagine what
Mr. Charisma thought of that.

75
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:36,767
It is merely the limitation
of your senses.

76
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,167
What do you
think the average IQ

77
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,268
of this group is, huh?

78
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:45,274
Can you see Texas up there
on your high horse?

79
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:48,075
What do you know
about these people?

80
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:51,074
Just observation and deduction.

81
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:53,881
I see a propensity
for obesity, poverty,

82
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:56,384
a yen for fairy tales,

83
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,248
folks putting what
few bucks they do have

84
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,649
into little, wicker baskets

85
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,249
being passed around.

86
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:02,687
I think it's safe to say
that nobody here

87
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,555
is gonna be splitting
the atom, Marty.

88
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:09,355
You see that?
Your fucking attitude.

89
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:12,027
Not everybody want to sit
alone in a empty room

90
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,658
beating off to murder manuals.

91
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:19,095
Some folks enjoy
community, the common good.

92
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,664
Yeah? Well,
if the common good

93
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,199
has got to make up fairy tales,

94
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:25,027
then it's not good for anybody.

95
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:28,498
Your sorrows
pin you to this place.

96
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:31,298
They divide you
from what your heart knows,

97
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,634
and there are a lot
of good hearts out there.

98
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:33,770
I'm looking out there.

99
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:35,874
I'm seeing a lot
of good hearts out there.

100
00:05:35,907 --> 00:05:38,040
I see a lot of joy out there.

101
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:39,911
I mean, can you imagine

102
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:42,077
if people didn't believe,

103
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,373
what things they'd get up to?

104
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:46,479
Exact same thing they do now,

105
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,582
just out in the open.

106
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,886
Bull...shit.

107
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,119
It'd be a fucking
freak show of murder

108
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,888
and debauchery,
and you know it.

109
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:57,727
If the only thing
keeping a person decent

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,062
is the expectation
of divine reward,

111
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,566
then, brother, that person

112
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:04,198
is a piece of shit,
and I'd like to get

113
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,797
as many of them out in the open

114
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,438
as possible.

115
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:09,869
I guess your judgment
is infallible

116
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,572
piece-of-shitwise.

117
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:17,578
Do you think that notebook
is a stone tablet?

118
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:23,814
What's it say about life, hmm,

119
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:28,883
you got to get together,
tell yourself stories

120
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:32,225
that violate every law
of the universe

121
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,921
just to get through
the goddamn day?

122
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:35,689
No.

123
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,161
What's that say about
your reality, Marty?

124
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:41,529
When you get
to talking like this,

125
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:44,266
you sound panicked.

126
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:45,737
You figure
it's all a scam, huh,

127
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,401
all them folks?

128
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,607
Mm-hmm.

129
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,903
They just wrong?

130
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:51,703
Oh, yeah.

131
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,677
Been that way since one
monkey looked at the sun

132
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,206
and told the other monkey,

133
00:06:56,247 --> 00:07:00,717
"He said for you to give
me your fucking share."

134
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,115
People so goddamn frail
they'd rather

135
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,219
put a coin in a wishing well

136
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,523
than buy dinner.

137
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:14,490
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,
Your arms open and close.

138
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:16,129
The echoes of my life
could never contain

139
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:17,695
a single truth about You.

140
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,158
You move the feather
in the ash.

141
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:21,229
You touch the leaf
with its flame.

142
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:22,556
- Amen!
- Amen.

143
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:24,765
Transference of
fear and self-loathing

144
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:27,029
to an authoritarian vessel.

145
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,269
It's catharsis.

146
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:31,700
He absorbs their dread
with his narrative.

147
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,834
Because of this, he's effective

148
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,739
in proportion to the
amount of certainty

149
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,613
he can project.

150
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:39,581
- Yeah! - Yeah!
- Yeah.

151
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:41,548
Certain linguistic
anthropologists think

152
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,380
that religion is
a language virus

153
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:47,486
that rewrites
pathways in the brain,

154
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,524
dulls critical thinking.

155
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:54,059
Well, I don't use
$10 words as much as you,

156
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:57,795
but for a guy who sees
no point in existence,

157
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:01,101
you sure fret about it
an awful lot,

158
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:04,866
and you still sound panicked.

159
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:08,873
At least I'm not racing
to a red light.

160
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:14,442
...every self-doubt
because he knows it.

161
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:18,576
See, we all got
what I call a life trap,

162
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:22,446
this gene-deep certainty
that things will be different,

163
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,852
that you'll move
to another city

164
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,484
and meet the people
that'll be the friends

165
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:27,947
for the rest of your life,

166
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:30,953
that you'll fall in love
and be fulfilled.

167
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:35,962
Fucking fulfillment,
heh, and closure,

168
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,026
whatever the fuck
those two--

169
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,794
Fucking empty jars
to hold this shitstorm,

170
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:45,199
and nothing is ever fulfilled

171
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:49,067
until the very end,
and closure--

172
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,267
No. No, no.
Nothing is ever over.

173
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,741
Minister Theriot,

174
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,942
do you recognize this girl?

175
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,512
I don't know for sure.

176
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:08,512
Wonderful sermon.

177
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:09,551
Well, thank you for coming.

178
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:11,287
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

179
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,551
I want to say it's--

180
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,286
Thank you.

181
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:17,823
I don't remember the name,

182
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:20,294
came pretty regularly
when we was in Eunice,

183
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,789
but I can't be sure.

184
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,724
We get around since then.

185
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:25,661
You? Oh, hello.

186
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:27,597
No. You're right.
We saw her in Eunice.

187
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,397
Tina might know her.

188
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,067
Mm-hmm.

189
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,668
How long were you in Eunice?

190
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:35,635
About 6 months.

191
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:37,738
Widow in Opelousas
leased us cheap.

192
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:39,105
We left when it caught fire.

193
00:09:39,138 --> 00:09:41,408
Any idea how that happened?

194
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:44,238
Your people said
criminal mischief.

195
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,611
If I was to lay odds,
maybe one of the widow's sons

196
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:49,346
wanted us off the land,
but we move on.

197
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,074
We seek no title
nor retribution.

198
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:52,713
I'm gonna go find David.

199
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:53,744
Okay.

200
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:55,943
Yeah.
Great preaching.

201
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:57,550
How long you been doing this?

202
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,952
Been preaching almost 20 years.

203
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:03,121
We've had Friends of Christ
for the last 8.

204
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:04,886
You with a church before that?

205
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,851
Independent evangelical.

206
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:09,587
I came up under
Billy Lee Tuttle,

207
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,491
went to his college in
Baton Rouge a couple years.

208
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:14,528
So back in Eunice,

209
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:17,357
who painted the mural
on the church wall?

210
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,557
Children from our
congregation painted it.

211
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:24,229
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:25,729
Something happen to this girl?

213
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,230
You looking for her?

214
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:29,027
Mr. Theriot, can we see
the identification

215
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,932
of your staff members?

216
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:35,234
You ever see her with anybody?

217
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,368
Wasn't she with
someone the one day?

218
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:40,764
You remember?
The tall man.

219
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:42,499
Yeah, but I don't know

220
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:44,802
if she was "with him" with him.

221
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:48,835
Well, can you describe him?

222
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:52,380
I just saw them talking.

223
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:54,309
I didn't get close or anything.

224
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:58,115
He was hunched forward
talking to her,

225
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:02,283
kind of a strange face,
I think,

226
00:11:02,324 --> 00:11:04,587
skin shiny around his jaw.

227
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,156
Ah, what, like burned?

228
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:12,426
Uh-huh.

229
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:14,963
So did she leave with him?

230
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:17,805
Yeah, maybe like that.

231
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:20,038
Arrested 10/89 on a 314,

232
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:23,171
spent last year in solitary
after a gang altercation.

233
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:24,409
Print and hold.
Thank you.

234
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:26,074
Copy that.

235
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:47,147
Everything check out?

236
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,821
For the most part.

237
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:53,689
Burt, you spent two
years in Angola--

238
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:56,487
indecency, public exposure,

239
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,390
whacking off outside a school.

240
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,657
They gave me bad medicine.
I didn't know.

241
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,193
I paid for that.
I paid for that.

242
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:12,129
Can you account
for his whereabouts

243
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:15,268
December 25 through January 3?

244
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,668
Yeah. Christmas
to New Year's,

245
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:17,804
we was in New Roads.

246
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,043
Shouldn't be a problem
to find people

247
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:21,107
who'll vouch for
Burt's whereabouts.

248
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,843
We had a good turnout there.

249
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,883
Good turnout in--

250
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:28,853
Detective, what is it
you think happened?

251
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,283
Someone killed this girl,
made a big show of it...

252
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,553
left a painting
of the crime scene

253
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,392
on one of your old churches.

254
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:42,864
"I am the resurrection
and the light

255
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:45,769
for those
who believe in me."

256
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:52,074
Was she raped, Detective?

257
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,042
Why would you ask that?

258
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:05,552
If you speak to Burt alone,

259
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,657
I believe you'll be
adequately convinced

260
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,489
of his innocence, Detective.

261
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:13,697
Okay. Let's do that.

262
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,733
Burt, go with the Detective.

263
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:22,039
The ontological fallacy
of expecting

264
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:23,777
a light at the end
of the tunnel,

265
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,382
well, that's what
the preacher sells,

266
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:28,648
same as a shrink.

267
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:31,320
See, the preacher,
he encourages

268
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,824
your capacity for illusion.

269
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:36,760
Then he tells you
it's a fucking virtue.

270
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:40,227
Always a buck to be had
doing that,

271
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:44,943
and it's such a desperate sense
of entitlement, isn't it?

272
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:51,054
"Surely, this is all for me.

273
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,687
Me.

274
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,192
Me, me, me. I, I.

275
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:58,699
I'm so fucking important.

276
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:02,433
I'm so fucking important,
then, right?" Fuck you.

277
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,570
Excuse us for a second.

278
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:20,249
I didn't know.

279
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:22,584
Easy. I am not
gonna hurt you.

280
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,192
I'm not gonna hurt you.

281
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:27,962
Oh.

282
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:37,305
Compassion is ethics,
Detective.

283
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:40,673
Yes. It is.

284
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:43,841
I ran checks on all of them.

285
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:46,608
Everyone has got a clean
record except for Burt.

286
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,447
I could see
this being some kind

287
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,444
of retard job--

288
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:53,484
pays for it, gets ashamed,

289
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,116
overreacts,

290
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,819
tries to redeem the act,
like, you know?

291
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,522
That's not bad, Marty...

292
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:04,857
Well, yeah.

293
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,422
I got all the way there
without your help.

294
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:10,190
...but it's not him.

295
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:13,326
He did a deuce at the farm
for dick wagging.

296
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:16,226
Should've been in
a mental ward to begin with.

297
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:17,664
Give me the second half.

298
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:19,034
Angola.

299
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:21,567
Some Bloods caught him
in the shower,

300
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,905
took his balls off
with a razor.

301
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:25,600
They were sloppy about it.

302
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,167
Oh, Jesus.

303
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,946
Still--

304
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,011
I braced him.

305
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:36,820
He shit himself, literally.

306
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,223
We can put some
troopers on this place,

307
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:44,695
have them surveil it,

308
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:47,492
but I think we should move on,

309
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:49,701
the tall man.

310
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,840
Well, that could be bullshit.

311
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:52,968
One threw it out,

312
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:54,271
and the other one
picked up on it.

313
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:56,671
No. Burt knew.

314
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:59,683
He saw the tall man, too.

315
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:01,284
This,

316
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:02,789
that Marie Fontenot thing,

317
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,358
there's no way Lange
was his first,

318
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:06,728
no fucking way.

319
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:13,168
Rosie, can you
help them get out, please.

320
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:28,615
We haven't
matched any signatures.

321
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:31,983
One guy in the fed
database used crowns,

322
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:34,653
another a set
of antlers--

323
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:36,757
Michigan lifer.

324
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,291
Then he called
the signature wrong.

325
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:43,355
We don't know that
there's any connection

326
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:46,097
to Marie Fontenot.

327
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,798
Yeah, but the lattices,
the symbology--

328
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:53,905
some kind of culture
to it, Marty.

329
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,840
I mean, he wanted
us to find this one,

330
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:00,674
like he was showing off.

331
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:03,841
That cane field is our stage.

332
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:07,078
Make a suggestion, then.

333
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,309
We start at zero,
they're gonna hand it

334
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:12,149
to the task force.

335
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:14,084
Well, somebody
missed something.

336
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,788
We need to go back,
check all files.

337
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:17,884
Any DBs in state
the last 5 years,

338
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,850
we start there.

339
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:22,825
We don't have the hours.

340
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,592
Shit, man. Look.

341
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,897
I've noticed you have
a tendency toward myopia,

342
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,894
tunnel vision,
blows investigations.

343
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:35,262
Vision skews, twists evidence.

344
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:38,963
You're obsessive.

345
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:43,001
You're obsessive, too,
just not about the job.

346
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,735
Not, me, brother.

347
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:49,502
I keep things even, separate,

348
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,206
like the way I can
have this one beer

349
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,639
without needing 20.

350
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,110
People incapable of guilt

351
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:57,178
usually do have a good time.

352
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:04,953
Try not to be
too hard on myself.

353
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,488
Well, that's real big of you.

354
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:09,854
You know the real difference
between you and me?

355
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:13,423
Yeah. Denial.

356
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:16,055
The difference is
that I know the difference

357
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,494
between an idea and a fact.

358
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:22,292
You are incapable
of admitting doubt.

359
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,593
Now, that sounds
like denial to me.

360
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:28,968
I doubt that.

361
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:34,001
We'll put out an APB

362
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:36,574
on any tall man
with facial scarring...

363
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,406
Okay.

364
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:41,372
...telex the hospitals
for patients that fit.

365
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:42,971
Good.

366
00:18:56,981 --> 00:19:00,451
So Cohle was trying
to keep it from the task force.

367
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:04,216
Looking back,
you ever think maybe

368
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:06,487
he tried to push things

369
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,518
where he wanted them to go?

370
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:14,065
No. We went where
the case led us.

371
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:16,233
But you took it up, though,

372
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:17,898
his serial theory.

373
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,632
Well, as arrogant
as he could be,

374
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,168
he was right.

375
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:26,173
I mean, that's how
we got our man.

376
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,369
Uh-huh,

377
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,008
but I like it
this way, you know?

378
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,239
It's steady.

379
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,902
Bullshit, really.

380
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:35,775
Look. I did all the
counseling and stuff.

381
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,243
This is just the way
things are.

382
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:41,176
No. Things don't
stay the same.

383
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,678
Pick up what you keep, and
you leave the rest behind.

384
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:45,247
People get better.

385
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,846
Well, that's the thing.
I think I am better.

386
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,477
You really think so?

387
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:53,116
Uh, trust me.

388
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,882
Maybe you just think
you prefer it this way

389
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:56,910
because it's
what you're used to.

390
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:59,012
Your life accommodates you.

391
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:02,480
You don't have to be
afraid of loss.

392
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,213
Those are the guys
I was telling you about.

393
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,749
They get a dog, fish,
what have you.

394
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:11,915
You start with that.
You live with it.

395
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,865
Hell, I suppose
you could set me up

396
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,298
with a nurse, get me
some of the good drugs.

397
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:38,001
Mm-hmm.

398
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,971
New start.

399
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:43,504
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

400
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:44,737
Hey, kids.

401
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,240
Hey, honey.

402
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:48,177
How you doing, Marty?

403
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:55,178
What's going on, Rust?

404
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,114
Brought the mower back.

405
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:59,912
Mow my yard?

406
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:02,045
Yeah. I saw
it needed mowing,

407
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:04,747
returned the favor, borrowing.

408
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,619
We got etouffee,

409
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:09,415
trying to get Rust
to stay for dinner.

410
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:11,415
Oh, yeah?

411
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:13,983
Stay for dinner, Rust.

412
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:18,419
Nah. I think
I got to get.

413
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:21,555
Maggie, thank you for the tea.

414
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:24,795
Sorry to hear that.

415
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:27,700
See you Monday.

416
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:31,132
I'll walk you out.

417
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,571
Hey.

418
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:35,108
Hey!

419
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:40,077
What?

420
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,613
What the hell do you
think you're doing, man,

421
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:46,251
at my house when I'm not here?

422
00:21:46,284 --> 00:21:48,147
Returning the mower.

423
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:50,220
You know what I mean.

424
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:54,522
You mow my lawn? Hmm?

425
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:56,194
Just what'd you think
I'd be doing over here

426
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,130
when you're not around, Marty?

427
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:01,993
What's our problem, you and me?

428
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:03,759
No problem.

429
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,296
I just don't ever want you

430
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,034
mowing my lawn, all right?

431
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:11,135
I like mowing my lawn.

432
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:43,031
Oh.

433
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:44,431
That is your team, Daddy?

434
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:48,031
Yeah, baby. That--
I want them to win.

435
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:03,815
Uh, hey, Audrey, your mom and I

436
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:05,751
want to talk to you
a minute about

437
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,422
those drawings you
did in school, yeah?

438
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,651
Mace, run to your room.

439
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:12,817
Why?

440
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,353
Because I said so.
Run to y--

441
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:17,551
Go. Go on.

442
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,562
Go.

443
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:25,634
Go. Run.

444
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:33,978
Look.

445
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:37,313
You don't have to get
upset, honey, okay?

446
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:39,345
We just want to talk to you.

447
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:43,248
Where'd you see that
before, hmm?

448
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:45,782
Why'd you draw that?

449
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:48,055
Because other girls liked it

450
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:50,718
and they thought it was funny.

451
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,253
That's all.

452
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:57,727
Yeah, but where'd you
get that idea, hmm?

453
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:02,670
The girls dared me to do it.

454
00:24:02,703 --> 00:24:04,165
Oh, God.

455
00:24:04,198 --> 00:24:06,700
That upsets people, Audrey.

456
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:10,168
It's ugly.

457
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:12,736
It makes something
that should be nice

458
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:15,343
ugly.

459
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:18,343
I'm sorry. Oh...

460
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:21,080
Shh. That's okay.
It's okay.

461
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,087
It's okay, sweetie.

462
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,115
Well, I'm not saying
that I got any room to talk,

463
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:33,649
but do you know what it means
to be a father?

464
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,193
It means you are accountable
for other people.

465
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,928
You are responsible
for their lives.

466
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:44,031
Now, past a certain point,

467
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:48,029
there's a futility
in responsibility.

468
00:25:02,939 --> 00:25:04,345
Hey.

469
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:07,681
That's the extent
of your concern?

470
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,483
Well, no.

471
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:12,081
I just don't know what
looking at it any more

472
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:13,950
is gonna do.

473
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:16,953
It's her.
I'm concerned.

474
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:19,994
Well, she's just trying
to get attention,

475
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:22,560
and the other girls--

476
00:25:22,593 --> 00:25:25,357
Jesus, how do they even know
about that stuff yet?

477
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,262
Girls always know before boys.

478
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:29,596
Why is that?

479
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,997
Because they have to.

480
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,834
Listen to me.
She's withdrawn.

481
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,371
She asks about you,
and she wants to know

482
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:39,403
why you're working so much now.

483
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:42,777
Well, I should be working less.

484
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,111
Task force is gonna
take that case,

485
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:48,802
and I'll be around more.

486
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,442
Last week?

487
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:58,681
I'm sorry about that.
I should've begged off.

488
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:00,953
We were having a good night.

489
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:04,655
Don't stop me. Talk.

490
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,529
I'm close, Marty.

491
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:13,363
Do you hear me?
I'm close.

492
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:17,070
Um, they're gonna
pull that case from us,

493
00:26:17,103 --> 00:26:22,511
and I'll be around more,
and we'll do things.

494
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:25,720
Why is there all this
space between us, Marty?

495
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:27,919
I don't know what you mean.

496
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:28,983
You do know what I mean,

497
00:26:29,016 --> 00:26:31,192
and you won't say,
and that's it.

498
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:33,691
That's what I'm talking about.

499
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:35,964
This last year, you've
been a sulky teenager.

500
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:38,397
You know it.

501
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:40,574
I'm trying to be
your friend, Marty.

502
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:50,012
I'm just not good
at... you know, expressing.

503
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:51,778
We change, don't we,

504
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:54,776
and sometimes not for long.

505
00:26:54,817 --> 00:26:58,011
And here I'm thinking people
don't really change at all,

506
00:26:58,045 --> 00:27:00,917
not who they are at heart.

507
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,517
You know, I try to remember things
because I feel

508
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,252
like I should, like it's my job

509
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:09,489
or something,
you know, early days,

510
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:12,195
and I'm tired of
trying to remember.

511
00:27:12,228 --> 00:27:16,898
Part of this--
and I'm not talking

512
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:19,095
about the part
that's all my fault--

513
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:23,134
but part of it, it's just life.

514
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:27,037
We used to spend weekends
without leaving my room.

515
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,731
- That's not what I mean.
- Remember that?

516
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,173
Of course we don't
screw like we're 19.

517
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:35,742
God, you want low expectations.

518
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:37,984
You know, you put a ceiling
on your life,

519
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:41,021
on everything, because
you won't change.

520
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45,595
You were so much smarter
when I met you,

521
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:47,699
you know?

522
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:55,233
I'm sorry, Maggie.

523
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:59,500
I'm sorry
for everything--

524
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,300
for not being here,

525
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:05,140
for taking all this
for granted.

526
00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:11,408
What have you been
doing, Marty?

527
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,343
I--

528
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:23,947
Work, home, cases.

529
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,719
Just--

530
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:32,518
I get to feeling like--

531
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,452
Look. I can see 40...

532
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:43,165
and it's like I'm that coyote

533
00:28:43,198 --> 00:28:44,900
in the cartoons,

534
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,395
like I'm running off a cliff,

535
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:52,905
and if I don't look down
and keep running,

536
00:28:52,938 --> 00:28:58,470
I might be fine, but, um...

537
00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:03,446
I think I'm all fucked up.

538
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:10,747
You are.

539
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,820
Yes. You are.

540
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:28,168
Marty?

541
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:36,571
Anyway, well, we pulled
a few hospital patients--

542
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:41,176
tall, scarred, sex offenders.

543
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:43,341
One kid did B&Es.

544
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:49,279
He had to tug one out
before he could leave a scene.

545
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:52,644
Phew. Yeah.
A lot of room work then.

546
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:57,652
Which one of you guys
is the box man?

547
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:02,416
You, yeah?

548
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:05,991
I used to be pretty good
in there myself,

549
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:08,493
not as good as Rust.

550
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,188
I know, son.

551
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:13,352
I can read this off you.

552
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:19,668
You're not bad.
It's not you.

553
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:21,099
There's a weight,

554
00:31:21,132 --> 00:31:22,328
and it got its fishhooks

555
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:23,935
in your heart and your soul.

556
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,471
Now, what you did
is not your fault.

557
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:42,976
It's not.

558
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:44,744
You was drug to the bottom

559
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:47,385
by that same weight,
the same weight

560
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:49,251
that won't let you
get along in a job,

561
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:50,858
and same weight that
wouldn't let you

562
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:53,691
get along at school...

563
00:31:58,196 --> 00:31:59,668
same weight that
wouldn't let you

564
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,731
have a mom.

565
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:08,338
I know these things, Chris.

566
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:13,577
I'm weak. I'm sick.

567
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,387
I get into the houses,
and I can't leave

568
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,753
until I go
all over the drawers.

569
00:32:20,786 --> 00:32:24,225
Listen to me, son.

570
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:26,594
You got one way out,

571
00:32:26,627 --> 00:32:29,060
and it's through
the grace of God.

572
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,865
You're only how
the Lord made you.

573
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:37,034
You are not flawed.

574
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:39,074
We, you, me, people,

575
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:41,875
we don't choose our feelings.

576
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:45,414
There's grace in this world,

577
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:47,149
and there's
forgiveness for all,

578
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:50,188
but you have to ask for it.

579
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:52,317
I do. I do.
I want that.

580
00:32:52,357 --> 00:32:57,691
I want it. I want that.
I'm asking. I'm asking.

581
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,155
Tell me. Tell me.

582
00:32:59,196 --> 00:33:00,995
Please just tell me
what to say.

583
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:06,235
I want to confess.
I want to confess.

584
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,703
Sorry about that.

585
00:33:18,143 --> 00:33:22,311
Your assist record, man,
that's something else.

586
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:25,448
Any pointers?

587
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:28,017
Oh, I never really
found it that hard.

588
00:33:28,057 --> 00:33:32,890
You just look at somebody
and think like they think,

589
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:37,465
negative capability.

590
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:41,203
I mean, I guess it's a skill.

591
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,035
Most times,
you don't even need that.

592
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:47,675
You just look them in the eyes.
The whole story is right there.

593
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:51,844
Everybody wears their hunger
and their haunt, you know?

594
00:33:53,284 --> 00:33:57,285
You just got to be honest
about what can go on up here,

595
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:59,890
a locked room....

596
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:05,028
but then again,
I'm terrible at cards.

597
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:08,932
Ha, ha!

598
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:12,635
Yeah. So while we were grilling
B&E jerkoffs and burn victims,

599
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:15,739
I decided to put insomnia
to good use.

600
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:39,062
_

601
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:46,437
People.

602
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,709
I've seen the finale
of thousands of lives, man--

603
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,983
young, old.

604
00:34:53,016 --> 00:34:56,920
Each one is so sure
of their realness,

605
00:34:56,953 --> 00:35:02,259
that their sensory experience
constituted a unique individual

606
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:05,795
with purpose, meaning...

607
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:13,540
so certain that they were
more than a biological puppet.

608
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:20,277
Well, the truth wills out,
and everybody sees

609
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,716
once the strings are cut,
all fall down.

610
00:35:45,912 --> 00:35:48,043
Maggie says he's shy.

611
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:51,178
I wouldn't say that.

612
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:54,115
Definitely not shy
about speaking his mind.

613
00:35:54,148 --> 00:35:55,681
Well, that's not what I mean.

614
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:59,419
His personality.
He's edgy.

615
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:03,892
Yeah, intense,
more like, introverted.

616
00:36:03,925 --> 00:36:05,859
I don't want another drunk.

617
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:07,364
The last cop
you showed me--

618
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:09,629
No. Wait. Steve was going
through a tough time.

619
00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:11,030
He threw up in my lap.

620
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,166
Don't worry about that.

621
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:15,101
Getting him near you lap
is gonna be the challenge.

622
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:18,574
Oh, hey, speak of the devil.

623
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:21,175
- Hey, Rust.
- Martin.

624
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:23,414
- Hey, Maggie.
- Hi, Rust.

625
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,846
- Jennifer.
- Rustin.

626
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:27,415
Nice to meet you.

627
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:31,454
Well, you walk over here?

628
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:41,498
Well... okay.

629
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:52,450
Just when I thought he
couldn't get any stranger.

630
00:36:52,483 --> 00:36:53,883
Are you serious?

631
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,683
He tastes colors.

632
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:58,787
So what is synesesia?

633
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,259
Synesthesia.

634
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:04,195
It's a misalignment
of synaptic receptors

635
00:37:04,228 --> 00:37:08,267
and triggers--
alkalis, colors,

636
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,604
certain metallics.

637
00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:13,171
It's a type
of hyper sensitivity.

638
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:16,770
One sense triggers
another sense.

639
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:19,370
Sometimes I'll see a color,

640
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:21,608
and it'll put a taste
in my mouth.

641
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:25,709
A touch, a texture, a scent
may put a note in my head.

642
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:27,278
I've heard that.

643
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,644
It can be a side effect
of a statin.

644
00:37:29,677 --> 00:37:31,179
It's not a side effect.

645
00:37:31,212 --> 00:37:32,609
So when something feels good,

646
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,112
does that mean it
feels twice as good,

647
00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:38,922
like from two different ways?

648
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:44,123
It could.
Yeah.

649
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:46,257
The waitress
will bring them, babe.

650
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,423
Why wait?
I'll be right back.

651
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,306
Refill and two rums.

652
00:38:05,747 --> 00:38:07,651
Ohh...

653
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:15,290
Hi. Can I have
another beer?

654
00:38:15,323 --> 00:38:16,690
Thank you.

655
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:20,191
What are you doing?

656
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:22,127
What's it look like?

657
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,529
I'm on a date.
Aren't you?

658
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,969
Heh.

659
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:31,040
So are you gonna go home
with this guy? Huh?

660
00:38:31,073 --> 00:38:34,378
It's really none
of your business.

661
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:37,178
Do you fuck your wife?

662
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:40,650
What do you
want me to do? Look.

663
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:43,585
Is this your way of
trying to talk divorce?

664
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:46,257
My God, Marty,
I don't want to marry you.

665
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,727
That's my whole point.
It's just run its course.

666
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,991
No, it hasn't. Come here.
Have a shot with me.

667
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:55,494
Gonna play a little something

668
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:57,262
everybody should dance to.

669
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:09,805
Hey, I didn't just
come here to drink, you know.

670
00:39:11,707 --> 00:39:14,241
Let me just set this down.

671
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,542
It'll be fun.

672
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:19,614
Yeah.

673
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:37,426
What?

674
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,563
Oh, nothing.

675
00:39:39,596 --> 00:39:43,558
Thought I saw a guy who
supposed to be in parish.

676
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:53,042
So what's Alaska like?

677
00:39:53,075 --> 00:39:55,412
It's beautiful.

678
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:58,044
It's not Paris, but it's clean,

679
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,449
and it's clear.

680
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:02,588
You've been to Paris?

681
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:05,053
For a month.

682
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:07,629
What'd you do in Paris?

683
00:40:07,662 --> 00:40:11,891
Mainly just got drunk
in front of Notre Dame.

684
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:23,305
Each stilled body so certain

685
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:27,974
that they were more than the sum
of their urges,

686
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:32,445
all the useless spinning,
tired mind,

687
00:40:32,478 --> 00:40:35,747
collision of desire
and ignorance.

688
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,584
You asked
about the interrogations.

689
00:40:41,617 --> 00:40:43,649
You want to know the truth?

690
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:49,124
I never been in a room
more than 10 minutes

691
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:51,526
I didn't know whether
the guy did it or not.

692
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,568
How long does it take you?

693
00:40:56,601 --> 00:41:00,980
Rust spent a lot of off duty
running DBs,

694
00:41:01,013 --> 00:41:04,748
weeks of it,
coon hound in another life.

695
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:06,749
Coon hound?

696
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,123
I meant raccoon hound.

697
00:41:10,156 --> 00:41:13,289
Everybody is a fucking
drama queen nowadays.

698
00:41:13,322 --> 00:41:15,890
Jesus. Look.

699
00:41:15,923 --> 00:41:20,099
If working his theories,
if his job

700
00:41:20,132 --> 00:41:22,764
was his idea of himself, fine.

701
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:26,170
I mean, the rest of us
had families,

702
00:41:26,203 --> 00:41:28,569
people in our lives,
good things.

703
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:31,137
People give you rules.

704
00:41:31,177 --> 00:41:33,912
Rules describe the shape
of things.

705
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:42,947
Come on!

706
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,347
Fuck you!

707
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,553
Fuck, Marty, get out of here.

708
00:41:52,586 --> 00:41:54,459
"Fuck, Marty." Is that
all you got for me?

709
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:56,492
Stop it. Go home.
I don't want this anymore.

710
00:41:56,525 --> 00:41:58,227
You got that little
shitbird in here?

711
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,932
Go away.
I'll call the cops.

712
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:01,398
Well, let's see how that
works out for you.

713
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:04,206
- I know other cops.
- Okay.

714
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,036
Get out.
Marty, get out.

715
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:08,407
But she said she was single.

716
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:11,745
Marty, God!
Stop! Stop it!

717
00:42:11,786 --> 00:42:13,185
Did she suck your dick, huh?

718
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:14,153
Stop it!

719
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:15,217
She suck your fucking dick?

720
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,186
Stop it!
Get out! Get off.

721
00:42:18,227 --> 00:42:19,394
Get off!

722
00:42:19,427 --> 00:42:21,193
Yeah.
You try it?

723
00:42:21,226 --> 00:42:23,159
Oh, you tell me, or I'll have

724
00:42:23,193 --> 00:42:26,800
some Ninth Ward prison queen
wearing your face for a condom.

725
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:30,739
Did she suck your dick?

726
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:33,969
Just for a little bit.

727
00:42:34,002 --> 00:42:36,405
Get off.

728
00:42:36,438 --> 00:42:38,868
Please stop it.

729
00:42:41,545 --> 00:42:44,048
Sorry I got in your face, guy.

730
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:48,017
I wouldn't have really
done something like that.

731
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,554
I'm not a psycho.

732
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,498
That's why I always said
I think Rust needed a family.

733
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,906
It's boundaries.
Boundaries are good.

734
00:43:36,972 --> 00:43:38,644
This is Cohle.

735
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:40,644
Rust, you're home.

736
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:43,181
- It's me.
- Yeah. What's wrong?

737
00:43:43,214 --> 00:43:44,646
I'm sorry.

738
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:46,284
Steve Geraci said
he caught something.

739
00:43:46,317 --> 00:43:48,580
He needed help.

740
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:51,083
I almost called the station,
but what's the point?

741
00:43:51,116 --> 00:43:52,851
You know they lie.

742
00:43:55,555 --> 00:43:58,562
I got to put you on the spot.

743
00:43:58,595 --> 00:44:01,696
You know if it's true?

744
00:44:01,729 --> 00:44:06,033
I didn't hear anything,

745
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:07,937
but then again, I wouldn't.

746
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,339
I mean, Geraci
wouldn't pull me.

747
00:44:10,372 --> 00:44:12,613
He hates me.

748
00:44:19,214 --> 00:44:22,291
You drop Jen at home?

749
00:44:22,324 --> 00:44:26,994
Yeah. I walked her
to the door.

750
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:28,699
You didn't go in?

751
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:29,899
You don't have to fall in love

752
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:31,131
at first sight, you know.

753
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:32,436
Yeah. I know. Look.

754
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:35,404
She's nice, pretty.

755
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:37,813
There's comfort there, Rust.

756
00:44:37,846 --> 00:44:39,511
I think you guys
would be good together

757
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:42,318
if you gave it a chance.

758
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:45,785
You guys don't
give things chances.

759
00:44:45,826 --> 00:44:47,520
I don't know why that is.

760
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:50,358
That's because we
know what we want

761
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:52,094
and we don't mind being alone.

762
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:57,828
Go to bed, Maggie.

763
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,270
Marty'll be home.
Take care.

764
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:12,181
Holy shit, 3 days in a row.

765
00:45:12,214 --> 00:45:14,351
Is that a new personal record?

766
00:45:14,384 --> 00:45:15,646
Fuck off.

767
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:17,822
I will take my first shit
through your sunroof.

768
00:45:17,855 --> 00:45:20,988
Hey, hey, I found one, I think,

769
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:23,094
another girl from earlier.

770
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:25,796
Come here.

771
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:30,233
3 years ago,
a flood in Abbeville,

772
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,337
they pulled this girl
out of the river.

773
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:33,473
Hold it.

774
00:45:33,506 --> 00:45:35,408
It says here that her
death was accidental--

775
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,241
drowned, water in the lungs.

776
00:45:37,274 --> 00:45:39,008
How's that him?

777
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:41,512
Coroner says the branches
and debris from the flood

778
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:43,050
caused these injuries,
all right?

779
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:46,354
I understand the ribs and
the arms, but the hyoid?

780
00:45:46,387 --> 00:45:47,819
- Still--
- No fucking way.

781
00:45:47,852 --> 00:45:49,956
Look at this,
lacerations to the abdomen,

782
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:53,262
plus she was positive
for meth and LSD.

783
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:56,531
They said she
was high, fell in.

784
00:45:56,564 --> 00:45:58,835
Hmm.

785
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:02,800
Look at the posterior.

786
00:46:02,832 --> 00:46:05,670
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

787
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:07,405
IDed
as Rianne Olivier--

788
00:46:07,438 --> 00:46:09,298
22, lives in Pelican Island,

789
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:11,538
population 300.

790
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:15,245
Grandpa is still there,
got a phone at the dock.

791
00:46:15,278 --> 00:46:18,548
I don't know if I
can sell this shit.

792
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:21,383
Two days, we dig
in this direction.

793
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:24,687
If this is his, it's
some kind of archetype.

794
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,656
DB, Ville Platt,
machinist. You're up.

795
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:30,465
Hey, we caught a break
in the case, boss.

796
00:46:30,498 --> 00:46:32,570
I thought you were
handing that off.

797
00:46:32,602 --> 00:46:33,730
What break?

798
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:35,866
KA of the victim.
Might've known the killer, boss.

799
00:46:35,907 --> 00:46:37,603
Might've seen him.
We follow up.

800
00:46:37,636 --> 00:46:40,905
We still got a few days.

801
00:46:40,938 --> 00:46:43,710
Two days, and it
goes to task force.

802
00:46:43,743 --> 00:46:46,245
You two catch again.

803
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:50,249
We'll try that serial
theory out on him,

804
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:52,215
he will pull you
just for spite.

805
00:46:52,248 --> 00:46:54,754
Pelican Island
is two hours away.

806
00:46:54,787 --> 00:46:56,395
Here we go.

807
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,532
Put your hand in his hand.

808
00:47:02,797 --> 00:47:04,100
The good church teaches

809
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:06,131
that the Christian church
does not teach that,

810
00:47:06,172 --> 00:47:07,770
the Catholic church does not--

811
00:47:15,243 --> 00:47:16,947
Hey.

812
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,283
Mm-hmm?

813
00:47:18,316 --> 00:47:23,954
Think a man can love
two women at once,

814
00:47:23,987 --> 00:47:27,425
I mean, be in love with them?

815
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:31,090
I don't think
that man can love,

816
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,329
at least not the way
that he means.

817
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:39,738
Inadequacies of reality
always set in.

818
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:42,274
This pipeline is
carving up this coast

819
00:47:42,307 --> 00:47:43,739
like a jigsaw.

820
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:47,546
Place is gonna be
underwater in 30 years.

821
00:47:51,347 --> 00:47:53,083
Do you think--

822
00:47:53,116 --> 00:47:59,189
Do you wonder ever
if you're a bad man?

823
00:47:59,222 --> 00:48:02,925
No. I don't wonder,
Marty.

824
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:04,797
World needs bad men.

825
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:12,237
We keep the other
bad men from the door.

826
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,334
That's him.

827
00:48:54,206 --> 00:48:58,646
When's the last time
you saw your granddaughter?

828
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:02,717
She left 4 years ago,
like her ma.

829
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,623
Wasn't surprised they
found her like that.

830
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:07,152
Yeah. Everybody
think they gonna be

831
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:08,855
something they not.

832
00:49:08,888 --> 00:49:12,725
Everybody, they got
this big plan.

833
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:16,463
She had a boyfriend
you know about, a man?

834
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:19,536
Eh, she took up with
that Ledoux fella--

835
00:49:19,569 --> 00:49:22,368
older boy,
shit family--

836
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:24,777
run off with him.

837
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:27,811
I ain't never had nobody
ask me about him before.

838
00:49:27,844 --> 00:49:31,314
He just tell me she
died in the flood.

839
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:34,082
That Ledoux family,
they still live around here?

840
00:49:34,123 --> 00:49:37,091
Oh, maybe a cousin or two.

841
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:38,957
Been shrinking every year.

842
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:40,692
Hurricane Andrew wiped most

843
00:49:40,725 --> 00:49:42,964
of the folks out around here.

844
00:49:42,997 --> 00:49:47,606
So you got a full name
on that Ledoux boy?

845
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:49,501
Reggie.

846
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:51,511
Reggie Ledoux.

847
00:49:51,544 --> 00:49:53,848
Father
is Bart Ledoux--

848
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:56,819
works offshore, drunkard.

849
00:49:56,852 --> 00:49:59,324
I heard he died.
Heh.

850
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,263
So where'd Rianne go to school?

851
00:50:01,296 --> 00:50:03,699
Light of Way when it was open.

852
00:50:03,732 --> 00:50:04,971
Kids either went there

853
00:50:05,004 --> 00:50:07,002
or they were bussed
to Abbeville.

854
00:50:07,035 --> 00:50:08,835
State said a kid
got to be bussed

855
00:50:08,876 --> 00:50:11,340
two hours away to school.

856
00:50:11,373 --> 00:50:14,076
I ain't too big on
them God botherers.

857
00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:16,483
Between them
and the government--

858
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:19,418
How about her parents,
other relatives?

859
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,850
Father is a merchant seaman.

860
00:50:22,883 --> 00:50:25,154
Mother is in California,
last I heard.

861
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:27,886
Do you have
anything of hers--

862
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:31,055
possessions,
anything that'd give us

863
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:33,464
an idea what he
might have been like?

864
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:37,923
What you boys looking
all this up for?

865
00:50:37,963 --> 00:50:40,764
I was told she drowned
in the flood.

866
00:50:40,797 --> 00:50:43,198
Now, I ain't no idiot.

867
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,804
You telling me she
ain't done drowned?

868
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:47,404
We don't know that, sir.

869
00:50:47,437 --> 00:50:49,805
We're just looking for a man
who might have known her.

870
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,444
Who?

871
00:50:52,477 --> 00:50:55,410
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

872
00:50:55,443 --> 00:50:58,515
He ended up having
a little box of her stuff,

873
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:02,219
had her last yearbook,
tenth grade,

874
00:51:02,252 --> 00:51:05,755
not a hint of feeling
from the old man,

875
00:51:05,788 --> 00:51:09,324
kind of got blinders,

876
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,101
but why'd he keep the box, huh?

877
00:51:13,134 --> 00:51:16,034
Did he ask himself?

878
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:20,104
Anyway, I guess,
that's one way to do it--

879
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:23,708
keep your eyes
on the crab traps.

880
00:51:23,741 --> 00:51:26,875
Kind of reminded me
of Rust a little bit.

881
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:34,552
This school is small,

882
00:51:34,585 --> 00:51:36,583
grades one through 12.

883
00:51:38,217 --> 00:51:43,158
Rianne Olivier.
Here she is, tenth grade.

884
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:46,159
Hmm.

885
00:51:49,326 --> 00:51:50,326
_

886
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:53,630
This school was part
of Tuttle's foundation.

887
00:52:04,963 --> 00:52:13,300
_

888
00:52:15,088 --> 00:52:16,190
Good afternoon.

889
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:17,588
Afternoon.

890
00:52:17,621 --> 00:52:19,890
This place shut down
'92, right?

891
00:52:19,923 --> 00:52:22,122
Yeah, the way I heard it.

892
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:23,725
What'd you hear?

893
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,732
Oh, Andrew blew it out.

894
00:52:25,765 --> 00:52:27,995
Guess they didn't think

895
00:52:28,036 --> 00:52:30,402
it was worth cleaning up.

896
00:52:30,435 --> 00:52:32,972
Do you work here, then?

897
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:35,075
No, sir. I work
for the parish,

898
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:37,137
cover several properties.

899
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,379
I-23?

900
00:52:42,645 --> 00:52:44,452
I-23. Go.

901
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:46,453
I've got comeback on your R&I.

902
00:52:46,486 --> 00:52:50,294
Reginald Ledoux--
DOB 11/13/60.

903
00:52:50,327 --> 00:52:52,697
You know anybody who went here

904
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,559
or worked here back then?

905
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,196
Mm, no, sir.

906
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,629
I only been coming here
the last few months.

907
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:02,671
Parish added it
to my work order.

908
00:53:10,985 --> 00:53:13,882
Thank you for your time.

909
00:53:16,462 --> 00:53:20,061
Who walks that fucking slow?

910
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:23,300
What you got?

911
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,470
R&I just came back.

912
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:28,174
Reggie Ledoux skipped
parole 8 months ago.

913
00:53:28,207 --> 00:53:30,271
He's got a stat.
rape complaint,

914
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:33,281
charges dropped,
but '93, he's busted

915
00:53:33,314 --> 00:53:35,484
in connection
to a narcotics lab

916
00:53:35,517 --> 00:53:37,653
used to make meth and LSD,

917
00:53:37,686 --> 00:53:40,293
which Dora Lange and
Rianne were full of.

918
00:53:40,326 --> 00:53:41,926
Right.

919
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:43,728
Ledoux did two years
at Avoyelles,

920
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:45,431
and guess who his cellmate was

921
00:53:45,464 --> 00:53:46,831
the last 4 months.

922
00:53:46,864 --> 00:53:48,798
Charlie Lange.

923
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:51,205
I got to give you this one.

924
00:53:51,238 --> 00:53:53,774
I started to believe
you were going

925
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:55,640
a little off your nut.

926
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:58,371
I mean, you're bonkers,
just not on this.

927
00:53:58,404 --> 00:54:00,137
All right.
Where was Ledoux?

928
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,305
Getting a list
of relatives, KAs.

929
00:54:02,346 --> 00:54:05,045
Been out of pocket
since jumping parole.

930
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:06,416
We'll find him.

931
00:54:06,457 --> 00:54:07,583
This makes sense.

932
00:54:07,624 --> 00:54:08,719
Looks good, baby.

933
00:54:08,752 --> 00:54:10,222
All right.
We are on our way.

934
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:11,255
To Avoyelles.

935
00:54:11,288 --> 00:54:12,626
Fuck, yeah, Martin.
Let's go.

936
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:13,994
I'm calling the interstate APB

937
00:54:14,027 --> 00:54:15,764
and the US Marshals on this.

938
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:17,435
I-23 to dispatch.

939
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:19,267
Come in, I-23.

940
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,404
What can I say?

941
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:21,676
I thought for a minute,
you just liked looking

942
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:23,171
at pictures of dead people.

943
00:54:23,204 --> 00:54:26,077
I need an all-state APB
on one Reginald Ledoux.

944
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,781
R&I came back with info.

945
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:29,316
All US Marshals
and Highway Patrol,

946
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,818
be advised, detain
on sight, over.

947
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,019
Roger that, Detective.

948
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:35,286
We've got that sent now.

949
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:37,160
Mm, mm, mm.

950
00:54:38,664 --> 00:54:45,060
And finally, we arrive
at Reginald Ledoux. Heh.

951
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:50,974
Come on, man.

952
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:54,606
You want to ask me,
ask, goddamn it.

953
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:57,344
You ever been in a gunfight?

954
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:59,312
No.

955
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:01,845
Well, then how the fuck
you gonna know

956
00:55:01,886 --> 00:55:04,015
what I'm talking about?

957
00:55:05,724 --> 00:55:09,933
Man, that place--
I never--

958
00:55:11,271 --> 00:55:16,412
That day, it reminded me
of my pop talking about 'Nam

959
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:18,277
and the jungle thing.

960
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:23,115
Look. Me talking about
what happened back then,

961
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:26,251
that ain't gonna do you
any good now.

962
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,323
This--

963
00:55:32,364 --> 00:55:35,229
This is what I'm talking about.

964
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:37,399
This is what I mean

965
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,441
when I'm talking
about time and death

966
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:44,777
and futility.

967
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,850
There are broader ideas
at work,

968
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:49,652
mainly what is owed
between us as a society

969
00:55:49,685 --> 00:55:51,922
for our mutual illusions.

970
00:55:51,955 --> 00:55:54,958
14 straight hours
of staring at DBs,

971
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:59,500
these are the things
you think of.

972
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:03,766
You ever done that? Hmm?

973
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:07,638
You look in their eyes,
even in a picture.

974
00:56:07,671 --> 00:56:09,744
Doesn't matter
if they're dead or alive.

975
00:56:09,777 --> 00:56:12,882
You can still read them,
and you know what you see?

976
00:56:15,189 --> 00:56:18,730
They welcomed it,

977
00:56:18,763 --> 00:56:21,496
mm-hmm, not at first,

978
00:56:21,528 --> 00:56:24,402
but right there
in the last instant.

979
00:56:24,435 --> 00:56:29,607
It an unmistakable relief,
see, because they were afraid

980
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,313
and now they saw
for the very first time

981
00:56:32,346 --> 00:56:37,687
how easy it was to just let go,
and they saw--

982
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,760
In that last nanosecond,
they saw what they were,

983
00:56:43,793 --> 00:56:46,431
that you, yourself,
this whole big drama,

984
00:56:46,464 --> 00:56:48,998
it was never anything
but a jerry-rig

985
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:54,069
of presumption and dumb will
and you could just let go

986
00:56:54,102 --> 00:56:57,008
finally now that you didn't have
to hold on so tight...

987
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:04,082
to realize that
all your life--

988
00:57:04,123 --> 00:57:05,692
you know, all your love,
all your hate,

989
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:09,658
all your memory, all your pain--
it was all the same thing.

990
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:12,729
It was all the same dream,
a dream that you had

991
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,830
inside a locked room,

992
00:57:16,863 --> 00:57:21,534
a dream about being a person...

993
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:31,875
and like a lot of dreams...

994
00:57:37,512 --> 00:57:40,249
there's a monster
at the end of it.
