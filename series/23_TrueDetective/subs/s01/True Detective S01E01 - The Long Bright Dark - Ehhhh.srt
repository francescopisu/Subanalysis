2
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:21,703
What'd you think, you
paired up with him?

3
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:25,667
What'd I think?

4
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,802
Well, you don't pick
your parents,

5
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:31,270
and you don't pick your partner.

6
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:36,939
You know, they used to call
him The Tax Man for a while?

7
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:40,573
He'd come out of Texas,
so nobody knew him.

8
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:42,907
Seemed a bit...

9
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,504
raw-boned to me, edgy.

10
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:47,976
Took 3 months till we got him

11
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,880
over to the house for dinner.

12
00:02:50,913 --> 00:02:52,711
Around our big 419.

13
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:55,183
That's what y'all want
to hear about, right,

14
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,984
Dora Lange, kids in the woods?

15
00:02:58,017 --> 00:03:01,715
Yeah, sure,
but, uh, talk about Cohle.

16
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,386
We heard some stories.

17
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,820
Kind of a strange guy, huh?

18
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,720
Strange. Uh... heh, heh, heh.

19
00:03:10,753 --> 00:03:12,561
Yeah.

20
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:16,092
Rust would pick a fight
with the sky

21
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:20,896
if he didn't like
its shade of blue,

22
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:23,833
but when we finally got
him over to the house...

23
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,967
this is when that case
was hot...

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,164
poor bastard looked like
he was on his way

25
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:31,702
to the firing squad.

26
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:34,237
Dora Lange.

27
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,844
Yeah. Occult ritual murder.

28
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:41,210
You can thank
the "Advertiser" for that.

29
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,523
Could you, uh, hold off on that?

30
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:44,716
All right. Yeah. You can't
do that here no more.

31
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:47,749
- Huh?
- Uh-uh.

32
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,188
Don't be assholes.

33
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:51,293
You want to hear this or not?

34
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,265
Vermillion sheriff requested
assistance with a 419,

35
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:16,369
cane fields outside of Erath.

36
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:18,370
I'd been on the job
about 3 months till then.

37
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,176
Two previous cases
were open and shut.

38
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:29,758
It was January 3, 1995,
my daughter's birthday.

39
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,055
I remember.

40
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:59,731
Hart and Cohle, State CID.

41
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,772
Who found her?

42
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:02,932
Farmer and his son.

43
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:04,971
This spread wasn't
scheduled for a burn.

44
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:08,336
Let's keep them here, and
let's tape off this road,

45
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:12,345
and give me your log.

46
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,810
You take the log.

47
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,013
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:20,379
Make sure you get
everything down.

49
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,597
Go ahead.

50
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:00,763
You ever see
something like this?

51
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:05,269
No, sir,
in 8 years of CID.

52
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:08,899
Them symbols, they's Satanic.

53
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,570
They had a "20/20"
on it a few years back.

54
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,006
ID?

55
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,872
No, sir.

56
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:21,179
We're gonna need
more men for a grid search,

57
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:25,020
set up a perimeter wide as
possible on those 3 roads,

58
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:26,924
post up, take license plates

59
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:29,892
of anything that passes.

60
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:31,027
I-23.

61
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,459
Go ahead,
I-23.

62
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:37,625
We're gonna need investigator
assist on that 419,

63
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,868
all you can spare for a canvass.

64
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,268
Roger that, Detective.

65
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,974
CID is taking over. Get
anybody who's free up here.

66
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:47,047
Okay. Tell me
what you see.

67
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,320
Ligature marks on her
wrists, ankles, and knees.

68
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:54,615
Multiple shallow
stab wounds to the abdomen.

69
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,750
Hemorrhaging around throat,

70
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:01,361
lividity at the shoulders,
thighs, and torso.

71
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:05,264
She'd been on her back a while

72
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:07,566
before he moved her.

73
00:07:14,672 --> 00:07:17,608
That's why
they called him The Tax Man.

74
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:20,848
The rest of us had these
little note pads or something.

75
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:23,512
He had this big ledger.

76
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:28,456
Looked funny walking door to
door with it like the tax man,

77
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:33,126
which ain't bad
as far as nicknames go.

78
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,660
Yeah. Of course
I've always taken a lot of notes.

79
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:40,430
I mean, you never know what
the thing's gonna be, do you?

80
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:43,197
A little detail
somewhere way down the line

81
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,601
makes you say, "Ohh!"
breaks the case.

82
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,970
You know, I've seen
all the different types.

83
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,411
We all fit a certain category...

84
00:07:54,444 --> 00:08:01,918
the bully, the charmer,
the, uh, surrogate dad,

85
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:06,393
the man possessed
by ungovernable rage,

86
00:08:06,426 --> 00:08:07,930
the brain...

87
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:13,736
and any of those types
could be a good detective,

88
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:18,472
and any of those types could be
an incompetent shitheel.

89
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:20,743
Which type were you?

90
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:26,216
Oh, I was just
a regular type dude

91
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:28,951
with a big-ass dick.

92
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:34,118
A lot of it had to do
with how they manage authority.

93
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:42,325
There can be a burden
in authority, in vigilance,

94
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:46,333
like a father's burden.

95
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,902
It was too much for some men.

96
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:53,303
A smart guy who's steady
is hard to find.

97
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:55,774
I was all right,
better than some,

98
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:02,846
but, you know, I knew how to talk
to people, and I was steady.

99
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,456
Rust... now his
Texas files were classified

100
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:12,059
or redacted,
and he wasn't big on talking

101
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,669
except when you wanted
him to shut up,

102
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,342
but he was smart.

103
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:25,713
Yeah. Second week
we were together,

104
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:28,448
I saw where he was living.

105
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:30,816
Kind of made me feel
for the guy.

106
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,137
I'd offer you a seat,

107
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,842
but, uh...

108
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,746
Don't mention it.
I, uh... I can't stay.

109
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:56,849
Yeah, I'll tell you guys...

110
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:59,452
and believe me,
past a certain age,

111
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:04,155
a man without a family
can be a bad thing.

112
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:37,794
We'd
encountered a meta-psychotic,

113
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:40,495
which I had to explain to Marty,

114
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:43,968
what meta-psychotic was.

115
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:50,235
This is gonna happen again,

116
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:56,244
or it's happened before, both.

117
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:59,347
Go on.

118
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,349
It's fantasy enactment, ritual,

119
00:11:03,382 --> 00:11:06,689
fetishization, iconography.

120
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,498
This is his vision.

121
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:12,402
Her body is
a paraphilic love map.

122
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:14,069
How's that?

123
00:11:14,102 --> 00:11:16,311
An attachment of physical lust

124
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:20,014
to fantasies and practices
forbidden by society.

125
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:24,987
You get that from one
of your books?

126
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,628
I did.

127
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:32,365
Her knees are abraded,
rug burns on her back.

128
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:34,163
Cold sores, gum line recession,

129
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:35,395
bad teeth.

130
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:38,498
There's decent odds
she was a prost.

131
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,801
He might not have
known her, but...

132
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:47,906
this idea goes
way back with him.

133
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:50,440
You... you got a chapter
in one of those books

134
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:53,846
on jumping to conclusions?

135
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,551
You attach an assumption
to a piece of evidence,

136
00:11:56,584 --> 00:12:01,180
you start to bend the
narrative to support it,

137
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,517
prejudice yourself.

138
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,891
Wait and see on the ID.

139
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:14,058
All right.

140
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:18,801
This kind of thing does
not happen in a vacuum.

141
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:22,538
I guarantee this
wasn't his first.

142
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:24,201
It's too specific.

143
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,451
Uh...

144
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:40,456
listen, uh... ahem,
this is

145
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:42,658
a...

146
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,224
stupid time to mention this,

147
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:48,561
but...

148
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:51,999
you've got to come to dinner.

149
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,663
Can't put Maggie off anymore,

150
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:56,633
so you just got to.

151
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:04,882
All right.

152
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:14,089
Gordon, thanks for coming.

153
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:15,592
Marty.

154
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,655
Yeah. So...

155
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:19,993
Anyway, that
evening, wasn't even sundown,

156
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:23,559
he decided it was a good time
to invite me over for dinner,

157
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,526
which I got a problem with,

158
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,231
all right, because I'm
thinking about Marty's wife

159
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:31,968
and this two kids and how
it's my daughter's birthday,

160
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,472
and I know...

161
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:37,974
there's nothing I can
do about it,

162
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:42,512
maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but...

163
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:45,217
I'm gonna have a drink.

164
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,457
Let me get up!
Heh, heh!

165
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,951
Daddy!

166
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:51,223
You're gonna meet him.
I got to get the door.

167
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:57,127
Hey.

168
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,502
Santa Claus is coming!

169
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:04,035
Aah! Jump!
Ha, ha, ha!

170
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:14,778
People out here,

171
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:20,781
it's like they don't even know
the outside world exists.

172
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:23,652
Might as well be living
on the fucking Moon.

173
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:29,026
There's all kinds
of ghettos in the world.

174
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:32,594
It's all one ghetto, man,

175
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:35,560
giant gutter in outer space.

176
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:43,508
Today, that scene,

177
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,282
that is the most fucked
up thing I ever caught.

178
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,648
Ask you something?

179
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:55,490
You're a Christian, yeah?

180
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:58,059
No.

181
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,560
Well, then what do you got the
cross for in your apartment?

182
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,765
That's a form of meditation.

183
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:08,166
How's that?

184
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:14,970
I contemplate
the moment in the garden,

185
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:19,540
the idea of allowing
your own crucifixion.

186
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:25,682
But you're not a Christian.

187
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,250
So what do you believe?

188
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:29,385
I believe that people
shouldn't talk

189
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:31,352
about this type of shit at work.

190
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:34,122
Hold on, hold on.

191
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:36,891
Uh... 3 months
we been together,

192
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:39,026
I get nothing from you.

193
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,839
Today, what we're into now,

194
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:44,039
do me a courtesy, okay?

195
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:45,901
I'm not trying to convert you.

196
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:48,172
Look. I consider myself
a realist, all right,

197
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:51,709
but in philosophical terms,
I'm what's called a pessimist.

198
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,580
Um, okay.
What's that mean?

199
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:57,149
Means I'm bad at parties.

200
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,519
Heh. Let me tell you.

201
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:02,724
You ain't great outside
of parties either.

202
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:11,199
I think human consciousness

203
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,704
was a tragic misstep
in evolution.

204
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:16,242
We became too self-aware.

205
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,779
Nature created an aspect of
nature separate from itself.

206
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,178
We are creatures that should
not exist by natural law.

207
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:27,049
Huh. That sounds
god-fucking-awful, Rust.

208
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,091
We are things that labor
under the illusion

209
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:32,090
of having a self,

210
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:36,489
this accretion of sensory
experience and feeling,

211
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,834
programmed with total assurance
that we are each somebody

212
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,971
when, in fact,
everybody's nobody.

213
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,674
I wouldn't go around spouting
that shit, I was you.

214
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:49,276
People around here
don't think that way.

215
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,645
I don't think that way.

216
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:52,979
I think the honorable
thing for species to do

217
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,484
is deny our programming,

218
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,686
stop reproducing,

219
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:01,527
walk hand in hand
into extinction,

220
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,824
one last midnight,
brothers and sisters

221
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:06,998
opting out of a raw deal.

222
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:12,801
So what's the point of getting
out bed in the morning?

223
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:14,809
I tell myself I bear witness,

224
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:19,437
but the real answer is that
it's obviously my programming,

225
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:22,880
and I lack the constitution
for suicide.

226
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:27,081
My luck, I picked today
to get to know you.

227
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,957
3 months, I don't hear
a word from you, and...

228
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,260
- You asked.
- Yeah.

229
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:34,826
And now I'm begging you
to shut the fuck up.

230
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,798
I get a bad taste
in my mouth out here.

231
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,672
Aluminum, ash,

232
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:52,710
like you can smell
the psychosphere.

233
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:54,005
I got an idea.

234
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:57,678
Let's make the car a place
of silent reflection

235
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:01,351
from now on, okay?

236
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,815
_

237
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:13,323
What should I bring for dinner?

238
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:21,837
A bottle of wine would
be nice, I guess.

239
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,572
I don't drink.

240
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,244
Well, no, of course not, Rust.

241
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:28,811
Listen. When you're
at my house,

242
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:30,746
I want you to chill
the fuck out.

243
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:33,749
Don't even mention any of that
bullshit you just said to me.

244
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:35,212
Of course not, Marty.

245
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:38,017
I'm not some kind
of maniac, all right?

246
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,385
I mean, for fuck's sake.

247
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,570
What'd you hear?

248
00:18:58,603 --> 00:18:59,741
Ask Cohle.

249
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:01,277
You mean The Tax Man?

250
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,478
You know, he's IA.

251
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:08,283
This is State CID Homicide...
Detective Geraci.

252
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:10,386
Yes, ma'am.

253
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,285
I'm calling to ask
about that night...

254
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:15,660
I mean, you never heard
any shit like this before.

255
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:17,859
She had...

256
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:20,534
antlers. Um...

257
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:21,768
Fuck.

258
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:24,270
This is... this is
the real thing,

259
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:27,808
some "Halloween" shit.

260
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:35,311
Well, we're gonna have to
do a press conference.

261
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:37,783
What about him?
What do you think?

262
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:45,926
Smart...

263
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,895
aloof.

264
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:50,433
Doesn't care
about making friends,

265
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:52,666
but he's already
running with it.

266
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:58,441
He's got a real...
real mind for it. Yeah.

267
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:00,644
So you'd keep him on then?

268
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:08,417
Both of us, yeah.
I would.

269
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,549
All right.
You're still lead.

270
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:13,855
The incident room is yours,

271
00:20:13,888 --> 00:20:16,886
and, uh, you do
the briefing tomorrow.

272
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,925
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

273
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:25,765
Hello, sir.

274
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:32,675
Fuck that prick.

275
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:39,180
Yeah. No. I couldn't
hear you there.

276
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:40,590
Antlers and shit.

277
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,851
That's my point,
I wanted you to see her.

278
00:20:42,852 --> 00:20:44,252
Yeah, you don't mark
up a body like that...

279
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,323
She had antlers?
What does that mean?

280
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:50,861
It was a crown.

281
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:54,195
We'll do the briefing
tomorrow, guys, early.

282
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:56,960
My guy does the AP Wire
asked about Satanism.

283
00:20:57,001 --> 00:21:00,399
It got Speece here. You're
gonna have his nose up your ass.

284
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:02,933
Major was saying something
about a press conference.

285
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:05,564
Well, guess I can count
my blessings, fellas.

286
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:07,035
Thanks for that.

287
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:23,353
Hey. You mind
if I skate? Ahem.

288
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:27,517
I got some names
from Vice, prost farms.

289
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,919
Check around on our DB.

290
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,287
You want me to go with you?

291
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:37,031
Nah. Just something to do.

292
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:40,837
Yeah. You go ahead. I'll
take care of the paperwork.

293
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:46,476
Like I said,
I'm feeling a lot of stuff

294
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:49,012
hit me at this time...

295
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:52,718
my daughter's birthday,
this dead woman,

296
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:56,187
and, um...

297
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,052
figured I'd work
the case, you know,

298
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:04,197
till DiCillo called
or we got an ID.

299
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,829
State Vice gave me
some addresses to follow up on.

300
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,470
So far, nobody'd...
nobody'd talked to me.

301
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:48,673
Evening, ladies.

302
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:53,033
I was hoping to ask
y'all a few questions.

303
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,896
Oh, come on, man.

304
00:22:54,937 --> 00:22:56,199
I'll get the next round.

305
00:22:56,232 --> 00:22:58,997
Heh. You making
trouble for us then?

306
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,268
No. I'm just looking to
get some information

307
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:02,539
on a woman.

308
00:23:02,572 --> 00:23:03,803
Might be you know her.

309
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:04,875
Who's that?

310
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:08,243
Hold on.

311
00:23:08,276 --> 00:23:12,376
Mmm. We'll take two large
Long Island ice teas, please.

312
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:16,077
Ma'am.

313
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:56,940
I'm Rust, by the way.

314
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:59,612
I'm Anette, she's Lucy.

315
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:03,351
Either one of you know a woman

316
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:06,923
about your age,
works the same place,

317
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:11,231
about 5'5", blond like you?

318
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:13,133
What kind of tits she have?

319
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:19,648
Medium, a little larger
than yours,

320
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:21,614
proportion to the body natural.

321
00:24:21,647 --> 00:24:22,780
Hmm.

322
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:24,612
Gee. I don't know. We
see a lot of girls

323
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:27,379
like that around.

324
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:29,053
Any girls like that

325
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:32,748
you haven't seen around
lately, missing like?

326
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:35,949
People come and go.

327
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:39,513
What do you want them for?

328
00:24:39,554 --> 00:24:43,154
I wouldn't bust
somebody for hooking

329
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:44,825
or drugs.

330
00:24:47,992 --> 00:24:50,190
I'm murder police.

331
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:53,295
Somebody got killed.

332
00:24:53,328 --> 00:24:54,663
There's a girl named Liza,

333
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:55,927
another called Destiny,

334
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:59,001
but I seen Destiny
yesterday at McDonald's.

335
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,370
What about Liza?

336
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:01,507
She's here.

337
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,925
Anette, go get
a couple more drinks

338
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:16,050
from the bar, will you, please?

339
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:20,355
All right.

340
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:28,658
You get pills pretty easy?

341
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,128
Relax. I want some.

342
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,230
Speed?

343
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:41,763
No. Quaaludes,
anything-barbital.

344
00:25:41,796 --> 00:25:43,036
Uppers are easier to get,

345
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:44,900
and they last longer, too.

346
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:47,667
Yeah, but it's not like that.

347
00:25:47,707 --> 00:25:50,170
What's it like?

348
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:52,810
I don't sleep.

349
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,111
Hey.

350
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:29,375
Oh.

351
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:30,847
Hey, Lone Ranger.

352
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,985
Hey. Ugh. Dreaming.

353
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:38,585
Why you out here, huh?

354
00:26:38,618 --> 00:26:41,259
Why didn't you come to bed?

355
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:42,723
Um...

356
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:52,772
Caught a... bad one
yesterday.

357
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:54,541
Just couldn't sleep.

358
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:56,645
You got that woman from Erath?

359
00:26:56,678 --> 00:26:58,613
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

360
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:00,076
Saw it on the news.

361
00:27:04,214 --> 00:27:05,822
Girls will be up soon.

362
00:27:08,286 --> 00:27:10,958
Missed you the last couple days.

363
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:15,126
Oh, shit.
I got to shower.

364
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,166
Got a debriefing today

365
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:19,732
and maybe
a press conference later.

366
00:27:25,804 --> 00:27:26,969
And if Speece calls,

367
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:28,874
tell him I'm debriefing
the squad all morning.

368
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:30,139
Well, Marty said
he was doing that.

369
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:31,578
He is.

370
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:32,642
Hey, beautiful.

371
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:35,181
Morning, baby.

372
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:36,884
Marty, how you want
your coffee, doll?

373
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:39,085
Strong and black
just like you.

374
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:42,358
Prints came back.
Dora Kelly Lange.

375
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:46,160
Priors for shoplifting,
possession, and...

376
00:27:46,193 --> 00:27:47,897
solicitation.

377
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,695
Address outside
of St. Martinville.

378
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:52,069
Landlord says she hasn't lived
there in almost a year.

379
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,364
She's got an ex Charlie Lange,

380
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:55,667
who's doing 8 in Avoyelles
for bad checks,

381
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:57,370
mom's outside of Breaux Bridge,

382
00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:59,537
DMV license expired,

383
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,368
and DiCillo called.

384
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,174
She was washed clean,

385
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:07,971
not a print on her.

386
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:11,409
We got ligature marks
on the wrists and ankles,

387
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:12,872
was bound
by a half-inch rope,

388
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:14,975
maybe 10, 20 hours.

389
00:28:15,008 --> 00:28:17,775
Evidence of vaginal intercourse.

390
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:19,447
Bound upright,

391
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,047
hadn't eaten in a
day, maybe more.

392
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,223
Toxicology hit for lysergic
acid and methamphetamine.

393
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:29,120
That's crystal and LSD.

394
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:31,129
How much LSD?

395
00:28:31,162 --> 00:28:32,561
Hard to say.

396
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:35,465
Got to wait for a mass spec.

397
00:28:35,498 --> 00:28:39,433
So she was drugged, bound,

398
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:42,170
tortured with a knife,

399
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:46,747
strangled, posed out there.

400
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,980
Yeah.

401
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:53,115
What about this stuff?

402
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,283
Well, the crown, for
lack of a better word,

403
00:28:56,323 --> 00:29:01,151
rose thorns, early
cane, switchgrass

404
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:03,990
wrapped around a bent branch,

405
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:07,492
and the horns are deer antlers.

406
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:10,056
Again, no prints on anything.

407
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:12,592
Symbols are painted
with acrylic basic blue

408
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,296
using a thick glove finger.

409
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:16,299
Ideas what any of this means?

410
00:29:16,332 --> 00:29:18,603
I don't know.

411
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:22,104
And it's all primitive.
It's like cave paintings.

412
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,570
Maybe you ought to talk
to an anthropologist.

413
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:41,523
Lot of trouble this guy went to.

414
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:44,025
Seems real personal.

415
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:46,530
I don't think so.

416
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:50,004
Was iconic, planned...

417
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:52,540
and in some ways,
it was impersonal.

418
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:55,173
Think of the blindfold.

419
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:01,516
This place is
like somebody's memory

420
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,452
of the town,
and the memory's fading.

421
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:07,021
It's like there was never
anything here but jungle.

422
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:12,189
Stop saying shit like that.
It's unprofessional.

423
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:14,924
Oh, is that what
I'm going for here?

424
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:17,929
I just want you to stop
saying odd shit,

425
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,928
like you smell a psycho's fear

426
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:22,434
or you're in someone's
faded memory of a town.

427
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:23,467
Just stop.

428
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:25,436
Well, given how long
it's taken for me

429
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:27,435
to reconcile my nature,
I can't figure

430
00:30:27,468 --> 00:30:29,906
I'd forgo it
on your account, Marty.

431
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:43,554
Ahem.

432
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,921
You get any sleep last night?

433
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:50,931
I don't sleep.

434
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:53,068
I just dream.

435
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,871
Occult.

436
00:30:56,904 --> 00:30:59,873
Now, I don't know if this shit
is anything but crazy,

437
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,881
but Speece
and the Superintendent,

438
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:05,282
they're paying attention,
the newspapers are making hay,

439
00:31:05,315 --> 00:31:07,283
church groups.

440
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,289
Detective?

441
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:11,258
Ahem.

442
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,260
All right, here's
what we got so far.

443
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:16,731
Deceased's name is
Dora Kelly Lange, 28...

444
00:31:16,764 --> 00:31:19,468
You stay busy now, the business?

445
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:21,929
Well, yeah,
I got the security firm,

446
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,466
PI stuff. Routine.

447
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,941
Lotta guys leave the job,

448
00:31:26,974 --> 00:31:29,613
cemetery within 10.

449
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:32,580
No family, idle hands.

450
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:36,619
Some advice, you make it out,
you stay busy.

451
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:38,586
Hit the corners.

452
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:41,082
Ask about anybody
she was seeing...

453
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:44,228
regular customers, meth dealers,

454
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:46,722
and rough johns, anything.

455
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:49,363
Any questions?

456
00:32:15,722 --> 00:32:18,321
You believe in ghosts?

457
00:32:21,194 --> 00:32:24,795
What'd we say about
silent reflection?

458
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:36,809
You happen to hear
anything out of the ordinary

459
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:40,081
between 10 and 1 AM, out back?

460
00:32:40,114 --> 00:32:43,017
No, no, but, uh,

461
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,585
sometimes they, uh,
dove-hunt out there.

462
00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:48,088
They found a woman?

463
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,223
Is it the Fontenot girl?

464
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:52,654
Who?

465
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,424
- And why would you ask that?
- Don't know.

466
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:57,960
Went missing
around here years back.

467
00:32:57,993 --> 00:33:00,065
Last time something happened.

468
00:33:00,098 --> 00:33:02,064
Just thought maybe it's her.

469
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:04,063
How old was she, this girl?

470
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:06,240
I don't know.
Little.

471
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,576
You know where the family lives?

472
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:23,749
Had a place couple streets down.

473
00:33:25,023 --> 00:33:28,128
They moved out, though.

474
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:30,694
Do you know the Fontenot
girl, one went missing?

475
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:32,660
Her?

476
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:35,163
Her family come to our service

477
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:37,667
once or twice,
5 or 6 years back.

478
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,531
Is that the girl?
Oh, Lord.

479
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:43,101
No, sir,
it's not.

480
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:45,573
Excuse me.

481
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,446
I want to ask y'all
something. Y'all think

482
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:50,677
maybe this have something
to do with those cats?

483
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,150
What cats?

484
00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:54,151
Two of 'em... one,
and a couple

485
00:33:54,184 --> 00:33:55,656
of weeks later, another.

486
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:57,153
Somebody cut 'em up,

487
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:59,161
turned their insides out,
then nailed them

488
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:00,860
to the front door, twice.

489
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:03,299
Now, I called
and told the police,

490
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,331
but we're predominantly African
American congregation.

491
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:09,102
I asked for it
to be investigated.

492
00:34:09,143 --> 00:34:12,712
We're not those type
of police, sir.

493
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:15,616
Well, who is, then?

494
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:22,117
Can I ask you something?

495
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:27,789
Any of these look
familiar to you?

496
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:29,787
- Seen them anywheres?
- No.

497
00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:31,792
No, they look like
something that might be

498
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:33,792
carved into a tree or something.

499
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,865
Mm-hmm.
How about these?

500
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:38,864
Now, that look like
something my old auntie

501
00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:41,031
taught us how to make
when I was a tyke.

502
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:43,198
What are they?

503
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:45,703
Some folks call them bird traps.

504
00:34:45,736 --> 00:34:48,503
Old Auntie told us that
they were devil nets.

505
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:51,839
You put them around the bed, catch
the devil before he get too close.

506
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,806
That's interesting.

507
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:56,244
- Hmm.
- She was a wonderful woman.

508
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:59,314
Loved her some Jesus,
but had a bit

509
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,311
of that Santeria
in her, you know?

510
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:04,309
I always just thought
it was something

511
00:35:04,342 --> 00:35:06,551
for children to do,
keep 'em busy,

512
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:11,020
tell them stories why
they're tying sticks together.

513
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:13,792
Then that's all
we got on the Fontenot girl.

514
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:15,792
There was
nothing in there.

515
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:18,328
Says, "Possible
report made in error."

516
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:19,730
Now, that was 5 years ago.

517
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:21,698
Ted Childress was
sheriff back then.

518
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:24,199
He's set up in Gulf Shores
now, I think.

519
00:35:24,232 --> 00:35:26,669
Ten-year-old girl goes missing
and that doesn't go state-wide?

520
00:35:26,702 --> 00:35:28,670
Now, hold on now.
My understanding,

521
00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:30,673
the little girl went off
with her birth daddy.

522
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:32,712
Now, did you check
her mom's record?

523
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:35,144
Possession, solicitation.

524
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,784
I believe Ted knew the family,
and the feeling was

525
00:35:37,817 --> 00:35:39,784
the little girl was
better off with her daddy.

526
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:42,583
Mom seemed to agree;
she filed a complaint,

527
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:44,589
then never bothered
with it again,

528
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:46,421
took off with her boyfriend.

529
00:35:46,454 --> 00:35:48,923
R&I said you had
a complaint these parts

530
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:50,924
around December...
little girl

531
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:52,924
getting chased
through the woods.

532
00:35:52,957 --> 00:35:56,098
Oh, yeah, I pulled
that one for you, too.

533
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:05,805
What the hell is this?

534
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:08,308
Little girl said
a green-eared spaghetti monster

535
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:10,813
chased her through some woods.

536
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:13,685
Now, we had her work
with a sketch artist,

537
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,783
and she told us
that looked exactly right.

538
00:36:15,816 --> 00:36:19,960
Now, you want to call an APB
on that, you go right ahead.

539
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:21,960
Listen, boys.

540
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:24,095
I'm gonna have to call
a timeout, make a beer run.

541
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:27,296
Well, why don't you hold
off on that for a while?

542
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:32,139
All right, well,
why don't you get it, then?

543
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:34,641
We really don't want to do that.

544
00:36:34,674 --> 00:36:38,142
Well, is this supposed
to be admissible? Huh?

545
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:42,141
If you want to pick
my brain, work a room,

546
00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:45,316
you buy me a cheeseburger
and a Coke, don't you?

547
00:36:46,685 --> 00:36:49,182
I'll take a sixer
of Old Milwaukee

548
00:36:49,222 --> 00:36:51,222
or Lone Star, nothing snooty.

549
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:53,589
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

550
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:57,155
'Cause it's Thursday
and it's past noon.

551
00:36:57,188 --> 00:36:59,658
Thursday is one of my days off.

552
00:36:59,692 --> 00:37:03,166
On my off days, I start
drinking at noon.

553
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,838
You don't get to interrupt that.

554
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:22,727
Ahem.

555
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,096
I'd appreciate a little
hustle up on that.

556
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:30,073
Yesterday,

557
00:37:30,106 --> 00:37:32,242
at approximately 6 AM,

558
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:35,747
civilians came across
the body of a female

559
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,248
in a sugar cane field
outside of Erath.

560
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:42,048
Now, this person,
we believe, was murdered,

561
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:44,749
and we are not yet in
a position to

562
00:37:44,783 --> 00:37:47,751
release the identity
of the victim or to offer

563
00:37:47,784 --> 00:37:49,959
details of the crime.

564
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:52,896
Our investigators

565
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:55,393
have several leads,
and hopefully we'll...

566
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:58,832
we'll have a suspect
for you in custody soon.

567
00:37:58,865 --> 00:38:01,336
Now, this perpetrator

568
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:03,841
will be apprehended,
and he will know

569
00:38:03,874 --> 00:38:06,841
swift Louisiana justice.

570
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:08,873
- Charlie?
- Mm-hmm?

571
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:11,480
Let's talk about
your ex, Dora Lange.

572
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:13,941
You want to talk Dori?

573
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:16,350
What's she said I've done now?

574
00:38:16,383 --> 00:38:18,855
Nothing. We're just
curious if you knew

575
00:38:18,888 --> 00:38:21,391
what she's been up to and
maybe where she's living.

576
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,991
Nope.

577
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:24,992
Got her divorce papers
pushed through

578
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:26,992
after I been here about a year.

579
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:29,526
I don't blame the bitch.

580
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,494
She got a habit?

581
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah, a few.

582
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:36,470
Weed, meth, juice.

583
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:38,176
Name it.

584
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:39,871
Charlie,

585
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:41,342
how'd y'all meet?

586
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:44,045
Growed up together,
dropped out the same time.

587
00:38:44,078 --> 00:38:46,680
Hitched up way too quick.

588
00:38:46,713 --> 00:38:50,014
You know how it is... you want
a wife, but only half the time.

589
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:51,486
Hmm.

590
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,993
Why are you saying
you hadn't heard from her?

591
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:57,227
She called up here
for you not too long ago.

592
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,300
She couldn't help me
anyway, man.

593
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,237
She sounded all fucked up.

594
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,238
You see, that's exactly
the kind of thing

595
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:05,269
that we do want to know
about, though, Charlie.

596
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,835
Oh. All right.

597
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:09,909
Uh... I needed
some scratch for my store,

598
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:13,042
and Dori owes me money,
she ain't got no fuckin' phone,

599
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:15,683
so got a number to
her friend Carla, got her

600
00:39:15,716 --> 00:39:18,686
to call me back, and she ain't
made no fuckin' sense.

601
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,486
Ahem. Carla's full
name and phone number.

602
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,422
What you mean,
she didn't make sense?

603
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:28,525
Like she could duck-hunt
with a rake.

604
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,963
High, yeah.

605
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:34,298
Talkin' 'bout
she's gonna become a nun.

606
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:37,572
- Why a nun?
- I don't know, man. She was high.

607
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:39,538
Fucked up, uh,

608
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:42,907
talkin' 'bout...
she met a king.

609
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,410
Shit.

610
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:47,115
Anyway...

611
00:39:47,148 --> 00:39:49,285
I don't need no
snitch jacket up in here.

612
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:51,823
Give me a break.

613
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,322
This is Avoyelles.

614
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:56,860
It's a goddamn day camp.

615
00:39:56,901 --> 00:39:59,598
Spend some time in Angola.

616
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:02,529
Surprised you even got
Aryan Nation here.

617
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:06,705
What'd Dori do?

618
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:12,075
Dori's dead.

619
00:40:13,483 --> 00:40:15,946
Thank you, boys.

620
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:18,616
We almost had a moment there.

621
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,495
Mmm.

622
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:34,896
So you want to talk the whole
case through or just the end?

623
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:36,832
No, whole story

624
00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:38,231
from your end, you don't mind.

625
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:40,503
You know, like he said,
files got ruined.

626
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:42,136
Hurricane Rita.

627
00:40:44,504 --> 00:40:49,477
What he didn't say is that this
is about something else.

628
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,981
Something new. That one
in Lake Charles, maybe?

629
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:55,653
Now, why you say that?

630
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,190
Get the details
out of the paper.

631
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:00,161
Yeah, we did.

632
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:03,023
You know anything about that,
about Lake Charles?

633
00:41:03,056 --> 00:41:05,592
Well, let me see

634
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,299
what you got, jog my memory.

635
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,267
Well, let's hear
your story first,

636
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:13,441
see how it fit with what we got.

637
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:17,609
Well, your dime, boss.

638
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,041
Talking Cohle,
what about that dinner

639
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:22,575
you mentioned, he turn up drunk?

640
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:24,582
Oh. Yeah.

641
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,044
Well, ahem.

642
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,484
That dinner,
that was a bit later.

643
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:32,085
It was kind of funny.

644
00:41:32,118 --> 00:41:34,589
The flowers, you know?

645
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:37,555
Like, he read somewhere that
if you get invited to dinner,

646
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:40,059
you're supposed
to bring flowers?

647
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:42,093
The hell?

648
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,630
You can barely stand up.

649
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,595
What is it?

650
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:49,037
You don't drink
with me or the boys,

651
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,869
and you got to get a load on

652
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,709
before you visit my family?

653
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:55,276
No, Marty, it's not like that.

654
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:57,811
And I didn't mean to,

655
00:41:57,844 --> 00:41:59,947
all right?

656
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:03,786
And I don't drink
'cause I've had trouble

657
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:06,953
with it before;
I didn't mean to.

658
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:11,797
I was checking on a CI.

659
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,965
I ended up hanging around a bar.

660
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,301
I was sitting there.

661
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:21,467
I couldn't think
of a good reason not to.

662
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:25,600
Usually I can.

663
00:42:30,643 --> 00:42:33,010
Don't worry about it.

664
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:35,011
Have some more coffee

665
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,051
and just try to make 10
minutes of conversation.

666
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:39,788
You got it.

667
00:42:39,821 --> 00:42:42,555
I'll call Chris or somebody,

668
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:44,690
get you out of here.

669
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:49,195
Marty.

670
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:53,959
I'm sorry, man.

671
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,433
Forget it.

672
00:42:56,466 --> 00:42:59,602
We'll try this some other time.

673
00:43:10,018 --> 00:43:13,983
Well, uh, Rust, it is
so nice to finally meet you.

674
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:16,485
Sorry it took so long.

675
00:43:16,518 --> 00:43:19,484
Well, I tried to tell her
you aren't big on socializing.

676
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:20,986
I said that your life's

677
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:22,953
in this man's hands, right?

678
00:43:22,986 --> 00:43:25,425
Of course you should
meet the family.

679
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:29,427
Well, not quite
as dramatic as that, hon.

680
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,996
I've never fired my gun.

681
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:34,037
Have you fired your gun?

682
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,333
Audrey.

683
00:43:39,205 --> 00:43:40,643
Yes.

684
00:43:40,676 --> 00:43:42,507
You shot people?

685
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,845
Macie.

686
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:45,349
Ahem.

687
00:43:45,383 --> 00:43:47,851
Dad's never shot anybody.

688
00:43:47,884 --> 00:43:50,985
Well, that's good.

689
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:52,882
You don't want to shoot people.

690
00:43:52,915 --> 00:43:54,650
But you have.

691
00:43:56,323 --> 00:43:58,794
Marty says you're from Texas.

692
00:43:58,827 --> 00:44:01,293
Yes, south Texas.

693
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:04,767
I grew up in Alaska.

694
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,533
Just been working here
the last 10, 12 years.

695
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:09,541
What kind of work?

696
00:44:09,574 --> 00:44:12,342
Narcotics, mostly.

697
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:14,310
Um...

698
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:17,850
was on the Robbery Squad
in Houston until '89.

699
00:44:17,883 --> 00:44:21,690
Ahem. Oh. Be right back.

700
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:23,826
Y'all keep eating.

701
00:44:28,196 --> 00:44:30,833
Do you like your job?

702
00:44:33,729 --> 00:44:35,904
Not exactly,

703
00:44:35,937 --> 00:44:38,105
but it's worthwhile.

704
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:40,104
I'm good at it.

705
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:42,239
You're not married?

706
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,576
Once.

707
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:48,082
- Uh, not anymore.
- Mm-hmm.

708
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:51,521
Did you do this
while you were married?

709
00:44:51,554 --> 00:44:53,489
Hey, Chris.

710
00:44:53,522 --> 00:44:56,488
Hey, thanks for the page.

711
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:59,524
Yeah, well, he'll appreciate it.

712
00:44:59,557 --> 00:45:02,018
Well... all right,

713
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:04,754
then I appreciate it.

714
00:45:11,264 --> 00:45:13,199
Children?

715
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:15,697
One.

716
00:45:15,738 --> 00:45:18,172
She passed.

717
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:21,848
Marriage didn't last
long after that.

718
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,851
Sorry.

719
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,293
Ahem. Chris Demma's
on the phone for you.

720
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:33,491
Something about a CI or...

721
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:35,965
Back there to the left.

722
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:37,966
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

723
00:45:42,203 --> 00:45:44,309
Ahem.

724
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:51,643
What was that?

725
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:53,685
What were y'all talking about?

726
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:55,654
Your job.

727
00:45:55,687 --> 00:45:58,421
What do you know
about him, Marty?

728
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:03,769
Um, not a lot.

729
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,264
He could be a good detective.

730
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,803
He's running on this
thing, but, uh...

731
00:46:09,844 --> 00:46:11,307
uppity.

732
00:46:12,845 --> 00:46:14,782
What?

733
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:18,753
Jeez. Have you ever
asked him about himself?

734
00:46:20,157 --> 00:46:22,094
Baby, trust me.

735
00:46:22,135 --> 00:46:25,272
You do not want to pick
this man's brain.

736
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,107
What was that?

737
00:46:31,148 --> 00:46:34,779
Oh, some details
on the CI. Ahem.

738
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:40,725
Thank you for dinner, Maggie.

739
00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:43,558
- This looks great.
- My pleasure.

740
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:45,556
I don't like
that broccoli.

741
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:47,091
Mind your manners.

742
00:46:47,132 --> 00:46:50,162
So you, uh, need to go or what?

743
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:54,497
No, it's nothing can't
wait till tomorrow.

744
00:46:55,864 --> 00:47:00,135
Rust, uh, what
you were saying before?

745
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:06,208
Oh, we can find something
nicer to talk about.

746
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:09,682
Marty, I saw
your table in there.

747
00:47:09,715 --> 00:47:11,514
You fly-fish?

748
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:13,653
Little bit.

749
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:19,123
So you
and Cohle went bad in '02, huh?

750
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:21,426
Heard about that.

751
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:24,765
Yeah, well... what happened
between me and him

752
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:28,773
don't have nothing to do
with Dora Lange.

753
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:33,142
I worked with Rust Cohle
for 7 years.

754
00:47:33,175 --> 00:47:35,142
People change.

755
00:47:35,183 --> 00:47:38,414
Relationships change.

756
00:47:38,447 --> 00:47:40,920
You stay in touch?

757
00:47:40,953 --> 00:47:43,391
No.

758
00:47:43,424 --> 00:47:47,423
No, I haven't talked
to Rust in...

759
00:47:47,457 --> 00:47:49,931
10 years.

760
00:47:49,964 --> 00:47:52,132
Yeah.

761
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,044
Look, however we...

762
00:47:57,077 --> 00:48:00,041
he was a good detective,

763
00:48:00,074 --> 00:48:04,043
and it don't matter how
he ended it. I mean...

764
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:08,086
I can say that
because it's the truth,

765
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,758
and I don't hold grudges.

766
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:13,426
I believe that's the shit

767
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:16,235
that leads to cancer.

768
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:23,073
But why am I talking
about dinner?

769
00:48:23,106 --> 00:48:27,748
Y'all want to walk through
the Lange case, fine.

770
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,424
This other stuff...
well, what's going on?

771
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:36,326
Sorry. We just heard
some stories.

772
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,358
Well, personally,
I heard he was

773
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:40,561
an ace case man, right?

774
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:43,736
I'd like to understand
his process.

775
00:48:46,366 --> 00:48:48,333
"His process."

776
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:49,974
Sure.

777
00:48:51,408 --> 00:48:53,488
The other landlord
says she trashed the place,

778
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,479
so she lost her deposit.

779
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:57,479
And the neighbors check out.

780
00:48:57,512 --> 00:48:59,985
Those that remember her
said that she, uh,

781
00:49:00,018 --> 00:49:02,490
used to come in early
in the morning,

782
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,491
if she came home at all.

783
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:10,668
You guys canvass the bars
pretty good today?

784
00:49:13,165 --> 00:49:15,637
You know,
up your ass, Cohle.

785
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,670
Why don't you do your
own fuckin' leg work,

786
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,805
you rat fuck?

787
00:49:24,383 --> 00:49:26,046
Say it again, rummy.

788
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,054
Hey.

789
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,561
You know what, man?

790
00:49:33,593 --> 00:49:35,727
Fuck you,

791
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,863
Tax Man.

792
00:49:41,403 --> 00:49:43,337
What the fuck?

793
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:46,044
Ahem.
Back to point.

794
00:49:46,076 --> 00:49:48,044
Got 3 hits on working girls.

795
00:49:48,077 --> 00:49:50,548
No one close to her, naturally.

796
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:53,914
A few names recognized
her as occasional.

797
00:49:53,948 --> 00:49:55,915
Like she tricked
now and then, show up

798
00:49:55,948 --> 00:49:58,725
at a couple of truck stops
when she needed cash.

799
00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:00,789
You got some names.
Which ones?

800
00:50:00,822 --> 00:50:04,293
I heard from my AP guy,
Ray Fontenot.

801
00:50:04,326 --> 00:50:06,830
Said her uncle's
Danny Fontenot...

802
00:50:06,863 --> 00:50:08,366
the pitcher, LSU.

803
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:11,334
Yeah, I watched him
play. Great player.

804
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:13,903
- Well, he lives close by.
- Ahem.

805
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,039
Well, thanks, guys.

806
00:50:16,072 --> 00:50:18,542
What about you two?
Did you get anything today?

807
00:50:18,575 --> 00:50:21,579
- Not much, sir.
- Well...

808
00:50:21,612 --> 00:50:24,411
You might know
the Reverend Tuttle.

809
00:50:24,444 --> 00:50:26,579
He runs our state-wide
charity drive.

810
00:50:26,612 --> 00:50:28,588
This is Detective Hart,
Detective Cohle.

811
00:50:28,621 --> 00:50:30,083
Pleasure to meet you, Officers.

812
00:50:30,116 --> 00:50:31,586
Nice to meet you.
Cohle.

813
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:34,586
Your case has a lot
of people taking care,

814
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:37,626
doors locking where
they used to not.

815
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,592
Eddie's been speaking
to me about it.

816
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,294
Concerned, very concerned.

817
00:50:41,327 --> 00:50:44,066
We've been discussing
the viability of a task force

818
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,571
to investigate crimes with
an anti-Christian connotation.

819
00:50:46,604 --> 00:50:49,405
You what?
Really?

820
00:50:51,807 --> 00:50:53,414
Yes.

821
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,721
I don't mean to tell men
of your positions,

822
00:50:59,754 --> 00:51:03,425
but there is a war
happening behind things.

823
00:51:05,194 --> 00:51:07,358
Thank you for doing your part.

824
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,598
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

825
00:51:10,495 --> 00:51:12,932
Well...

826
00:51:12,965 --> 00:51:15,933
Eddie's going to be
very, very pleased

827
00:51:15,966 --> 00:51:19,102
to have such good men
working on this.

828
00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:24,079
Are you kidding me?

829
00:51:24,112 --> 00:51:26,583
Un-fuckin'-believable.

830
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:29,049
"Anti-Christian."

831
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:32,417
Fucks. And who
the fuck's Eddie?

832
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:33,721
Huh?

833
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:36,564
Is he serious?

834
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:38,532
Well, he doesn't
have a television.

835
00:51:38,565 --> 00:51:40,499
- Who's Eddie?
- And he's from Texas.

836
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:42,465
He's the fuckin' governor...

837
00:51:42,498 --> 00:51:44,466
- Edwin Tuttle.
- Ah.

838
00:51:44,499 --> 00:51:46,509
They're first cousins.

839
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:47,974
Well, that makes sense.

840
00:51:48,007 --> 00:51:49,973
Yeah, that's the
sound of The Big Machine,

841
00:51:50,014 --> 00:51:52,340
Cohle, that's gearing up
to pound your ass.

842
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:53,580
Heh!

843
00:51:53,613 --> 00:51:55,749
The sound of a gaggle of hens.

844
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:57,749
Yeah, you better
watch your mouth

845
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:00,054
or they're gonna
peck your eyes out.

846
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,051
- Hi.
- Hi.

847
00:52:03,092 --> 00:52:05,219
I am looking for Detective Hart.

848
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,429
I have a stack of
depositions for him.

849
00:52:07,462 --> 00:52:08,924
Judge Sutpen told me to
make sure and give them

850
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:10,929
to Detective Hart
and no one else, so...

851
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:12,729
- Oh.
- Is that the, um...

852
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,195
The, uh, depositions.

853
00:52:14,236 --> 00:52:16,172
I thought I should
walk you through them.

854
00:52:16,205 --> 00:52:19,437
Oh. Great, great. Let's
just find a place to talk.

855
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,943
Thanks, Cathleen.

856
00:52:20,976 --> 00:52:22,448
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

857
00:52:22,481 --> 00:52:24,413
Right through here.

858
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:54,043
Your
victim was Dora Lange,

859
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:56,580
but you all checked
on Marie Fontenot.

860
00:52:56,621 --> 00:52:58,051
Why?

861
00:52:58,084 --> 00:53:00,052
Missing girl, 5 years gone,

862
00:53:00,085 --> 00:53:01,558
report made in error?

863
00:53:01,591 --> 00:53:05,094
She had an uncle
who lived nearby...

864
00:53:05,127 --> 00:53:07,566
and call it intuition.

865
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,565
Sometimes he's
more responsive.

866
00:53:12,598 --> 00:53:14,803
I'd like to help.

867
00:53:20,709 --> 00:53:22,779
Mr. Fontenot all the way.

868
00:53:25,713 --> 00:53:28,148
Uh, ahem.

869
00:53:28,181 --> 00:53:31,223
We met,

870
00:53:31,256 --> 00:53:33,791
oh, maybe 7 years ago.

871
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:36,297
I was visiting
Skip Hays.

872
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,801
I'd played for USL.

873
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:42,167
Thing of beauty, sir,
watching you throw.

874
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,670
Hmm.

875
00:53:43,703 --> 00:53:46,302
Danny, this man's a detective

876
00:53:46,335 --> 00:53:48,271
with the police.

877
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:54,982
Uh...

878
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:58,477
I'm actually...
Ahem. Sorry, uh,

879
00:53:58,518 --> 00:54:01,752
we wanted to ask you
about your niece, Marie.

880
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:03,225
Hmm.

881
00:54:03,258 --> 00:54:06,657
"How much could You put on
one family?" I ask the Lord.

882
00:54:06,698 --> 00:54:09,527
We try to get by.

883
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,062
Did you know Marie's
birth father?

884
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:13,533
Len?

885
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:15,661
Len Stroghes was her daddy.

886
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:16,702
Hmm.

887
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:18,366
It's okay.

888
00:54:18,399 --> 00:54:20,875
We're asking
because, uh,

889
00:54:20,908 --> 00:54:23,378
we had heard that Marie
ran off with him

890
00:54:23,411 --> 00:54:26,745
and that... she wasn't
really missing.

891
00:54:29,284 --> 00:54:31,723
That's what Debbie said.

892
00:54:31,756 --> 00:54:35,725
Oh. Well, uh...
anybody heard from Len?

893
00:54:35,758 --> 00:54:39,366
Anybody maybe knows
where he's at?

894
00:54:43,237 --> 00:54:45,701
Uh, sorry.
The last thing.

895
00:54:45,734 --> 00:54:47,867
Do you know where Debbie is now?

896
00:54:47,908 --> 00:54:49,874
She married
another man.

897
00:54:49,907 --> 00:54:53,378
Not the one she's
with when Marie...

898
00:54:53,411 --> 00:54:56,543
She was in Vegas, last we heard.

899
00:55:19,068 --> 00:55:21,570
Marie must have loved it here.

900
00:55:21,603 --> 00:55:22,904
Yeah.

901
00:55:22,937 --> 00:55:24,873
All this for her?

902
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:26,874
Danny loved her so much.

903
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,873
We weren't her legal guardians,

904
00:55:28,914 --> 00:55:31,407
but she played here
all the time,

905
00:55:31,448 --> 00:55:32,943
more than her Mama's.

906
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:35,447
I can see why.

907
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,492
What is it Dan has,
if you don't mind my asking?

908
00:55:39,525 --> 00:55:43,493
All they ever told us was
"a cerebral event."

909
00:55:43,526 --> 00:55:46,131
Series of strokes, like.

910
00:55:53,908 --> 00:55:56,005
Marty?

911
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:59,950
Excuse me for one sec.

912
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:14,022
Inside on the floor
on the right.

913
00:56:32,841 --> 00:56:34,873
I don't know
what that is.

914
00:56:34,914 --> 00:56:37,978
I haven't looked in there
since the police first came.

915
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:48,662
Bet you want
to hear the hero shot, huh?

916
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:53,032
That place we carried
the kids out?

917
00:56:53,073 --> 00:56:55,168
Eventually, sure.

918
00:56:57,473 --> 00:57:00,608
So what did she look like...

919
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:03,312
that one in Lake Charles?

920
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:30,251
Can you, uh, tell us

921
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:32,484
anything about that,
Mr. Cohle?

922
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:39,065
That looks a lot
like the one from '95,

923
00:57:39,098 --> 00:57:42,205
but... well,
you knew that already.

924
00:57:42,238 --> 00:57:46,539
Yeah, there are specifics
consistent to the '95 case,

925
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,044
details that weren't
public knowledge.

926
00:57:50,077 --> 00:57:53,053
You were off the grid
for 8 years, right?

927
00:57:53,086 --> 00:57:56,053
- Show back up here 2010.
- My question is...

928
00:57:56,086 --> 00:58:00,059
How could it
be him...

929
00:58:00,093 --> 00:58:03,722
if we already caught him in '95?

930
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:09,194
How indeed, Detectives?

931
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,738
I figured you'd be
the one to know.

932
00:58:20,607 --> 00:58:24,574
Then start asking
the right fuckin' questions.

933
00:58:36,485 --> 00:58:42,022
