1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,289
Something went down, 2002.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,699
Your ex-husband's partner,

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,569
Rustin Cohle.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,450
I knew Rust to be a good man,

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,300
so I can't imagine what I can offer.

6
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,860
I'm the only one ever took up for you.

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,750
No, buddy, without me..

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,970
there is no you.

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,819
The man

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,350
with the scars,

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,769
made me watch

12
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,679
what he did to Billy.

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,989
What's this all about now?

14
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,519
Dead women and children.

15
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,629
Your partner here, he
braced Billy Lee Tuttle.

16
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,449
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

17
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,509
If he was pissed off after
the conversation we had,

18
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,930
then I am on to something.

19
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,090
I really wanted to see you.

20
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,780
I saw the pictures on your phone.

21
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,349
I cannot help it if
some crazy bitch sent..

22
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,810
I slept with someone.

23
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,560
It was Rust.

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,649
I quit.

25
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,860
You serious?

26
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,049
Thought maybe we should talk.

27
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,430
Sure. I'll follow you.

<font color=#AF7817>Original Air Date - March 02, 2014

45
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,210
You look like you're doing all right.

46
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,170
Father Time has his way with us all.

47
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,020
Looks like you must have pissed him off.

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,030
Why we here?

49
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,350
I got a thing

50
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,700
the State PD's asking about.

51
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,920
The Lake Charles murder.

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,739
I mean, shouldn't it
have been in the paper

53
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,699
to draw a line somewhere by now?

54
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,659
I mean, we can't trust them.

55
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,969
And, I mean, if they're gonna
cover something like that up,

56
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,740
who knows what else they've covered up?

57
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,710
What you think?

58
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,030
I think you don't look
particularly healthy.

59
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,460
Listening to you talk,

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,270
your eyes, you seem

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,810
kind of brittle, Rust.

62
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,220
Most of the last decade
I spent stone-drunk.

63
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,260
Functional, but hammered.

64
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,189
Went back to Alaska,

65
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,609
spent 8 years working fishing boats, bars.

66
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,760
- Oh, I thought you didn't like the cold.
- I hate it.

67
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,199
And then I come back here

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,569
to Louisiana for the first time in 2010.

69
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,850
And why is that?

70
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,750
The same reason I'm sitting
across the table from you now.

71
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,230
A man remembers his debts.

72
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,410
I don't dwell on the past.

73
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,969
Well, it must be nice.

74
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,269
I'm not interested in whatever
it is you think you owe me.

75
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,730
Oh, I don't owe you.

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,950
We left something undone.

77
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,900
We got to fix it,

78
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,419
and I've been working
on this for two years.

79
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,760
Me, myself.

80
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,129
Never called you, I never
bothered you with it..

81
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,659
Yeah, why would you? Shit,
man, what did you do?

82
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,029
Alienate every other person in your life,

83
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,609
and then finally you came
back to me in the rotation?

84
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,619
You know, not for nothing,

85
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,379
but if you wouldn't have
clipped Ledoux back then,

86
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,840
we might have got the whole
fucking story out of him.

87
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,169
You know, I think I'm gonna
finish this beer and say so long.

88
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,190
Now, I'm not much of a drinker nowadays.

89
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,329
In fact, I hadn't had a drop in
3 weeks till I ran into you.

90
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,420
Well, I don't need you to drink, Marty.

91
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,720
- I need you to help me.
- Why would I?

92
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,859
They say you can't account for your time.

93
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,259
They got eyewitnesses placing you

94
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,249
at the Lake Charles crime scene.

95
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,149
You got some storage shed that
you won't let them look at.

96
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,459
- That's right.
- Why not?

97
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,999
Why not shoot straight with them?
You're innocent.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,850
Help them stop wasting their time.

99
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,990
Fucking since when did guilt

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,400
and innocence define the State PD, huh?

101
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,320
Come the fuck on.

102
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,419
Now, I don't know the sprawl
of this thing, all right?

103
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,199
The people I'm after,
they're all fucking over.

104
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,589
They're in a lot of different things,

105
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,900
pieces, family trees.

106
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,330
The only way for you to understand

107
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,390
what I'm on to here is for me to show you.

108
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,350
You got to come see what I got.

109
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,690
No. You know what?

110
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,220
I don't think I've been
very clear with you, Rust.

111
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,740
If you were drowning,

112
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,170
I'd throw you a fucking barbell.

113
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,730
Why would I ever help you?

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,950
Because you have a debt.

115
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,170
You got some fucking sack.

116
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,199
What's that mean, I have a debt, huh?

117
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,290
Means the way shit went down in '95,

118
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,580
this is on you, too, buddy.

119
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,880
What do you got to show me?

120
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,320
What you packing?

121
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,250
.38.

122
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,610
Hollow-point?

123
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,380
Yeah.

124
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,930
That'd do it.

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,030
You never be too careful.

126
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,120
All right.

127
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,229
Remember, there was no physical evidence

128
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,220
connecting Dora Lange to
Ledoux's place out in the woods,

129
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,129
meaning it probably
didn't happen out there.

130
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,540
Nobody was in a hurry to bring that up.

131
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,510
Two.. women and children gone missing,

132
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,529
all taken from areas
within a 10-mile radius

133
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,939
of schools that were funded by
Tuttle's Wellspring initiative.

134
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,569
We establish a connection.

135
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,510
Who's in, who's out, you know?

136
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,939
I mean, do people disappear

137
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,509
in equal numbers in other
parts of the state?

138
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,010
- How many schools were there? - 14.

139
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,529
Now, I've covered a surface area.

140
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,929
I pulled runaways in state

141
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,549
and missing persons, and if you'll notice,

142
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,429
there's twice as many along the bayous.

143
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,429
I don't know why.

144
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,080
Hell, someone should do a study as to why.

145
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,389
Well, now you're just throwing up stats.

146
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,470
Why was Tuttle so interested
in the Lange case, huh?

147
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,519
Remember Charlie Lange
said what Ledoux told him?

148
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,399
Said there's a group of men, sacrifices.

149
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,910
Well, I think Tuttle recognized the scene.

150
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,959
That's why he came down

151
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,889
there jiminy quick with
a fucking task force,

152
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,530
and that's why he tripped out
when I talked to him in '02.

153
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,420
OK, so what happened to him?

154
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,189
I mean, I'm looking around here,

155
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,790
and I don't see or hear anything

156
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,140
that doesn't make this all conjectural.

157
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,140
1988.

158
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,419
Accusations of child molestation

159
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,589
at a preschool funded by Tuttle.

160
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,280
Name of that school is Shepherd's Flock.

161
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,699
It shuts down, reopens two
years later on Pelican Island

162
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,500
under the name Light of the Way Academy,

163
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,369
where Rianne Olivier went.

164
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,740
And I got an enrollment
list.. 16 kids in the class.

165
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,179
One of them turned out to be a
young man who'd just showed up

166
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,460
for solicitation in New Orleans.

167
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,940
Now, this is 2010.

168
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,800
His name is Toby Boelert.

169
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,920
Goes by the name of Johnny Joanie.

170
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,170
Shepherd's Flock?

171
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,339
Why are you asking me about that place?

172
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,839
You know, after that place shut down,

173
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,940
there was a lot of talk going around.

174
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,310
You ever see that reverend..

175
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,070
Billy Lee Tuttle, around?

176
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,490
You know, I think so, but
who can remember way back?

177
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,420
That's how it all started.

178
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,340
Memory be fucked.

179
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,960
I decided it all had
to be a dream anyways,

180
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,650
and I don't remember if it..

181
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,390
We'd go to sleep,

182
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,219
only sometimes I didn't
feel like I was asleep.

183
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,659
I felt like I was still awake,
but I must have been asleep

184
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,160
because I couldn't move.

185
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,020
Just.. sort of see under my eyelids.

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,600
And what?

187
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,210
I don't know.

188
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,090
There were men..

189
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,840
taking pictures.

190
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,550
Sometimes..

191
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,110
other things.

192
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,850
Who were they?

193
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,340
I don't know.

194
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,750
They had animal faces.

195
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,540
That's why I decided it had to be a dream.

196
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,920
They had animal faces, well,
it had to be a dream.

197
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,200
Any other kids see this?

198
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,960
One girl.

199
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,300
I don't remember her name.

200
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,440
She first started talking about it.

201
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,440
And she seen it, too, the faces.

202
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,639
I do not remember her name.

203
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,100
Marie Fontenot?

204
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,180
Maybe.

205
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,370
You ever see any of these men's faces?

206
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,550
Once.

207
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,860
They didn't all have animal faces.

208
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,410
Three younger men. I don't remember them.

209
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,280
Just one.

210
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,009
He had bad scars all around his mouth,

211
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,480
like the bottom half got all burned up.

212
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,440
I thought that man, he was a dream, too.

213
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,720
No, I don't think he was a dream.

214
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,149
I don't understand.

215
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,099
Are you saying that you think

216
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,200
that this hypothetical killer

217
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,310
was, uh, an old schoolteacher?

218
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,390
Or it might what, involve State PD?

219
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,440
Goddamn. What happened to you, man?

220
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,730
Remember him?

221
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,540
Yeah.

222
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,830
Yeah. You and I were on the case in Erath.

223
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,519
Girl comes forward and says she
was chased through the woods

224
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,879
by a spaghetti monster with green ears.

225
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,359
Now, I think that this is our man

226
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,320
with the scars on his face.

227
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,129
We got 3 references 17 years ago: that old

228
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,129
revival church said a tall
man with scars came through,

229
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,989
Kelly Reider in the hospital,

230
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,740
and now this hooker
from the quarter.. Toby.

231
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,109
I don't know who he is,

232
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,309
I don't know where he
is, I don't know where

233
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,550
this whole thing fucking
starts, but it ends with him.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,799
All right, you know the little
township down around Erath?

235
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,270
All right, that's where the
Tuttle family is from.

236
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,740
Now, it used to be a pirate hideout,

237
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,540
then turned into plantations and whatnot.

238
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,850
Had a very rural sense of Mardi Gras, uh,

239
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,109
you know, the men on horses,
animals masks, such.

240
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,670
- Courir de Mardi Gras.
- That's right.

241
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,569
Now, they had an annual winter festival.

242
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,639
Went heavy on the
Saturnalia, a place where

243
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,750
that Santeria and Voudon
all mash together.

244
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,960
Have a look.

245
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,920
From the winter festival.

246
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,440
Blindfold..

247
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,680
antlers, mask.

248
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,820
I got these from a series
an artist did in Kenner,

249
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,480
right after Katrina.

250
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,099
Says he kept running across
these "stick things,"

251
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,320
as he called them.

252
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,640
Look familiar?

253
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,470
Think our man had a real good
time after the hurricane..

254
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,839
chaos,

255
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,690
people missing, and people gone.

256
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,230
Cops gone.

257
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,010
I think he had a real good year.

258
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,580
What do you need me for?

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,610
You got friends on the force.

260
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,170
You have access that I don't, databases.

261
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,809
I need case files.

262
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,819
I need missing persons. I need homicides.

263
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,449
I need title transfers, auto and home.

264
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,349
I got a list of names.

265
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,349
I'm gonna need background
checks, tax records,

266
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,289
anything we can get on Ledoux.

267
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,979
Jesus Christ, man.

268
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,029
I wouldn't have called you

269
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,529
and I wouldn't have fucking bothered you

270
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,189
if State wouldn't have pulled me
in on this Lake Charles case.

271
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,729
Well, if you need help,

272
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,569
why don't you just give it
to Papania and Gilbough?

273
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,239
No, they may be pawns in this thing
and not even fucking know it.

274
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,009
- Come on.
- Look, Eddie Tuttle is the goddamn senator of this state.

275
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,130
The late Reverend Billy
Lee Tuttle is his cousin.

276
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,119
I'm telling you, it's a
fucking family thing.

277
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,529
That's what I mean when I
talk about the sprawl, Marty!

278
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,819
Eddie Tuttle's the reason

279
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,369
that the Lake Charles thing
never made the wire.

280
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,559
Look, man, you have some
compelling stuff here

281
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,390
and you might have something,

282
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,020
but..

283
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,079
all this.. this.. the "sprawl,"

284
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,959
as you call it, which I
would call conjecture,

285
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,749
this shit about the Tuttles, the State PD.

286
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,019
Do you know how fucking crazy that sounds?

287
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,039
It's like you've been
alone too long, you know,

288
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,469
like you maybe told yourself this story

289
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,390
and kept drinking until you believed it.

290
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,530
Marty..

291
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,950
I had my time where I wondered
if this was all in my head.

292
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,620
That time passed.

293
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,780
Really?

294
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,540
What happened to Billy Lee Tuttle?

295
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,210
There's something you're
gonna have to look at.

296
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,750
No other way around it.

297
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,400
You still take your coffee black?

298
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,139
Oh, uh, green tea, if you have it.

299
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,339
I've been trying to stay away from coffee,

300
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,719
you know, a little bit healthier.

301
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,790
So, Mace.. is she, uh,
back from Chicago yet?

302
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,510
Mm-hmm, 3 months ago.

303
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,010
3 months.

304
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,959
Uh.. and what was it, that..

305
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,250
Americorps.

306
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,560
Teaching.

307
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,819
And Audrey, how.. how's she?

308
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,120
She's fine, at the moment.

309
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,840
She sometimes decides she
doesn't need her meds.

310
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,809
I like her boyfriend.

311
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,570
He watches out for her.

312
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,310
She had an art show in New Orleans,

313
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,079
sold some paintings.

314
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,950
Oh, that's good. That's great.

315
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,489
I should buy one,

316
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,240
I mean, if I can afford it.

317
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,920
So the reason I, uh..

318
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,820
I mean, like I said on the phone, I..

319
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,620
I want to ask you about those cops.

320
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,720
They just wanted to know
about you and Rust.

321
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,150
Mostly Rust.

322
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,020
They wanted to know about

323
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,890
the fight in '02.

324
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,900
Mmm, did you tell them?

325
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,110
No..

326
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,940
but they think Rust did something.

327
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,579
I know.

328
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,800
He didn't.

329
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,360
I didn't think he did.

330
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,070
Have you.. talked to him?

331
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,790
No, not since.

332
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,880
Have you?

333
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,029
Yeah, I mean, after they brought me in.

334
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,220
Yeah.

335
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,799
How is he?

336
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,660
Different, same.

337
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,260
I mean, he's lived rough
for a long time now.

338
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,320
He always did, it seemed like.

339
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,640
Taken a toll.

340
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,770
He needs my help.

341
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,760
Are you gonna help him?

342
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,800
Yes.

343
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,960
Why?

344
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,980
I have to.

345
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,149
Well, what is it? What do
the police think he did?

346
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,909
I can't talk about that. It's PI stuff.

347
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,120
He's hiring the firm, I'm hiring him.

348
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,859
All this time, you two,

349
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,480
and just.. just like that?

350
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, I took some convincing.

351
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,680
I looked in Billy's eyes.

352
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,940
He looked in mine.

353
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,430
He got me suspended.

354
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,029
Now, Billy Lee Tuttle owns
3 houses in Louisiana.

355
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,359
One in Shreveport, one in Baton Rouge,

356
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,010
one in New Orleans.

357
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,910
Also one in Florida.

358
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,269
I waited till he went on his
spring ministry tour, 2010..

359
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,629
Look, Rust, I changed my mind.

360
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,749
If you did something, I don't
want to hear about it.

361
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,340
Remember I told you about
my stint in robbery?

362
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,280
I make a pretty ace B&E man.

363
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,010
Now, I staked his places out for weeks.

364
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,730
Checked surveillance, map security.

365
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,139
I found ingresses.

366
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,289
Now, here I am, you know.

367
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,939
My whole life is just one
expanding, circular fuck-up

368
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,269
and I think it's about to close out

369
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,779
with me getting clipped
in a home invasion.

370
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,219
I mean, what I'm saying is

371
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,920
I was aware that I might
have lost my mind.

372
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,110
But after the second home..

373
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,400
doubt got taken behind the
woodshed and put down.

374
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,719
Notice he never reported
the Baton Rouge break-in,

375
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,380
just the Shreveport house.

376
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,030
Found those in the safe there.

377
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,480
Paper stock's over 15 years old.

378
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,359
Goddamn it.

379
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,119
These.. they aren't as bad

380
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,970
if you don't know what you're looking at.

381
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,280
Motherfuck.

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,190
And..

383
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,310
there's a videotape.

384
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,690
Take a look.

385
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,280
No!

386
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,830
God!

387
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,590
Jesus!

388
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,100
Fuck!

389
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,430
Fuck!

390
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,680
You watch all of that?

391
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,010
Yeah.

392
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,400
Yeah, I had to, see if any of
the men took off their mask.

393
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,860
None did.

394
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,840
Oh, fuck.

395
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,640
I won't avert my eyes.

396
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,250
Not again.

397
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,150
Jesus Christ.

398
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,220
That little girl is Marie Fontenot.

399
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,010
Did you kill Tuttle?

400
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,700
No.

401
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,300
I assume that

402
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,180
he was thinking he was
gonna be blackmailed.

403
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,809
And I think some people took
him out after they found out

404
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,880
what was taken from the safe,
before he had a chance to.

405
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,170
What.. can I do to help?

406
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,580
We start by pulling everything
there is on Dora Lange.

407
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,239
And I got names,

408
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,639
I got family members, Tuttle connections.

409
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,539
Any information that we can get

410
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,510
on Reggie or Dewall Ledoux.

411
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,180
All right, we can coordinate
out of your offices

412
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,860
if you want.

413
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,870
You shouldn't have that.

414
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,080
Nobody should have this.

415
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,660
I'm glad that you're doing good, Maggie.

416
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,429
It seems like everybody's happy, you know.

417
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,290
It's.. ahem. It's good to see.

418
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,650
Thank you

419
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,330
for everything.

420
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,210
I haven't seen you in
over two years, Marty.

421
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,390
Did you come here to say good-bye?

422
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,820
Thank you, Maggie.

423
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,650
I mean that.

424
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,929
There's not gonna be a bunch of people

425
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,260
coming in and out of this place, is there?

426
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,050
What do you think, Rust?

427
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,979
Practical terms, we're doing
an identify and locate.

428
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,359
Now, I can't afford to subscribe to all

429
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,719
the databases that I used to,

430
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,489
but I got Auto Track XP

431
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,789
for motor vehicle records.

432
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,519
I got Flat Rate Info

433
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,380
for the QI National People Locator,

434
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,480
public records, of course.

435
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,669
All right.

436
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,100
That sounds good.

437
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,320
How you been? Ahem.

438
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,330
You know, besides work,

439
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,690
what do you do?

440
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,889
I'm sorry, I just.. I don't
ever remember you asking me

441
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,970
a personal question before.

442
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,050
Uh.. you know,

443
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,910
I just stay busy, uh,

444
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,880
fish, girlfriends.

445
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,470
You seeing anybody?

446
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,619
Not really. Some dates.

447
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,210
You know, it's all pretty casual.

448
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,349
I did have something going for a while,

449
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,990
this Filipino girl, but
that didn't pan out.

450
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,420
Quiet life. I don't stay out late.
I just.. I go home.

451
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,219
You?

452
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,090
Ah, I'm about the same.

453
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,879
No girlfriend.

454
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,350
Just go to work, go home.

455
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,160
How about that girl you
were seeing in '02?

456
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,190
What ever happened with her?

457
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,580
Yeah, that was never gonna last.

458
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,410
Never should have started.

459
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,299
Yeah. Boy.

460
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,830
She, uh, she had problems.

461
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,020
Oh, you always liked them crazy.

462
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,560
Yeah, that I did.

463
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,680
Why'd you quit, Marty?

464
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,130
Yeah, you could have been boss, you know.

465
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,310
LT, at least, Captain.

466
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,320
I did another 4 years
after you left, and I..

467
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,080
I guess the job just kind
of ran its course with me.

468
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,410
How is that?

469
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,989
I was gonna play baseball, ride bulls.

470
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,729
You know, you end up becoming

471
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,880
something you never intended.

472
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,800
Uh, I guess you never
really even know why.

473
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,269
I suppose I could have been a painter,

474
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,060
you know, a historian.

475
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,730
Old scenes, new details.

476
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,170
Yeah, yeah. You do much painting?

477
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,369
Nah.

478
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,440
Little late in the game to start
something like that, I reckon.

479
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,720
Life's barely long enough
to get good at one thing.

480
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,150
If that long.

481
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,250
Yeah, so be careful what you get good at.

482
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,009
What do you call a black
man who flies a plane?

483
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,220
I don't know.

484
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,399
Pilot, you racist bastard.

485
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,300
What else would you call him?

486
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,309
Well, speaking of, you know, I
been taking some writing courses?

487
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,069
And, uh.. no.

488
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,039
I have, and I been tinkering around

489
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,559
with this thing off and on.

490
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,050
True crime.

491
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,499
And that's the genre, not the title.

492
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,149
- You serious?
- Yeah.

493
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,699
You know, what happened in '95
and some other old cases,

494
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,570
and all I need from you, Bobby,

495
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,140
is some old copies of case files.

496
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,990
You still like your
single malt, don't you?

497
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,700
Ah, I guess I do.

498
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,439
Oh, business gotten so bad

499
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,900
you got to become a writer?

500
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,929
Nope, I've always wanted to do it.

501
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,330
I just never had the time.

502
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,930
And regards the files, I'd
like to avoid Fuck and Suck,

503
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,360
the two dicks I spent last Saturday with.

504
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,409
Papania and Gilbough.

505
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,410
I hear ya.

506
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,510
'Course, man. Whatever you need.

507
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,989
Appreciate it, Bobby.

508
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,130
Not a problem.

509
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,809
Missing persons, mostly.

510
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,800
Maybe far back as the eighties.

511
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,139
Well, anything before '05 that never

512
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,640
became part of an official investigation,

513
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,059
it isn't gonna be in the computers.

514
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,680
You're gonna have to
sort through the files.

515
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,070
Thank you.

516
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,500
Found something, background.

517
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,479
Dewall Ledoux transferred title

518
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,130
on a truck to a Jimmy Ledoux.

519
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,880
Appears like that might be a cousin.

520
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,210
I found him in White Castle.

521
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,290
Owns an auto shop.

522
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,160
All right.

523
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,040
Did you pull that Marie Fontenot file?

524
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,780
There wasn't one.

525
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,900
Report's gone. Backtracking that.

526
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,389
Marty, this is Robert Doumain.

527
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,320
He owns the place.

528
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,790
Hey, how's it going?

529
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,020
Nice spot.

530
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,180
He's not a cop no more, Robert.

531
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,090
You got something against cops?

532
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,240
Bob had a little boy.

533
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,300
Been missing since '85.

534
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,340
Sorry.

535
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,070
Jimmy Ledoux came up spotless..

536
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,670
3 kids, wife's a teacher.

537
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,570
He coaches his boys'
pee-wee football team.

538
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,730
Any relation?

539
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,630
So many Ledouxs around, I never
had to worry about a connection.

540
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,210
But, yeah, my dad's second
cousin or something.

541
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,840
My pops didn't like them none.

542
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,010
Said they weren't white
enough to be white trash.

543
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,290
What's this about, exactly?

544
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,369
Man asked us to locate his daughter.

545
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,589
It was a long time ago,

546
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,749
but it looks like she
might have known Dewall.

547
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,710
Sorry to hear that.

548
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,710
Must know what happened to them.

549
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,920
Sick shits.

550
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,190
Pop said they died too quick.

551
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,729
Is there anything you

552
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,190
remember that you can
tell us about these guys?

553
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,940
Just they were nuts. Looked at you funky.

554
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,700
Reggie was always asking about
the girls in my school,

555
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,319
and couple times I saw Dewall,

556
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,920
he just said kooky stuff.

557
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,420
Any chance you ever saw
a third man with them,

558
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,770
a man who had a bunch of scars

559
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,910
on the bottom of his face?

560
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,230
It's weird you say that.

561
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,760
I remember that face.

562
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,070
My pop let them use our deer camp once.

563
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,799
Took me with him. I was, like, 11.

564
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,330
They were maybe 10 years older than me.

565
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,280
They introduced us to the guy.

566
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,970
His face, underneath his nose and cheeks,

567
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,050
scarred.

568
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,140
Gave me funny looks all night.

569
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,310
Every time I glanced
at him, staring at me.

570
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,470
Any chance this man with the
scars was another Ledoux?

571
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,900
No. I don't know. I don't think so.

572
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,400
Next morning, men were
too hung-over to hunt.

573
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,710
Pop and I went home.

574
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,970
You, uh, ever see him
again, guy with the scars?

575
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,510
Never again.

576
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,480
I'd remember.

577
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,450
Fuck, I don't like this place.

578
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,040
Nothing grows in the right direction.

579
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,260
Where'd this woman come from?

580
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,430
Tax records.

581
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,470
Drew a paycheck from Tuttle's father.

582
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,220
Uh, some kind of domestic.

583
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,090
How'd you find her?

584
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,440
Well, had to get federal income
tax records from '40 to '59.

585
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,459
I matched Social with a credit check run

586
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,930
in the late nineties

587
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,740
for Section-8 housing in Alexandria.

588
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,260
Good job.

589
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,840
Look at you. Heh!

590
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,240
High praise from a bartender.

591
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,190
Cops.

592
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,690
She gets tired easy,

593
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,900
'specially hot as it is.

594
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,050
Now, I don't understand
what this is about.

595
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,000
Thank you.

596
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,569
We're private investigators,
hired to do, uh,

597
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,329
ancestral research.

598
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,790
M-mineral rights along the coast.

599
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,670
I never knew them Tuttle
people, but I heard stories.

600
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,800
No, thank you.

601
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,290
You think she might get
some money out this?

602
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,389
Uh, quite possible.

603
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,490
Depends on what we find out.

604
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,530
Miss Delores?

605
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,469
You worked for Mr. Sam
Tuttle 19 years, right?

606
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,550
Yes.

607
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,010
Erath.

608
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,249
Then Shreveport.

609
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,820
So you knew his son, Billy Lee, right?

610
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,919
A cousin, Eddie?

611
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,149
Little boys, mm-hmm. I remember.

612
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,039
What about extended family?

613
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,460
Cousins, you know, that might
have been close to the boys?

614
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,430
Those days, families were bigger.

615
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,820
Oh, all sorts of brothers,
cousins, kids just running around.

616
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,030
Did, uh, Sam Tuttle have

617
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,519
kids outside his marriage
that you know about?

618
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,750
Hmm! Don't you know it.

619
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,259
Now, people kept their own back then.

620
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,430
I mean, a man's house was his own.

621
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,210
Mr. Sam?

622
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,240
He had lots of children.

623
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,720
All types.

624
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,210
He didn't like a woman..

625
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,020
See, once she had it done to her,

626
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,970
he didn't like them but that one time.

627
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,100
Not after that.

628
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,700
Hmm, and out of all these
kids running around,

629
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,529
you remember one that maybe had scars

630
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,740
all across the bottom of his face?

631
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,550
I.. I think that was
Mr. Sam's grandchild.

632
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,610
His daddy did that to him, that poor boy.

633
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,449
I.. I think that child
was a.. a Childress

634
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,229
or what, Fi, he was a
LeBeau or a Childress?

635
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,150
From Mr. Sam's other family?

636
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,610
I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

637
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,000
That's OK.

638
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,060
Miss Delores.

639
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,889
Could you have a look at
something for me? One thing.

640
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,850
Just have a look. See if you recognize it.

641
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,050
You know Carcosa?

642
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,030
What is it?

643
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,980
Him who eats time.

644
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,750
Him robes..

645
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,050
it's a wind of invisible voices.

646
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,309
Mineral rights, my ass.
What you all doing?

647
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,400
Rejoice.

648
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,949
Death is not the end.

649
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,839
- Rejoice.
- You need to leave, now.

650
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,189
- Death is not the end.
- You need to leave.

651
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,140
You know Carcosa?

652
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,749
You rejoice.

653
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,910
Carcosa.

654
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,710
Rest of the family, they
don't really talk to Aunt D.

655
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,490
She crazy.

656
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,340
Dementia.

657
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,690
She never had any kind of good life,

658
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,769
but most days, she can't even make sense.

659
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,790
Yeah? She sure made sense to me.

660
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,520
That should worry you, mister.

661
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,830
Sure hope that old lady was wrong.

662
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,660
About what?

663
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,980
About death not being the end of it.

664
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,939
Did some backtracking on
the Marie Fontenot stuff.

665
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,370
Got some old sheets.

666
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,620
Sheriff signed off on the
"Report made in error,"

667
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,850
but he didn't take the
original complaint on her.

668
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,480
Deputy did.

669
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,100
Got a name?

670
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,570
You ain't gonna believe this shit.

671
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,850
Steve Geraci.

672
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,369
So I did some double-checking.

673
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,869
Before CID,

674
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,310
he was with Vermillion Parish Sheriff's.

675
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,240
Erath was his beat.

676
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,499
If it got covered up,

677
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,930
Steve might know something.

678
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,670
Didn't say a fucking word when
we asked about it in '95.

679
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,160
I never did like that cocksucker.

680
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,220
Where is he now?

681
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,780
Well, uh, this is the thing.

682
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,750
He's from Iberia originally.

683
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,920
After CID, he went home.

684
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,420
He's Sheriff of Iberia Parish.

685
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,870
Shit.

686
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,920
Yeah.

687
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,469
Rust, the only person
can arrest the sheriff

688
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,819
in this state is the governor.

689
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,400
Well, we ain't looking
to arrest him, Marty,

690
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,730
just have a little chat.

691
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,180
Well, he ain't gonna talk with you.

692
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,559
I got a car battery and two
jumper cables argue different.

693
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,789
Don't even start with that shit.

694
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,570
What do you recommend, Marty?

695
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,790
Well, fuck, why don't you talk to him?

696
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,640
You two always liked each other.

697
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,610
Well, what can I say? I'm a people person.

698
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,640
Well, start with that, then.

699
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,560
Oh, come on.

700
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,330
Just try to relax. Take your time.

701
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,160
There you go.

702
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,140
OK. Nice shot.

703
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,790
What was that, 15 on the green?

704
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,860
Ha ha ha! I don't know.

705
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,799
Hey, you know, on the phone,

706
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,050
you were saying something
about that Fontenot girl.

707
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,500
- Yeah.
- Why's that on your radar?

708
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,050
Oh, it's nothing. It's just, uh,

709
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,880
extended family wants a locate.

710
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,010
I didn't remember at the time.

711
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,620
Back in '95,

712
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,030
I was hitting the bottle a lot back then.

713
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,460
Yeah, who wasn't?

714
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,070
20 years ago, you know.

715
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,680
My recall,

716
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,910
girl's mom was single,

717
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,000
drug charges.

718
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,710
Little girl went to live with
her birth daddy, I think.

719
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,050
That is, if I'm remembering right.

720
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,379
Uh, Mama didn't make a fuss after

721
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,350
the first notice, so she was fine with it.

722
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,840
And you talked to the
family directly back then?

723
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,579
No. Ted Childress,

724
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,720
the sheriff. He knew them.

725
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,570
Childress?

726
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,540
Now watch this.

727
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,740
You like that?

728
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,300
Seized it off a good old boy,
had a quarter-bag of weed.

729
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,680
Ooh. You got to love this country.

730
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,920
Good to see you again, man.

731
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,130
Good to see you.

732
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,160
Hey, uh,

733
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,870
that client you got,

734
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,140
asking about the Fontenot girl.

735
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,410
You let them know I'll be
happy to talk to them.

736
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,389
Oh, yeah, distant relatives.

737
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,849
St. Louis. Trying to
settle a tiny inheritance.

738
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,100
Don't worry about it.

739
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,740
Ok.

740
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,790
Well, they want to talk,
you let them know.

741
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,319
Yeah. Don't go too fast, Sheriff.

742
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Not me.

743
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,419
Let's do it again some time.

744
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,770
Yeah, I like that.

745
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,090
Better get those jumper cables ready.

746
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,360
The motherfucker's lying.

747
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,870
Rust.

748
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,230
It's good to see you.

749
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,360
Bullshit.

750
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,200
I talked to Marty.

751
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,200
I hear you talked to the cops, too.

752
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,220
Yes, them, too.

753
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,450
How are you?

754
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,700
What'd Marty tell you?

755
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,869
He wanted to know what the
police asked me about.

756
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,670
He said he was helping you
with something. That's it.

757
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,560
How long you been back?

758
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,420
Hear you got a big house.

759
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,280
Marty says the girls are doing fine.

760
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,960
That's good.

761
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,720
Rust,

762
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,600
just tell me it's something
that's not gonna get him hurt.

763
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,180
Well, I can't tell you that.

764
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,169
It never sat right with me,

765
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,550
and it doesn't now, you asking
me to lie to you about him.

766
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,659
Now, get on out of here.

767
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,200
You're classing the place up.

768
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,330
Why'd you quit, Marty?

769
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,460
What's the real reason? What happened?

770
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,300
You tell me why you come back, for real.

771
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,660
Mmm, you first.

772
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,450
Why'd you quit?

773
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,740
Well, I saw something.

774
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:24,680
Baby.

775
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,110
Tweaker tried to dry the
kid in a microwave.

776
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,530
Saw that, what he'd done, and I thought..

777
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,390
never again.

778
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,479
I thought I.. I never want to look

779
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,610
at anything like that anymore.

780
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,050
Your turn.

781
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,750
Why'd you, uh, why'd you come back?

782
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,570
This.

783
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,720
Something I had to see to..

784
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,870
Before getting on with something else.

785
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,389
My life's been a circle

786
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:35,240
of violence and degradation

787
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,140
long as I can remember.

788
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,890
I'm ready to tie it off.

789
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,710
See you on the boat.

790
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,040
After the other day, I was thinking,

791
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,500
"Why don't I see Steve and the boys more?"

792
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,930
Ain't been out to my camp in a while.

793
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,350
You know, if I don't get out here

794
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,250
3, 4 times a year..

795
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,580
I'm a basket case.

796
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:18,770
I hear ya.

797
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,369
I do love a reason to drink beer

798
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,040
first thing in the morning.

799
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,130
Say, Steve,

800
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,380
I been wanting to ask,

801
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,539
you know that Fontenot girl?

802
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,880
Remember, going off with her daddy?

803
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,639
I.. I just wasn't clear.

804
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,659
Was it you knew for a fact

805
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,040
that she went with her daddy,

806
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,940
or somebody told you that
that's what happened?

807
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:53,450
The family talked to Sheriff Childress.

808
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,840
The girl's aunt and uncle,

809
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,340
he knew them.

810
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,490
Who were they?

811
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,599
Starting to think this wasn't just

812
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,109
a friendly invitation
from an old pal, huh?

813
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,770
It's definitely that.

814
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,670
Well, then try this, then.

815
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,000
I said all I remember about the girl.

816
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,620
Let's just have a good
time, and don't ask again.

817
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,230
- I'm with you 150% on that.
- All right.

818
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,360
Thing is, Steve..

819
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,400
I ain't gonna ask you.

820
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,310
He is.

821
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,480
No, I wouldn't if I was you, Steve.

822
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,390
You're out of your jurisdiction, Sheriff.

823
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,930
You realize who I am now, you assholes?

824
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,130
Yeah, I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

825
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:00,239
Marty.

826
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,960
Don't look at me. I ain't never
been able to control him.

827
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,560
Come on.

828
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,980
But you're done after this.

829
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,800
I'll have boss crackers
splitting your ass in Angola.

830
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,460
Yeah, we'll talk about that,

831
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,359
and some other things.

832
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,490
Come on.

833
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,970
That church Cohle talked about's
supposed to be right here.

834
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,249
- We're lost.
- We're not lost.

835
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,469
We're going in the right direction.
We're heading south.

836
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,159
And that's gonna head us to 49?

837
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,439
No, we're not looking for the 49.

838
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,759
We're looking for the church.

839
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,230
I know we're looking for the
church; we ain't got to no church.

840
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,309
Ain't seen nothing that
even resemble no church.

841
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,979
Ain't nobody out here to
even ask where anything is.

842
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,349
Let me know when you see something.

843
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,720
There ain't nothing to see.

844
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,360
Yes, sir?

845
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,280
You know there's a little
church around here?

846
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,760
Pretty old? Black minister?

847
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,940
You must mean Son of Life, sir.

848
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,530
That place shut down.

849
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,640
'05, I think, just after
all them hurricanes.

850
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,110
You live around here?

851
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,730
No, sir. I live in St. Martin.

852
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,289
Got a parish contract.

853
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:29,400
Take care of some cemeteries,

854
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,790
public schools.

855
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,470
All right. Thanks.

856
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,149
Hey, you know how to get to 49 from here?

857
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,210
Sure.

858
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,220
About a half-mile, you'll see a left.

859
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,260
Pr 1435.

860
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,460
Take that.

861
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,669
About..7 miles of fields.

862
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,810
You'll hit 49 before Crowley.

863
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,489
Know your way around, huh?

864
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:50,879
Oh, yeah, boss.

865
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,000
- I know the whole coast. My family..
- Thanks.

866
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,910
My family's been here a long, long time.
