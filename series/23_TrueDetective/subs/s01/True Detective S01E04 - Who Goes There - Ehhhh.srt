made a big show of it...

3
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:06,716
left a painting of
the crime scene

4
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,257
on one of your old churches.

5
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:09,462
You're obsessive.

6

just not about the job.

Are you gonna go
home with this guy?

8
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:15,638
Really none of your business.

13
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,468
I found another girl.

14
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:26,262
She was positive
for meth and LSD.

15
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,670
You ever think maybe

16
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:30,486
he tried to push things
where he wanted them to go?

17
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,232
Hey, we caught a break
in the case, boss.

18
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:33,929
I thought you were
handing that off.

19
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:35,842

22

23
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:43,971

to a narcotics lab

24
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:46,080
used to make meth and LSD,

25
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:47,700
did two years at Avoyelles,

26
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:50,685
and guess who his cellmate
was the last 4 months.

27
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:51,834

29
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,122

You know, like Polaroids.

00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:59,326
He was a big guy...

87
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:01,992
a lot bigger than you.

88

95
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:19,853
He's a cook, you know,
like a chemist?

96
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:22,224
He used to, uh, make shit
out of kitchen stuff...

97
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:25,294
cook down cleansers
and whatnot.

98
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,560
Used tater skins and fry grease
to make high-test sour mash.

99
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,604
He got mad knowledge for that shit,
but, like, I don't know, man,

100
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,077
he talk like a short-eyes,
like something.

101
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:36,243
How you mean? He wouldn't
talk that shit up in here.

102
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:38,545
No, man, he didn't. Like,
me and him at night,

103
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,038
blasted up on one of his mixes.

104
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,207
I mean, he could
brew some shit up

105
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:44,575
put you up out your head, man.

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,215

107
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,119
I mean, fuck, man, it's a
big deal out there, too.

108
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:51,943
So, uh, what kind of
shit was he talking?

109
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,024
He said that there's
this place down south

110
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:59,635
where all these rich men
go to, uh, devil-worship.

111
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,000
He said that, uh...

112
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,998
they... they sacrifice
kids and whatnot.

113
00:05:05,023 --> 00:05:06,536
Women and children all got...

114
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,810
all got murdered
there, and, um,

115
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:10,475
something about someplace
called Carcosa

116
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,979
and the Yellow King.

117
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:16,549
He said there's all these, like,
old stones out in the woods,

118
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:20,189
people go to, like, worship.

119
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:22,389
He said, uh...

120
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:25,228
He said there's just so much
good killin' down there.

121
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:27,525
Reggie got this
brand on his back,

122
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,597
like in a spiral?

123
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:32,101
He says that's their sign.

124
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,605
What the fuck ever,
you understand?

125
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,238
I don't listen to the
man, but he's big,

126
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:37,773
so I don't tell him to
shut the fuck up, neither!

127
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:41,245
You remember any buddies
he ever talked about?

128
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,580

129
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:45,011

had any visitors.

budge a fuckin' inch.

484

around your face,

485
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:20,740
grip your scalp, yank down,

486
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,375

488
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,515
And they'd put a
mirror in front of you

489
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,348
so you could get a
good look at yourself.

490
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:37,849
And they'd cut your dick
and your balls off...

491
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,698
