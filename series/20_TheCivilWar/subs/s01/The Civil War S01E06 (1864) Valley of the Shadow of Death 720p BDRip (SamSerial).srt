1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,476
"I have just this moment
heard from the front.

2
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,437
"There is nothing yet
of a movement,

3
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,273
"but each side
is continually on the alert,

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,734
"expecting something
to happen.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,862
"To think we are
to have here soon

6
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,822
"What I've seen
so many times--

7
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,700
"the awful loads
and trains and boatloads

8
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:36,704
"of bloody and pale,
and wounded young men again.

9
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,471
"For that is what
we certainly will have.

10
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:41,083
I see all the signs here."

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,626
Walt Whitman.

12
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:52,470
Men's beliefs, had
a startling simplicity to it.

13
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:56,432
For example, a soldier
in line at gettysburg

14
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:59,226
told, "you will advance
a mile across that open valley

15
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,270
and take that hill."

16
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,397
I, for one, would say,

17
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,941
"general, i--i don't think
we should do this.

18
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,943
I don't believe
we can get there."

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,363
But they--they--they took it
in a matter of course.

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,365
Um, and you must remember
they fought for four years,

21
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,618
which is a long time.

22
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,787
And this simplicity
was severely tested,

23
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,957
but they never lost it.

24
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:26,253
They--they--duty,
bravery under adversity--

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,381
very simple virtues,
and they had them.

26
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:59,120
In 1864, a rebellion in
China that cost 20 million lives

27
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,163
finally came to an end.

28
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,127
In 1864, the czar's armies
conquered turkistan

29
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,171
AND TOLSTOY FINISHED
<i>WAR AND PEACE.</i>

30
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:16,178
In 1864, Louis pasteur
pasteurized wine,

31
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,680
the Geneva convention

32
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,641
established the neutrality
of battlefield hospitals,

33
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,393
and Karl Marx

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,396
founded the international
working-men's association

35
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,106
in London and New York.

36
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,902
Nevada became a state,

37
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,988
and for the first time,

38
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:37,449
the words "in god we trust"
appeared on a U.S. coin.

39
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:45,040
In 1864, the civil war
was in its fourth year.

40
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,502
Union ships
controlled the Mississippi.

41
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,504
The union blockade
was tightening.

42
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,007
Lee had been beaten
at gettysburg.

43
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,551
Vicksburg and chattanooga
had fallen.

44
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,179
As confederate hopes
began to dim,

45
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,514
union objectives
became clear--

46
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,517
<i>ATTACK THE HEART OF
THE CONFEDERACY AT ATLANTA</i>

47
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,396
and destroy Lee's army
of northern Virginia.

48
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:11,025
But there was still
no real end in sight.

49
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:14,195
As Robert e. Lee
and ulysses s. Grant

50
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,031
prepared to confront each other
for the first time,

51
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,533
neither knew
what awaited their armies

52
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,537
along a 100-mile Crescent
east of Richmond.

53
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,915
To win, one would
have to outthink

54
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,000
as well as outfight
the other.

55
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,466
In 1864, for the first time
in history,

56
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,593
a nation would try
to hold an election

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,262
in the midst
of civil war.

58
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,431
After 3½ years of war,

59
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,267
Abraham Lincoln's prospects
for reelection

60
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,771
did not seem bright.

61
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,814
For Elisha hunt rhodes,

62
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,817
stuck in the union trenches
outside Petersburg,

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,863
the war stretched on
interminably.

64
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,243
To con federate Sam Watkins
at Franklin, Tennessee,

65
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,994
it seemed
"the death angel was there

66
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,081
to gather its last harvest."

67
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,501
That same year,
William tecumseh sherman,

68
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,212
now in command of
the union's western armies,

69
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,714
would set out through
the mountains of Georgia

70
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,383
for Atlanta.

71
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,513
Lieutenant Washington roebling,

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,057
who thought he'd seen
the worst at gettysburg,

73
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:29,770
came close to losing his faith
in the union cause.

74
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:34,149
In Washington,
a sometime poet, Walt Whitman,

75
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,486
worked as a nurse
in the crowded union hospitals

76
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,655
until they overwhelmed him.

77
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:49,248
In 1864, the pictures that
would come back from the war

78
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:53,210
would be too horrible to look at
for years to come.

79
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,010
"It is enough to make
the whole world start

80
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,178
"at the awful amount
of death and destruction

81
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,097
"that now stalks abroad.

82
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,516
"I begin to regard
the death and mangling

83
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,561
"of a couple of thousand men
as a small affair,

84
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,688
"a kind of morning dash,

85
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,400
"and it may be well
that we become hardened.

86
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,364
The worst of the war
is not yet begun."

87
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,366
William tecumseh sherman.

88
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,635
In early 1864,
spotswood rice,

89
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,888
a slave
on a tobacco plantation,

90
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,724
escaped and made his way
to Glasgow, Missouri,

91
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,894
where he enlisted
in the union army.

92
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:56,774
"Benton barracks hospital,
St. Louis, Missouri.

93
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,525
"My children,

94
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,987
"a few lines to let you know
that I have not forgot you

95
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,990
"and that I want to see you
as bad as ever.

96
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,702
"I feel confident
that I will get you.

97
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,997
"Your miss kitty said
that I tried to steal you,

98
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,708
"but I let her know
that god never intended for man

99
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,920
"to steal
his own flesh and blood.

100
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,506
"I once thought that I had
some respect for them,

101
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,133
"but now my respect
is worn-out,

102
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,596
and I have no sympathy
for slave holders."

103
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,515
Spotswood rice.

104
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,272
"The Willard hotel
may be much more justly called

105
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,274
"the center of Washington
and the union

106
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,276
"than either the capitol,
the white house,

107
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,028
"or the state department.

108
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,406
Everybody may be seen there."

109
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,699
Nathaniel hawthorne.

110
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,620
On the afternoon
of march 8, 1864,

111
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,455
a stubby, rumpled man
made his way

112
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,792
across the crowded lobby
of Willard's hotel.

113
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,503
A 14-year-old boy
carrying a satchel

114
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,463
followed in his wake.

115
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,465
He didn't have
his three stars on yet

116
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,050
because he wasn't going
to get his commission

117
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,844
until the next day,

118
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,970
but he just walked
up to the desk

119
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,471
and asked for a room,

120
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,015
and there had been
a great many generals

121
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,725
in and out of Willard's.

122
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,894
Practically all of them had been
in and out of Willard's.

123
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,523
The desk clerk said,
"well, I've got something

124
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,525
up on the top floor,
if that will do,"

125
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,277
and Grant said,
"that will do fine,"

126
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,987
and he gave him
the register to sign,

127
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,572
and Grant signed it.

128
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,991
When the clerk looked down
and saw "U.S. Grant and son,

129
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,284
galena, Illinois,"

130
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,162
his eyes bugged out
of his head.

131
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,997
Word spread quickly

132
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,915
that the man
Lincoln had recently placed

133
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,792
at the head
of all the union armies

134
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,544
was in the hotel,

135
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,297
and when he and his son entered
the crowded dining room,

136
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,091
everyone stood and cheered.

137
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,137
Afterwards,
he strolled two blocks

138
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,764
up Pennsylvania Avenue
to the white house,

139
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,016
where president
and Mrs. Lincoln

140
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,519
were giving a reception.

141
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,314
"I wish to express
my entire satisfaction

142
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,191
"with what you have done
up to this time,

143
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,526
"so far as I can understand it.

144
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,653
"The particulars
of your plans

145
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,531
I neither know
nor seek to know."

146
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,034
Abraham Lincoln.

147
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,702
Three years earlier,

148
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,622
Grant had been notable
only for his failures.

149
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,707
Now he was the conqueror
of donelson,

150
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,585
vicksburg, and chattanooga
come to Washington

151
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,004
to receive the rank
of lieutenant general,

152
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,673
last held
by George Washington.

153
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,890
He had command now
of 533,000 men,

154
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,351
the largest army
in the world.

155
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,243
"I want to push on
as rapidly as possible

156
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,119
"to save hard fighting.

157
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,206
"These terrible battles are
very good things to read about

158
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,542
"for persons
who lose no friends,

159
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,919
"but I am decidedly in favor

160
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,922
"of having as little of it
as possible.

161
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,675
The way to avoid it
is to push forward."

162
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,634
Ulysses s. Grant.

163
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,433
Hiram ulysses Grant was
born at point pleasant, Ohio,

164
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,104
on April 27, 1822.

165
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,606
His father Jesse
ran a tannery,

166
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,943
and its stench was one
of his first memories.

167
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,946
He was sensitive
and withdrawn with people,

168
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,198
but wonderful with horses.

169
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,951
His father thought him
hopelessly impractical

170
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,328
and got him an appointment
to west point.

171
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,956
A clerk mistakenly
registered the boy

172
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,416
as ulysses s. Grant

173
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,961
and rather than complain,
he lived with it.

174
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,005
His friends called him Sam.

175
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,431
He was graduated
in the middle of his class.

176
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:00,225
The next year he was engaged
to Julia dent,

177
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,811
the daughter
of a Missouri slave owner.

178
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:08,650
He adored her, and she
bore him four children.

179
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,986
Grant thought
the Mexican war wicked

180
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,613
but went anyway.

181
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,949
"I considered my supreme duty
was to my flag," he wrote,

182
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,367
and served bravely in battle,

183
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,703
riding alone through
a hail of enemy fire

184
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,205
to bring ammunition
to his men.

185
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,793
After the war,

186
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,171
the army sent him to a remote
California outpost,

187
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,882
where, lonely and miserable
without his family,

188
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,176
he began to drink.

189
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:38,430
"Dear Julia, I sometimes
get so anxious to see you

190
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:42,309
"and our children that
i am almost tempted to resign

191
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,602
"and trust to Providence

192
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,688
"and my own exertions
for a living.

193
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,108
"Whenever I get to thinking up
the subject, however,

194
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:55,447
poverty, poverty begins
to stare me in the face."

195
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:00,410
In 1854, he left
the army and returned east

196
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,579
to rejoin Julia
and work a piece of land

197
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,706
his father-in-law gave him.

198
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:09,670
He called it "hardscrabble farm"
and could not make a go of it.

199
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,298
He tried bill collecting,
real estate, raising potatoes,

200
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,717
even peddling firewood
in the street.

201
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,344
Nothing worked.

202
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,721
One year, in St. Louis,
he pawned his watch

203
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,350
to buy Christmas presents
for his family.

204
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,644
He had been reduced
to working as a clerk

205
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,563
in his father's harness shop
in galena, Illinois,

206
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,774
when the war began.

207
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:35,445
As a west point graduate,
Grant was a scarce commodity.

208
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,907
He reentered the army
and never looked back.

209
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,661
"In this season,
i saw energies in Grant.

210
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:45,288
"He dropped a stooped-shouldered
way of walking

211
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,541
"and set his hat
forward on his head

212
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,168
in a careless fashion."

213
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,796
John a. Rawlins.

214
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,596
He was promoted
to brigadier general,

215
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,844
won a small battle
at belmont, Missouri,

216
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,846
then a big one
at fort donelson

217
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,597
at a time when
other northern generals

218
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,683
were going down to defeat.

219
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,564
"His soldiers
do not salute him.

220
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,898
"They only watch him

221
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,609
"with a certain
sort of familiar reverence.

222
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,904
"They observe him coming
and, rising to their feet,

223
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,199
"gather on each side of the way
to see him pass.

224
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,495
"No napoleonic displays,
no ostentation, no speech,

225
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,039
no superfluous flummery."

226
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,210
He was
distinctly unglamorous

227
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,212
and had only
one personal attendant,

228
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,048
a runaway Missouri slave
named bill.

229
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,633
He didn't like marching bands

230
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,219
and could recognize
only two tunes.

231
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,305
"ONE WAS <i>YANKEE</i> DOODLE, <i>"</i>
HE SAID,

232
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,432
"and the other wasn't."

233
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,310
He insisted that his meat
be cooked dry

234
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,979
because even a suggestion
of blood on his plate

235
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,773
made him sick.

236
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,649
Once,
on the Eve of a battle

237
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,818
in which thousands
of men would die,

238
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,738
he had a teamster
tied to a tree for six hours

239
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,408
for mistreating a horse.

240
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,495
He was methodical, dogged,

241
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:10,081
and uncommonly clearheaded
under fire.

242
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,335
Grant the general
has many qualities,

243
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:17,589
but he had a... a thing
that's very necessary

244
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,049
for a great general.

245
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,677
He had what they call
4:00-in-the-morning courage.

246
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,679
You could wake him up
at 4:00 in the morning

247
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,057
and tell him that they just
turned his right flank,

248
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,184
and he would be
as cool as a cucumber.

249
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,019
He had an ability
to concentrate,

250
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,604
and a good example of that

251
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,732
is he would be working
at his desk, bent over writing,

252
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,026
and he would need something
across the room--

253
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,402
a document or something.

254
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,779
He would get up

255
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,322
and never get out
of that crouched position,

256
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,409
go over there and pick up
the document he'd need,

257
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,201
and come back to his desk
and sit down again

258
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,911
without ever having
straightened up.

259
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,247
It's an example of how
he could concentrate.

260
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:54,918
He drank bourbon,
and he got drunk easily.

261
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,421
A galena neighbor, John rawlins,
was made his chief of staff

262
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,508
and took it upon himself
to keep Grant sober.

263
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,555
Grant never got drunk
when his wife was around.

264
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,683
There was only two conditions
Grant would drink under.

265
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,309
One was his wife wasn't there,

266
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,562
and the other was there
wasn't anything going on.

267
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:17,399
He went on a true bender
during the vicksburg campaign,

268
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,276
but it was when
nothing was happening.

269
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,236
It was if he--

270
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,571
whether it was
anything sexual

271
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,072
about his wife
being out of touch,

272
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,699
I'm not too sure about,

273
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,243
but I do know
that it was, boredom

274
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,163
that would--
that would make him drink.

275
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,416
Now he traveled south
to Meade's headquarters

276
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,294
at Brandy station
near culpeper, Virginia--

277
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,755
the largest union encampment
of the war.

278
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:46,136
"April 19. YESTERDAY
THE 6th CORPS WAS REVIEWED

279
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,431
"by lieutenant general
U.S. Grant.

280
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,391
"He is a short, thickset man

281
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,603
"and rode his horse
like a bag of meal.

282
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,230
"I was a little disappointed
in the appearance,

283
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,150
but I liked
the look of his eye."

284
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,570
Elisha hunt rhodes.

285
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:08,700
"We all felt at
last that the boss had arrived."

286
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,548
While Grant
conferred with Meade,

287
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,121
members of his staff
described Grant's triumphs

288
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,706
in the west.

289
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,585
Veterans of the army of
the potomac were not impressed.

290
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,629
"That may be," one said,

291
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,131
"but Grant
never met Bobby Lee."

292
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,856
"Can anybody say
they know the general?

293
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,483
"I doubt it.

294
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:48,114
He looks so cold,
quiet, and grand."

295
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,659
"I think that Lee
should have been hanged.

296
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,411
"It was all the worse
that he was a good man

297
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,165
"and a fine character
and acted conscientiously.

298
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,335
"It's always the good men
who do the most harm

299
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,170
in the world."

300
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,006
Henry Adams.

301
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:08,677
Lee is, one of the most
difficult people to talk about

302
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,720
because
he's been immortalized,

303
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,348
or as they call him now,
some people, "the marble man."

304
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:19,354
He's been dehumanized
by the glory and the worship.

305
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,857
He was a warm,
outgoing man,

306
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:27,362
always had time for any private
soldier's complaint.

307
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,614
Once a northern soldier

308
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,741
being marched
to the rear as a prisoner

309
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,661
complained to Lee in person
that someone had taken his hat.

310
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,287
And he said, "that man got it."

311
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,581
And Lee made the man
give him his hat back.

312
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,586
The man Grant faced across
the rapidan river in Virginia

313
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,422
came from a family
as celebrated

314
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,549
as Grant's was obscure.

315
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:51,345
Robert e. Lee
was born in 1807

316
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,180
at stratford in
westmoreland county, Virginia,

317
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,558
and was raised by his mother.

318
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,768
She taught him to revere
general Washington,

319
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,395
a neighbor remembered,

320
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:04,482
"to practice self-denial
and self-control" in all things.

321
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,526
His father,
"light horse Harry" Lee,

322
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,293
had been a friend
and favorite lieutenant

323
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,321
of George Washington,

324
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:14,242
but light horse Harry also
squandered two wives' fortunes

325
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,245
before deserting his family
for the west indies.

326
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,040
At west point,

327
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,209
Robert e. Lee did not earn
a single demerit.

328
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,087
Classmates called him
"the marble model,"

329
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,507
but liked him in spite
of his perfection.

330
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:35,013
He was graduated second
in his class in 1829.

331
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,057
In 1831, he married

332
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,810
Martha Washington's
granddaughter, Mary custis.

333
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,729
She bore him seven children

334
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:47,817
and endured his long absences
as best she could.

335
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,071
The mansion at Arlington
with its 250 slaves

336
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,616
was her home
before it was his.

337
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,328
Appointed to the prestigious
corps of engineers,

338
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,246
he was three times
promoted for bravery

339
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,956
during the Mexican war,

340
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:06,127
where he once met
a young ulysses s. Grant.

341
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,422
Superintendent of west point,
captor of John brown,

342
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,757
he was at the start
of the war

343
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,177
the nation's
most promising soldier.

344
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:18,973
In 1861, Lee refused command
of the union army

345
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,267
and followed his state
out of the union,

346
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,395
not because he approved
of slavery or secession,

347
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:28,942
but because he believed
his first duty was to Virginia.

348
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,906
"I did only
what my duty demanded.

349
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,991
"I could have taken
no other course

350
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,161
without dishonor."

351
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:45,166
"The man who stood before
us was the realized king Arthur.

352
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,252
"The soul that looked
out of his eyes

353
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,045
"was as hon est and fearless

354
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,589
"as when it first
looked out on life.

355
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,759
"One saw the character
as clear as crystal,

356
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,845
"without complication,

357
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:02,308
and the heart as tender
as that of ideal woman hood."

358
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:08,022
A union girl watching Lee
ride past her Pennsylvania home

359
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,276
said, "i wish he were ours."

360
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,029
Early in the war,
he was ridiculed

361
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,322
as "the king of spades"

362
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,700
because of his fondness
for entrenching

363
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:24,038
and "granny Lee" because of
his gray hair and strict ways,

364
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,541
BUT AFTER HE DROVE McCLELLAN
OFF THE PENINSULA,

365
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,418
stopped pope
at second manassas,

366
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,503
demolished burnside
at fredericksburg,

367
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,881
and destroyed hooker
at chancellorsville--

368
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,216
all despite
overwhelming odds--

369
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,303
he won the unshakable confidence
of Jefferson Davis

370
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:42,098
and the unqualified love
of his officers and men.

371
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,559
He is Avery great general,

372
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:50,440
and, h-he's superb on both
the offensive and the defensive.

373
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,025
He took long chances,

374
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,569
but he took them
because he had to.

375
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,821
If Grant had not
had superior numbers,

376
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,908
he might have taken chances
as long as Lee took.

377
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,076
The only way to win
was with long chances,

378
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,037
and it made him brilliant.

379
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,750
No one ever called him
Bobby Lee to his face.

380
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,585
His men called him
"marse Robert"

381
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,378
or "uncle Robert."

382
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,755
He had a terrible temper,

383
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,549
which he worked all his life
to control.

384
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:21,429
When angered,
his icy stare was unforgettable.

385
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:22,931
There was a young man
brought before him

386
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,724
for some infraction
of the rules,

387
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,518
and can you imagine being
brought before general Lee

388
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,854
for having broken the rules?

389
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,356
And the young man was trembling,

390
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,608
and Lee said,
"you need not be afraid.

391
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,151
You'll get justice here,"

392
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,778
and the young man said,
"i know it, general.

393
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,029
That's what I'm scared of."

394
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,991
Ha ha ha ha!

395
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,119
He referred to
the union army as "those people"

396
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,163
rather than as "the enemy."

397
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,250
Now "those people"
had a new commander

398
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,418
whom Lee had not tested.

399
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,310
When Grant began
his spring campaign of '64,

400
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,230
he took what they called
"the heavies" --

401
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,983
the heavy artillerymen
out of the forts in Washington

402
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,526
and put them in the field.

403
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,695
Many had been in the army
two or three years

404
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,155
and never had heard
a shot fired in anger,

405
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,659
and as these units marched
into camp,

406
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,704
they were so much larger
than the combat regiments

407
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,707
that, soldiers alongside
the road used to say,

408
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,083
"what division is that?"

409
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,626
There were so many of them,

410
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,253
but they had some fierce things.

411
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,171
The first time
they'd go into combat,

412
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:41,717
they'd have a mangled corpse-
an artillery casualty--

413
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,262
by the side of the road
with a blanket over him,

414
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,265
and as the new green regiments
came abreast of them,

415
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,350
they'd whisk
the blanket off and say,

416
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,145
"this is what's waiting
for you up ahead."

417
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,065
Not a--not a--
not a very pleasant story.

418
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:01,779
"To get possession of Lee's
army was the first object.

419
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,239
"With the capture of his army,

420
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,533
"Richmond would
necessarily follow.

421
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,369
"It was better to fight him
outside his stronghold

422
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,787
than in it."

423
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,581
Ulysses s. Grant.

424
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,303
"This advance by general Grant

425
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,223
"inaugurated the seventh act
in the on to Richmond drama

426
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,101
played by the armies
of the union."

427
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,978
General John b. Gordon.

428
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:40,276
"That man Grant will
fight us every day and every hour

429
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,862
till the end of the war."

430
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,115
General James longstreet.

431
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:51,037
Grant's plan called
for four simultaneous blows.

432
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,997
William tecumseh sherman
had orders

433
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,959
to strike out from chattanooga
for Atlanta.

434
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:01,339
Franz sigel would advance
up the shenandoah valley.

435
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,007
Benjamin Butler
was to lead an army

436
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:06,094
up from the James river,

437
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,639
and George Gordon Meade was
to lead the army of the potomac,

438
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,974
110,000 strong,

439
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,018
south against Lee.

440
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:19,190
"Wherever Lee goes,
you will go also,"

441
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,900
Grant told Meade,

442
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,861
and Grant
would come along, too.

443
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,906
Lee's strategy was unchanged--

444
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,952
destroy the union resolve
to wage war.

445
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,246
He would refuse to fight Grant
in the open,

446
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,165
force him to attack
fortified confederate positions,

447
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,877
and thereby offset
Grant's superior numbers.

448
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,671
The bloody cost

449
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,199
of trying to force the south
back into the union at gunpoint

450
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:49,303
would bolster antiwar sentiment
in the north.

451
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,140
"If we can break up
the enemy's arrangements early

452
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,891
"and throw him back,

453
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,811
"he will not be able to recover
his position or his morale

00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,647
"until the presidential
election is over,

455
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:04,068
and then we shall have a new
president to treat with."

456
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,028
General James longstreet.

457
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,496
"April 1, 1864.

458
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,708
"The president came down
to culpeper to review the army.

00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,836
"The president was mounted
on a fractious horse.

"Soon after the march began,
his tall hat fell off.

461
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,800
"His pantaloons
slipped up to the knees,

homemade drawers,

slipped up also,

"and with an earnest voice
exclaimed,

520
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,755
<i>TEXANS ALWAYS MOVE THEM."</i>

521
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,641
"Never before in my
lifetime did I ever see such a scene

522
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:07,269
"as was enacted
when Lee pronounced these words.

523
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,604
"A yell rent the air

524
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,399
"that must have been heard
for miles around.

525
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,150
"A courier riding
by my side,

526
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:16,237
"with tears coursing
down his cheeks, exclaimed,

527
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:20,741
<i>I WOULD CHARGE HELL ITSELF
FOR THAT OLD MAN."</i>

528
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:24,954
The texans held the
position until reinforcements came.

529
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,373
By the end of the day,

530
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,333
the confederates had smashed
Grant's right,

531
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,044
seized two generals
and 600 prisoners,

532
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,964
and come close to cutting
the union supply line.

533
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:49,520
Grant received these reports
without comment.

534
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,480
Right in the middle
of the battle of the wilderness,

535
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,107
all staff men
who had been fighting

536
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,354
in the east all this time--

537
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,110
and he had just come
from the west--

538
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,404
kept talking about
Bobby Lee, Bobby Lee.

539
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:59,905
He will do this
and do that other,

540
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,198
and Grant finally told them,

541
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,845
"I'm tired of hearing
about Bobby Lee.

542
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,452
"You'd think he was going
to do a double somersault

543
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,995
"and land in our rear.

544
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,705
"Quit thinking about
what he's going to do to you

545
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,165
"and think about what
you're going to do to him.

546
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,916
Bring some guns up here."

547
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,084
Things like that.

548
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,295
Grant's--he's wonderful.

549
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:19,425
The wilderness is probably not
the bloodiest battle in the war,

550
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:25,389
but the most terrible battle
in the war in many ways.

551
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,975
Grant in two days
loses more men

552
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,561
than hooker did--did
at chancellorsville.

553
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:34,148
But in the wilderness,

554
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:38,778
the leaves from the previous
year cover the ground,

555
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,530
and using the type of weapon
they used in the civil war,

556
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:46,035
you have lots of lint
and linen smoldering,

557
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,788
falling into the leaves,

558
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,541
and it will set
these leaves afire,

559
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:58,172
and men who've been shot badly
through the bowels,

560
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,591
with broken legs,

561
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,009
will not be able to move

562
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,595
as the fire starts burning
toward them,

563
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:09,767
and large numbers of wounded men
will perish in the flames.

564
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,688
Grant's first move
had been a disaster.

565
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,025
The wilderness had cost
17,000 men.

566
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:22,154
That night, brush fires
raged through the woods.

567
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,741
200 wounded federal soldiers
burned alive

568
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:30,955
while the entrenched armies
listened to their screams.

569
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:35,042
"I am holding my breath in
awe at the vastness of the shadow

570
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:38,963
"that floats like a pall
over our heads.

571
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:43,467
"It is come that man has no
longer an individual existence,

572
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:48,639
but is counted in thousands
and measured in miles."

573
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,808
Clara barton.

574
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:53,060
In the wilderness,

575
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:57,481
surgeons amputated limbs without
letup for more than 100 hours

576
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:02,111
and sent back behind the lines
2,000 wounded men each day.

577
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,948
"As a wounded man
was lifted on the table,

578
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:10,077
"often shrieking with pain
as the attendants handled him,

579
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,204
"the surgeon quickly
examined the wound

580
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,583
"and resolved upon
cutting off the wounded limb.

581
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,668
"Some ether was administered.

582
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,212
"The surgeon snatched his knife
from between his teeth,

583
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,172
"wiped it rapidly
once or twice

584
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,550
"across his
bloodstain ed apron,

585
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,176
"and the cutting began.

586
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,763
"The operation accomplished,

587
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,433
"the surgeon would look around
with a deep sigh

588
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,226
"and then...

589
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,603
<i>NEXT."</i>

590
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,980
Carl schurz.

591
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:43,694
"The wilderness
was a useless battle

592
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:49,158
fought with great loss
and no result."

593
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,993
Washington roebling.

594
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,372
Grant, in the wilderness--

595
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,180
after that first night
in the wilderness--

596
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:01,003
went to his tent,
broke down, and cried very hard.

597
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,339
Some
of the staff members said

598
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,799
they'd never seen a man
so unstrung,

599
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,968
but he didn't cry
until the battle was over,

600
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,013
and he wasn't crying
when it began again next day.

601
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,258
What was
different about Grant

602
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,685
became clear the next morning

603
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,188
when he gave the order
to march.

604
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,315
For the first time
after a defeat,

605
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:24,777
the army of the potomac
was moving forward.

606
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,655
"May 7.

607
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,658
"If we were under
any other general except Grant,

608
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,576
"i should expect a retreat,

609
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,704
but Grant is not
that kind of soldier."

610
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,957
Elisha hunt rhodes.

611
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,129
"Our spirits rose,"
one union man remembered.

612
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:47,633
"We marched free.
The men began to sing."

613
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,388
"Ulysses," another soldier said,
"don't scare worth a damn."

614
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,404
"General Grant
is not going to retreat.

615
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,448
"He will move his army
to spotsylvania.

616
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,242
"I'm so sure
of his next move

617
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:17,329
that I have already made
arrangements."

618
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,956
He knew what Grant
was going to do

619
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,958
because he could
make himself Grant

620
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,251
for long enough
to figure out

621
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:25,421
what Grant would do
in a situation.

622
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:29,341
When, they fired, let's see,
five or six generals

623
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,468
before they got to Grant,

624
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,470
AND BY THE TIME
THEY LET McCLELLAN GO,

625
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,807
Lee said, "I'm afraid they're
gonna keep making these changes

626
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:41,812
until they get someone
i don't understand."

627
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,314
They never got anyone
he didn't understand,

628
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,316
but, they finally got Grant,

629
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,402
who knew how to whip him
and did.

630
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:53,949
In the first years
of the war,

631
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,410
battle was bloody
but sporadic.

632
00:33:56,577 --> 00:34:00,164
From now on, it would be waged
without a break.

633
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,832
From the wilderness
to cold harbor,

634
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:05,502
it would not stop
for 30 days.

635
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,421
It was, one soldier wrote,

636
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:08,756
"living night and day

637
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,675
within the valley
of the shadow of death."

638
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,597
Our father,
who art in heaven...

639
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,474
"May 8.

640
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,268
"The dreadful work
is beginning again.

641
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,520
"John l. Miller,
my cousin,

642
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,440
"killed at the head
of his regiment.

643
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,193
"The blows now fall so fast
on our heads,

644
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,820
it is bewildering."

645
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,947
Mary chesnut.

646
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,449
But deliver us from evil.

647
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,876
At spotsylvania,

648
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:50,547
the two armies mauled each other
for days without gaining ground.

649
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,259
It was the most
relentless exchange of fire

650
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,096
in the history of warfare
up to that time.

651
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,851
Some men were hit
by so many bullets

652
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,271
that their bodies
fell apart.

653
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,899
A union veteran remembered it

654
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,444
simply as "the most terrible day
i have ever lived."

655
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,536
"The enemy's dead
were piled upon each other

656
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,621
"in front
of the captured breastworks,

657
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,916
"in some places
four layers deep.

658
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:31,088
"Below the mass
of fast-decaying corpses,

659
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,632
"the convulsive twitching
of limbs showed

660
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,136
"that there were wounded men
still alive.

661
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:41,473
The place was well named
the bloody angle."

662
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:51,608
The two armies lost
another 20,000 men.

663
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,579
"MAY 12th,
YELLOW TAVERN, Virginia.

664
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:07,332
General Jeb Stuart killed."

665
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,381
When Lee got the news,
he said,

666
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,759
"i can scarcely think of him
without weeping."

667
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,565
Again and again,
Lee anticipated Grant,

668
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,735
and again and again, the union
commander skirted south and east

669
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,278
in a semicircle,

670
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:39,489
the two armies locked in
a brutal, clumsy stranglehold

671
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,785
as the battle lines lurched
toward Richmond.

672
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,872
"We must destroy
this army of Grant's

673
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,333
"before he gets
to the James.

674
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,753
"If he gets there,
it will become a siege,

675
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,173
and then it will be
a mere question of time."

676
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,967
"MAY 11th.

677
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,930
"We have now ended the sixth day
of very heavy fighting,

"and the result up to this time
is much in our favor.

679
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,603
"I propose to fight it out
on this line,

680

if it takes all summer."

681
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:16,151
Grant continued
his stubborn flanking maneuvers

682
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,153
in an attempt
to get around Lee's right

683
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,322
and move on Richmond.

684
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,705
He did it with
superior numbers and doggedness,

685
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,916
kept going,
move by the left flank,

686
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,794
move by the left flank,
move by the left flank,

687

and Lee's backing up
the whole time,

688
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,673
losing men
that he couldn't replace.

00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,055
"that we have been
fighting a little.

692
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:49,059
"Our corps has only 12,000 left
out of 27,000.

693
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:53,772
"Uncle Robert e. Lee
isn't licked yet by a long shot,

694
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:57,734
"and if we are not mighty
careful, he'll beat us.

695
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:02,447
"I think we have done very well
to avoid that fate so far.

696
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,700
"Tomorrow we have
another battle.

697
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:08,996
I don't think
it will amount to much."

698
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,206
Washington roebling.

699
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:16,586
Grant and Lee now raced
for a crossroads called cold harbor

700
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,715
near the chickahominy river.

701
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,676
Again, Lee got there first
and ordered his men to dig in

702
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:26,430
and prepare for the all-out
assault he knew would follow.

703
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,352
AS THEY SETTLED DOWN
FOR THE NIGHT ON June 2nd,

704
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,481
veterans on the union side
sensed what was coming.

705
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,901
"The men were calmly writing
their names and home addresses

706
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,570
"on slips of paper

707
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,239
"and pinning them
to the backs of their coats

708
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,992
"so that their bodies
might be recognized

709
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,330
and their fate made known
to their families at home."

710
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,623
General Horace Porter.

711
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,382
When the bugles blew
for the attack at 4:30 A.M.,

712
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:06,845
60,000 union men started
toward the unseen enemy.

713
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,264
The battle of cold harbor
had begun.

714
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,769
"I had seen the dreadful
carnage in front of marye's hill

715
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,270
"at fredericksburg,

716
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:20,192
"but I had seen nothing
to exceed this.

717
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,819
It was not war.
It was murder."

718
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,915
Those were men who
knew how to take a position

719
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,000
where you could do
the most killing from.

720
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,293
When that whole army
was lined up,

721
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,628
they're waiting and hoping

722
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,463
and praying something
would come at them,

723
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,342
and Grant threw three corps
at them,

724
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:50,305
and in approximately 7 minutes,
they shot about 7,000 men down.

725
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,641
It was a bloody mess.

726
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:58,313
It's the only thing Grant ever
admitted that he'd done wrong.

727
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,607
"I've always regretted

728
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:05,112
"that the last assault
at cold harbor was ever made.

729
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,947
"No advantage whatever
was gained

730
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:10,367
to compensate for
the heavy loss we sustained."

731
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,749
When another assault
was suggested,

732
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,752
union officers
rejected the idea outright.

733
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,297
"I will not take my regiment
in another such charge,"

734
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,174
said a New Hampshire captain,

735
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,927
"if Jesus Christ himself
should order it."

736
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,516
After the battle,

737
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,144
the diary of a young
Massachusetts volunteer

738
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,480
was found
spattered with blood.

739
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,524
Its last entry read,

740
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:47,821
"June 3, 1864,
cold harbor, Virginia.

741
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:49,698
I was killed."

742
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,376
"Our matters here
are at a deadlock.

743
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,462
"Unless the rebs
commit some great error,

744
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,214
"they will hold us in check
until kingdom come.

745
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,718
"We are thoroughly tired
and disgusted.

746
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:13,054
"These two armies remind me
very much of two schoolboys

747
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,266
"trying to stare each other
out of countenance.

748
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:20,270
"Everyone knows that if Lee were
to come out of his trenchments,

749
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:21,730
"we could whip him,

750
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:25,025
but Bob Lee is a little
too smart for us."

751
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,777
Washington roebling.

752
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,490
From the wilderness to
cold harbor, in a single month,

753
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,493
the army of the potomac
had lost 50,000 men,

754
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:38,747
half as many as it had lost
in three years of struggle.

755
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:42,918
"June 5, 1864.

756
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,129
"Our people lost
very severely yesterday.

757
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,089
"In every calculation
that we make,

758
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,426
"we make ourselves out
to be 20,000 men stronger,

759
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:55,055
"yet in every fight, they show
as many men as we have,

760
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,557
"and they always show
as long a line as we do

761
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,435
"no matter how long
we make ours.

762
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:04,272
"June 7, 1864.

763
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,941
"Another one of
my best friends in the army

764
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,276
"has been killed.

765
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:13,156
One goes after the other
with perfect regularity."

766
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:20,038
"Grant doesn't care a snap
if men fall like the leaves fall.

767
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,290
"He fights to win,
that chap does.

768
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,125
"He has the disagreeable habit

769
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:28,588
of not retreating
before irresistible veterans."

770
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,382
Mary chesnut.

771
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,387
"He keeps his own counsel,
padlocks his mouth,

772
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:37,847
"while his countenance
indicates nothing--

773
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,225
"that is, gives no expression
of his feelings

774
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,728
"and no evidence
of his intentions.

775
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,564
"He smokes almost constantly

776
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,900
"and has a habit of whittling
with a small knife,

777
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,695
"cutting a small stick
into small chips,

778
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:55,240
making nothing."

779
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:56,658
"Grant is a butcher

780
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:59,327
"and not fit
to be at the head of an army.

781
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:02,664
"He loses two men
to the enemy's one.

782
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:06,042
"He has no management,
no regard for life.

783
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:10,005
I could fight an army
as well myself."

784
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,715
Mary Lincoln.

785
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:20,140
When several of Lee's
officers denounced Grant as a butcher,

786
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,058
Lee quieted them.

787
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,145
"I think Grant has managed
his affairs remarkably well

788
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:27,689
up to the present time,"
he said.

789
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,150
Grant kept moving.

790
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,192
He slipped his army

791
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,235
out of his trenches,

792
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:33,528
crossed the chickahominy,

793
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:35,405
feinted toward Richmond,

794
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:36,573
then shifted left again

795
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,034
to the James river.

796
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,869
His target now was Petersburg--

797
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,704
south of
the con federate capital--

798
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,831
where he hoped to cut off
Lee's supplies

799
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:48,293
and destroy the army
of northern Virginia.

800
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,089
For the first time, Lee
misjudged Grant's intentions,

801
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:56,217
rushing much of his army
to the outskirts of Richmond

802
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,721
to meet an attack
Grant did not plan to make.

803
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:03,391
Instead, union engineers
laid a pontoon bridge

804
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,686
all the way across the James
in just eight hours.

805
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:11,900
ON June 12th,

806
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:16,071
the massive army of the potomac
began to cross.

807
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,907
It took four days.

808
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:29,542
"General Grant,
i begin to see it.

809
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,795
"You will succeed.

810
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,588
"God bless you.

811
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:35,256
A. Lincoln."

812
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:44,307
16,000 union troops
under general William Smith

813
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,267
were the first
to reach Petersburg.

814
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,936
The city was defended

815
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:51,439
by fewer than 3,000 confederates
under general beauregard.

816
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:02,867
Smith moved slowly
to the attack.

817
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:07,872
Reinforcements intended
to aid him got lost on the way.

818
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,251
Still, his late-afternoon
assault made progress.

819
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:12,711
When night fell,

820
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:16,715
Petersburg seemed
within the union's grasp.

821
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,885
General winfield Scott hancock
urged a moonlight assault,

822
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,429
but Smith begged off,

823
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,639
remembering cold harbor.

824
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:27,016
During the night,

825
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,644
confederate reinforcements
were brought up.

826
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,897
The opportunity was gone.

827
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,485
"The rage of the enlisted
men was devilish.

828
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,405
"The most bloodcurdling
blasphemy I ever listened to

829
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,365
I heard that night."

830
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,786
In just six weeks,

831
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,831
Grant and Lee had
all but crippled each other,

832
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:53,585
and now both armies dug in
for a siege.

833
00:45:57,547 --> 00:46:00,508
The burrowing would go on
for 10 months.

834
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,845
The men lived in a 20-mile
labyrinth of trenches,

835
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:05,305
plagued by flies,

836
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:07,974
open to rain
and the fierce Virginia sun,

837
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:10,894
and exposed to shell
and mortar fire.

838
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,315
"Nothing for excitement

839
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:18,359
"except that a few were
picked off by sharpshooters.

840
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,362
"A feeling prevails
that soon er or later,

841
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,324
this experience
will befall us all."

842
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:27,202
Private John w. Haley.

843
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,037
Fire!

844
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,710
Colonel
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain,

845
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:38,046
one of the heroes
of gettysburg,

846
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:41,549
led his regiment
in an assault on Petersburg.

847
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,760
As he turned
to rally his men,

848
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,762
a bullet smashed
through his pelvis,

849
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,681
severed arteries,
nicked his bladder.

850
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:49,891
He stayed on his feet,

851
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,018
leaning on his sword
with one hand

852
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:54,062
and waving his men on
with the other

853
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,397
until they had
all passed him by.

854
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,650
Then he sank to the ground.

855
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:01,611
Doctors did not expect him
to live.

856
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,864
In tribute to his courage,

857
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:08,243
Grant promoted him on the field
to brigadier general.

858
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,288
Chamberlain's obituary appeared
in the newspapers the next day.

859
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:26,386
Petersburg is
a magnificent salute

860
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:29,639
to the durability of men
on both sides.

861
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,891
It was just--
it was a rehearsal

862
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,936
for world war I trench warfare,

863

and they stood up
very well to it,

864
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:38,898
but the soldiers always did
in that war.

865
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:43,236
They were--it's, to us,
an almost incredible bravery,

866
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,405

PRIVATE Alexander HUNTER,
17th Virginia.

907
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,530
When the war began,

908
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,783
there were only a handful
of army hospitals in the north.

909
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,660
When it ended,

910
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,121
the union was running
more than 350,

911
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:43,458
the confederacy, 154.

912
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:47,378
There were 16 hospitals
in Washington alone.

913
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,963
When these proved
insufficient,

914
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,507
men were cared for
in the patent office,

915
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:55,720
even in the house
and senate chambers.

916
00:50:55,887 --> 00:51:00,308
Hospitals were
giant warehouses for the dying.

917
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,560
The biggest and best,
north or south,

918
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,520
was chimborazo at Richmond,

919
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,189
with 8,000 beds,

920
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:09,275
five soup kitchens,
icehouses, dairy cattle,

921
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:10,902
a herd of goats,

922
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:14,322
a bakery that turned out
10,000 loaves of bread a day,

923
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,033
and a 400-keg brewery.

924
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,208
"Arous'd and angry,

925
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,168
"I'd thought
to beat the alarum,

00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:30,588
"and urge relentless war.

00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,924
"But soon
my fingers fail'd me,

928
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:36,386

00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:40,681

00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,851
or silently

931
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,020
Walt Whitman.

932
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,315
Walt Whitman was
too old for the ranks,

933
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,400
not qualified
to be an officer,

934
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,778
not enthusiastic about
"firing a gun

935
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:56,531
or drawing a sword
on another man,"

936
00:51:56,697 --> 00:52:00,326
but when his younger brother
was wounded at antietam,

937
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:02,578
and Whitman went to find him
in the hospital,

938
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:05,373
he was appalled
by what he saw.

939
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,043
He moved to Washington
to help with the wounded,

940
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,296
giving out small gifts,
changing dressings,

941
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,757
and reciting his poetry.

942
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,219
"The doctors tell me

943
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:20,429
"i supply the patients

"which all their drugs

945
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,101
"are helpless to yield.

"It has saved
more than one life,

00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,063
"so I go around.

948
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:34,235
Some of my boys die.
Some get well."

"All nurses are required

"Their dresses must be
brown or black,

00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,709
"with no bows,
no curls, no jewelry,

dorothea dix volunteered
her services to the union.

The 59-year-old crusader
for the mentally ill

959
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:04,932
was put in charge
of all women nurses

960
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,393
employed by the armies.

961
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,395
Tireless, and so autocratic

962
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:11,772
one woman called her
"dragon dix,"

963
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,150
she barred any applicant
she thought interested

964
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,277
in romantic adventure.

965
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:19,822
Even nuns were sometimes
turned down.

966
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:21,282
By the end
of the war, though,

967
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:23,618
the only question
she asked potential recruits

968
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,913
was "when can you start?"

969
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,789
Under her strict guidance,

970
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:32,210
care for the sick and wounded
was vastly improved.

971
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,670
Despite the bitter criticism
and petty rivalry

972
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,047
of male colleagues,

973
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:38,549
she stayed at her post

1036
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,341
100 miles away.

1037
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,263
William tecumseh sherman
and ulysses s. Grant

1038
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,016
had survived
hard times together.

1039
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:59,226
Their friendship
had been forged in Kentucky

1040
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,562
when sherman had come close
to breaking down,

1041
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,607
persuaded the war
would never end.

1042
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:07,359
"Grant stood by me
when I was crazy,

1043
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,528
"and I stood by him
when he was drunk,

1044
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:13,657
and now we stand
by each other always."

1045
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,576
Sherman was an orphan

1046
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:18,287
and had graduated sixth
in his class at west point

1047
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:20,539
when he was only 20.

1048
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:23,918
Tall and red-haired,
intelligent and irritable,

1049
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,212
he wore shoes
rather than military boots,

1050
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,047
slept little,
and talked a lot.

1051
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:31,258
"Boiling over with ideas,"
a friend said.

1052
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,928
"He was always too busy
to eat much.

1053
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,430
"He talked and smoked cigars
incessantly,

1054
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:38,849
"giving orders,
dictating telegrams,

1055
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,018
bright and chipper."

1056
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:45,272
He hated politicians,
profiteers, sentimentalists.

1057
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,358
Above all,
he hated reporters,

1058
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,360
whom he considered
worse than spies

1059
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,612
because they printed
military secrets

1060
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,948
just to sell newspapers.

1061
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,783
"These dirty
newspaper scribblers

1062
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,368
"have the impudence
of Satan.

1063
00:58:57,535 --> 00:59:00,579
"They come into camp, poke about
among the lazy shirks,

1064
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:04,375
"and pick up their camp rumors
and publish them as facts.

1065
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:05,960
"They are a pest,

1066
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:10,464
and I treat them as spies,
which, in truth, they are."

1067
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:12,552
He was convinced
if he killed them all,

1068
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:16,804
there would be news from hell
before breakfast.

1069
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:20,140
Family and friends
called him "cump."

1070
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,685
His men called him
"uncle Billy."

1071
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:26,105
He was ruthless in war.

1072
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,775
Now Grant entrusted
his friend

1073
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,360
with the second
most important part

1074
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:33,279
of his grand strategy--

1075
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:36,782
to seize Atlanta and smash
the combined confederate armies

1076
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:40,703
of Tennessee and Mississippi
under Joseph e. Johnston.

1077
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:50,796
In Washington,

1078
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:53,924
Lincoln's chances
for reelection were slim.

1079
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,011
"I'm going to be beaten,"
Lincoln wrote that summer,

1080
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,680
"and unless some
great change takes place,

1081
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,515
badly beaten."

1082
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,642
With Grant stalled
at Petersburg,

1083
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,562
sherman had to win.

1084
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,613
Sherman had surveyed
parts of Georgia

1085
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,323
as a young lieutenant.

1086
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:20,618
"I knew Georgia better than
the rebels did," he wrote.

1087
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,370
He knew the fighting there
would be scattered and sporadic,

1088
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,831
"a big Indian war,"
he called it.

1089
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,296
Joseph e. Johnston,

1090
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,590
the confederate commander
who now faced sherman,

1091
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:38,218
was heartily disliked
by president Jefferson Davis,

1092
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:42,723
but he was very nearly
worshiped by his men.

1093
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,392
"I do not believe
there was a soldier in his army

1094
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,811
"but would gladly
have died for him.

1095
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,773
"With him,
everything was his soldiers.

1096
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:54,068
He would feed his soldiers
if the country starved."

1097
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,861
Sam Watkins.

1098
01:00:57,905 --> 01:00:59,657
Outgunned, outsupplied,

1099
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,450
AND OUTNUMBERED ALMOST <i>2</i> TO 1,

1100
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:05,204
Joseph johnston could only hope
to slow sherman's advance

1101
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:06,747
and perhaps lure him
into making

1102
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:08,749
the kind of doomed
frontal attack

1103
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:11,919
that would help swing
the election against Lincoln.

1104
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:19,426
But sherman's advance
was a masterpiece of planning.

1105
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,261
In a matter of hours,

1106
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,472
his engineers replaced
burned Bridges

1107
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:26,642
and repaired
ripped up rail lines.

1108
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:34,692
When Nathan bedford forrest's
raiders collapsed a tunnel

1109
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,151
in sherman's rear,

1110
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,654
one weary Southern private
was not impressed.

1111
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,072
"Sherman," he said,

1112
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:42,449
"probably carried
a spare tunnel with him."

1113
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,374
Slowly, relentlessly,

1114
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,292
he forced johnston
out of Dalton...

1115
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:55,546
Resaca...

1116
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:58,298
Cassville...

1117
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,301
Allatoona...

1118
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,471
New hope church.

1119
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,809
A surrendering confederate
told his captors,

1120
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:12,020
"sherman will never go to hell.
He'll flank the devil

1121
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:15,107
and make heaven
in spite of the guards."

1122
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:17,776
"June 14th.

1123
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:20,612
"We killed
general polk yesterday

1124
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,657
and made good
progress today."

1125
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:28,078
William tecumseh sherman.

1126
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,330
At kennesaw mountain,
north of Atlanta,

1127
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,374
the confederates dug in.

1128
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:34,001
ON June 27th,

1129
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:37,087
13,000 union men
stormed up the mountain

1130
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,256
and were hurled back.

1131
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,592
The federals "seemed to walk up
and take death,"

1132
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:43,218
a Southern er remembered,

1133
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:48,140
"as coolly as if they were
automatic or wooden men."

1134
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:50,851
"I've heard men say that
if they ever killed a yankee

1135
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:53,395
"during the war,
they were not aware of it.

1136
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:55,689
"I am satisfied
that on this memorable day

1137
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:59,568
"every man in our regiment
killed from 20 to 100 each.

1138
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:03,614
All that was necessary
was to load and shoot."

1139
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,949
The union lost 3,000 men,

1140
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,952
the confederates,
only 750.

1141
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,164
"One or two more such assaults,"
an aide warned sherman,

1142
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:15,083
"would use up this army."

1143
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,460
Sherman never admitted

1144
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:18,879
he had made a mistake
at kennesaw mountain,

1145
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:21,965
but he never
repeated it either.

1146
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:26,094
Reluctantly, he returned
to his slow flanking maneuvers,

1147
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,180
forcing johnston
back to within sight

1148
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:30,224
of Atlanta itself,

1149
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,809
but there, he stalled,

1150
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,477
just like Grant.

1151
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,902
Two months
of relentless fighting

1152
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:44,988
had resulted
in identical stalemates.

1153
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,866
Sherman was stopped
north of Atlanta.

1154
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:51,245
Grant and Lee were deadlocked
outside Petersburg.

1155
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:54,748
Without a decisive victory
somewhere,

1156
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:58,877
Abraham Lincoln was sure
to lose the fall election.

1157
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,046
Time was running out.

1158
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,601
"Miss kitty dig-gs,

1159
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:18,689
"i want you to understand
that Mary is my child,

1160
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:22,568
"and she is a god-given right
of my own,

1161
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:26,321
"and you may hold on to her
as long as you can,

1162
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,740
"but I want you to remember
this one thing--

1163
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:32,870
"that the longer you keep
my child from me,

1164
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,455
"the longer you will
have to burn in hell

1165
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:39,167
"and the quicker
you will get there.

1166
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:42,963
"I have no fears about
getting Mary out of your hands.

1167
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:47,509
"This whole government
gives cheer to me,

1168
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:50,971
and you cannot
help yourself."

1169
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:52,931
Spotswood rice.
