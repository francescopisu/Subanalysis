10 Firefly Trash - Episode 10 2003 English

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,950
Yeah.

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,160
That went well.

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,630
All right, I got it. Stone.

5
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,050
All right, all right.

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,300
Hi, guys. Right, right there.

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,230
Malcolm Reynolds.

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,860
- You old son of a... come here!
- Hey, Monty.

9
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,030
How you doing?

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,450
They didn't say you
were picking up this leg.

11
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,830
Well, work's been a little slow lately,
so I thought I'd do some smuggling.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,870
- Where's that sorry-ass ship of yours?
- Monty.

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,830
Two boats like ours,
meeting on an empty rock like this?

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,040
That screams contraband to the Feds.

15
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,710
You forget the time
you got pinched in Beylix?

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,720
Always thinking, ain't you?
Smarts, that's what you got. Smarts.

17
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,640
Now, okay, wait. Somethings different,
something is, something is...

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,730
The beard! Oh, you shaved
off your soup-catcher.

19
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,520
I thought you were gonna wear
that thing to the grave.

20
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,480
Yeah, so did I, but she didn't
much like my whiskers.

21
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,280
- She?
- Oh! Bridget!

22
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,570
What the hell am I thinking?
I gotta introduce you to the missus.

23
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,450
Monty!

24
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,330
You have fallen from
our noble bachelor ranks?

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,670
I wasn't looking to, but she just
sort of swept me off my feet. Bridget!

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Well, she must be
a rare specimen indeed.

27
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,340
Yeah. It don't begin to cover it.

28
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,300
Mal, I want you to meet my Bridget.

29
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,100
So...

30
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,310
you guys have met.

31
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,580
Mal, why you got a piece
trained on my wife?

32
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,950
- She ain't your wife, Monty.
- Huh?

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,120
- I married her, didn't I?
- You ain't the only one.

34
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,210
Bridget!

35
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,300
Mal.

36
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,100
Bridget. Hey! Quit it, you two!

37
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,560
Here, now. Knock it off.

38
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,020
Damn it, that's enough!

39
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,650
What the hell is going on here?
What do you mean, she ain't my wife?

40
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,740
She ain't your wife,
she's married to me!

41
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,950
- Don't listen to him.
- It's true.

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,530
About half a year back,
at the Triumph settlement.

43
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,450
Only it wasn't Bridget then,
it was Saffron.

44
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,250
She hitched me, got on my ship
and tried to steal it out from under me!

45
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,800
She is cold as ice
and dead crazy on top of it.

46
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,800
You're a liar, Malcolm Reynolds.

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,890
Now, I ain't never got to telling you
his name.

48
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,430
Hell. Fine, be like that.

49
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,400
Damn you, Bridget! Damn you to Hades!

50
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,520
You broke my heart in a million pieces.

51
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,280
You made me love you and then you...

52
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,490
I shaved off my beard for you,
devil woman!

53
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,010
You're gonna want to pull
your claw out of that bag nice and slow.

54
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,970
Relax. I'm not going
for a gun or anything.

55
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,980
Just freshening up.

56
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,270
You and lipstick are a dangerous
combination, if I recall.

57
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,230
Turn around.

58
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,570
Oh, yeah, just like old times.

59
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,530
We don't have any old times.

60
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,160
I just don't want you pulling
a pistol out of...

61
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,660
of anywhere.

62
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,620
You missed a spot.

63
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,590
Can't miss a place you've never been.

64
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,140
Marriage is hard work, Mal. I know it.

65
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,430
That doesn't mean
we should just give up.

66
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,390
We've had our spats, maybe I made
some bad decisions along the way...

67
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,100
Oh, you are a tweaked one, you are.

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,520
But face it, hubby, I'm really hot.

69
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,320
Mm-hmm.

70
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,410
- Start walking.
- Walking? Walking where?

71
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,620
Pick a direction,
just don't turn around.

72
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,990
Come on, Mal.

73
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,540
This is my scrap of nowhere.
You go on, find your own.

74
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,040
You can't leave me here
on this lifeless piece of crap moon.

75
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,040
- I can.
- I'll die.

76
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,380
Well, as a courtesy...

77
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,840
you might start on that, because
this chatter ain't doing me any kindness.

78
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,510
Why don't you just go ahead
and shoot me then?

79
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,350
I don't know.

80
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,730
Why didn't you shoot me?

81
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,230
Back when I took my eyes
off you for a split?

82
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,610
I'm ashamed to say it,
but I gave you the window.

83
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,610
You and Monty fought
in the war together, right?

84
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,490
Yeah, I smelled that.

85
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,240
The war buddy bond's tough to crack.

86
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,620
I knew if I shot you,
I'd lose Monty any ways.

87
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,200
You just had a better hand
of cards this time.

88
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,080
It ain't a hand of cards.
It's called a life.

89
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,500
Seriously, Mal,
you gotta give me a ride.

90
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,340
- You are completely off your nut.
- I won't make trouble.

91
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,130
You can stick me in a crate,
just don't leave me here...

92
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,900
This was all your fault.
I had the perfect crime lined up.

93
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,610
You were gonna steal
a man's beard.

94
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,780
A million square job.
The big time.

95
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,000
I was gonna cut Monty and his crew in,
but you screwed that.

96
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,750
Odd, but I don't think I'll be
losing any sleep over it.

97
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,130
I've got the layout, entrance codes.

98
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,510
- Believe me, this practically robs itself.
- Bye-bye, now.

99
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,180
I'm handing you a fortune on a platter.
Don't you want to hear the details?

100
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,860
Whoa, cap. Don't tell me you
got into a fight with Monty.

101
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,240
Oh, really?
But I thought we loved Monty.

102
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,910
We love Monty, don't we?

103
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,660
If he had a tussle with that sasquatch,
we'd all be in the dirt right now...

104
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,540
scooping up the captain's teeth,
ain't that so, sir?

105
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,590
I don't really want to talk about it.

106
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,800
We got work to do.
Let's shut up and do it.

107
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,680
Inara was asking for you, wanted...

108
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,760
So later with the talking then.

109
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,210
- Hear you're looking for me?
- I was. Care to sit?

110
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,760
I was hoping we could talk
a little business.

111
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,880
- Would you like some tea?
- Okay.

112
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,390
- What's your game?
- I offered you tea.

113
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,140
Mm-hmm. After inviting me here
of your own free will.

114
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,230
Which makes two events
without precedent.

115
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Which makes me more
than a little skittish.

116
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,030
- Mal, if we can't be civilised and talk...
- I'm plenty civilised.

117
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,990
- You're using wiles on me.
- I'm using what?

118
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
Your feminine wiles.

119
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,660
Your companion training,
or some might say...

120
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,700
uncanny ability to make a man
sweaty and/or compliant...

121
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,620
which I've had enough of today.

122
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,170
- Maybe this isn't the best time.
- No, no, this is a fine time.

123
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,250
You just talk plainly, is all.

124
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,010
I'm not sleeping with you, Mal.

125
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,260
Uh, no, I think I would have noticed.
I think my keenly trained senses...

126
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,470
You're not my lover, nor are you
my mother, my house mistress...

127
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,640
nor anyone who has any say
on how I conduct my affairs.

128
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,850
- Well enough. So?
- So let me conduct my affairs.

129
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,520
- Who's keeping you...?
- I've had no one in weeks.

130
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,570
Backwater moons, slums...

131
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,030
frontier planets without
even a temple built.

132
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,110
- We go where the work is.
- There's all kinds of work, Mal.

133
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,530
And ours is the kind that gets
you shut down by the Alliance.

134
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,200
I opt to stay off the radar.

135
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,500
There are many worlds
where we can both work.

136
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,750
We used to visit them, remember?

137
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,050
Are you saying I'm doing this deliberate?
On account of you?

138
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,630
That there's some reason
I want you off the job?

139
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,340
Is there?

140
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,220
This is one of the crazier things
I've heard today.

141
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,810
And when I tell you about
the rest of my day, you...

142
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,680
I'm not accusing you of anything...

143
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,270
No, let's set a course for the planet
of the lonely, rich, yet hygienic, man.

144
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,110
We can park there for a month.

145
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,530
Not all of your work is illegal.
And the best...

146
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,240
- You wanna keep me off the job?
- Your best job was on a central planet.

147
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,740
I stay out of your whoring.

148
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,370
- That didn't take long.
- Keep out of my thieving.

149
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,580
I know my job very well, thank you.

150
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,660
Right, you're a criminal mastermind.

151
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,420
What was the last cargo we snuck
past the Alliance to transport?

152
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,340
- That was...
- What was the cargo?

153
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,090
- They were dolls.
- Geisha dolls with heads that wobbled.

154
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,510
Hey, people love those!

155
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,560
And what exactly was our net profit on
the famous wobbly-headed doll caper?

156
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,770
Our cut?
So you're in the gang now.

157
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,690
Since I can't find work as a companion,
I might as well be a petty thief like you.

158
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,700
Petty?

159
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,490
- I didn't mean petty.
- What did you mean?

160
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,660
That's Chinese for "petty."

161
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,960
No, that's a narrow...

162
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:42,130
- There are nuances of meaning that...
- You should have stuck with your wiles.

163
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,210
Don't put all of this on me, Mal.

164
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,090
You know you haven't been
after serious work in...

165
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,760
Serious work?

166
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,180
You want to know if...

167
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
What?

168
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,350
Nothing.

169
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,150
All right. Tell me more
about this job of yours.

170
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,540
The mark's name is Duren Hamer.

171
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,830
He may be one of the biggest collectors
of Earth-that-was artefact's in the 'verse.

172
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,540
Guy's got warehouses full of stuff.

173
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,510
But his prize piece
is sitting in his parlour.

174
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,550
An antiquity of unspeakable value.
The Lassiter.

175
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,970
The original hand-held laser pistol.

176
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,310
One of only two known to still exist.

177
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,060
The forerunner of all
modern laser technology.

178
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,440
Hamer got lucky, picked it up
during the war for nothing.

179
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,110
But it wasn't just luck. Tell them.

180
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,860
Hamer's Alliance.

181
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,360
Bio-weapons expert during the war.

182
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,200
He'd target areas
with valuables...

183
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,280
wipe out every living soul
without damaging the goods...

184
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,660
go in, take whatever he wanted.

185
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,750
Now he's living fat on a private
estate on Bellerophon.

186
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,540
I've managed to get a hold of his
schedule for the next 18 months...

187
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,670
a layout of the estate grounds
and every security code for the place.

188
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,430
Saffron has a notion we can walk in,
take the Lassiter right off his shelf.

189
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,970
I'm confused.

190
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,940
You're asking, if I've got security codes,
why don't I grab it for myself?

191
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,440
No, actually...

192
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,730
I was wondering...

193
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,940
what's she doing on the ship?
Didn't she try to kill us?

194
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,160
Please. Nobody died last time.

195
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,620
We're in space.

196
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,450
- How did she get here?
- She hitched.

197
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,240
I don't recall pulling over.

198
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,880
The point is, this ain't no wobbly-headed
doll caper, this here's history.

199
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,170
Okay, I got a question.

200
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,090
If she's got security codes, why don't
she just go in and grab it herself?

201
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,180
Good point.

202
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,680
Getting in the door and putting
our hands on the Lassiter is easy.

203
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,310
Getting out's the tricky part.

204
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,190
It's tagged and coded.

205
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,020
Second it passes through the door,
alarms, security, Feds.

206
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,900
This isn't a one-woman operation.

207
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,490
- To do this right, I'm gonna need...
- Idiots.

208
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,740
- Partners.
- Dupes.

209
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,740
That's what you'll all be
if you trust her.

210
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,450
Could be that's so.

211
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,080
Lord knows, ain't none of us
here criminal masterminds.

212
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,210
So if you got something better,
Inara, something not petty...

213
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,920
I would sure be willing to hear it.

214
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,520
So question remains:

215
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,690
How do we get the artefact out
without setting off the alarms?

216
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,940
- This the layout?
- Full blueprints of the grounds.

217
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,070
Could be we look hard enough,
we'll find a way.

218
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,200
You dig into that, little Kaylee. Zoe?

219
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,120
You ain't said a word. Time to weigh in.

220
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,660
Take sounds ripe enough.
Assuming we can fence it.

221
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,080
I know a guy on Persephone.
Already has half a dozen buyers.

222
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,500
But Inara ain't wrong.

223
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,090
- She can't be trusted.
- I ain't asking you to trust her.

224
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,970
- I'll be with her the whole time.
- See there?

225
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,300
All you gotta do to be a rich woman,
hon, is get over it.

226
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,020
Okay.

227
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,690
I'm in.

228
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,610
Captain says to stay put.

229
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,900
Doesn't want you to run afoul
of his blushing psychotic bride.

230
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,410
She figures out who you are,
she'll turn you in before you can say:

231
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,200
"Don't turn me in, lady."

232
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,200
This bounty on us just keeps
getting more exciting.

233
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Well, I wouldn't know.

234
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,080
She's a liar.

235
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,670
That don't exactly set her apart
from the rest of us.

236
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,130
Plunder sounds fun enough.

237
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,840
She's a liar, and no good
will come of her.

238
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,260
Well, as a rule, I say,
girl folk ain't to be trusted.

239
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,100
Jayne is a girl's name.

240
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,980
Well, Jayne ain't a girl!

241
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,110
She starts in on that girl's name thing,
I'll show her I got man parts.

242
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,400
I'm trying to think of a way
for you to be cruder, I just...

243
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,610
It's not coming.

244
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,790
I was gonna leave you a deck of cards.

245
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,830
Great.

246
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,250
Another exciting adventure in sitting.

247
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,550
Afraid.

248
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,300
We'll be okay.

249
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,390
Why the captain is trusting that...

250
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,100
Not her. Jayne.

251
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,520
Afraid?

252
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,600
Since when?

253
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,650
Since Ariel.

254
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,940
Afraid we'll know.

255
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,410
We should be on Bellerophon by 06.

256
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,370
- I figure the job should...
- I don't want to know.

257
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,120
Least it's your kind of world.

258
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,080
- Got appointments?
- We hit, I'm gone.

259
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,550
I've booked a few choice clients to get
my mind off Mal's descent into lunacy.

260
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,670
Zoe...

261
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,390
don't let Mal trust her.
Everything Saffron is, is a lie.

262
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,930
She'll get the drop on him...

263
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,100
which, as far as I'm concerned,
is what he richly deserves.

264
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,140
I ain't saying it ain't risky.

265
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,060
Don't count Mal out, though.

266
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,190
- He knows the estate...
- No details.

267
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,280
I meant that. Just be careful.

268
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,820
See you when we're wealthy.

269
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,240
Hey.

270
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,660
You give me a hand in here.

271
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,120
No wandering about, remember?
Or I'll stick you back in your crate.

272
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,300
Bellerophon Estates.
Home to the rich and paranoid.

273
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,970
Gracious living, ocean views
and state of the art security.

274
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,680
Including local patrols and multi-code
keys needed at all entrances and exits.

275
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,810
- Which we have.
- Right.

276
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,520
You and Mal will split off in shuttle two
as we make our approach.

277
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,530
There's a landing port just south
of the main house.

278
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,900
Prepare for landing.

279
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,370
You ready?

280
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,240
Ready.

281
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,800
Hamer's throwing a party
this weekend, so...

282
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,390
you should have no trouble blending in
with the hired help that'll be setting up.

283
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,770
All you gotta do is get
through the back door.

284
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,440
That shouldn't be a problem, unless
someone has been less than truthful.

285
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,860
The parlour with the Lassiter
is on the ninth floor.

286
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,200
You'll have to disable the display.
Won't be any trouble.

287
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,120
Once you get the goods in your hands,
you can't take it out the front door.

288
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,830
Nor the back door, nor any door.
Every piece is tagged for the scanners.

289
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,370
So, what do we do?

290
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,040
- You wanna tell them?
- It was your genius idea.

291
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,090
You chuck it in the garbage.

292
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,600
All the estates on Bellerophon use this
automated garbage drone system.

293
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,730
You hit one little button, and the drone
whooshes off with the trash.

294
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,570
Brilliant.

295
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,410
- Thanks.
- Except it's idiotic.

296
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,540
The drones take the disposal bins
straight to reclamation.

297
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,210
Thirty seconds after we hit the button,
the booty will be incinerated.

298
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,170
Not if we reprogramme the bin.

299
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,800
Give it new coordinates.

300
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,720
Once I override the standard
guidance protocol...

301
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,800
I can tell that disposal bin
to go wherever we want.

302
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,140
- And where would that be?
- The loneliest piece of desert we find.

303
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,100
Here, Isis Canyon.

304
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,730
The drone dumps the bin, we claim
the goods when we're all together again.

305
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,860
And how do you plan to get
to the bin to reprogramme it?

306
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,780
You get to the loot,
and we'll get to the bin.

307
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,900
All right, we're planted! Take her up!

308
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,570
That's good, that's good!

309
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,870
Hold her steady!

310
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,030
Hold her there!

311
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,790
Clear.

312
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,250
Which way?

313
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,300
Right.

314
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,170
This should be it.

315
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,450
- Let's get to work.
- Yeah.

316
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,300
Okay, she's set.

317
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,810
Be careful, it's hot.

318
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,810
Gorram it, Wash. Hold her steady!

319
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,980
Sorry.

320
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,780
- Jayne, the dynoram's live.
- What?

321
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,660
The dynoram, don't touch...
Oh, no! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

322
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,340
- Where's the trash chute?
- In the vestibule.

323
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,840
Wait. Shh!

324
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,390
Someone's coming.

325
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,350
You!

326
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,900
You found her.

327
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,200
You brought back my wife.

328
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,660
Oh, my dear.

329
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,630
My own sweet Yolanda.

330
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,380
Yolanda?

331
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,800
This boy weighs a solid ton.

332
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,100
Doctor, you got yourself
a patient to see to.

333
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,180
Yes.

334
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,020
I'll take care of it.

335
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,940
I thought I'd never see you again.

336
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,280
Forgive me, I don't mean
to make a show.

337
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,660
- Please, I'm the one who's intruding.
- Not at all.

338
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,910
I owe you a great debt of thanks.

339
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,250
- I just gave the lady a lift.
- No. You've done much more than that.

340
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,870
You've returned to me
the only thing I truly treasure.

341
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,880
Well, then this is a day
I'll feel good to be me.

342
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,590
- Do I owe you any reward?
- No.

343
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,470
- Our trip weren't even out of our way.
- I promised him 800 square.

344
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,970
- No, but we never agreed and...
- Please.

345
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,600
I'd be embarrassed not to make
some recompense.

346
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,560
In my study I... Well, are you hungry?

347
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,610
You both look so tired.
There's food or...

348
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,860
- Yolanda, I'm babbling like a moon brain.
- Hush.

349
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,490
We'll both have plenty
to say by nightfall.

350
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,030
- Six years.
- Ls that all?

351
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,700
- From the day they found your shuttle.
- They set on me at Parth.

352
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,290
These awful men.

353
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,330
That wasn't me.
I didn't know those men.

354
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,330
They said they wanted ransom, but...

355
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,000
they sold me to slavers.

356
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,970
- Also unknown to me.
- When you left, I thought...

357
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,050
Well, you disappeared
the same day as Heinrich.

358
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,010
- Heinrich?
- The security programmer.

359
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,520
And he was young and I saw
you two talking and I thought...

360
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,190
But after they found his body...

361
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,310
They killed Heinrich?

362
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,280
I guess he wasn't useful anymore.

363
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,280
- I never stopped looking.
- I knew you wouldn't.

364
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,740
That's the thought that kept me alive.

365
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,130
We have so much time to make up.

366
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,300
Well, that's my cue to skedaddle.

367
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,350
Let me get your money.

368
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,810
You won't disappear again?

369
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,810
Never.

370
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,860
We gotta move fast.

371
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,360
Yeah, he might come back
and hug us in the act.

372
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,160
You don't know him.
He's everything I said he was.

373
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:57,460
Oh, yeah, he's a killer of men.
Why, I'll bet he even eats up babies.

374
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,340
You're wasting time.

375
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,710
Let us take a breath here, Yolanda.

376
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,180
We're sneaking into a place you could
walk into welcome as glad news.

377
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,220
What's the maths on that?

378
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,970
You not adding that Hamer
would as soon cut your throat as...

379
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,140
- You would?
- If possible.

380
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,940
Nope, that ain't it at all.

381
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,320
You would've knocked him
in the brain were that the case.

382
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,190
You don't want him to know the truth.

383
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,950
Unlike all the other, I'm gonna go with
hundreds, of men you've married...

384
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,250
you actually want this one to think
well of you when you've gone.

385
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,750
My God, could it be,
I've actually met...

386
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,050
- your real husband?
- Congratulations.

387
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:48,260
Anything else you want on
your tombstone, you piece of crap?

388
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,850
Now I'm intruding.

389
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,390
This isn't what it looks like.

390
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,440
Unless it looks like we're stealing
your priceless Lassiter, because...

391
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,150
that's what we're doing. Don't ask
about the gun though, that's new.

392
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,360
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

393
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,950
Not, you know, a lot, but...

394
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,280
- You don't know what he's forced me...
- Stop.

395
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,080
Yolanda, please, just stop.

396
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,420
Don't look at me like that.

397
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,880
I said, don't look at me like that!

398
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,550
Almost done.

399
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,300
I just gotta plug the interface
strike plate in and...

400
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,100
That's a pick up call.

401
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,890
How we doing?

402
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,680
I can't reach it.

403
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,730
Wash, we need more altitude. Now!

404
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,560
Working on it, dear.

405
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,490
Kaylee.

406
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,360
Kaylee.

407
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,950
Kaylee, Kaylee, Kaylee,
Kaylee, Kaylee.

408
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,450
Okay, got it!

409
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,500
Let's not get worked up.

410
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:05,880
Are you really so naive?
Do you think your life is anything to me?

411
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,260
All right.

412
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,100
No one's killing any folk today on
account of we got a tight schedule.

413
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:19,020
Yo-Saf-Bridge, we'll get on about our...
Drop it, now!

414
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,360
Did you think I was a princess?

415
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,740
That I would stay locked up
here in the tower?

416
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,990
With you?

417
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,370
- I hoped.
- You're a rutting fool.

418
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,830
- We're in. Go! Go!
- Copy that.

419
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,640
You wanna finish the job?
Because we're short on minutes.

420
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,930
- I'm sorry.
- How long have you been with him?

421
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,930
- Oh, we are not together.
- He's my husband.

422
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,940
Well, who in the damn galaxy ain't?

423
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,150
I feel so bad for you.

424
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,110
Bad for me?

425
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,690
I'm not the patsy being stole from.

426
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,450
If you had half a brain, you would've
called the Feds the minute you saw me.

427
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,160
Oh, I did.

428
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,580
Emergency signal.

429
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,540
For kidnappings and the like.

430
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,290
I love you, Yolanda.

431
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,590
But I couldn't think for a second...

432
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,420
that you actually came here for me.

433
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,840
That would be them now.

434
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,850
Men.

435
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,490
Duren.

436
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,610
Peaches.

437
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,870
Just call them off.
Tell them it was a mistake.

438
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,660
You need help, Yolanda.

439
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,290
I'll do anything you want me to.

440
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,540
You know how I can make you feel.

441
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,800
Please, you're embarrassing yourself.

442
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,390
I'm embarrassing?
Who's the dupe on the floor?

443
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,890
I hate to bring up our imminent arrest
during your crazy time, but we gotta go!

444
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,070
This is police responding to an
emergency call. Request entry all points.

445
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,640
What're you doing?

446
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,110
Good security.

447
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,950
Show some identification.

448
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,620
Move.

449
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,800
Nope. Let's go.

450
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,820
That had to be tough.

451
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
Yeah, have yourself a great guffaw.

452
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,950
No, I mean it.

453
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,490
Six years, knowing he was holding
treasures, you didn't move on him.

454
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,290
I gotta figure that's a job you told
yourself you'd never take.

455
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,750
Till times got hard enough,
then the one line you hadn't crossed...

456
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,840
My name's not Yolanda.

457
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,340
Never entered my mind it was.

458
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,470
I tried.

459
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,760
I actually tried.

460
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,270
I thought, this is a decent man.

461
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,980
- The genuine article.
- A working man.

462
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,780
Struggling to get by with bare
necessities on his private floating island.

463
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,280
Yeah, he had money.

464
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,450
I thought it would help. I thought if I had
everything, I wouldn't want...

465
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,240
Heinrich, the security programmer.

466
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,370
You know, I'd forgotten his name.

467
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,040
Addressing the itch of curiousness...

468
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,380
you marry him too?

469
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,170
No.

470
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,210
I didn't kill him either.

471
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,220
No. I don't reckon there's
many you killed.

472
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,260
Just put them in a position to die easy.

473
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,310
- I should have killed Duren.
- Right.

474
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,940
The one guy who don't have it coming.

475
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,480
The man who knows you,
still loves you, treachery and all.

476
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,480
Can't have him walking about.

477
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,740
You must be loving this.

478
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,750
A little bit.

479
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,550
I've seen you without
your clothes on before.

480
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,340
Never thought I'd see you naked.

481
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,010
Can people ever change?

482
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,850
Depends on the person.

483
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,430
I'm guessing...

484
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,480
the pain of this fades away, you'll
just go back to being what you are.

485
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,020
What is that?

486
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,070
A brilliant...

487
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,240
beautiful...

488
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,990
evil double-crossing snake.

489
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,500
Cheer up, weepy. You made yourself
a boatload of hard cash today.

490
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,710
You can question the meaning of life on
a floating island of your own for a while.

491
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,880
You won't tell anyone
about me breaking down?

492
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,510
I won't.

493
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,890
Then I won't tell anyone how easily
I got your gun out of your holster.

494
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,100
I'll take that as a kindness.

495
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:41,230
You just may be the most gullible fool
I ever marked.

496
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,190
And that makes you special.

497
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,490
Well, you can riddle me
with holes, Yolanda...

498
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,910
but I just saw the truth.
I played you from minute one.

499
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,330
Well, you got me at barrel's end.
Who am I to argue?

500
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,920
What's your move?

501
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,300
We'll be setting down in the desert,
leave you to set a spell.

502
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:06,170
Oh, and speaking of naked...

503
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,470
No, now, that's just low.

504
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,100
Kind of evens things out though,
don't you think?

505
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,060
Pants.

506
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,860
I really don't see the benefit to this.

507
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:25,150
However I may slip, you're not gonna
catch my crew with their trousers down.

508
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,030
- I can't turn.
- What?

509
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,080
Can't turn. Not getting any tug
from the aft alternator.

510
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,160
That don't make no sense. Unless...

511
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,630
Yep.

512
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,430
The filament on
the grav-dampener's stripped.

513
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,100
Who could've done that?

514
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,850
I can fix it, but she put a timer on the
motivator and wet-wired the damp...

515
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,480
What does it mean, Kaylee?

516
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,570
We ain't gonna make the rendezvous.
We have to land. Now.

517
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:14,530
No! No! Dirty, dirty whore!

518
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,500
Yeah, you better run!

519
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,510
God, where is it?

520
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,640
Ugh! It's not here.

521
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,260
Looking for this?

522
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,560
I wonder if it works.

523
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,150
Oh, well, it's still worth a fortune.
Anyway, this works fine.

524
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,280
- Honey, you look horrific.
- What are you doing here?

525
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,360
- Oh, just my part of the job.
- What part of the job?

526
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,830
You know. I put on the big act,
storm away in a huff.

527
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,370
Then fly off, wait for you to
double-cross Mal, beat you to the spot...

528
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,250
and grab the loot before
you can get to it. What?

529
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,540
You didn't see it coming?

530
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,000
Uh-uh!

531
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,170
I'm a little disappointed.

532
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,090
Some of the performances weren't
as nuanced as they could have been.

533
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,890
I thought they might have tipped that we
were playing you from the beginning.

534
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,810
Oh, well. Guess not.

535
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,610
No, you can't do this!

536
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,280
You're not gonna die, you big baby.

537
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,280
The authorities will be here
in a few hours to dig you out.

538
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,360
You can't. I have a condition!

539
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,040
What going on?

540
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,380
You got knocked out.

541
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,460
Did we get a pay off?

542
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,210
Did we get the money?

543
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,970
Can you move your arms and legs?

544
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,560
They're not moving.

545
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,980
Do you wanna know why?

546
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,690
Your spine. You hit it pretty hard
when you fell.

547
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,530
- Spine?
- Yes.

548
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,200
I gave you something to stop your motor
functions so you wouldn't wrench it.

549
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,950
Should wear off in a half an hour.

550
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,120
You'll just be bruised.

551
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,290
Spine okay?

552
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:32,840
How much did they offer you
to sell out me and River on Ariel?

553
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,140
That's crazy talk.

554
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,310
Then let's talk crazy.

555
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,890
How much?

556
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,770
Anybody there?

557
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,820
Anybody else?

558
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,910
You're in a dangerous
line of work, Jayne.

559
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:04,200
Odds are you'll be under
my knife again. Often.

560
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,960
So I want you to understand
one thing very clearly.

561
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,210
No matter what you do or say or plot...

562
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,380
no matter how
you come down on us...

563
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,140
I will never, ever harm you.

564
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,850
You're on this table, you're safe.

565
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,520
Because I'm your medic.

566
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,270
And however little we may like
or trust each other...

567
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,480
we're on the same crew.

568
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,650
Got the same troubles, same enemies,
and more than enough of both.

569
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:43,120
We could circle each other and growl,
sleep with one eye open...

570
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,870
but that thought wearies me.

571
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,710
I don't care what you've done...

572
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,210
I don't know what you're planning
on doing, but I'm trusting you.

573
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,710
I think you should do the same.

574
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,260
Because I don't see this working
any other way.

575
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,940
Also...

576
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,190
I can kill you with my brain.

577
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,180
Yeah.

578
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,510
That went well.

579
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,980
- You call this going well?
- We got the loot, didn't we?

580
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,310
- Yes, but...
- Then I call it a win.

581
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,650
What's the problem?

582
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,400
Should I start with you being stranded
or you having no clothes?

583
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,450
- All according to plan.
- Really?

584
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,120
I thought the plan was me being a
fail-safe in case everything went wrong.

585
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,120
Like if Saffron disabled Serenity
and left you for dead.

586
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,500
Nonsense. You had a key role
to play in this.

587
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,790
How sad would you have been
if you hadn't gotten to play it?

588
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,170
- Heartbroken.
- See? All according to plan.

589
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,760
Wash, take us out of the world.

590
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,720
Zoe, contact Brennert and Ellison.

591
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:28,430
See if they'd be interested in
fencing a priceless artifact for us.

592
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,100
What?

593
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,070
Good work, captain.

594
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,150
Thank you, Kaylee.

595
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,210
Good day.
