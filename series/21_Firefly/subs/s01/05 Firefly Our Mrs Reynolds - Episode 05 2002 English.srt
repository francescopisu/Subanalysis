00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,119
05 Firefly Our Mrs Reynolds - Episode 05 2002 English

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,880
Pardon me for intruding, but I believe
y'all are carrying something of mine.

3
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,510
Ain't yours.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,510
You think we wouldn't find out
you changed your route?

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,720
You gonna give us what due us
and every damn thing else on that boat.

6
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,310
I think you gonna give me a little
one-on-one time with the missus.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,650
Oh, I think you might want
to reconsider that last part.

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,980
See, I married me
a powerful ugly creature.

9
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,530
How can you say that? How can you
shame me in front of new people?

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,950
If I could make you prettier, I would.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,320
You are not the man I met a year ago.

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,540
Now, think real hard.

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,870
You been bird-dogging this township
a while now.

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,380
They wouldn't mind a corpse of you.

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,550
Now, you can luxuriate
in a nice jail cell...

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,510
but if your hand touches metal...

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,680
I swear by my pretty floral bonnet,
I will end you.

18
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,140
Take them!

19
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,870
In the morning,
we'll head for Beaumond.

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,540
Give you a chance to find work.

21
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,040
I appreciate it.
This place is lovely, but...

22
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,830
Not your clientele.
I understand.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,710
- You gotta play at being a lady.
- Well, yes.

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,260
So explain to me again
why Zoe wasn't in the dress.

25
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,550
Tactics, woman.
Needed her in the back.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,430
Besides, those soft, cotton dresses
feel nice. There's a whole airflow.

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,100
And you'd know that because...?

28
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,600
You can't open the book of my life
in the middle.

29
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,230
Like women, I'm a mystery.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,980
Best keep it that way.
I withdraw the question.

31
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,660
It makes the rain come
when you turn it.

32
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,450
The rain's very scarce.

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,200
It comes only when needed most.

34
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,960
And such it is with men like you.

35
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,550
This is the most...

36
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,470
You, friend.

37
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,640
You're the guy.

38
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,060
I'll treasure this.

39
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,660
Elder Gommen,
thank you for the hospitality.

40
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,790
We owe you a great debt.

41
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,250
I'm sorry we have so little
to pay it with.

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,750
Though I hope our gifts
will show our regard.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,210
Well, I don't think Jayne's
ever letting go of that stick.

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,800
Alliance patrol boat
heading into atmo.

45
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,840
Well, we gotta fly.

46
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,850
We'll pray for a safe voyage.

47
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,020
And hope to lay eyes on you again
ere too long, my friend.

48
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,440
- Count on it. Bye, now.
- Bless you.

49
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,940
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

50
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,360
- Bye.
- Bye, now.

51
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,250
Who the hell are you?

52
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,590
- What do you mean?
- I was pretty clear.

53
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,720
What are you doing on my boat?

54
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,720
But you know
I'm to cleave to you.

55
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,470
To wha...? By who?

56
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,680
Did Elder Gommen not tell you?

57
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,850
Tell me what? Who are you?

58
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,820
Mr. Reynolds, sir...

59
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm your wife.

60
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,550
- Could you repeat that, please?
- I am your wife.

61
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,260
That was your agreement
with Elder Gommen...

62
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,140
since he hadn't cash or livestock...
I'm... I'm sorry.

63
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,730
Go back to the part
where you're my wife.

64
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,360
- I don't please you?
- You never met me.

65
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,440
- Zoe, why do I have a wife?
- You got a wife?

66
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,990
All I got is that stick
sounds like it's raining.

67
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,280
- How come you got a wife?
- I didn't.

68
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,580
- We're not married.
- I'm sorry that I shame you.

69
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,910
You don't shame me.
Zoe, would you get Wash?

70
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,040
This is Zoe. We need all personnel
in the cargo bay.

71
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,340
All? I said Wash.

72
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,010
Everyone should have a chance
to congratulate you on your day of bliss.

73
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,470
There's no bliss.
I don't know this girl.

74
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,970
- Then can I know her?
- Jayne.

75
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,260
Don't sully this.

76
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,350
You'll clean latrines with your face,
you don't cut that out.

77
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,100
Who's the new recruit?

78
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,980
Everybody,
I want you all to meet...

79
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,570
Mrs. Reynolds.

80
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,700
You got married?

81
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,450
Wow, that's... Congratulations.

82
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,250
We'd always hoped you two kids
would get together.

83
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,920
- Who is she?
- She's no one.

84
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,960
- Captain!
- Would you stop that?

85
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,630
- I'm sorry.
- You brute.

86
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,130
Oh, sweetie, don't feel bad.

87
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,340
He makes everybody cry.
He's like a monster.

88
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,680
I'm not a monster.
Wash, turn the ship around.

89
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,270
- Can't.
- It's an order.

90
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,230
- We can't.
- What is wrong with you?

91
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,400
Have you got an encyclopedia?

92
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,150
There's already a bulletin on the cortex
as to the murder of a prefect's nephew.

93
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,570
One of our bandits has family ties.

94
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,740
Unless you feel like
walking into a gallows...

95
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,620
I suggest we continue to Beaumond,
and you, enjoy your honeymoon.

96
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,460
This isn't happening.
Would you stop crying?

97
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,710
For God's sake, could you be
a human being for 30 seconds?

98
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,550
- As one married man to another...
- I'm not married!

99
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,430
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,810
You have very nice qualities,
but I didn't ever marry you.

101
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,270
I believe you did.

102
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,060
Last night.

103
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,480
- How drunk was I last night?
- I don't know. I passed out.

104
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,860
It says here, The woman lays
the wreath upon her intended.

105
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,780
Which I do recall.
Which represents his sovereignty.

106
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,580
That was you?

107
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,830
And he drinks of her wine.

108
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,830
And then there's a dance
with a joining of hands.

109
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,800
The marriage ceremony
of the Triumph settlers.

110
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,380
You, sir, are a newly-wed.

111
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,060
What does it say in there
about divorce?

112
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,240
Really think you're the one
to talk to her?

113
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,320
The way I see it, me and her
got one thing in common.

114
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,370
We're the only ones
don't think this is funny.

115
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,250
Hello?

116
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,460
Woman person.

117
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,880
You all right?

118
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,680
I thought last night during the ceremony
that you were pleased.

119
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,100
Well, yeah, last night I was.

120
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,980
Had some mulled wine, a pretty girl
gave me a hat made out of a tree.

121
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,110
Nobody said I was signing up
to have and to hold.

122
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,570
- Are you gonna kill me?
- What?

123
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,620
What kind of crappy planet
is that? Kill you.

124
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,290
I heard talk of men who weren't
pleased with their...

125
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,660
Well, I ain't them.

126
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,880
Don't stand for that.
If someone tries to kill you...

127
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,840
you try to kill them right back.

128
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,930
Look, wife or no, you are no one's
property to be tossed aside.

129
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,930
You got the right, same as anyone,
to live and try to kill people.

130
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,060
I mean, you know, people that are...

131
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,400
That's a dumb planet.

132
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,940
What will you do with me?

133
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,280
Not rightly sure.

134
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,950
We're bound for Beaumond.

135
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,240
Decent kind of planet.

136
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,080
Might be able to set you up
with some work there.

137
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,120
- I'll not be anyone's doxy.
- Not whoring. They got factories.

138
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,340
Some ranches,
if you're more for the outdoors.

139
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,750
Near a week before we get there.

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,300
We'll figure something.

141
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,880
I'd be a good wife.

142
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,350
Yeah, well, I'd be a terrible husband.

143
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,770
You have five whole days
to figure that out.

144
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,270
For five days, we'll be together?

145
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,150
We'll be together on the ship,
but not...

146
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,570
That'll be fine.
I'll do for you or not, as you choose.

147
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,950
Well, shiny.

148
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,620
Hungry? Kitchen's just through there.

149
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,490
I'll cook you something.

150
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,290
- No, I meant for you.
- I'm a fine cook. Everyone says.

151
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,960
That's... It's great.
Look... Hold it. Hold.

152
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,800
- I ain't never even...
- My name is Saffron.

153
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,110
Divorce is very rare. It requires
dispensation from her pastor.

154
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,320
I can send him a wave,
see what I can do.

155
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,650
I appreciate that.
She's a nice girl.

156
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,660
- Seems very anxious to please you.
- It's their way, I guess.

157
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,620
I suppose so.

158
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,990
If you take sexual advantage of her...

159
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,410
you're going to burn
in a very special level of hell.

160
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,130
A level they reserve
for child molesters...

161
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,590
and people who talk at the theatre.

162
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,670
What...?

163
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,300
I am not...

164
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,010
- Preacher, you got a smutty mind.
- Perhaps I spoke out of turn.

165
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,890
- Per-maybe-haps, I'm thinking.
- I apologise.

166
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,770
I'll make her up a room
in the passenger dorm.

167
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,350
The special hell.

168
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,780
Thank you.

169
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,200
Something smells good.

170
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,000
Having yourself a little supper, captain?

171
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,710
Saffron insisted on it.
I didn't want to make her feel...

172
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,670
- This is damn tasty.
- Ls there more where that came from?

173
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,300
I didn't think to make enough
for your friends.

174
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,010
But every-thing's laid out if you'd like
to cook for your husband.

175
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,010
Yeah.

176
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,520
Isn't she quaint?
I'm just not hungry.

177
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,230
So are you enjoying your
own nubile, little slave girl?

178
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,230
She wanted to make me dinner.
At least she's not crying.

179
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,650
I might.
Did she really make fresh bau?

180
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,530
Quaint.

181
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,820
Remember that sex
we were planning to have?

182
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,830
You're all making a big deal.

183
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,960
I would appreciate it if one person
on this boat would not assume...

184
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,170
that I'm an evil lecherous hump.
Nobody's saying that, sir.

185
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,460
We're pretty much just giving each other
significant glances, laughing incessantly.

186
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,720
- Is that cider?
- By the stove.

187
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,220
Yum. I'll get you a refill. Hon?

188
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,930
That's for me to do.

189
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,940
You know...

190
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,520
you weren't lying about your cooking.
If I hadn't already eaten...

191
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,240
- You don't want to finish?
- No, I just, um...

192
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,410
I have captainy things to do,
but truthfully, that's a fine meal.

193
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,870
- Do you need anything else?
- No. No.

194
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,330
You just have something to eat
yourself, and I'm gonna go...

195
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,710
captain.
If you're done with supper...

196
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,420
would you like me
to wash your feet?

197
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,310
Beaumond.

198
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,230
City of New Dunsmuir.

199
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,530
Arrival, October 24.

200
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,950
- Departure...
- Can I come in?

201
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,160
- No.
- See, that's why I usually don't ask.

202
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,040
- What do you want?
- Oh, I just needed to...

203
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,290
hide.

204
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,500
So I take it the honeymoon is over?

205
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,670
Oh, she's a fine girl.
Don't misread. Hell of a cook too.

206
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,220
I'm sure she has many exciting talents.

207
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,340
Do you ever...

208
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,680
wash your clients' feet?
It's my speciality.

209
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,600
We'll be at Beaumond
at least two weeks, right?

210
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,060
- Can't exactly be sure.
- I need you to be sure.

211
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,520
I can't make commitments
and then not keep them.

212
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,280
That's your speciality.

213
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,570
Are you touchy because I got a bride
or because I don't plan to keep her?

214
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,370
I find the whole thing degrading.

215
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,330
That's just what Saffron said
about your line of work.

216
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,910
You should think twice
about letting go of Saffron.

217
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,880
- You two sound like quite a match.
- Maybe you're right.

218
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,750
- Maybe we're soul mates.
- Yes.

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,340
Great. I wish you hundreds
of fat children.

220
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,380
Could you imagine that? Me with
a whole passel of critters underfoot.

221
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,560
- Hell, 10 years' time I could...
- Can you leave me alone, please?

222
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,360
I wasn't looking for a fight.

223
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,410
Always do seem to find one, though.

224
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,290
Do I have your attention?

225
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,750
Kind of going to extremes here,
ain't we?

226
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,550
There's times I think
you don't take me seriously.

227
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,220
I think that ought to change.

228
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,100
Do you think it's likely to?

229
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:40,310
- You got something you don't deserve.
- And it's brought me a galaxy of fun.

230
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,980
Six men came to kill me one time.

231
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,860
The best of them carried this.

232
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,740
It's a Callahan full-bore auto lock.

233
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,410
Customised trigger, double cartridge
thorough-gauge.

234
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,290
It is my very favourite gun.

235
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,500
- You offering me a trade?
- A trade?

236
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,960
It's theft. This is the best gun
made by man.

237
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,010
It has extreme sentimental value.

238
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,090
It's miles more worthy
than what you got.

239
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,720
- What I got? She has a name.
- So does this.

240
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,480
I call it Vera.

241
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,230
My days of not taking you seriously
are certainly coming to a middle.

242
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,820
I'd treat her okay.

243
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:32,610
She's not to be bought.
Nor bartered or borrowed or lent.

244
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,160
She doesn't know a damn thing about
the world and needs our protection.

245
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,240
- Well, I'll protect her.
- Jayne.

246
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,370
Go play with your rain stick.

247
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,300
God!

248
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,430
You do sneak about, don't you?

249
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,720
You're a good man.

250
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,220
You clearly haven't been talking
to anyone else on this boat.

251
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,690
I don't wish to be wed
to the large one. I'd rather...

252
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,110
If I'm not to be yours, I'd rather
have the work you spoke of.

253
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,110
I could be useful on a ranch.

254
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,280
It's good work.

255
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,580
My mama had a ranch.
Back on Shadow, where I'm from.

256
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,120
Ran cattle mostly.

257
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,120
Wasn't nobody ran them
harder or smarter.

258
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,540
She used to tell me:

259
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,960
Don't brand the cattle. Brand the buyer.
He's the one likely to stray.

260
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,130
- She raised you herself?
- Her and about 40 hands.

261
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,180
I had more family for a kid...

262
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,680
- That is odd.
- What?

263
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,640
I just don't...

264
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,360
I'm not one who talks about
what's past, and here you got me...

265
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,570
Does your crew never show interest
in your life?

266
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,610
No, they...

267
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,490
are...

268
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,240
They just know me well enough to...

269
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,960
Well, what about you?
What's your history?

270
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,290
Not much to say.

271
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,840
Life like yours, I fear
you'd find mine terrible dull.

272
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,340
Oh, I long for a little dullness.

273
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,680
Truth to say, this whole trip's getting
to be just a little too interesting.

274
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,810
It's a wreck.

275
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,900
- No, this is good.
- It's parts.

276
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,520
A lot of cheap parts we'll never unload.

277
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,320
This is why you'll never be
in charge, Bree.

278
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,990
You don't see the whole.

279
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,030
- The parts are crap...
- I said that.

280
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,990
But you put it together,
you got a Firefly.

281
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,080
Thing will run forever, they got
a mechanic even half-awake.

282
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,200
It's got no flash.

283
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,170
Some people ain't looking for flash.

284
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,540
She's a good catch.

285
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,130
She comes our way,
you prep the nets.

286
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,430
Clearly, she's out of her mind.

287
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,180
Well, she's led a sheltered life.

288
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,180
Did you see the way she grabbed
that glass from him?

289
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,310
Every planet has its own
weird customs.

290
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,020
A year before we met,
I spent six weeks on a moon...

291
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,440
where the principal form
of recreation was juggling geese.

292
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,660
My hand to God. Baby geese.
Goslings. They were juggled.

293
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,700
Of course.
A man rushes in to defend her.

294
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,620
I'm talking about geese.

295
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,920
Captain shouldn't babysit
a groupie, and he knows it.

296
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,960
Okay, when did this become not funny?

297
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,170
When you didn't put her ass back down
on Triumph where it belongs.

298
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,390
Hey! Now it's even my fault? Anything
else on your mind I should know about?

299
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
There's all sorts of twists
and cul de sacs.

300
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,100
- She's trouble.
- I'm getting that.

301
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,690
I'm going to bed.

302
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,460
Hey!

303
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,130
You're, uh... Uh...

304
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,800
- Well, there you are.
- I've made the bed warm for you.

305
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,050
Yeah, it looks warm.

306
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,220
And I've made myself ready for you.

307
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,770
Let's ride right past the part where
you explain exactly what that means.

308
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,150
Didn't you see you got
a room of your own?

309
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,770
- And I'm to sleep there?
- That's the notion.

310
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,780
Assuming you're sleepy.

311
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,660
But we've been wed.
Aren't we to become one flesh?

312
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,540
Well, no. We're still two fleshes here...

313
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,500
and I think that your flesh
ought to sleep somewhere else.

314
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,540
I'm sorry. When we talked, I'd hoped...
I don't please you.

315
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,920
Hey, flesh.

316
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,720
Saffron, it ain't a question
of you pleasing me.

317
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,720
It's more a question of what's...

318
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,720
Um...

319
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,520
Of what's morally right.

320
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,100
I do know my Bible, sir.

321
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,900
On the night of their betrothal,
the wife shall open to the man...

322
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,980
as the furrow to the plough...

323
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,820
and he shall work in her
in and again...

324
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,410
till she bring him to his fall...

325
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,290
and rest him then
upon the sweat of her breast.

326
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,250
Oh.

327
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,670
Good Bible.

328
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,170
I'm not skilled, sir,
nor a pleasure to look upon...

329
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,010
Saffron...

330
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,090
you're pleasing. You're...

331
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,220
Hell, you're all kinds of pleasing,
and it's been a while...

332
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,850
a long damn while since anybody
but me took a hold of my plough...

333
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,810
so don't think for a second
that I ain't interested.

334
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,860
But you and me,
we ain't married.

335
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,320
Because you got handed to me by
some hu-dong couldn't pay his debts...

336
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,870
don't make you beholden to me.

337
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,620
- I keep trying to explain...
- Let me explain.

338
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,080
I lived my life in the maiden house,
waiting to be married off for trade.

339
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:28,010
I seen my sister paired off with
ugly men, vicious or blubberous.

340
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,720
Men with appetites
too unseemly to speak on.

341
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,230
And I've cried for those girls.

342
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,520
But not half so hard as I cried
the night they gave me to you.

343
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,730
Why?

344
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,030
Is there blubber?

345
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,330
I cried for I'd not dreamed
to have a man so sweet...

346
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,040
so kind and beautiful.

347
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,130
Had I the dare to choose,
I'd choose you...

348
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,800
from all the men on all the planets
the night sky could show me.

349
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,510
If I'm wed, I am a woman...

350
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,140
and I'll take your leave
to be bold.

351
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,060
I want this.

352
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,650
I swell to think of you in me.

353
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,940
And I see that you do too.

354
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,240
Oh, that's just...

355
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,240
Leave me at the nearest port,
never look upon me again.

356
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,870
I'll make my way with the strength
that you taught me.

357
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,880
Only let me have my wedding night.

358
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,380
Oh, I'm gonna go to the special hell.

359
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,470
I...

360
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,140
I really wish it was that simple, girl,
but I don't...

361
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,110
Ooh.

362
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,570
Son of a...

363
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Night, sweetie.

364
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,210
Well, if it isn't the master chef.

365
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,590
Not sleepy?

366
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,760
Am I allowed to be up here?

367
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,220
Well, sure. Why not?

368
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,220
It's not like anyone else
is taking up space.

369
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,730
I've never been off world before.

370
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,730
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- It's like a dream.

371
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,320
The planet I'm from, couldn't see
a one of them, pollution's so thick.

372
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,780
Sometimes I think I entered
flight school...

373
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,410
just to see what the hell
everyone was talking about.

374
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,830
What are you doing?

375
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,580
Now we're alone.
Just us and the stars.

376
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,550
No ship, no bellowing engines,
no crew to bicker at each other. Look.

377
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,390
Do you know the myth
of Earth that was?

378
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,310
Not so much.

379
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,980
That when she was born,
she had no sky...

380
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,860
and was open, inviting...

381
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,400
and the stars would rush into her...

382
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,860
through the skin of her...

383
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,870
making the oceans boil
with sensation.

384
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,500
And when she could endure
no more ecstasy...

385
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,670
she puffed up her cheeks
and blew out the sky.

386
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,460
Oh.

387
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,760
Good myth.

388
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:05,770
My whole life, I saw nothing but roofs
and steeples and the cellar door.

389
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,730
In a few days, I'll be back to that life
and gone from yours.

390
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,820
Make this night what it should be.

391
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,530
Please...

392
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,570
show me the stars.

393
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,540
Do I wish I was somebody else
right now.

394
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,500
Somebody not married...

395
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,050
not madly in love with a beautiful
woman who can kill me with her pinky.

396
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,220
- I've been too forward.
- No.

397
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,680
Well, yes, but I actually like that
in a woman.

398
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:43,680
That's part of why Zoe and I are,
as previously mentioned, married.

399
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,640
I thought...

400
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,230
She didn't seem to respect you.

401
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,400
Not everybody gets me and Zoe
at first glance.

402
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,860
Did it get very hot in here?
I need airflow.

403
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,610
You love her very much.

404
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,240
Yeah.

405
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,620
I never did meet anyone
quite like Zoe.

406
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,120
The first time we met,
she actually threw...

407
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,390
Are you lost?

408
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,900
I'm sorry, I thought the other shuttle
was yours.

409
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,860
It is. I was on the cortex and my
screen shorted. This one's out too.

410
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,820
- Looking for customers?
- What were you looking for?

411
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,330
I don't mean to be rude. A companion's
life is so glamorous and strange.

412
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,750
I wish I had the skill for such a trade.

413
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,170
You'd like to please your new husband?

414
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,420
Oh, he'll have none of me.

415
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,420
For true, I'm somewhat relieved.

416
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,630
If I'm to learn of love...

417
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,890
I'd like it to be at the hands
of someone gentle.

418
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,180
Someone who could...

419
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,480
feel what I feel.

420
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,900
But Mal said you don't approve
of my work.

421
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,150
Sure, and he said that
to keep you from me.

422
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,200
I was too curious about you.

423
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,910
Ever since I saw you.

424
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,040
Come to my shuttle.

425
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
You would...?

426
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,130
You would lie with me?

427
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,560
- I guess we've lied enough.
- You're good.

428
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,680
You're amazing. Who are you?

429
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,270
Malcolm Reynolds' widow.

430
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,960
Baby. Wake up.

431
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,170
- He's bleeding.
- There's no one in there.

432
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,050
What's going on?

433
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,020
Mal! Mal, Mal, Mal, Mal, Mal!

434
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,620
Get the doctor. Mal's hurt.

435
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,630
You stupid son of a...

436
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,140
ls it Christmas?

437
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,930
- Well, he's back.
- What happened about me?

438
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,100
Your blushing bride was a plant.

439
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,100
She took both of you out.

440
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,730
How did...?

441
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,490
Narcotic compound, probably
spread over a seal on her lips.

442
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,860
- You get it on yours, and pow.
- Lips, huh?

443
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,110
Well...

444
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,580
We used to get a lot of guys
brought in on the night shift at the ER...

445
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,290
usually robbed, very groggy.
They called it the good night kiss.

446
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,670
- So you two were kissing.
- Well, isn't that special?

447
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,800
- Wash, how did...?
- I just got kicked in the head.

448
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,390
- My man would never fall for that.
- Most of my head wishes I had.

449
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,600
- You guys don't understand.
- Seems pretty simple.

450
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,140
- You were taking advantage...
- I was the one being taken advantage of.

451
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,640
My apologies.

452
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,980
You were victimised, Wash was beaten,
and Inara found you here.

453
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,360
Then I fell.
My head got hurt like Wash.

454
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,450
- I don't get any of this.
- I only fell, is all.

455
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,910
- What the hell's our status?
- We're shut down...

456
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,580
trying to get on the bridge.

457
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,580
All we know is, we're headed
somewhere, and it ain't Beaumond.

458
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,840
Oh, I'm fine.
I don't need to be examined.

459
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,510
I'm comfy.

460
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,390
She didn't just lock it. She fused
both entrances to something.

461
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,560
But why the big act?
What was she after?

462
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,140
Besides molesting captains.

463
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,940
You wanna stow it, preacher?
We're in some peril here.

464
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,110
If she can fly this,
why take the shuttle?

465
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,530
Maybe she likes shuttles?

466
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,280
Some people juggle geese.

467
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,620
- She's a pro.
- This is a masterful job of muck-up.

468
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,460
See how she crossed the dry feeds?

469
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,330
So we even try to re-route,
it'll lock down.

470
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,050
- She went straight for the thermal cap.
- Yeah, yeah.

471
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
We are so hung.

472
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,220
I'm glad you're having a good time.
Can we make it right?

473
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,050
That's not gonna happen
for a while.

474
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,100
Well, we don't have a good long while.

475
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,350
We could be headed straight into
a solid moon for all we know...

476
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,730
so how's about we get to work?

477
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,020
Hey, it was your big make-out session
that got us into this, sir.

478
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,610
- I was poisoned.
- You were drugged.

479
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,490
That's why I never kiss them
on the mouth.

480
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,910
What can you do?

481
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,000
We can get the cortex and navcom back
online, at least see where we're headed.

482
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,410
- What about steering?
- What about stopping?

483
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,960
She humped us hard.
We're gonna have to do a lot...

484
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:30,880
Well, do it! Doesn't help me to see
where I'm going if I can't change course.

485
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,340
- This girl really knows her ships.
- That's not all she knows.

486
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,300
She's well-schooled.

487
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,470
What do you mean, the sedative?
The good night kiss?

488
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,520
I only hit my head,
but Mal went through that.

489
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,730
But, no, I mean, seduction,
body language, signals.

490
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,900
She's had training.
As in companion.

491
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,190
As in academy.

492
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,570
Our little Saffron's quite a wonder.

493
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,490
I'm beginning to think
she married beneath herself.

494
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,700
How do you know? About the training?

495
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,790
She tried to seduce me too.

496
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,880
Really?

497
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,090
Did she...?

498
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,010
Uh, did you...?

499
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,880
You don't play a player.

500
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,760
It was sloppy of her to try it,
but she was in a rush.

501
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,720
But she had professional...

502
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,560
So in my case,
I mean, it was really...

503
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,980
You would've kissed her too.

504
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,440
- Wash didn't.
- But she was naked.

505
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,690
And all articulate.

506
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,360
Okay! Everybody not talking about sex,
in here. Everybody else, elsewhere.

507
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,120
They're coming.

508
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,870
- How far out?
- Ten minutes or so, right on target.

509
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,830
Speed, A-1.

510
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,750
- That girl's a wonder.
- She gets it done.

511
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,670
Tell the boys.

512
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Yes!

513
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,430
Got it?

514
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,640
We got life, we got screens.
It's a qualified yes, a partial.

515
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,890
- What about nav control?
- No.

516
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,060
- Where we headed?
- Coordinates she entered.

517
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,310
We're headed for something
not too far.

518
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,320
Did she signal anybody?

519
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,990
She did. Same coordinates, no ID.

520
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,320
Who's out there?

521
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:25,160
Let me see if her signal wave can
translate to a visual. There might be...

522
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,960
Yeah. Electromagnetic interference.

523
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,830
It's bouncing the signal
all over the place. Look at it.

524
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,840
It's like a circle.

525
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,420
It's a net.

526
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,220
I don't get it.

527
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,850
Where are we headed?

528
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,470
The end of the line.

529
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,610
It's a carrion house.
Scrap shop.

530
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,280
Takes ships and pulls them apart,
or fixes them up.

531
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,950
- Doesn't sound that scary.
- That pattern you're looking at is a net.

532
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,960
We fall into that, we're helpless.

533
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:15,130
It'll turn this ship into an electrical
conduit and burn us from the inside out.

534
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,170
Some of the new ones
will just hold you.

535
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:23,590
And then the scrappers will override the
air locks, pull the O2 or just gas you.

536
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,390
They're not looking
to deal with survivors.

537
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,100
One day, you're gonna tell us how
a preacher knows so much about crime.

538
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,440
Kaylee.

539
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,060
- I'm trying, sir.
- Keep on it. We can't fall into that net.

540
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,400
We're gonna need a plan B.

541
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,160
Zoe, get our suits prepped now.
I figure we got one shot at this.

542
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,330
- Give me a visual, soon as we're close.
- Won't be long.

543
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,580
What do I do?

544
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,750
You go get Vera.

545
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,920
She needs oxygen around to fire,
and we don't have a case.

546
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,800
Gonna use a suit.

547
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,630
Here, we got it.

548
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,550
- What am I aiming for, the window?
- That won't disrupt the net.

549
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,430
See these six brightest points?

550
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,390
Those are the breakers.
Hit one, should short it out.

551
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,520
What do you mean, should?

552
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,130
- You see it?
- Clear as day.

553
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:42,300
You see, Vera? Dress yourself up,
you get taken out somewhere fun.

554
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,420
We got it.

555
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,750
It's not pretty, but we can steer enough
to turn the hell around.

556
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,210
Nice work.

557
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,550
Weren't soon enough to help.

558
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,090
It's easier to pull things apart
than put them right.

559
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,140
Still the best mechanic floating.

560
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,510
Don't you know kissing girls
makes you sleepy?

561
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,720
Sometimes I just can't help myself.

562
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:37,520
Now, let's go visiting.

563
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,740
Honey, I'm home.

564
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,330
Looks like you get that wedding night
after all.

565
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,840
It's the first time, darling.
I think you should be gentle with me.

566
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,220
You gonna kill me?

567
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,180
Can you conjure up a compelling
reason for me not to?

568
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,100
I didn't kill you.

569
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,440
You handed me and my crew over
to those that would kill us.

570
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,610
I made you dinner.

571
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,940
Why the act?

572
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,320
The seduction games, the dancing about.
There has to be an easier way to steal.

573
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,740
You're assuming
the pay-off is the point.

574
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,370
I'm not assuming anything
at this juncture.

575
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,200
How did you find me?

576
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,960
Only a few places that shuttle would
make it to from where you left.

577
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,750
Happy to find it intact.

578
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,670
You're quite a man, Malcolm Reynolds.

579
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,050
I've been waiting a long time for
someone good enough to take me down.

580
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,550
Saffron...

581
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,560
you even think about playing me again,
I will riddle you with holes.

582
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,770
Everybody plays each other.
That's all anybody ever does.

583
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,940
- We play parts.
- You got all kinds of learning.

584
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:09,700
You made me look the fool without
trying, yet I have a gun to your head.

585
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,950
That's because I got people with me.

586
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,410
People who trust each other and ain't
always looking for the advantage.

587
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,580
Promise me you're gonna kill me soon.

588
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,620
You already know I ain't gonna.

589
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,130
You did pretty well.

590
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,300
Most men, they're on me
inside of 10 minutes.

591
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,550
Not trying to teach me
to be strong and the like.

592
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,800
I got one question for you.

593
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,770
Just one thing I'd like to know,
straight up.

594
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,230
Ask me.

595
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,480
What's your real name?

596
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,160
You'd only have lied anyhow.

597
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,290
Come in.

598
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,790
Back on course.

599
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,880
Be on Beaumond a day or two late.
Hope it's all right.

600
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,420
Should be fine, thank you.

601
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,800
- And does the vixen live?
- Yeah, if you can call it that.

602
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,470
- All's well, I suppose.
- Yes.

603
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,100
You're a very graceful woman, Inara.

604
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,980
I...

605
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,610
Thank you.

606
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,650
So here's where I'm fuzzy.

607
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,240
You got by that girl,
came and found me...

608
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,120
and somehow you happen
to just trip and fall.

609
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,080
- What do you mean?
- Come on, Inara.

610
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,660
How's about we don't play?

611
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,580
You didn't just trip, did you?

612
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,920
No.

613
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,260
Well, isn't that something.

614
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,100
I knew you let her kiss you.
