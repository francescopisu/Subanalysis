1
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,461
Sold, ladies and gentlemen,
to Ms. Veronica Vreeland for $200,000.

2
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:31,424
Bored? We've only been
here 10 minutes.

3
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:34,385
Ten minutes for you,
10 hours for me.

4
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,971
I know it's for a good cause, but...

5
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:42,184
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
this magnificent timepiece

6
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,853
from the reign of Louis XVI.

7
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:46,689
Who will start the bidding at $400,000?

8
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:50,735
You've gotta be kidding.
I wouldn't use that for a doorstop.

9
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:11,130
Right on time, as usual.

10
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:20,765
I have a bid of $500,000.
Do I hear $550,000?

11
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:25,978
Good afternoon.

12
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,231
Have they sold the Louis XVI yet?

13
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,276
No, the bidding just started.

14
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,361
How did you...

15
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,449
I gotta see my optometrist.

16
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:44,789
I have a bid of $585,000. Do I hear six?

17
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:49,168
Come, come. This is a one-of-a-kind item
ladies and gentlemen. Who'll give six?

18
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,837
Six hundred thousand.

19
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,631
Six hundred thousand?

20
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:56,884
I've heard that time is money,
but this is ridiculous.

21
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,345
Like you said, it's for charity.

22
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:04,642
I have $600,000 from Mr. Bruce Wayne.
Do I hear $650,000?

23
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:08,979
Need I remind you, this timepiece
was once owned by Marie Antoinette.

24
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,487
Relax, Dick. It's almost over.

25
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:20,282
You're not gonna believe this,
but I thought I just saw the Clock King.

26
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,204
Well, he was there.

27
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:29,125
I have $650,000. Going, going, gone.

28
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:33,587
Blimey!

29
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,771
A trial run, and it went like clockwork.

30
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:56,152
Hmm. Got one.

31
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,458
<i>I have $650,000. Going, going, gone.</i>

32
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,628
<i>Blimey!</i>

33
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,338
Back up.

34
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,428
<i>There. Freeze it.</i>

35
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,977
That must be the hand
everyone talks about.

36
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,354
The one that's quicker than the eye.

37
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:36,108
So we don't have
another invisible man running loose.

38
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,276
Then who could it be?

39
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,488
I think it's Temple Fugate,
the Clock King.

40
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,364
What makes you think that?

41
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:44,241
Let's just call it a hunch.

42
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,160
Better warn Mayor Hill, Jim.

43
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,746
I doubt that time has healed
Fugate's wound.

44
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,990
6:15, sir. Time for breakfast.

45
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,410
I've also brought you your medicine
and the timer

46
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,830
so you can take your pills on schedule.

47
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,415
You think of everything,
don't you, Harold?

48
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,543
It is my job, sir.

49
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,295
How goes your research, if I may ask?

50
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,463
Well enough.

51
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,383
The iron ball has dropped
a mere tenth of a millimeter

52
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,593
since the experiment began last week.

53
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,388
An extreme temporal discontinuity.

54
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:50,307
And the accelerated effect
is just as dramatic.

55
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,978
Five minutes ago, that plant was a seed.

56
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:56,480
Amazing, Dr. Wakati.

57
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:59,733
Why, the possible applications
are mind-boggling.

58
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,860
Indeed.

59
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,446
We could get rid of radioactive waste
in minutes instead of eons

60
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:08,200
put terminally ill people in stasis
until a cure is found.

61
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:14,540
The question is, is mankind civilized
enough to make the proper use of it?

62
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,500
You're right, Doctor.

63
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:20,838
It's very important that this device
be kept in the right hands.

64
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:42,693
I hope you're having
a pleasant evening, Mr. Mayor,

65
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:47,197
because it's time for you and me
to renew our acquaintance.

66
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:07,426
It's going to be a big ceremony, Jim.

67
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,431
Fugate? No, I'm not worried.

68
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:15,184
I've got a platoon of officers
around the building.

69
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,354
<i>He can't get in the door
without bumping into a blue coat.</i>

70
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:22,316
He's still on the phone.
You really think our guy will show up?

71
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:25,736
Sure as night follows day.

72
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,113
What am I thinking?

73
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,875
Going to be a nasty fall, dearie.

74
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,920
What the...

75
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,182
Ah!

76
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,726
I think that's our cue.

77
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,187
You! How did you get past...

78
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,731
Good evening, Mayor.

79
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,150
Nice to see you again too.

80
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,653
And whose life are you ruining now?

81
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,071
A poor pensioner,

82
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:53,198
a malnourished orphan perhaps?

83
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,370
Naughty, naughty.

84
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,040
What?

85
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,750
Where did you...

86
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,174
I don't think so.

87
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,092
Even if you could climb the building,

88
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,595
you won't be leaving this way,
Mr. Mayor.

89
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:17,890
I've waited a long time for this.

90
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,350
Please, Fugate, don't hurt me.

91
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,271
If it's any comfort, my revenge
will encompass more than just you.

92
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,943
I intend to pass a most timely sentence
on the entire judicial system.

93
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:31,737
Get ready.

94
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,283
My eyes!

95
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,103
Robin. Grab the hypo.

96
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:49,523
Get off me.

97
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,191
What?

98
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,739
You clumsy...

99
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,493
You...

100
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,001
Hey, you. Stop!

101
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,592
Look. Over there. That's him.
Let's get him.

102
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,218
- Come on.
- Stop.

103
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,390
- Hold it right there.
- You're under arrest.

104
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:27,936
- Don't move.
- Freeze.

105
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:43,243
The Batmobile.

106
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:45,913
Ah!

107
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:47,915
- Hey!
- Where'd he go?

108
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,416
- Look out.
- Hey, watch it.

109
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,590
It was like a nightmare.

110
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,384
First he was here, then there.

111
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:01,929
My heavens.
If you hadn't set that trap...

112
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,682
Well, at least we've got the pieces
from Fugate's broken thingamajig.

113
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,309
Maybe we can find out how he made it.

114
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,979
I don't think Fugate made that device.

115
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:13,690
He's not a scientist.

116
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,068
Well, we'll soon find out who did.

117
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:19,988
All our patrol cars are equipped
with tracking devices.

118
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,449
We should be able
to run Fugate down pretty quickly.

119
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,371
Harold.

120
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:30,666
Harold.

121
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,918
What are you doing in my room?

122
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,337
I called for you but got no answer.

123
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,256
I thought something might be wrong.

124
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,801
There is something wrong, old man.

125
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,762
Why are you wearing that?

126
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,182
I'm afraid I haven't been
altogether candid with you.

127
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,935
What... What are you going to do?

128
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,648
You'll find out, my good doctor,
all in good time.

129
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,447
I want a dragnet over
a five-mile radius.

130
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,703
He couldn't have gotten far.
With any luck, time is on our side.

131
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,546
You think the police will find him?

132
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,507
Doubtful, but I have an idea.

133
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,426
With his knowledge of train schedules

134
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:24,845
He would know when the next
commuter run would pass.

135
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,514
It's no accident
that he ditched the car where he did.

136
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:31,685
Only one train passed there in the last
six hours, heading for the mountains.

137
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,104
I don't get it.
There's nothing out that way.

138
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,566
Nothing except Cranston Estates.

139
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,949
So you say this guy
lives out there?

140
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,285
What's his name, this Professor Wataki?

141
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:52,205
Wakati. He's the father
of quantum temporal theory,

142
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,291
the structure of time.

143
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,178
What's going on?

144
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:08,096
Fugate's booby-trapped the car.

145
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,390
We're trapped in time.

146
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,196
What's going on?

147
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,990
We've been put in a bubble of slow time.

148
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,618
The outside world is moving
much faster than we are.

149
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,161
Look.

150
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:33,830
Hours are passing like minutes.

151
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,501
Why didn't the car's sensors
pick up the booby trap?

152
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,463
He probably set it just a nanosecond
or two out of phase with reality.

153
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,340
But that's the least of our problems.

154
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:46,843
E still equals MC squared, last I heard.

155
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,929
Mass increases with speed.

156
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:51,515
If a car hits us
while we're frozen like this,

157
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:53,642
we might trigger an atomic explosion.

158
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,108
There it is.

159
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,819
Hey!

160
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,762
Nearly as I can figure,
we've lost almost 48 hours.

161
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,904
Then we'd better not
waste any more time.

162
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,292
I think we've found the professor.

163
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,382
How do we get him out?

164
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,135
Same way we got ourselves out.

165
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,102
Don't, Harold.

166
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,562
Batman?

167
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,906
Just make sure nobody fiddles
with the props.

168
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,909
No problem.

169
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,734
He was the one person
in the world I trusted.

170
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:11,029
Is it any wonder I prefer
being a recluse?

171
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,115
What else did he say, Dr. Wakati?

172
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,825
He was babbling.

173
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:18,495
Said something about the Mayor,

174
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,706
about how he was finally
going to get his day in court.

175
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:23,333
Day in court?

176
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,377
The new courthouse.

177
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:28,129
The Mayor is dedicating
it today at 10:00.

178
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,633
That's two minutes from now.
We'd better call the cops and...

179
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,969
You can't. I have no phones.

180
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,306
Your phone won't work, Batman.
This area is a dead zone.

181
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:42,852
I chose it so my experiments would
be free of electromagnetic interference.

182
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:46,314
It'll take at least a half hour for us
to make it back on the bikes.

183
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:52,404
You have 30 seconds to show us
how to use these.

184
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:11,590
Wow, faster than a speeding bullet.

185
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,554
<i>And so, my friends,
it is my privilege</i>

186
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:21,766
<i>to officially bring Gotham City's
new courthouse to order.</i>

187
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,938
By all means, Mr. Mayor,
usher the new building in with a bang.

188
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:39,159
This could be dangerous.
Better stand back.

189
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:44,914
Oh, to savor the moment
as long as possible.

190
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,896
No. It can't be.

191
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,448
Too late. It's triggered.

192
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:28,875
Slow down.

193
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:11,543
Looks like time just ran out.

194
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,223
It's a shame that you've decided
to keep this device a secret.

195
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,768
It would seem that the world
is not quite ready for it yet.

196
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,812
Gee, that's too bad for Fugate.

197
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:32,665
I'm sure he'll wish he had something

198
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,733
<i>to make the days pass quicker
where he's going.</i>
