1
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,427
We've waited weeks for reservations.

2
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,980
- Name?
- King, party of one.

3
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:50,693
King, King. No, I'm sorry,
I don't show that reservation.

4
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,488
Oh, yeah? Well, let me
show you something, fruitcake.

5
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,533
Ahh!

6
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,288
Hands up, chow hounds.

7
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:08,711
Drop your forks and prepare to cower
before the uncanny Condiment King.

8
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,464
- Who is that?
- Some kind of nutcase.

9
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:14,592
- Just ignore him.
- Someone will call security.

10
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:20,681
Hey. Hey! I don't believe this!
I say cower, and you're still eating?

11
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:22,892
Well, all right then.

12
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,318
Now, see here, you.

13
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:40,534
Hot sauce.

14
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,954
Anyone else want to be a hero?

15
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,332
Then take out your wallets,
cash and jewels

16
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,085
and toss them here on the table.
Come on. Right now.

17
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:55,108
<i>Disturbance reported at
the top of the Crown restaurant.</i>

18
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:59,011
<i>Suspect is a male, costumed extremist
armed with what appears to be</i>

19
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,262
<i>a ketchup gun.</i>

20
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,015
It's gonna be one of those nights.

21
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:13,693
So long, suckers.
Parting is such sweet-and-sour sorrow.

22
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,411
What's this?

23
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,997
Ah! The big, bad Bat-guy.

24
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,377
I knew you'd catch up to me sooner or
later. How I've relished this meeting.

25
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:37,675
You, the dynamic Dark Knight, versus me,
the conceptual Condiment King.

26
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,093
Come, Batman.

27
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,888
Let's see if you can cut the mustard...

28
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,098
Quiet.

29
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,353
- You hit me.
- Now, listen, Mustard Man,

30
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:51,272
or whatever you call yourself.

31
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,192
You're obviously new at this,
so I'm willing to go easy on you.

32
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,863
Provided you give back the loot and
never even think about doing this again.

33
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,156
Deal?

34
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,160
- Horseradish!
- This is your last warning.

35
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,746
Let's go, Batso. You and me.

36
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,124
I'm the prince of pickles,
sultan of sauce.

37
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,335
You don't stand a chance. You hear me?

38
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,755
Later, chump.

39
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,469
Hang on.

40
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:34,857
Harvey, call an ambulance.

41
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,568
I know this man.

42
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,696
He's that TV comic, Buddy Standler.

43
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:44,074
<i>Still no clues in the mystery</i>

44
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,826
<i>behind comedian Buddy Standler's</i>

45
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,828
<i>one-man crime spree last night.</i>

46
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:52,041
<i>A rampage that ended with a trip
to the hospital for the famed TV comic.</i>

47
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,419
<i>Though Standler himself is unable
to account for his actions,</i>

48
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,922
<i>his manager had these observations.</i>

49
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,510
<i>I don't get it. Buddy's just thrown
his entire career away.</i>

50
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,887
<i>The network's canceling his show</i>

51
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,681
<i>and the restaurant's suing him
for a million dollars.</i>

52
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,601
<i>Why'd he do it?
It just doesn't make sense.</i>

53
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,522
That's too bad. I watch Standler's show
all the time. He's great.

54
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,483
Any idea what would have caused him
to go off the deep end?

55
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,361
No, but talk about bad timing.

56
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,404
He was supposed to be one of the judges

57
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,573
for the annual
laugh-off competition tonight.

58
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,700
Alfred and I bought tickets.

59
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:29,286
<i>By the way, where is Alfred?</i>

60
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,216
- One side, mac.
- I beg your pardon.

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,140
Ooh. Pretty. I want it.

62
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,979
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Sure I can, lady.

63
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,189
I'm the Pack Rat,

64
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,693
- and your trash is my treasure.
- Hey!

65
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,947
Mmm. Shiny.

66
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,366
Security!

67
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,914
Oh, no, you don't.

68
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:29,013
Whoa, dibs on the dummy hand.

69
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:32,016
Good heavens.

70
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:42,109
I've been looking everyplace
for one of these.

71
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,663
- Yes?
<i>- Master Bruce?</i>

72
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,873
Alfred?

73
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:58,250
I think you're needed at Mayfield's
right away, sir.

74
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,252
There's a man with a gun running amok.

75
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,503
He's...

76
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,758
A word of advice, mac.
Never rat on a rat.

77
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,185
<i>Alfred?</i>

78
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,357
Alfred!

79
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,539
<i>You'll get oatmeal and like it.</i>

80
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,544
Listen, Eddie, if they expect me
to judge that stupid laugh-off again,

81
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,755
they'd better be prepared to pay.

82
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,968
Hold on, I got somebody at the door.

83
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:56,642
- Yeah?
- Pizza delivery.

84
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,727
I didn't order any pizza.

85
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:04,608
- But I'll take it. How much?
- It's on me.

86
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,902
Hey!

87
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,247
Okay, everybody, empty your pockets.

88
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,918
I want gum wrappers, loose string,
those little balls of lint.

89
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,630
None of that cash stuff.

90
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:28,465
Hey!

91
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,051
What?

92
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,723
So it's the rat versus the bat
and the brat.

93
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,977
Only one will survive,
and that's gonna be me.

94
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,395
Everybody, clear out.

95
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,592
Come on out.

96
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,848
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

97
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:53,258
It's Harry Loomis.

98
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,052
Another famous comedian.

99
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:56,428
Look at his neck.

100
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:05,979
A microchip?

101
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,482
Mind control.

102
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,945
This is beginning to point toward
our old friend, the Mad Hatter.

103
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,044
Wake up, Jervis. We have to talk.

104
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,714
Come on, rise and shine.

105
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,765
Wow, he's really out.

106
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,208
Here's what we know.

107
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:13,380
Someone implants the Mad Hatter with
one of his own mind-control devices,

108
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,799
then does the same thing
to two comedians.

109
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,217
But what's the connection?

110
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,720
Looks like it's three comedians
now, sir.

111
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,391
"TV personality Lisa Lorraine
was abducted"

112
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:26,310
"from her apartment early this evening."

113
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:30,397
And here's our common link.
This comedy competition.

114
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:33,400
Sure. Buddy, Harry and Lisa
judge it every year.

115
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,444
Remember, we taped the last one.

116
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,112
Right here, Master Dick.

117
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,114
And I've cued it
to something you should see.

118
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,206
<i>Well, that's it for our contestants.</i>

119
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,542
<i>Now our panel of distinguished judges
will choose</i>

120
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,670
<i>the funniest person in Gotham.</i>

121
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:05,390
<i>Not so fast, chuckles.
You haven't introduced me yet.</i>

122
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,643
<i>Smiling Shecky Rimshot.</i>

123
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,228
<i>Ba-dum-boom.</i>

124
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,856
<i>Come on, already.</i>

125
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,526
<i>Good evening, ladies and germs.</i>

126
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,738
<i>Hey, did you hear about the guy
walked into a doctor's office</i>

127
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:21,990
<i>with a frog on his head? Doctor says,</i>

128
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,928
<i>"That's the weirdest looking wart
I've ever seen." Frog looks up and says,</i>

129
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,955
<i>"Yeah, I woke up this morning,
there was a big bump on my butt."</i>

130
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:36,463
<i>Hey, then there's this guy who buys
a new dog.</i>

131
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,340
<i>He takes it for a walk
and the friend says...</i>

132
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,633
Huh?

133
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,095
<i>Sorry, pal.
We've already made our decision.</i>

134
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:47,266
<i>And for your information,
registration closed days ago.</i>

135
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,519
<i>I'm not leaving until I get that trophy.</i>

136
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,314
<i>Oh, yes, you are.</i>

137
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,696
<i>You can't do this to me!</i>

138
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,781
<i>I'm the greatest comic in Gotham!</i>

139
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:06,910
<i>I'll get even. I'll ruin you all.</i>

140
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,174
<i>Freeze it right there.</i>

141
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,626
I think I see what you mean, Alfred.

142
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,421
Without the hat...

143
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,049
And different hair...

144
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:22,843
The Joker!

145
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,900
I tell you, Maury, I'm dying here.

146
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,277
I got a full house,

147
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,572
and all three of my celebrity judges
are either missing or in jail.

148
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,033
You gotta find me
some replacements quick.

149
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,453
Ask and ye shall receive.

150
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,580
What in the...

151
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:57,127
Permit me to introduce Judges
Knuckles, Vinnie and Kowalski.

152
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:00,297
They'll be presenting me
with the trophy tonight.

153
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:03,842
Listen, you
can't just walk in here and take...

154
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,011
Oh, but I already have.

155
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,394
These little microchips are a wonder.

156
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,982
Remind me to thank the Mad Hatter
if he ever wakes up.

157
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,736
Hey, start the show already.

158
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:26,156
- Let's go already!
- Start the show!

159
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:31,286
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the 10th annual Gotham Laff Off.

160
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,415
And now, it is my deepest honor
to present to you

161
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:40,170
the evening's first and only contestant,
Smiling Shecky Rimshot.

162
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,566
Hey, folks, you're beautiful.

163
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,510
Funny thing happened to me
on the way to the theater last year.

164
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:50,972
It seems three no-talent hacks
tried to stop me from winning.

165
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,516
But guess what!

166
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,521
I'm back.

167
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,614
Oh! Such unhappy faces.

168
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,200
Judges, let's cheer them up.

169
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:18,667
My high-octane laughing gas
will have you rolling in the aisles.

170
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,976
It's just you and us, Joker.

171
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,353
Not quite, Batman.

172
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:42,774
I've got a new girl, and she'll
really sweep you off your feet.

173
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,405
Lisa Lorraine?

174
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,870
Call me Mighty Mom.

175
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,371
Ain't she sweet?

176
00:15:57,622 --> 00:16:01,001
My very own happy homemaker.

177
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,378
But I don't do windows.

178
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,006
Not bad.

179
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,301
Honey, why don't you show our pals
how you clean house?

180
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,345
In other words, mop 'em up.

181
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,440
Who's first to get dusted?

182
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,622
Think you can get
the brain patch off her?

183
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:26,818
No problem.

184
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,120
- Hey!
- Naughty boy. Mama spank.

185
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,755
What did I tell you about playing
with your toys in the house?

186
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,674
- Get rid of it!
- You're the boss.

187
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,729
No! Not on my nice clean floor.

188
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:05,565
- Just hold still.
- Ow!

189
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:07,150
That hurts.

190
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:13,490
- Don't worry. I'm back to normal.
- Who can tell?

191
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:41,142
- Stay back.
- You've hit a new low, Joker.

192
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,105
Only you would ruin three lives
for a silly piece of tin.

193
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,691
You're dumber than you look, Bats.

194
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,822
It's not the trophy that matters,
it's the title.

195
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:58,660
I am the greatest clown
this dismal burg has ever seen.

196
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:02,414
What would the common folk do
without my pranks and antics?

197
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,207
Let's find out.

198
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,048
Up, up and away!

199
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,318
Quit rocking the boat!

200
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,707
Oh! Too bad, Bat-sap.

201
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,001
But you should have remembered
the old saying,

202
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:51,588
"Dying is easy, comedy is hard."

203
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:04,934
Mind if I join the party?

204
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,653
Ow! You miserable brat.

205
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,869
Get this stupid thing off me.

206
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,377
Oops!

207
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,962
Watch it.

208
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,424
I think I'm getting airsick.

209
00:19:56,069 --> 00:20:01,491
I'll get you for this, Batman!
No one upstages me and lives.

210
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,830
Is there a problem, officers?

211
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:18,174
What's so funny?
I'll give you something to laugh about!
