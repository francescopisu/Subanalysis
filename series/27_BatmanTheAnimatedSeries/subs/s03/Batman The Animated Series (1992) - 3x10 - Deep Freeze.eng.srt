1
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:16,719
Fire!

2
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,580
Interesting.

3
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,844
Guard? Guard?

4
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,722
Guard!

5
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,230
Help me!

6
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,488
You gotta give Mr. Freeze credit.

7
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:20,157
That's the most original breakout
this year.

8
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,034
Yes, but I don't think he was behind it.

9
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,120
Look at the expression of fear
on his face.

10
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,454
That's not easy to fake,

11
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,332
especially for a man
claiming to be dead to emotions.

12
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,209
Freeze was taken against his will,

13
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:32,795
and obviously by someone
with expertise in robotics.

14
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,424
Then maybe we'd better consult
our own robot expert.

15
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:45,266
Greetings, dynamic duo.

16
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:46,684
I'm your biggest fan.

17
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,937
What is it?

18
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,148
Mwah!

19
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,483
I just wanna help.

20
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,280
Just wanna help. Just wanna help.

21
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:01,866
Poor little critter.

22
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,993
I never could get his programming right.

23
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,286
Cute toy, Karl.

24
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:08,414
You know I'm out
of the robot business, Batman.

25
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:13,169
All I make anymore are little friends
to keep me company.

26
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,462
Like Tiny, here?

27
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,215
Well, if it isn't old M-9.

28
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,342
- It's one of yours?
- Not really.

29
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,554
I once created a smaller prototype
for Grant Walker.

30
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,931
- The guy who builds those theme parks?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,642
I was one of Walker's
original visioneers.

32
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,437
Constructing and programming
the animatronic figures

33
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,439
he used in his park attractions.

34
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,109
Though it looks like old Grant's boys
pumped up the design a bit.

35
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,653
I'm wondering
how improved these robots are.

36
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,656
And why one of them was sent
to kidnap Mr. Freeze.

37
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,025
Impressive.

38
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:19,401
"Impressive?"

39
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,029
You gaze upon all this
and can only say "impressive"?

40
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,615
Though perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.

41
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:29,036
I've made a hobby of studying
your chilly history, Victor Fries.

42
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,788
And you are?

43
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:32,915
Grant Walker, at your service, sir.

44
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,585
This is Oceana,
my prototype vision of the future.

45
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,672
A vision that
you shall help make a reality.

46
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,048
Doubtful.

47
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:42,258
We'll see.

48
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,343
Make sure that our guest is comfortable.

49
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,599
<i>Sir, we've picked up
an unauthorized craft entering our area.</i>

50
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,104
Can't afford nosy trespassers
at this stage of the game.

51
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,857
Dispatch our usual deterrents,
Mr. Johnson.

52
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,782
I still don't see why a theme-park mogul
would kidnap Mr. Freeze.

53
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,743
Men like Walker are obsessed
with getting their own way.

54
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,621
And they don't let little things
like the law stop them.

55
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,499
I'm picking something up on the scanner.

56
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,501
Three small objects coming in fast.

57
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,356
Hang on!

58
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,422
The power shorted out.

59
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:05,549
And those things are coming back.

60
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,309
Intruder threat
has been neutralized, sir.

61
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:16,727
<i>Excellent.</i>

62
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:30,074
Looks like we're swimming home.

63
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:32,910
Not before we have a talk
with Mr. Walker.

64
00:07:57,184 --> 00:08:00,646
I think you'll find that suit
is a perfect duplicate of your original.

65
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,983
Automatic temperature control,
increased cybernetic strength.

66
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:06,151
Even the cold gun works.

67
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,668
Yes. Logically,
I should do the same to you.

68
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,461
Just hear me out, please.

69
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,089
As I said,
I've studied you and your work.

70
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,299
Do you realize that in your frozen state

71
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,928
you'll age much slower
than an ordinary human?

72
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,431
You're practically immortal, my friend.

73
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:39,977
Yes, eternal life
trapped in this wretched shell.

74
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,062
What a miserable joke.

75
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:46,150
Oh, miserable to you,
but a godsend to me.

76
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,694
Look at me, Mr. Freeze. I'm an old man.

77
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:51,363
I've created wonders in my lifetime,

78
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,824
but there is still so much to do.

79
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,035
I want to change as you have.

80
00:08:56,118 --> 00:09:01,415
To become like you,
a being of blessed, eternal cold.

81
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,459
You're insane.

82
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:07,546
Only you have the know-how to duplicate
the accident that made you what you are.

83
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:10,049
What I long to become.

84
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,427
You want to live like this?

85
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,804
Abandoned and alone?

86
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,016
A prisoner in a world you can see,
but never touch?

87
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,564
Old and infirm as you are,

88
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:30,194
I'd trade 1,000 of my frozen years
for your worst day.

89
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,029
Actually,

90
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:35,074
I had another kind of swap in mind.

91
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,957
Nora.

92
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,127
I was a major investor in GothCorp
a few years back

93
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,130
and put up some money
for their cryogenics program.

94
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:55,094
I trust you know the young lady
behind the glass.

95
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,305
My wife.

96
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:01,558
The GothCorp execs
think she perished in the fire,

97
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,976
but my men got her out.

98
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,313
I have the technology
to restore her, my friend.

99
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:09,441
All you have to do is grant my wish.

100
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,361
Very well.

101
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,035
<i>Welcome, friends.</i>

102
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:06,540
<i>Thanks to all our hard work,
Oceana's nearly up and running.</i>

103
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:10,711
<i>Now, while most folks believe
Oceana's just another theme park,</i>

104
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,713
<i>we know better.</i>

105
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:16,425
<i>Fact of the matter is,
it's not too nice out there anymore.</i>

106
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,052
<i>Crime, hatred, violence.</i>

107
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,054
<i>Things keep going on like that,</i>

108
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:23,765
<i>it could mean the end of civilization.</i>

109
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:29,188
<i>That's why I decided to build a city
where good folks can live in peace.</i>

110
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,357
<i>A new Garden of Eden, you might say,</i>

111
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,194
<i>from which a new race
of people can spring.</i>

112
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:38,697
<i>Now, of course you can't have spring
without a little winter.</i>

113
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,241
<i>About five years of it, I'd say.</i>

114
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,288
<i>Now, don't anybody worry.</i>

115
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,917
<i>We'll all be warm as toast in here.</i>

116
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,295
<i>As for those folks outside,
well, it's sad,</i>

117
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:56,673
<i>but I'm only speeding up
what they were doing to themselves.</i>

118
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:58,675
Brother. He's all heart, isn't he?

119
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,219
Walker's a madman.

120
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,887
Whoa!

121
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,129
- Look.
<i>- Every time I open a park,</i>

122
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,215
<i>I get gate-crashers.</i>

123
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:41,343
We've seen your insane vision
of the future, Walker.

124
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:46,390
<i>My world will have no crime,
violence, or pain.</i>

125
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:48,976
You can add free will to that list too.

126
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,103
<i>A small price to pay for order.</i>

127
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,604
Your order.

128
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,189
For your select few.

129
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:57,317
<i>Excuse me, but I fail to see
the problem with that.</i>

130
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:24,344
Freeze, I don't know
what Walker said or promised you,

131
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,513
but you can't help him
go through with this plan.

132
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,099
I have no choice.

133
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,536
I know it's a bit chilly
in there,

134
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:52,331
but I figured you'd like to stick around
and see the show.

135
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,790
How are we doing?

136
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:57,336
Ready.

137
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,712
Let's do it.

138
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,118
Incredible.

139
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,163
This suit has more power
than I ever dreamed.

140
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,125
Oh!

141
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,753
Are you all right, sir?

142
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:42,297
This takes
a little getting used to.

143
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,717
Once Project Deep Freeze is completed,
you won't need the suit.

144
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,469
Well, let's get that started.

145
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:48,804
Coming, Mr. Freeze?

146
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,847
I've done what you wanted.

147
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,016
Now leave me alone with my wife.

148
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,143
Suit yourself.

149
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,813
You can't let Walker do this.

150
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,940
Billions of people will perish.

151
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:01,775
That's not my concern.

152
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:04,820
All that matters is
I once again have my wife

153
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,571
and the means to restore her.

154
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,827
She'll wake up in a dead, frozen world
that you helped destroy.

155
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,161
She'll hate you for that.

156
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,496
Silence.

157
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,248
You think you're alone now?

158
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,999
Wait until she learns the truth.

159
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,669
I said silence!

160
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,140
Forgive me.

161
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,984
Come. There is much to do.

162
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,492
The cannon is operational, sir.

163
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,008
Excellent.

164
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:14,055
Ah! You've come to join us after all,
my friend.

165
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,352
Wait. What are you doing?

166
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,489
Stop him!

167
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:14,824
This is my dream.

168
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,284
My vision!

169
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:21,122
I cheated death to make it real,
and you won't stop me.

170
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:26,044
You may live forever, Grant Walker,
but your mad dream dies now.

171
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,265
What are you doing?
That's the main power core.

172
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,976
An overload will blow this city
out of the water.

173
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,185
Exactly.

174
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,772
No!

175
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,989
<i>Attention, all residents of Oceana.</i>

176
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,032
<i>Your city is doomed.</i>

177
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,411
<i>If you value your lives,
you will evacuate now.</i>

178
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,037
<i>That is all.</i>

179
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,797
- Mr. Walker!
- Get out of here. Now!

180
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,899
There's our ride.

181
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:33,320
- Let's go.
- I'm staying with Nora.

182
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,323
Don't be a fool.
This whole place is going under.

183
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,408
I won't lose her again.

184
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,328
There's nothing you can do for her.

185
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,621
Come with us.

186
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,750
I am the least of your worries.

187
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,088
Robin!

188
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,925
Take the boy and go.

189
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,140
Relax. You're going to be okay.

190
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,282
We're together again, my love.

191
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,074
Man...

192
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:03,243
If I spent any more time
in that immersion tank,

193
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:04,369
I'd be growing gills.

194
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:06,955
I'm just glad I was able to
get you back here in time.

195
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,289
Thanks.

196
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,256
For a while
I thought I'd wind up like Walker,

197
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,793
trapped in an ice cube forever.

198
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,337
What about Mr. Freeze?

199
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,880
You think he's gone for good?

200
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,048
I'm not sure.

201
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,760
But if Freeze's condition
has made him truly immortal,

202
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:23,763
<i>we may not have seen the last of him.</i>
