1
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,955
You really can't get good help
these days.

2
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:09,920
Phew!

3
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:20,181
I understand your help
is the very best money can buy.

4
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:22,850
You see, I'm the one who had you hired.

5
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,811
Then I owe you something special.

6
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:29,357
This particular assignment is one
from which I will derive

7
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:33,778
- exquisite pleasure, Miss...
- Call me Candice.

8
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:37,531
Call me Bane.

9
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,331
Come on, boss. Hit it again.

10
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,416
Again.

11
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,673
Come on, boss. No wonder Batman's
running rings around you.

12
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,642
Just can't get good help these days.

13
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,186
So I have heard.

14
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,730
Candice, when Jake here comes around,

15
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,482
tell him he's fired.

16
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,706
Now, let's do a little business,
Mr. Bane.

17
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:18,989
They'll never pin it on me, but that
little fiasco cost me an easy $10 mil.

18
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,784
You almost didn't get paid.

19
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,121
You're lucky these diamonds
didn't get nabbed in the smuggling bust.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,377
No, Mr. Thorne,

21
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:33,629
you're the lucky one.

22
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:41,512
I'm making my secretary
available to you.

23
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,807
She can provide any background
you might need on your target.

24
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:46,976
My needs have already been met.

25
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,691
I'm paying you to go after Batman,

26
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,317
not Killer Croc.

27
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:58,195
But the Batman will surely be
on the reptile's trail.

28
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,281
I will observe the bat in action

29
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:04,076
and when I understand how he thinks
and fights, I will break him.

30
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:07,997
Now, where do I find this Killer Croc?

31
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,782
Load the truck. We'll get the safe.

32
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,602
Batman.

33
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,474
No time for this.

34
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,708
Come on in, Batman. The water's fine.

35
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:26,302
He is mine to destroy, monster.

36
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,262
Over my dead body.

37
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,639
As you wish.

38
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,825
That's Croc.

39
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:00,878
Somebody's helping us out.

40
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,796
Somebody tough.

41
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,725
He could be a crime-fighter, you know?

42
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,853
Somebody trying to be like us,
trying to help us clean up Gotham.

43
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,898
What do you think, Batman? Do you...

44
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,316
What?

45
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,487
I think you're right
about one thing, Robin.

46
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,530
Whoever did this was tough.

47
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:31,200
This was done with bare hands.

48
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,474
- I didn't think you'd mind some company.

49
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,893
Visiting hours are over.

50
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,688
Hmm...

51
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,107
How do these traction things work?

52
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:06,777
When my bones heal,
I'll show you firsthand.

53
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,321
Okay, okay.

54
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,365
What do you want?

55
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,783
Who did this, Croc?

56
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,952
Why should I tell you?

57
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:19,164
If you wanna suffer in silence,
that's fine by me.

58
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,003
Ahhh!

59
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,462
Okay, okay.

60
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:27,423
He was huge.

61
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,341
He had these tubes in his head.

62
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:33,095
Pumped him up twice as big
right in front of my eyes.

63
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:38,350
And he had an accent.
South American or something.

64
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,644
See? That wasn't so hard.

65
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,355
You'll know hard, Bats,

66
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:47,901
once he sucks that juice into his brain
and snaps you in two.

67
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,695
Don't bet on it, Killer.

68
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,238
Later, gator.

69
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,211
You seem to have a ding
in your door, sir.

70
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,297
He trashed my car, Alfred.

71
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,592
Between a couple of guys,
that's real personal.

72
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,429
Nice to see you haven't lost your sense
of humor in the face of adversity.

73
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:19,558
Something Croc said reminded me of
a Cuban prison experiment I heard about.

74
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,853
Peña Duro Prison, for lifers only.

75
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:25,981
- Then we're looking for an escapee?
- That's right.

76
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:29,151
And there's only been
one escape in 25 years,

77
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,611
three years ago.

78
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:37,242
Computer, run background file
on Project Gilgamesh.

79
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:39,369
Gilgamesh. Named after the warrior?

80
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,038
The ultimate warrior.

81
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,000
<i>A chemical plan to create super soldiers
out of hardened prisoners.</i>

82
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,920
<i>It was abandoned when they got
more than they bargained for.</i>

83
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:51,423
<i>- And what was that, sir?
- They got Bane.</i>

84
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,683
After he escaped,

85
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,478
Bane went into business for himself
as a freelance assassin.

86
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,065
Price per job, $5 million.

87
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,399
So, the question is,

88
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,068
who wants to eliminate me?

89
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,862
That line is forming
around the block, sir.

90
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:15,906
Let me put it this way.

91
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,075
Who has $5 million to spend?

92
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,919
I have anticipated his every move.

93
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,173
Very soon now, I will allow you
the pleasure of drawing the mask

94
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,093
from Batman's decimated face.

95
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,555
With Batman out of the way,
Gotham could be yours.

96
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,056
So could I.

97
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,225
And what about your employer?

98
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,853
Well, accidents do happen.

99
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,938
See you tonight.

100
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,027
You're here late, Candice.

101
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:56,280
Just leaving, Rupe.

102
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,250
He's out there somewhere, Bane.

103
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,087
Yes. Probably closer than we think.

104
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,835
It is over

105
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,670
before it begins.

106
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:55,589
I think not.

107
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,214
You have courage for one so small.

108
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,591
You can yet be of use to me.

109
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,996
I'd like to speak to you
about your new boyfriend.

110
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,210
You've been stood up.

111
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,878
He knew you'd come.

112
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,714
He was obsessed with you in prison.

113
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,882
He's read everything about you.

114
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:24,052
He knows you better
than you know yourself.

115
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:26,888
Bet it's for you.

116
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,934
<i>I've been watching you, Batman.</i>

117
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:32,894
<i>Were I a common sniper,</i>

118
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,771
<i>you'd have never reached the phone.</i>

119
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,606
What do you want, Bane?

120
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:39,860
<i>Something more personal between foes.</i>

121
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,821
<i>What do you value most, Batman?</i>

122
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,614
<i>Perhaps I should say</i>

123
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:46,825
<i>whom do you value most?</i>

124
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:51,455
Robin.

125
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,037
I want his mask, Bane.

126
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,290
Patience. Soon you will have them both.

127
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,649
Been nice hanging with you.

128
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,337
Welcome to my arena, Batman.

129
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,425
Prepare to meet your master.

130
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,994
I will break you!

131
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,121
My legs. Get the weights.

132
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,250
Come here, sweetie.
I got something to discuss with you.

133
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:40,952
Toys. You try to fight me
with pathetic little toys.

134
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,553
You've got nothing.

135
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,679
Beg for mercy.

136
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,765
Scream my name!

137
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,516
Never.

138
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,394
You are beaten.

139
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:08,980
Now I will break you.

140
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:13,860
Huh?

141
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,073
No! No! The venom!

142
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,699
Can't stop it!

143
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:31,503
No! Help me!

144
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:39,761
You can't do this to me!

145
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:41,721
I am invincible!

146
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,224
I am Bane!

147
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,570
Let her go.

148
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,614
I know where she's headed.

149
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,707
Is this the best you can
throw at me, Rupert?

150
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,676
Go on, Candice, take his mask.

151
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,886
Thought you might like
to hear this, Rupert.

152
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,638
It's a new release.

153
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:27,559
Maybe we'll call it,
"Better Luck Next Time."

154
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,120
<i>With Batman out of the way,</i>

155
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,437
<i>Gotham could be yours.</i>

156
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,272
<i>So could I.</i>

157
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,733
<i>And what about your employer?</i>

158
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,318
<i>Well, accidents do happen.</i>

159
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:39,821
Candice!
