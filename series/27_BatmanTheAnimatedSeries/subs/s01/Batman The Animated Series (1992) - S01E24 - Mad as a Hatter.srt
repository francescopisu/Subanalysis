I had to come back when I heard
that cad abandoned you again.

How did you know? I didn't tell anyone.

I anticipated there'd be trouble sooner
or later, so I enlisted some help.

How I wonder what you're at.

207

Now, this is a game more to my liking.

208
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,666
Are you, the famous Batman,
so intent upon destroying my happiness

209
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:27,045
that you'll harm these poor,
mind-warped innocents to get me?

210

My control over my pawns
increases their strength. (LAUGHS)

Then all you've waited for is a puppet.
