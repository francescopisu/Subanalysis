179
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,738
I'd like to ask Mr. Daggett
about the rumors I've heard.

180
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,699
I hear he's selling Renuyu
through direct marketing

181
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:31,995
because stores won't carry it
due to its harmful side effects.

182
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,830
Well, that's, uh...

183
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,416
Absolutely untrue.

184
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:40,504
What about the addictive properties
of Renuyu, Mr. Daggett?

185
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,547
How, once you're hooked on it,

186
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:46,426
you can't stop using it
without horrible pain?

187
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,053
No. I mean...

188
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:49,763
That's just not so.

189
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,521
Why don't you show them
what an overdose can do, Daggett.

190
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,191

Why don't you tell them about me?
