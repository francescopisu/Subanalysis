Whoops! Coming through. Hot stuff.

I wouldn't take odds on this place

You gonna wreck something else?

If I didn't know better, I'd say
you wanted this place destroyed.

192
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:30,387
After spending 300 million to build it?
That's not good business, my friend.

193

I've seen the unpaid bills.

194
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,933
Building this casino has bankrupted you.

195
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,853
That's why you turned it
into a target for the Joker.

196

Once he destroys it,
you'll collect the insurance money.

you, the casino

and that strutting fool Kaiser
will all be blown sky-high.

Not bad, eh?

00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:12,322
You won't get Kaiser.
He's been playing you for a patsy.

Eh?

219
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,576
He's counting on you
to blow this place up

220
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,994
so he can collect the insurance.

By the time you get clear,

Kaiser will be miles away,
laughing at you.

I hate it when you make sense.

I'll settle my score
