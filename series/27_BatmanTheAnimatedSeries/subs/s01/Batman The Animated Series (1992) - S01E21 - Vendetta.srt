then became a pro-wrestler.

183
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,086
Two years later,
Croc had moved to Gotham City

184
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:04,504
and turned to crime.

185
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,715
He used to be strictly penny-ante.

186
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,592
Until now, I'd never heard of him.

187
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:11,636
But, according to this,
Bullock busted him

188
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,473
based on the testimony
from Conway and Joey the Snail.

189
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,308
Then Croc has escaped.

190
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,605
And now, it's payback time.

191
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,399
You have Conway and the Snail.

192
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,234
They can clear Detective Bullock.

193
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,571
True, but that won't get us Croc.

194
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,574
He won't return to his lair,
now that I know where it is.

195
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:35,452
I'll have to make him come to us.

199
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:13,532
- How did you...
- Escape? Simple.

200
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,202
The guards don't think about the sewers.

201
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,080
No one does, except me.

202
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,832
It was you who set me up
for Spider and Joey.

203
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,376
You got it.

204
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,672
I wanted you to sweat it out
in a cell for a while, like I did.

205
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,300
To know what it feels like,
the way I do.

I know everything now.

213
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:28,898
You planted that toothpick
on the dock, didn't you?

214
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:31,568
And you impersonated Bullock
at the jail.

215
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:36,990
KILLER CROC: Yeah,

216
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:40,327
and it would've gone down smooth
if you hadn't butted in.

217

But, hey, I'm adaptable.

218
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,873
When you grow up looking like I do,

219
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,417
you gotta learn to go with the flow.

220
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:50,003

Why'd you stick your neck out
like that to help me?

Because I thought you were guilty too

237

and I was wrong.

has been arrested?
