00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:33,640
If the vulture's here that means
the Penguin will be right on his tail.

184

Oh, great! It's him.

185
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,494
That's it. I'm calling 911.

186
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,834
It's dead.

187
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,175
So much for phone calls, huh, boss?

188
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,596
Then it's them or us.

189
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,556
Be careful with that egg, Roberta.

190
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,267
I bet we can find
something here to help us.

I don't think anyone's home.

Yeah, the place is locked up tight.

194
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:32,240
Stone walls do not a prison make
nor locked doors a barricade.

195
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,000
Gentlemen,
and I use the term loosely,

196
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:43,960
after you.

197
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:56,264
Okay, get ready for operation Fowl Play.

(EXCLAIMS)

199
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,313
How bourgeois.

200

Tearing this place apart
could only improve it.

These commoners
have such cheap furniture.

210
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,649
Come on, Batman, snap out of it.

211
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:50,569
If that didn't wake him,
I don't know what will.

Charge! Now, Roberta!

213
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,123
Nice shot.

214
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,543
Be careful, Roberta,
you don't wanna get too close.

How ineffective.

Ah. (CHUCKLES)

226
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,101

would you?

Now, where was I?

Right, Frank.
