Only clue I have is this soil analysis
from their tire tracks.

179
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,077
Hmm.

180
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:16,123
Contains the same compounds
you'd find in a toxic waste dump.

181
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,918
Then may I suggest an accessory
this evening?

182
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,177

- Where are you?
- With a friend.

191
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,785

to let you know I'm okay.

193

Oops. Gotta go.
I'll talk to you soon.

194
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,626
Sooner than you think.

195
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,088

- Wrong number.

Look who's come a-courting.

202
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,643
Looks like he's got us.

203
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,020

- Yes!
- Yes!

208
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,835
POISON IVY: Here we have
the typical male aggressor,

209
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,381
fittingly imprisoned within the bonds
of female domestic slavery.

210

HARLEY: And, frankly, folks,
he's never looked better.

211
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,266
Admit it, darling,

212
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,062
you didn't think two women
were capable of bringing you down.

213
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,274
Man or woman,
a sick mind is capable of anything.

214
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,778
A very enlightened statement, Batman.

215
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,405
We'll carve it on your headstone.

216
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,492
HARLEY: Aloha, sucker.

217
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,749

Pudding?

220
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,558
You were out, so we just made
ourselves at home.

221
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:41,226
Hope you don't mind.

222
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,478
You found me!

223
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:45,313
So much for self-esteem.

224
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,612
I hope you realize
we're on a toxic waste dump.

225
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:56,616
I'd say you've got 10 minutes
to clear out before the fumes do you in.

She's right, boss.
