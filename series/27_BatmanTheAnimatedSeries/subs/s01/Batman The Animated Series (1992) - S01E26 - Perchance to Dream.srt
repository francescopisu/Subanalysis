It's an odd favor.

53

00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,411
Why do you think that?

186
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,497
I suspected it from the start.

187
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:41,541
I knew I was right
when I tried to read the newspaper.

188
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,710
The print didn't make sense.

189
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:45,295
Yes?

190
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,924
That's because reading is a function
of the right side of the brain

191
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:51,343
while dreams come from the left side.

192
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,179
It's impossible to read something
in a dream.

193
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,097
Granting that's true,

194
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,807
how is it my fault?

195
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,392
I can't explain it.

196
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:01,436
But you're the key to this.

197
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,063
I knew you'd be here.

198
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,482
This tower is part of my nightly patrol.

199
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:08,151
Now tell me what's going on.

200
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,281
<i>We know you're up there, Mr. Wayne.</i>

201
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,367
<i>We don't want to hurt you.</i>

202
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,452
<i>We just want to talk.</i>

203
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,666
(BOTH GRUNTING)

204
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,535
The Mad Hatter?

205
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,663
Congratulations are in order,

206
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,915
I suppose. And you're right.

207
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,333
This is a dream,

208
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,294
a very special dream.

209
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,754
Then you know everything about me.

210
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,840
I do. (CHUCKLING)

211
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:14,134
But I'm only part of your dream.

212
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:19,055
The mind-control apparatus
reveals nothing to the real world.

213
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:22,767
Its purpose is
to create an ideal world for you.

214
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,812
Then you're not the real Mad Hatter.

215
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,230
No.

216
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,649
Just a figment of your imagination.

217
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,777
But that doesn't mean I'm not real

218
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,863
in this dream world.

219
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,116
Make it stop. Bring me back.

220
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,204
I'm crushed.

221
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,041
You don't like the fantasy world
I've created for you?

222
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:47,459
It's not real.

223
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:54,132
Ah. Are you the dreamer
or merely part of someone's dream?

224
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,135
(LAUGHING) That was just the question

225
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,471
Tweedledee put to Alice
in <i>Through the Looking...</i>

226
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:01,890
This isn't some silly storybook!

227
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,225
Ah, but it is.

228
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,227
It's a beautiful story.

229
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,813
You have love, wealth, a family.

230
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,857
All you ever wanted.

231
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:13,943
Your own private Wonderland.

232
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,738
No!

233
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,490
I won't live a lie.

234
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,076
No matter how attractive you make it.

235
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,079
It's a moot point, my friend.

236
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,539
There's no way out of this.

237
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,709
Tell me how to wake up, or I'll...

238
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,587
Ha! You can't hurt a dream,
my good fellow.

239
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,881
And you can't wake up.

240
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,133
Stop fighting it.

241
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:42,430
You see?

242
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,849
In a moment, the police will be here.

243
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,478
Do you want to spend the rest
of your dream life in Arkham?

244
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,230
(THUDDING)

245
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:52,607
Open up, Mr. Wayne.

246
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,286
You're wrong.

247
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,663
There is a way out.

248
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,748
(STUTTERING) Now, wait just a minute.

249
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,084
You don't want to do anything foolish.

250
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,919
(THUDDING CONTINUES)

251
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,380
This isn't an ordinary dream.

252
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,549
What if you're wrong?

253
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:21,177
Then I'll see you in your nightmares.

254
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:27,767
Mr. Wayne, no!

255
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,234
(GASPING)

256
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,736
(MACHINERY BUZZING)

257
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:41,781
(GROANING)

258
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,742
No! You can't!

259
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,870
(GRUNTS)

260
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,748
(GRUNTS)

261
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,879
It's impossible!

262
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:59,507
No one's will is strong enough
to escape my dream machine!

263
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,468
Why?

264
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,179
Why did you do it?

265
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,723
You, of all people,

266
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:09,642
have the gall to ask me that?

267
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,812
You ruined my life!

268
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,692
I was willing to give you
whatever life you wanted

269
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:20,904
just to keep you out of mine.

270
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,332
Something for the lab boys to play with.

271
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:33,750
Any idea what it is?

272
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,251
Yes.

273
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,755
The stuff that dreams are made of.

274
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,936
