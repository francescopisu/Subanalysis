CROCKER: No. None of your business.

BATMAN: Somebody is trying
to run the people

200
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,895
in this neighborhood out of their homes.

201
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,800
Your boss, Daggett,
wouldn't know anything about this,

202
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:32,884
would he?

203

207
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,395

you gave up the arson-for-hire game.

(STAMMERING) I did. I'm clean.

That's it. That's right. You got it.

Don't tell Daggett I talked.

As businessmen,
the choice we face is clear.

It's time we decide where we stand.

231

Are we for progress or against it?

232
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:04,517
For the future or for the past?

233
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,020

Any comments on this tragedy?

MAN: Does this affect your plans
for redevelopment, Mr. Daggett?

242
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,128
It's a sad fact,

243
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:17,215
but you have to expect
violence in Crime Alley.

244
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:20,468
These people don't value
human life like we do.

like you do, Daggett.

were a few condemned buildings.

was the cause of this tragedy.

have been caught.

I believe your duty is clear.

Excuse me.

And besides,
you have an appointment to keep.

This used to be a beautiful street.
