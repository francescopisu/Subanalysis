None. And I've scoured the entire city.

00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:58,260
No one has seen either Robin
or Dick Grayson for two days.

10
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:02,306
I really should remain
upstairs then, sir.

11
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,516
Lest he call.

12
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,603
Oh, by the way, this came for you
an hour ago by messenger.

13
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,960
No. It can't be.

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,054

00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,932

Who are you? How did you get in here?

17
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,402
You must forgive Ubu, detective.
He is well-trained.

18
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,574
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am he who is called Ra's al Ghul.

19
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,910
The Demon's Head.
I thought you were only a legend.

20
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,371
I am quite real.

21
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,999
And as I am sure you realize by now,

22
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,253
my reputation for resourcefulness
is well-deserved.

23
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,589
As you can see,
we have a common problem.

24
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:20,259
Your ward was abducted
on the same night as my daughter.

25
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,304
You do remember my daughter?

26
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,806
- You're Talia's father?
- Yes.

27
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,728
But surely you would not expect her
to mention me by name. (COUGHS)

28
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,858
Keep your distance! I am merely old.

29
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,319
Older, perhaps, than you can imagine.

30
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,572
But not so old that I cannot
assist you in your search.

Obviously, Batman's activities
require certain costly implements.

47
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,226
It was a simple matter for my people
to learn which wealthy Americans

48
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,687
were amassing what Batman might require.

49
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,941

description of you was Bruce Wayne.

that those we seek are to be found here?

I make it my business to know
things like that. Here.

Does your money solve this problem? No.

77

It will take more than wealth,
it will take power.

that I planned your ward's capture?

134
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,663
Almost from the beginning.

135
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,916
How could you have known
that Robin and your daughter

136
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:42,751
were abducted on the same night?

137
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,045
Unless I had done the abducting?

138
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,671
Exactly.

139
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:49,591
And do you think I'd have let you
take me anywhere in your plane

140
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:51,634
unless I suspected
you meant to lead me somewhere?

For one thing, there were

That someone had to be you.

Then there was Ubu.

but the pit is what keeps him alive.
What has kept him alive for 600 years.

- Please, you must believe me!
