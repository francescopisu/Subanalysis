00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,084
There was no sign
of forced entry here, you know.

178
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,629
So I'm figuring somebody must have
unlocked the cages,

179
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,506
and looked the other way.

180
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,216
I've been checking you out, Hamner.

181
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,928
Seems last week, your bank account
suddenly got bigger by a few grand.

182
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,262
So, what's the story?

183
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:53,100
I want the truth before I decide to
feed you to your furry friends here.

184
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,560
All right, all right. You got it.

185
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,272
The guy tells me to open the locks.
Next morning, the wolves are gone.

186
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,400
- What guy?
- I don't know.

187
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,319
I never saw him, he calls me.
Pays me off by courier.

188
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,238
For all I know, he could be you.

189
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:08,407
You got that wrong, pally.

190
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,742

You fool!

193
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,505
There's no telling
what the werewolf might do.

194

Go, Anth...

199
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,954
Anthony, what... What are you doing?

Stay down!

Guess not.

218

down here.
