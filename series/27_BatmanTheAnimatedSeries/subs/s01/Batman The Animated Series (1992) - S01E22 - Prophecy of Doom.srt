I got your message.

I'd have been here sooner,
but I've been trying to locate Lisa.

192
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,659
She didn't come home last night.

193
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,745
The inner voice assures me she is fine.

194
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,164

198

that the Brotherhood's fund
is in jeopardy.

What do you mean?

200
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:13,180
We must convert it
into gold bullion at once.

201
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,765
I've prepared the papers
for your signature.

202
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:21,438
But, Nostromos, I can't possibly sign
until I've notified the brothers.

203
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,939
There's no time!

204
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,025
But, they must be informed.

205
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,776
It's our obligation.

I don't understand.
