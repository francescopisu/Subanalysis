WOMAN: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for magic.</i>

4
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,461
Good evening, Gotham. I'm Zatanna.

5
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:41,142
Tonight, I can promise you
a few surprises.

6
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,789
- A thrill or two along the way.

7
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:48,232
And with luck, a happy ending.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

9
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,240
How long has it been? Ten years, 12?

10
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,659
All that and another lifetime.

11
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:01,162
ALFRED: She and her father
were very fond of you.

12
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:03,456
I was a different person then.

13
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,584
Yes. Intense, driven, moody.

14
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,628
She'd never recognize you now.

15
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:13,841
Now open your heart to magic,
and become a child again.

16
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:26,312
ZATARA: Remember,
concentration and control.

17
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:30,107
Focus on them,
and you can master any escape.

18
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:35,696
Go.

19
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,698
(STRAINING)

20
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,634
Congratulations. You've beaten
your old time by six seconds.

21
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:57,885
Yes!

22
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:00,638
You've got the makings
of a great magician.

23
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,599
I'm sorry you're going to be moving on.

24
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,852
Same here. It was an honor
to study with you, Zatara.

25
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,521
But to what end?

26
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,190
Three months ago you appeared
on my doorstep

27
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,484
with no interest in performing,

28
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,570
and yet dying to become
an escape artist.

29
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,239
(CHUCKLES)

30
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,118
And for some reason,
I wound up teaching you secrets

31
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,787
I'd never shown another magician.

32
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,539
BRUCE: You could've sent me away.

33
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,918
ZATARA: No. There was something
inside you I had no right to deny.

34
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,380
Something deep and painful.

35
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,592
After all, I would be foolish to assume
I was the only one with secrets.

36
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,636
Eh, John Smith?

37
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,222
Thanks for everything, sir.

38
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,182
I'll miss you, John.

39
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,477
And so, I trust, will Zatanna.

40
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,646
Oh! Hi, Daddy.

41
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,069
Good night, children.

42
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,245
I thought you'd be finishing
the tour with us.

43
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,207
I'm leaving for Japan tomorrow.
There's still a lot I have to learn.

44
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,961
Boy, that's you.
One big serious schoolboy.

45
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:17,047
No time in your life for fun or magic.

46
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,759
Here, pick a card.
I'll tell your future.

47
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:25,347
Hmm. I see emotion, intensity...

48
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,932
Two of hearts.

49
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,894
BRUCE: Joker.

50
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:32,354
Oh, it's a dumb trick anyway.

51
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,148
BRUCE: Look, I don't know the future,

52
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,859
but I know I'll see you again
someday, Zanna.

53
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,944
You're the only one who
ever calls me Zanna.

54
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,696
I really hate it.

55
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,366
No goodbye hug?

56
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,078
See? It's not so bad.

57
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,165
- I'll write you.
- No, you won't.

58
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,459
- I promise.
- You can't.

59
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,836
I locked your hands
to the wall. (GIGGLES)

60
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,505

00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,009
Looks like someone's missing
their plane tomorrow.

62
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,428
But hey,
if you were any kind of escape artist

63
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:06,931
you'd be out of those cuffs
and through the door by now.

Thank you. You know, I have this
little problem with money.

Seems like it disappears
before I even make it.

69
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,121
And here to help me demonstrate
are Mr. Irving Fauncewater,

director of the Gotham Mint,
and noted magic debunker

71

- Oh!

00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:48,138
Let me guess, first time on stage, Irv?
Nothing like enthusiasm, right, folks?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

78
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,267
The way they're responding,
one would think

79
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,644
your ridiculous stunt was going to work.

80
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,482
Just to clue you in, Monty here makes
a living exposing magicians' secrets.

81
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,901
Simple tricks and nonsense.

82
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,278
ZATANNA: Uh-huh.

83
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,863
And I've invited him here

84
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,074
to find the secret of the feat
I'm attempting tonight.

85
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:11,871
There is no secret. What you're
proposing is flat-out impossible.

86
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,499
Well, kids,
impossible is what I'm all about.

87
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,211
Mr. Fauncewater, open the doors, please.

88

Bravo, my dear.

It was a pleasure to be proven wrong.

00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:02,963
Thank you, Monty.

99
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:07,968
And now, just so Irv doesn't have a fit,
I'll bring it back good as new.

Arba decarba!

102
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,773
"Where's the money," he says.

103
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,442
It's right there, isn't it?

104
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,445
It's gone! What have you done with it?

105
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,616
Now, take it easy, Irv. I'm sure there's
a perfectly logical explanation.

106
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:33,202
And I'm sure the audience
would like to hear it.

107
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,955
- As would the police.
- Now, wait a minute.

Look, it's a trick, an illusion.
I don't know what went wrong,

but if we can all just
calm down for a second...

"Anything you say can and will
be used against you."

This never happens to me in Vegas.

115
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,866
BRUCE: She's been set up.

116
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:17,955
Obviously, but as she's the only
suspect, the police must hold her.

117
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:22,084
Giving the real thief time to escape.
I can't let that happen.

118
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,629
And more important,
you can't desert an old friend.

- Thanks.

You know, I didn't love the idea of
spending the night in jail,

124
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:56,076
but this does technically
make me a fugitive.

125

I believe I'm looking
at some prison time now.

126
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,415
I heard about the mint robbery.
I can help prove you didn't do it.

127
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,168
Why do you care about some
leggy dame in nylons?

No, no. I'm sorry. I'm having a bad day.

131
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,811
I'm sure whoever framed you
knew how your trick was done.

132
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,688
They may have left a clue at the mint.

- Just relax.

scraped into the floor.

137
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,859
Whatever made it
left shards of glass, too.

138
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,487
That would have been
one mighty big piece of glass.

139
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,240
(GASPS) Or mirror.

140
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,618
Like the one you used to reflect
the hologram of the vanished mint.

141
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,204
Oh, sure,
take all the mystery out of life.

142
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,626
I think the money was stolen
before you got here.

143
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,965
The thief reflected a hologram
of the cash while you did your trick,

144
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,759
then quickly hid
the mirror when it was over.

145
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:38,345
How'd he get rid of a mirror that big?

146
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,933
He didn't. It's still here.

ZATANNA: Only another magician
would have known how to rig that trick.

151
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,834
Or someone who knows their methods.
Like Montague Kane.

152
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,920
He's been ripping off
illusionists for years.

153
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:16,425
I thought I finally had a trick
even he couldn't expose. Wrong.

154
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,135
I'll settle with Kane.

155
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,679
Meantime, I'd better
drop you someplace safe.

156
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:25,434
Oh, no. Kane played me for a sap,
and I'll see him go down for it.

157
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,853
All right, but it could be dangerous.

158
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,064
You're sure there's no one
you want to call first?

Uh, friends, family, a husband, maybe?

160
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,070
Me? Who's got time for a relationship

161
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,698
when you're pulling rabbits
out of a hat 52 weeks a year?

162
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:44,828
Besides, someone's got to keep
the old act going now that Dad's gone.

163
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,957
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

164
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,295
I saw him perform when I was younger.
He was great.

Thanks. You know, I have
the weirdest feeling we've met before.

Come in, and join me by the fire.

Come, come. Don't be shy.

00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,020
You've obviously unraveled
my little scheme

00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,482
and I would congratulate you
face-to-face.

172

You're not going to have a face
when I'm done with you.

Now, you slimy... (GASPS)

174
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,825
It's a trap!

183
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:08,764
This way.

184
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:30,035
I always did know how to make an exit.

185
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,746
Unfortunately, so did Kane.

KANE: Take a last longing look,
gentlemen.

191
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,193
We're heading to a place
where the climate is warmer,

192
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:04,694
the people are friendlier

193
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,615
and the extradition laws
are nonexistent.

194
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,618
BATMAN: The only place
you're heading is to a prison cell.

195

Well done, Batman.

196
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:17,374
You not only eluded my trap,
but solved my clue as well.

197
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,917
Get rid of him.

Ta-da!

00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,393
Oh, Monty. You fell for
the second-oldest trick in the book.

201
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,395
And here's the first.

You are most engaging, my dear.

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,547
Beautiful, impetuous.

210
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:10,594
I could be persuaded to spare you,
if properly implored.

Bring them both!

With all reverence for the departed,

215
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,827
Zatara himself
couldn't escape those locks.

216
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,249
Still, between the two of you, you might
be able to loosen a few chains

217
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,293
before you hit the water.

218
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,717
(WHISPERS) Take my hand.

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,929
Scared? That makes two of us.

- Trust me, Zanna.
- "Zanna"?

BATMAN: Quick, in my glove.

222
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,239
Farewell, my dear Zatanna.

223
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,450

does the same trick twice.

I meant to. Really.

Hey, it's okay.
I can see you've been busy.

245

- Just answer an old friend one question.
- Shoot.

246
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,927
What happened that made you put this on?

247
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,138
A painful memory.

248
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,056
And a promise.

249
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,559
I'd say you're keeping
that promise pretty well.

250
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:13,646
And for what it's worth,
Dad would've been proud of you tonight.

You, too.
