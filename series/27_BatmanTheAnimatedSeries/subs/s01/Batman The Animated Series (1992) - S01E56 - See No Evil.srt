181
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,217
Kimberly.

182
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:29,678
Kimberly.

183
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:31,596
Kimberly!

184
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,265
Kimmy!

185

(CRYING)

186
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,120
I thought Mojo was just
her imaginary friend.

187
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,371
I never thought...

188
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,581
What's that?

189
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,083
A tranquilizer dart.

190
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,085
How long ago did you see your daughter?

191
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,546
Five minutes ago.
I put her to bed and...

192
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,089
Batman?

193
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,768
LLOYD: Here we are.

194

(GASPS)

195
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:24,232
- You want me to get in your car?
- Now, Kimmy...

196
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:26,860
But it'll look
like the car's going by itself.

197
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,570
Won't we get in trouble?

198
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,822
No, Kimberly, we won't.

199
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,407
I don't know.

200
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,493
(SIGHS) I'll tell you what,

201
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:37,287
maybe if I let you see me,
you'll feel better.

202
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,458
Hi, Kimberly.

203
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,376
(GASPS) You're a man?

204
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,962
I gotta go, Mojo.

205
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,839
I'm not supposed to be with strangers.

206
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,758
Mommy told me. (GASPS)

207
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,427
But I'm not a stranger, Kimberly.

208
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:53,887
I'm your daddy.

209
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,014
My daddy? Get away!

210
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,099
Mommy says you're not allowed
to come near me.

211
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,768
She says you're a bad man.

212
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,645
She says that's why they locked you up.

213
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,979
Never mind that!

214
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:05,524
You're coming with me,
whether you want to or not.

215
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,400
BATMAN: Not in this lifetime, pal.

216
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,614
(GRUNTS)

217
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,953
Mommy, Mommy!

218
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,944
Mommy, Mommy!

219
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,028
Kimberly?

(TIRES SCREECHING)

221
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:32,819
I didn't know he could fly, too.

222
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,870
(HORN HONKING)

223
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,809
Give it up, Ventrix.

224
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,437
The suit is toxic. It'll destroy you!

225
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:09,773
Don't hand me that.
I'm not feeling any pain.

226
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,941
At least, not like you're gonna feel.

227
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,057
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING)

228
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:05,995
Argh!

(GROANING)

230
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:15,171
(GRUNTING)

231
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,096
Ventrix, the suit,

232
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,431
it's poison!

233
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,057
LLOYD: So, what if it is?

234
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,726
I don't care.

235
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:31,855
As long as I have it,

236
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:35,400
I can take my daughter back,
whenever I want!

237
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,154
Her mother won't be able to stop me,

238
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,822
and neither will you!

239
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,502
No!

240
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,463
Peekaboo.

241
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:58,131
Ow!

(LLOYD GRUNTING)

243
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:04,763
Oh!

244
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:12,353
Get ready for your biggest
disappearing act, Ventrix.

245
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,398
The one where no one sees you
for 10 to 20.

246
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,475
KIMMY: Me and Mommy are moving.

247
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,465
And even if Daddy gets out
of jail this time,

248
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,782
he'll never find us.

249
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,493
Kimberly? Who are you talking to now?

250
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,161
Just Batman, Mommy.

251
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,122
Oh. Him, again?

252
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,500
But he really was here, Mommy.

253
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,210
I know, honey.

254
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,336
I know.
