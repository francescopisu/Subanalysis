What has my sweet little flytrap
caught this time?

183
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,478

(GROANING) Harvey Dent.

188
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,127
Oh, the poor District Attorney.

189
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,880
I hear he's not expected to live.

Oh, please, call me Poison Ivy.

195
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,856
You see,
Harvey had to pay for his crime.

196
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,691
What crime?

197
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,402
Why, murder, of course.

for that silly penitentiary of his.

200
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:19,538
This little rose would be extinct today,
if I hadn't saved my precious

201
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,831
from those horrible bulldozers.

202
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,211

are on his hands.

Hmm.

206
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,137
So his fate was sealed...

207
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,227
With a kiss.

208
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,271
