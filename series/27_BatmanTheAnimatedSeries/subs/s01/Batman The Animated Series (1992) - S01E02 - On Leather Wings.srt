<i>Common brown bats.</i>

179
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,876
They shouldn't pose a problem.

180
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:57,804
As the weather gets colder,
they'll move on.

181
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,504
<i>What about the sound on the tape?</i>

182
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,131
It's actually two sounds.

183
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,716
Starlings and brown bats.

184
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,093
Probably fighting over
a nest in your chimney.

185
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:06,636
Appreciate the help, Doc.

186
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:09,389
I'll return the favor
next time you're raising funds.

187
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:10,682
Bye-bye.

188
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:12,476
This computer checked that fiber

189
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,853
against every animal species
known to man.

190
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,657
I went to them because I thought
they might know something we didn't.

191
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,109
That hair wasn't a brown bat's.

192
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:24,071
And those melodic sounds?

193
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,324
Computer, check against combined sounds.

194
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:29,326
Starlings and brown bats.

195
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,372
<i>Negative.</i>

196
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,374
<i>Sounds not originated
by either species.</i>

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,085
I would say, sir,

198
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,879
that we have ourselves an incongruity.

199
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,464
Incongruity, Alfred?

200
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,132
He's lying.

201
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,134
And I'm gonna find out why.

202
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,284
(SCREECHING)

203
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,419
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

204
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:23,463
MAN: Can't fight it.
It's got me.

205
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,678
(CHOKES)

206
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,475
(COUGHS)

207
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,871
Who's back there?

208
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:59,541
You!
I'm looking for Dr. March.

209
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,543
He's not here, Batman.

210
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:05,213
Where is he?

211
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,757
Giving a lecture
on human extinction

212
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,176
and bat evolution.

213
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,261
He's really quite brilliant.

214
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,513
He's misguided and a thief.

215
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,348
He's just a theorist.

216
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,267
He was afraid
to put it to the test.

217
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,019
But I wasn't.

218
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,229
I knew we'd discovered a formula

219
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,106
to create a totally new species.

220
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,941
Neither man nor bat.

221
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,860
And once I started taking it,

222
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,111
I couldn't stop.

223
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:29,863
I desperately wanted to.

224
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,240
But it took over.

225
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,118
Francine and March
tried to protect me,

226
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,953
but it was too late.

227
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,540
The beast knew what chemicals
were needed to bring itself about.

228
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,501
It was out of my control.

229
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,962
And it only needs one more component

230
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,089
to complete the process.

231
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,509
It's in me,

232
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,010
Batman.

233
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,429
(LAUGHS)

234
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,124
(ROARS)

235
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,730
FRANCINE: Kirk!

236
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,400
(GASPS)

237
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,395
I'm getting something strange.

238
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:27,230
Oh, not again!

239
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,566
I'm serious.
It's right below us.

240
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,111
(GRUNTS) Whoa!

241
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,322
Gotham Command, we need choppers.

242
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:37,115
We've sighted the Batman.

243
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,427
- Let's go!
- I can't do it, sir.

244
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,122
What do you mean you can't do it?

245
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:02,015
I just got word not to let you up
without the Commissioner.

246
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,601
- Who told you that?
- The Commissioner.

247
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,478
GORDON: Get out, Detective!

248
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,481
The Mayor may not let me fire you,

249
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,941
but I am not taking the heat
for your fiascoes.

250
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,903
This is my case, Commissioner!
You heard the Mayor!

251
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,155
Then why don't you go
take it up with him?

252
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,573
I've got a job to do.

253
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:20,909
If you want to tag along,
fine!

254
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:24,913
Take her up, Lieutenant.

255
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:27,916
Hey, wait for me!

256
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:17,340
- There he is.
- GORDON: There they are.

257
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,009
What is that thing?

258
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,720
That thing is what we're after.

259
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,638
Holy...

260
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,215
Two for dinner, sir?

261
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:02,385
I got a list of all the items
stolen from the chemical labs.

262
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:06,014
Who would have thought
they'd be used to create a monster?

263
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,560
Maybe I can undo the fate
Langstrom has brought upon himself.

264
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,733
ALFRED: Does it appear feasible, sir?

265
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:18,735
I think so.

266
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,334
Is he all right?

267
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,547
- Will he change again?
- No.

268
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:41,508
The formula's out of his system.

269
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:43,384
It's over...

270
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:44,886
for now.

271
00:21:58,274 --> 00:22:00,401
