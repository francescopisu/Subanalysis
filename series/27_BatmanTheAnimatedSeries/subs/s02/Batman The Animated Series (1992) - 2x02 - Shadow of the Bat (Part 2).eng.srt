1
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,655
James Gordon, I have a warrant
for your arrest.

2
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,782
<i>Previously on</i> Batman...

3
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:17,577
The rally's tomorrow night.
Everything's in place.

4
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:19,328
You know what to do.

5
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,082
I'm going to see Jim Gordon gets
all the public support we can muster.

6
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:26,085
All the top cops will be there,
so don't worry your pretty little head.

7
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:27,712
Should be quite a show.

8
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:31,757
Yes, and I know someone who'd be
a real showstopper.

9
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,719
The best thing you can do for him
is to keep out of it.

10
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:40,182
Sorry, Batman. You being at the rally
could decide if Dad goes free.

11
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,352
<i>So you'll be there, one way or another.</i>

12
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:47,231
After all Commissioner Gordon
has done for Gotham City,

13
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,901
<i>the least the city can do for him
is grant him bail.</i>

14
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,032
Gil, you know those guys
who shot at you?

15
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:57,675
Well, I think I know who one of them...

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,870
I didn't know you had company.

17
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,747
My friend here was just leaving.

18
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,335
Yeah, gotta run. Listen, I'll see you
at the business meeting, Gil.

19
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,628
Miss.

20
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:09,962
Look at that.

21
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,759
<i>Mr. Mason ducked before he saw the guns.</i>

22
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:16,719
Almost as though he expected it.

23
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,388
What am I gonna do?

24
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,516
If Gil's involved in this,
there's nobody I can trust.

25
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,419
- Where will you start?
- With Gil Mason.

26
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,713
The videotape clearly shows
that he ducked

27
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,590
before those shots were fired.

28
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,594
If he knew he was gonna be shot at,

29
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,305
he probably knows a lot more
about what's going on.

30
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,057
Then he may know more
than he's letting on

31
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,060
about Commissioner Gordon's
unfortunate situation.

32
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,353
I hope so, Alfred.

33
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:10,731
'Cause if this lead fizzles,
I'm fresh out of ideas.

34
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,329
Stop!

35
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:11,333
You again?

36
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,961
Listen, under other circumstances,
this could be fun,

37
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:15,588
but I've got a job to do.

38
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,506
Don't flatter yourself.

39
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,885
Well, I don't have time
to babysit amateurs, okay?

40
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,596
I may not have a diploma
from crime-fighting school,

41
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,598
but I can do fine on my own, thanks.

42
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:30,102
- What are you doing here anyway?
- Same as you. We both suspect Mason of...

43
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,241
Mason here.

44
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,495
You wanna meet? Okay, where?

45
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,288
What's he saying?

46
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,040
Dork.

47
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:57,838
South Gotham subway,
the old river entrance. In one hour.

48
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,176
Right. I'm on my way.

49
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,141
Well, show's over.

50
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,352
You can run along home now.

51
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,400
- Okay.
- Okay?

52
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,237
If you won't let me help you,
what else can I do?

53
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,906
Good. You've got some sense after all.

54
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,912
Nice guy,
but a few bats short of a belfry.

55
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,386
Whoa!

56
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,474
Gotta work on that landing, girl.

57
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,685
I guess the party started without me.

58
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,898
You sure you haven't seen him
at the department?

59
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,079
I'd remember that face.

60
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:55,831
Who is he?

61
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:58,584
In a few minutes,
nobody's gonna care.

62
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:05,799
- Okay, you're done.
- So that's it?

63
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,720
You bring me all the way to South Gotham
to ID some two-bit hood?

64
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:11,764
Don't get wise with me, Mason.

65
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:14,600
Remember who got you set up
as Gordon's assistant.

66
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:16,435
Right, Harvey, right.

67
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,774
Don't call me that!
It's Two-Face to you, pretty boy.

68
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:25,945
Okay, okay. Two-Face, take it easy.
You're the man.

69
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:29,365
Don't you forget it.
Since our little stunt at the rally,

70
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:32,284
I got this city thinking
you're the best thing since the Batman.

71
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:35,829
Once Gordon's out of the picture...

72
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,833
You'll be a shoo-in to take his place.

73
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,921
In fact, they could be calling you
Commissioner by tomorrow.

74
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,381
Tomorrow?

75
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,064
I'm stepping up the timetable.

76
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:52,179
Too many people nosing around.
This guy, that Batgirl chippy.

77
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,431
I'm not taking any chances.

78
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,892
My men will bust Gordon
out of jail tonight.

79
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,228
Then we'll dump him off Bayshore Wharf.

80
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,439
- Hey!
- What's that?

81
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,066
Hey, did you hear something?

82
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,987
We got company. Over there.

83
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,784
Robin, look out!

84
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,328
Robin?

85
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,301
If he's Robin, that makes you...

86
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,777
Let's go!

87
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,288
Blow it!

88
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,975
Just whose side are you on?

89
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,145
You're right. If I hadn't let him
take me by surprise...

90
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:26,356
Robin! I see you brought a date.

91
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,359
Me? I thought she was with you.

92
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,279
She's got your taste in clothes,
speaking of which...

93
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,200
Yes. Am I glad to see you.

94
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,951
Do you mind?

95
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,037
Sorry.

96
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,458
Well, this is just great. Now Batman
and Robin know what's going on.

97
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,752
The bat-chick too. I saw her.

98
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,547
The explosion probably
took care of them. But just in case...

99
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,481
I don't know who you are
or why you're doing this,

100
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,191
but let's get one thing straight.

101
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:12,444
It takes more than a costume
and an attitude to do this work.

102
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,655
Look, I've got a reason
for being here so...

103
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:16,198
You've already fouled up once.

104
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,368
Stay out of our way
so it doesn't happen again.

105
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,755
I should've known it would be Two-Face.
It's a perfect two-part plan.

106
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,925
He consolidates the gangs
while Mason takes over the police.

107
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:37,469
What he said about the Commissioner,
will he...

108
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,096
You saw him flip his coin.

109
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:42,516
It's judge, jury, and executioner.

110
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,524
And here we sit with no way to...

111
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:51,692
Huh?

112
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,026
Sounds like a train.

113
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:04,538
Argh!

114
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:08,542
Hold on.

115
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,803
Not bad. Maybe there's hope
for you after all.

116
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,909
Hurry, Batman!

117
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,086
Great. Only how do we get to it?

118
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,881
Always carry a spare.

119
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,889
You first. Press here to send
it back down to us.

120
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:04,973
Wait.

121
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,645
Just in case
you run into trouble up there.

122
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,896
Thanks.

123
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,045
No!

124
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:48,058
If I ever get reinstated, Bullock,

125
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,227
remind me to do something
about the food in here.

126
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:54,690
Relax, Commish. We got the judge
to reconsider bail, didn't we?

127
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,236
You gonna eat that pickle?

128
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,803
- What in...
- Come on, Commissioner.

129
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:27,639
Rupert Thorne doesn't
desert his friends.

130
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,683
Thorne...

131
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,110
Get some keys down here!
Never a blasted cop when you need one.

132
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,517
Think she made it?

133
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,229
I hope so.

134
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,231
Think we'll make it?

135
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,445
What do you think about the
commissioner's innocence now, Detective?

136
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,615
- I don't know.
- Come on, he has to be guilty.

137
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,510
- Have you heard from Gordon?
- Any leads about his whereabouts?

138
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:30,911
You think he's left town?

139
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:37,417
- Get out of my face, all of you.
- Detective. Detective.

140
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:39,836
I can barely hear you, miss!

141
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,964
The phone lines
must've been damaged by the explosion.

142
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,550
Speak up!

143
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:49,012
I said Commissioner Gordon's in danger.

144
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:50,847
I still can't hear you.

145
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,142
If you want the story
on Gordon's breakout, come down here.

146
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,395
Breakout?

147
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,438
They've got him.

148
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,410
I've got an idea.

149
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,246
It's about time.

150
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,110
- Where are we going?
- We'll find out when we get there.

151
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,337
Subways are getting
more dangerous every day.

152
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,434
You think they got
the Commissioner by now?

153
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,634
Most likely. We've got to
get to Bayshore Wharf.

154
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,971
Glad it's not far. I hate wet shoes.

155
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,103
It's business, Jim. Nothing personal.

156
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,856
Matter of fact, I respect you. I do.

157
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,776
But a fella has to take
his opportunities where he finds them.

158
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,279
And with you out of the way,
I'll be mayor inside of a year.

159
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,365
You're sick, Gil. A lot sicker than him.

160
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,700
At least I can see his bad half.

161
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,953
Sorry you feel that way.

162
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,205
At least you won't have to worry
about Barbara.

163
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:21,706
I'll take good care of her.

164
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,000
She's very fond of me, you know.

165
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:28,547
You piece of scum. I may not be around
to stop you but I know someone who will.

166
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:30,507
I wouldn't count on it, Jim.

167
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,260
There's been a recent decline
in the bat population.

168
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,769
Run, Commissioner!

169
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,818
Get him!

170
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,239
Batgirl, I presume.

171
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,369
Don't worry. I'll get you out of this.

172
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:00,495
Somehow.

173
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,922
Miss me?

174
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,427
I think you're safe now, sir.

175
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,266
Get him. Snuff the Bat!

176
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:37,157
What?

177
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:46,207
You've screwed up my plans
for the last time, Batman.

178
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:11,232
No, you don't.

179
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:43,598
Ahhh!

180
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,907
- That's a first. A coin flips Two-Face.
- Where's Batgirl?

181
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,243
Out there. On her own.

182
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,427
Now let's see who you really are.

183
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:26,182
- Barbara? I didn't know it was you.
- Would it have made a difference, Gil?

184
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,487
I ought to leave you here.

185
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,765
Commissioner, I understand
that Gil Mason is still in a coma.

186
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,100
Yes, but even so, he has been indicted.

187
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,145
So how does it feel to be
behind your desk again?

188
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:15,064
A heck of a lot better than it felt
being behind bars.

189
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:17,609
And what of the mysterious Batgirl?

190
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:20,862
Who is she and where has she
vanished to? Any thoughts?

191
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,655
As far as I'm concerned,

192
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,991
she's as welcome
in Gotham City as the Batman.

193
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,494
How do you think Batman
will feel about that?

194
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:30,121
I suppose there's always room
for one more.

195
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,583
And I have a feeling
we'll be seeing her again.

196
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,835
I wouldn't be at all surprised.
