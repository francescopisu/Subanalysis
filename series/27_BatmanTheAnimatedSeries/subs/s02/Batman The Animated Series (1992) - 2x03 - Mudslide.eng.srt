1
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,801
I'm gonna check the parking lot, Billy.
Try to stay awake, huh?

2
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:36,679
Hey, it's not
past my bedtime, old man.

3
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,451
Whoa!

4
00:01:58,534 --> 00:01:59,785
I didn't hear you come back.

5
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:02,663
Sorry, I forgot to check
Mr. Tarnower's office.

6
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,373
I better do that now.

7
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,450
What in the name of...

8
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,581
Looks like a slow night, Alfred.

9
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,000
When I finish patrolling this area,
I'm heading home.

10
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,252
<i>Excellent timing, Master Bruce.</i>

11
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,046
<i>I've just taken dinner out of the oven.</i>

12
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,051
Looks like trouble
at Tarnower Financial, Alfred.

13
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,511
I won't be home early after all.

14
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,722
Please don't take this
the wrong way, sir,

15
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,683
but your goose is cooked.

16
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,039
Step away from the safe. Now!

17
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,500
Do it, man. I'm cocked!

18
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:37,258
Mr. Tarnower?

19
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,593
What did you expect? Batman?

20
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,556
You should be downstairs guarding
the door. What do I pay you for?

21
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,267
Yes, sir. Sorry. I thought...

22
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:49,019
Hey, what happened to your accent?

23
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,896
And aren't you supposed to be in Hawaii?

24
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:03,951
Batman? Thank goodness you're here.
I caught a thief.

25
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:35,709
Hagen, I offered to help you
become human again.

26
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,461
The offer still stands.

27
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:40,297
I don't need your help, Batman.

28
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,217
Have it your way.

29
00:05:57,606 --> 00:06:00,442
You used to be faster, Hagen.
Not to mention neater.

30
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,718
Matthew, get in.

31
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,215
Stella.

32
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,594
There, there.
It's gonna be all right, Matthew.

33
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:12,097
I'll fix everything. Don't you worry.

34
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,141
It'll be all right.

35
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:17,978
I'll take care of you.
I won't let anything happen to you.

36
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,096
It's okay now, Matthew.

37
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,140
Sleep, my darling.

38
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,529
Am I correct in
assuming metamorphic Mr. Hagen

39
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:10,114
is back in town, sir?

40
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,616
Back, but not for long, I'd guess.

41
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,577
It seems that Clayface
is losing his integrity.

42
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,414
I wasn't aware that he ever had any
to begin with.

43
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,333
I'm speaking in
a physiological sense, Alfred.

44
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:25,671
Based on destructive ultrasonic analysis
of the sample,

45
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,966
the molecular bonding
of his clay flesh is breaking down.

46
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,719
He's falling apart, literally.

47
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,512
How grotesque.

48
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,805
Tea?

49
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,477
Whatever medical process he's using
to keep himself together

50
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,603
must cost a fortune.

51
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,064
Which is why he's committing robberies.

52
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:47,401
And that woman helping him,
what's her stake in this?

53
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,820
Mmm. Perhaps she enjoys mud baths.

54
00:08:57,786 --> 00:09:02,207
<i>The surgery was a success, Eric...
I mean, Senator Chandler.</i>

55
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,550
<i>Oh, darling, how wonderful.
Let's get married right away.</i>

56
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:30,694
<i>Susan. Wait.</i>

57
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:34,490
<i>I love you, Susan.
You cured more than my body,</i>

58
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,366
<i>you cured my heart.</i>

59
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:51,215
- Turn it off!
- Matthew?

60
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,222
That's not me anymore.

61
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:03,477
I'm sorry, Matthew.
I didn't think you'd be awake yet.

62
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,272
I don't know if I can stand this
much longer.

63
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,026
Trapped in this suit,
surviving on chemicals.

64
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,319
It's a nightmare!

65
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,073
Stella.

66
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,658
I'm sorry.

67
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,577
I know I owe everything to you.

68
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,163
You cured more than my body,

69
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,040
you cured my heart.

70
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,502
I have something to show you, Matthew.
Something new.

71
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,897
Now, watch.

72
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,404
- How did you do that?
- A new isotope.

73
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,491
MP-40. An experimental
mutagenic adaptogen.

74
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:01,243
I believe it can restore,

75
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:04,913
maybe even increase your powers,
perhaps permanently.

76
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,542
You can become
Matt Hagen again, forever.

77
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,460
Where can we get this stuff?

78
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,715
Well, that's a problem. The only
large source is Wayne Biomedical Labs.

79
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,634
It's rare and it will be well-protected.

80
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,847
Protected from human thieves, maybe,
but not from Clayface.

81
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,308
No, Matthew. It's too risky.

82
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:27,769
Without the suit, your structural
integrity could go at any time.

83
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,229
It's worth the risk.

84
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,065
I'm not spending the rest
of my life like this.

85
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:47,289
Anything interesting yet, Alfred?

86
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,960
It appears his past dealings with women
had nothing to do with medicine, sir.

87
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,922
No record so far of any female doctors.

88
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:58,717
Keep looking.
If we find her, we find him.

89
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,661
Let's cut to the chase.

90
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,913
The MP-40, where is it?

91
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:54,314
A monster. There's a monster in the lab!

92
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,359
Okay, okay. Just take it easy.
We'll handle it.

93
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,790
Look at that lady, Mommy.
She's got mud all over her.

94
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:08,597
Ew! Mommy, she's melting!

95
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,410
- What is it?
- Let me out of here.

96
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,078
- Oh, gross!
- Coming through.

97
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:16,247
- God, that smells.
- Oh, I'm gonna be sick!

98
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,439
Come on.

99
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,860
That's it, run.
Run for your measly lives.

100
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,779
Run from Clayface!

101
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,672
You're dead meat, Batman.

102
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,175
No room to dodge. I gotcha cold.

103
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,010
Other way around, Hagen.

104
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,530
There's nothing here about
any women doctors, Master Bruce.

105
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:51,616
The ladies Mr. Hagen knew
were generally of a less, uh,

106
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,869
intellectual class.

107
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,328
We're missing something.

108
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,830
I can't imagine what.

109
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:59,541
Closest thing Hagen had
to a relationship with a doctor

110
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:03,253
was in the film <i>Dark Interlude.</i>
In it, he plays Eric Chandler,

111
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,715
a senator who falls in love
with the plastic surgeon treating him.

112
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,758
That's it. His movies!

113
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,803
- Master Bruce?
- No time to explain now, Alfred.

114
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,513
There never is.

115
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,128
I... I can feel it.

116
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:50,258
Yes.

117
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,636
Yes! It's working.

118
00:16:58,808 --> 00:16:59,809
No!

119
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,146
Batman. No, turn it back on.

120
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,689
I was so close.

121
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:09,069
So close!
I almost felt like Matt Hagen again.

122
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,196
How did you find us?

123
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,991
I realized you must've used a medical
consultant on some of your films.

124
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,827
I found Dr. Bates' name
in an old film log.

125
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:19,746
Dr. Bates had once owned a motel,

126
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,082
but sold it to get money for this,
I expect.

127
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,751
This was the address the bank had
in its files.

128
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,171
It's over, Hagen.
The lab boys can take it from here.

129
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,965
No!

130
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,308
Stella!

131
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,864
You've upstaged me
for the last time, Batman.

132
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,036
Time to bring down the curtain.

133
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,506
Time for your final bow, Batman.

134
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,010
Matthew, no! You can't.

135
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,264
It's the only way.

136
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,814
Please, stop it.

137
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,611
Think, Stella.
Do you want Matt Hagen or this?

138
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,613
No.

139
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,036
No, you don't!

140
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,623
Is... Is he...

141
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,542
Almost.

142
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,628
I can feel his heart slowing.

143
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,671
Slowing.

144
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,302
Huh?

145
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,442
Matthew, get back inside!

146
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:58,488
You're absorbing the rain! Matthew!

147
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,501
Matthew!

148
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:12,585
No.

149
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,547
We finish this now.

150
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:39,821
Save him, Batman. Please!

151
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:43,241
Come on, Hagen. Pull yourself together.

152
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,955
Too late.

153
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,499
Curtain's going...

154
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:55,879
- Down.
- Hagen!
