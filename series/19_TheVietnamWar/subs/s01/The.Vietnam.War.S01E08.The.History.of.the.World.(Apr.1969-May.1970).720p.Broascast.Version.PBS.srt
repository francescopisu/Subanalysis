00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:40,900
had wanted to be a nurse ever
since she was a small child.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,733

was killed during Tet,

56
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,500
joined the Army to do what
she could for the wounded.

initially was so difficult

that would be brought in

192
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:00,332
the whole time I was in the P.O.W. camp,

193
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,265
but I had, like, a mantra.

194
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,633
Every night when I went to sleep,

195
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:08,832
after a certain point, I would say,

196
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:13,133
"I'll be here when the morning comes."

197
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,432
And I felt if I could
just live one more day,

198
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,899
then I could live one more
day, and then one more day.

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,799
NARRATOR: At the peace talks in Paris,

200
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:26,365
the Nixon administration had
introduced a new demand...

201
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,500
U.S. troops would not withdraw

202
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,865
until all American prisoners had come home

203
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,533
and Hanoi had provided a strict accounting

204
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,899
of those missing in action.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,365
No one knew how many prisoners there were.

206
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:44,399
Most were airmen held in or around Hanoi,

207
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,200
but a handful of others, like Hal Kushner,

208
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:50,732
were struggling to survive
in makeshift jungle camps

209
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:53,500
in South Vietnam.

210
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,232
Hanoi would not reveal the
names of the men they held,

211
00:10:57,332 --> 00:11:01,232
because they still insisted
they were not prisoners of war,

212
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,432
but war criminals.

213
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,765
They subjected many to brutal torture,

214
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:08,966
extracted "confessions,"

215
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,232
and refused to permit inspections

216
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,265
by the International Red Cross.

217
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:18,432
The Johnson administration had
generally downplayed the issue,

218
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:22,500
hoping quiet diplomacy
might bring the men home.

219
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,200
The Nixon administration

220
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,100
launched a "go public" campaign instead,

221
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,799
meant to put the plight
of American prisoners

222
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,966
and those missing in action

223
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,066
at the center of things.

224
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,265
It also provided a rebuke

225
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:38,432
to those in the antiwar movement

226
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,600
who seemed more sympathetic

227
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,832
to North Vietnamese civilians
who had been bombed

228
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:45,600
than they were to U.S. airmen

229
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,232
who had been shot down doing that bombing.

230
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:53,832
Sybil Stockdale, whose husband,
Commander James Stockdale,

231
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:56,700
was the highest-ranking prisoner in Hanoi,

232
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,100
formed the National League of Families

233
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,600
of Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia,

234
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,332
and led delegations of wives to Paris

235
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:08,832
to confront North Vietnamese negotiators.

236
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:13,533
Five million Americans began
wearing tin or copper bracelets

237
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,166
engraved with a missing man's name

238
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:18,666
and date of loss.

239
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:22,932
More than 50 million P.O.W./M.I.A.
bumper stickers

240
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,633
would be sold over the next four years.

241
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:29,066
Despite what their jailers had told them,

242
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,365
the prisoners had not been
forgotten by their country.

243
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,865
Eventually, one journalist wrote,

244
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:38,133
many "people began to speak

245
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:42,299
"as though the North Vietnamese
had kidnapped 400 Americans

246
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,832
and the United States had gone
to war to retrieve them."

247
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,399
At the same time, the Saigon
government of Nguyen Van Thieu

248
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,799
was holding prisoners of its own.

249
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,732
There would eventually be

250
00:12:56,832 --> 00:13:00,600
some 40,000 North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong soldiers

251
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,633
in four crowded camps.

252
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:06,666
Another 200,000 South Vietnamese civilians

253
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:10,666
would also be held, many without trial.

254
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,666
NGUYEN TAI:

255
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:34,899
JAMES GILLAM: There are certain
rules to tunnel warfare.

256
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:39,832
Don't turn on the light

257
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:43,000
unless you're really, really,
really sure you're alone.

258
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,700
Use your senses.

259
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,899
Do your first killing
as quietly as you can.

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,066
That means don't shoot.

261
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:56,133
I chased somebody into a tunnel,

262
00:14:56,232 --> 00:15:01,500
met them at a bend in the
corner, in the dark.

263
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,100
I thought I was alone

264
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,399
and then I smelled their breath.

265
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,500
And we had a wrestling match in the dark.

266
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,966
And I got the upper hand

267
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:18,299
and crushed this person's trachea,

268
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,033
held him down while he died...

269
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,566
...and then got out.

270
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:30,000
I beat and strangled someone to death

271
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,899
in a tunnel

272
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,966
in the dark.

273
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,665
Um...

274
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,200
But that wasn't the only casualty.

275
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:42,633
The other casualty was the
civilized version of me.

276
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,633
(gunfire)

277
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:01,232

00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,066
NARRATOR: April 1969

280
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,133
marked the high point of
American military commitment

281
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:10,666
to South Vietnam.

282
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:18,133
543,482 men and women were now in country,

283
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:22,265
and tens of thousands more were stationed

284
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:25,299
at airbases and aboard
ships beyond its borders.

285
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,265
40,794 had died.

286
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:36,299
And more than $70 billion had been spent.

287
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,899
(explosion in distance)

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,399
That spring, a new battle

289
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,600
caught the attention of
the American public,

290
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,399
a struggle to take still
another numbered hill...

291
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,133
Hill 937 on military maps.

292
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:55,200
CHET HUNTLEY: For nine days,

293
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,242
American and South Vietnamese
troops have been trying

294
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,200
to take a mountain near the Laotian border,

295
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:02,133
and ten times they have been thrown back.

296
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:03,500
(booming, shouting)

297
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,465
(gunfire)

298
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,732
(shouting over radio)

299
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,232
The casualties have been so high...

300
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,599
50 Americans and 250 North
Vietnamese killed...

301
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,333
that the mountain has come to
be known as "Hamburger Hill."

302
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:39,066
Today, another 600 allied troops
were thrown into the battle.

303
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:41,732
(helicopter blades whirring)

304
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,200
(gunfire)

305
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:47,000
(explosion, screaming)

306
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:53,165
NARRATOR: A weary G.I. told a reporter

307
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:55,365
that his battalion commander

308
00:17:55,465 --> 00:18:00,333
"won't stop until he kills
every damn one of us."

309
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:01,732
(explosion, gunfire)

310
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,965
After 11 days of fighting,

311
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,766
the Battle for Hamburger Hill ended.

312
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:15,932
56 Americans died.

313
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:20,333
420 more were wounded.

314
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,965
A week later, the Americans
abandoned the hill,

315
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:26,965
just as they had abandoned
so many other hills

316
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:31,599
they had taken at great cost
over the years in Vietnam.

317
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:36,633
General, could you explain for
us again the strategy involved

318
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:39,732
in the decision to withdraw American troops

319
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,032
after they had taken Hill
937, or Hamburger Hill?

320
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,099
No piece of ground, as such,

321
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,599
is important to us.

322
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,432
HUNTLEY: In the United States Senate,

323
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,333
Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts delivered

324
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:57,232
a brief speech criticizing what he called

325
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,266
a "senseless and
irresponsible military pride

326
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:02,766
"in which American men
are sent to their deaths

327
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:05,599
in pointless battles like
this one for Hamburger Hill."

328
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,799
Kennedy called upon President Nixon

329
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,032
to issue new orders to
commanders in Vietnam

330
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,665
to halt such actions

331
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:13,566
and he charged that they contradict

332
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,000
the president's stated intentions

333
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,799
of seeking a negotiated peace.

334
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:22,900
NARRATOR: There had been more
deadly weeks during the war,

335
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,365
costlier battles, larger
numbers of casualties.

336
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:33,665
But more and more Americans
seemed to have had enough.

337
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:36,133
The following month, Li fe magazine

338
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,266
published the names and photographs

339
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:41,165
of all 242 Americans

340
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:45,133
who had died in combat in just one week.

341
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:49,066
For the first time, in a
national publication,

342
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:53,032
casualty statistics came with human faces.

343
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:58,665
The only way they could
measure success in Vietnam

344
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:00,865
was, was was kill ratios...

345
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:03,133
how many of them versus how many of us.

346
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:05,400
Well, the only thing that's important

347
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,799
to the American people is the "us."

348
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,465
You know, if there's three
us dead, that's the number.

349
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:14,700
Not 30, you know, Vietnamese dead.

350
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,865
And, so, politically, an attrition strategy

351
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:20,133
just can't last very long.

352
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:21,665
We don't care what the ratio is,

353
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:23,008
we just want the absolute number

354
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:25,665
of how many American kids died.

355
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,032
NARRATOR: A Gallup poll now
found that most Americans

356
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,900
believed Vietnam had been a mistake.

357
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,965
Richard Nixon knew he needed
to signal to the public

358
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:38,299
that an end was in sight.

in which the names of all eligible males

685
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:01,733
will be put into a hat,

686
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:05,400
and the men will be drafted
according to their head sizes.

687
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,032
The tiny heads will go
into the military service

688
00:38:09,132 --> 00:38:13,465
and the fat heads will go into government.

692
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:25,199
"Why are we here?"

693
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,065
And the, the standard response,

694
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:29,099
at least on an official level, was,

695
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,065
to prevent international communism

696
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:35,065
from conquering the world.

697
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:38,965
The men say, "Hey, that, that's bullshit."

698
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:42,800
So the other reason put forth,

699
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,932
at least in the latter days of the war,

700
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,400
was to maintain America's
international credibility

701
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,065
with our allies, and our enemies.

702
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:54,300

the credibility of Lyndon
Johnson or Richard Nixon.

704
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:01,099
And so, within a relatively short time,

705
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:03,333

captain says, you know.

713
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:30,233
We got, uh... the captain will stay back,

714
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,233
he'll tell the platoon or something

715
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:35,032
to go out so many hundred meters, you know.

716
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:36,865
We don't do it.

717
00:39:36,965 --> 00:39:38,766
We only go as far as we get out of sight,

718
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:40,300
sit down, and come back in.

719
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,309
JOHN PILGER: What happens
to an unpopular officer

720
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,365
out in the field?

721
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,400
Mostly unpopular officers,
from what I've heard,

722
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,132
if they, if they mess
with a grunt too much,

723
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:53,099
they get shot at.

724
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,599
NARRATOR: It had always been a part of war.

725
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:59,733
In Vietnam, it was called "fragging,"

726
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:04,065
after the fragmentation
grenades most often used.

727
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:09,233
Beginning in the summer of 1969,

728
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:13,199
as thousands of American
troops began going home,

729
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,865
the number of reports of the
murder or attempted murder

730
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:19,000
by enlisted men of their superiors

731
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,132
increased alarmingly.

732
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:27,266
The Army would investigate
nearly 800 cases.

733
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:29,333
Most took place far from the fighting,

734
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:32,132
usually the violent outcome
of arguments over race

735
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,400
or women or drugs

736
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,500
rather than the war itself.

737
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,166
But there were exceptions.

738
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:42,233
OKAMOTO: It's a totally different army

739
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:46,166
than what we sent to Vietnam in 1965.

740
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:50,300
And the new lieutenant comes in,
all gung-ho for body count.

741
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,932
He wants contact, he goes crazy, and says,

742
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:56,333
"I want a volunteer for this."

743
00:40:56,432 --> 00:40:59,032
(rapid gunfire)

744
00:40:59,132 --> 00:41:04,865
That new gung-ho officer was
a clear and present danger

745
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:08,666
to the life and limb of the grunts.

746
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,333
They'd have subtle hints,
like a little note saying,

747
00:41:11,432 --> 00:41:14,065
"We're gonna kill your ass
if you keep this up."

748
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:17,132
Or instead of a fragmentation grenade,

749
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:20,965
they may throw a smoke grenade
in an officer's hooch or bunker.

750
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:25,032
And if they didn't correct
their behavior and outlook,

751
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:28,532
yeah, they would frag them.

752
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:32,300
I saw it happen in a very, uh, strange way.

753
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:40,400
We were in a base and a Marine
started running towards me.

754
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,666
I didn't realize that what he...

755
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,900
what he was doing back
in the dark over there

756
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,166
was actually throw a hand grenade

757
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:50,733
underneath the space that
is underneath a hooch.

758
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:52,132
(explosion)

759
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,599
And when it exploded, I went, "Holy shit."

760
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:58,032
And I knew right away what he had done.

761
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:01,400
And he was an African-American Marine.

762
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,400
African-Americans were treated

763
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,865
with disrespect by their superiors.

764
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:09,800
This was not uncommon.

765
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,800
So in a ways, as bad as this sounds,

766
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,300
maybe that guy had it coming to him.

767
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,865
I don't know.

768
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:24,865
In Paris, the 29th session
of the so-called peace talks

769
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:25,865
took place.

770
00:42:25,965 --> 00:42:27,766
There was no progress.

771
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:31,199
In Vietnam, it was announced
that 139 Americans

772
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,800
lost their lives last week,

773
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,500
bringing total deaths in our longest war...

774
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,500
NARRATOR: The four-way peace talks in Paris

775
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,166
continued to go nowhere.

776
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:44,900
To break the logjam, Nixon
directed Henry Kissinger

777
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,666
to begin secret talks,

778
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:50,400
the first in a series
of clandestine meetings

779
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,266
with the North Vietnamese alone.

780
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:55,666
They first met in an apartment building

781
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:57,800
on the Rue de Rivoli.

782
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,833
The Viet Cong and the South
Vietnamese government

783
00:43:00,932 --> 00:43:03,632
were not included.

784
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:06,666
Hanoi remained immovable.

785
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:10,532
They would not even admit they
had troops in South Vietnam,

786
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:14,532
let alone discuss withdrawing them.

787
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:16,400
Now Kissinger warned

788
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,699
that if there were no change in
their position by November 1,

789
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,733
the one-year anniversary

790
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,166
of President Johnson's bombing halt,

791
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:25,900
President Nixon

792
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,900
would "consider steps
of grave consequence."

793
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,000
September 2, 1969,

794
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:47,333
was the 24th anniversary

795
00:43:47,432 --> 00:43:51,233
of Ho Chi Minh's declaration
of Vietnamese independence

796
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,766
in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square.

797
00:43:55,766 --> 00:44:00,565
At 9:45 that morning, Ho died.

798
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:05,300
He was said to be 79, but
like so much about him,

799
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,699
the precise date of his birth
was shrouded in mystery.

800
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,400
He had been "Uncle Ho" for decades,

801
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,800
the living embodiment of the
struggle against the Japanese,

802
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,800
the French, the Saigon government,

803
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,733
and then the Americans.

804
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,766
♪

805
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:27,632
In a speech to the National Assembly,

806
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:32,166
Le Duan, the First Secretary
of the Communist Party,

807
00:44:32,266 --> 00:44:33,565
who had been the architect

808
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:36,233
of North Vietnamese military policy

809
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,599
for a decade,

810
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:41,766
promised to fulfill what
he said was Ho's vision:

811
00:44:41,865 --> 00:44:47,733
the reunification of the
country on communist terms.

812
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,965
Nothing had changed.

813
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,908
ROBERT FRISHMAN: Hanoi has
given the false impression

814
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:57,233
that all is wine and roses and it isn't so.

815
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:59,699
NARRATOR: The same day Ho Chi Minh died,

816
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,365
an unusual press conference was held

817
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:05,365
at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center.

818
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:08,132
Two ailing prisoners of war,

819
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:11,699
Robert Frishman and Douglas Hegdahl,

820
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,065
who had recently been released
by the North Vietnamese,

821
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:16,300
spoke in public for the first time

822
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,199
about the severe treatment

823
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,666
they and their fellow
prisoners had received.

824
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:24,233
I don't think solitary confinement,

825
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:28,032
forced statements, living
in a cage for three years,

826
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:31,965
being put in straps, not being
allowed to sleep or eat,

827
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:35,532
removal of fingernails,
being hung from a ceiling,

828
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,900
having an infected arm
which was almost lost,

829
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,233
not receiving medical care,

830
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,565
being dragged along the
ground with a broken leg,

831
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:45,599
or not allowing exchange of
mail to prisoners of war

832
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,032
are humane.

833
00:45:47,132 --> 00:45:51,333
NARRATOR: Douglas Hegdahl
was quiet, self-effacing,

834
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:54,065
and so apparently clueless,

835
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,233
his North Vietnamese guards

836
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:59,065
had called him the "stupid one."

837
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:00,632
But once released,

838
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:03,900
he was a gold mine of information.

839
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,900
He had memorized the names
of more than 200 prisoners

840
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,632
to the tune of "Old McDonald Had a Farm."

841
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:14,565
Thanks to him, scores of American families

842
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:16,766
would find out for the first time

843
00:46:16,865 --> 00:46:22,032
that their sons and husbands
and fathers were still alive.

844
00:46:22,132 --> 00:46:25,565
Within a few days of the press conference,

845
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:29,432
Hanoi's treatment of the
prisoners began to improve.

846
00:46:29,532 --> 00:46:33,400
"A lot less brutality,"
one captive remembered,

847
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,032
"and larger bowls of rice."

848
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,800
(explosion)

849
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,465
(men yelling)

850
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:44,465
(rapid gunfire)

851
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:52,242
DEVALLIER: All right, who's wounded?

852
00:46:52,266 --> 00:46:54,965
All right, give me some cover!

853
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:57,733
RICHARD THRELKELD: Devallier is
the lone medic in the platoon.

854
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,000
He's scared,

855
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,432
scared from the moment he
gets out of the chopper

856
00:47:01,532 --> 00:47:02,965
to the moment it picks him up.

857
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:05,965
Scared that someday he's
going to get killed

858
00:47:06,065 --> 00:47:09,032
picking up a wounded buddy.

859
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:11,032
(rapid gunfire, men yelling)

860
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:14,965
WAYNE SMITH: I was the replacement

861
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,666
for a medic who had been killed.

862
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:22,333
First time out, we were
assigned to do a patrol.

863
00:47:22,432 --> 00:47:25,766
MAN: Remember to stop the bleeding!

864
00:47:25,865 --> 00:47:31,465
SMITH: And we stumbled
actually into an ambush.

865
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:34,199
(explosion)

866
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,666
And it was incredibly terrifying.

867
00:47:37,766 --> 00:47:40,065
Guys were screaming and yelling.

868
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,465
There was shooting everywhere.

869
00:47:42,565 --> 00:47:46,532
That first firefight, I
remember praying to God,

870
00:47:46,632 --> 00:47:52,766
if He got me through this that
I would make a difference.

871
00:47:52,865 --> 00:47:57,233
That I really would make a difference.

872
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,400
MEDIC: Sometimes their lives
depend on you, I mean;

873
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,432
you hold it in your hands, as a medic.

874
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:06,400
It's just hard to say but right then,

875
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,733
you hold life and death in your hand.

876
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:12,532
NARRATOR: In Vietnam,
medics and navy corpsmen

877
00:48:12,632 --> 00:48:15,065
accompanied infantry units on patrols,

878
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,032
search and destroy missions,

879
00:48:17,132 --> 00:48:20,632
and large-scale combat operations.

880
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:24,500
Nearly 2,000 would lose their lives.

881
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,432
(helicopter whirring)

882
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,766
Unlike in previous wars,

883
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:34,166
many medics in Vietnam
chose to carry weapons,

884
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:36,666
and when the shooting started,

885
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:39,465
were willing to use them
to protect themselves

886
00:48:39,565 --> 00:48:42,500
and their wounded comrades.

887
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:46,000
SMITH: I carried an M16,

888
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:49,132

1185
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,199
There was no sense of daily purpose.

1186
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,432
We didn't know why we were in a village

1187
01:02:54,532 --> 01:02:56,666
or what we were supposed to accomplish.

1188
01:02:56,766 --> 01:02:58,932
So we'd kick around jugs of rice

wounding a G.I. standing a few feet away.

1202
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,900
But mines and booby traps
were the greatest menace.

1203
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,900
O'BRIEN: Somewhere around
80% of our casualties

1204
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,465
came from land mines of all sorts.

1205
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,099
In Vietnam, for me, just
to get up in the morning

1206
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:02,400
and look out at the land and think,

1207
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,300
"In a few minutes I'll
be walking out there,

1208
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,266
"and will my corpse be there or there?

1209
01:04:08,365 --> 01:04:11,565
Will I lose a leg out there?"

1210
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:15,900
I'd always thought of courage
as charging enemy bunkers

1211
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,266
or standing up under fire.

1212
01:04:18,365 --> 01:04:21,699
But just to walk through Quang Ngai,

1213
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,065
day after day, from village to village,

1214
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:28,432
and through the paddies and
up into the mountains,

1215
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:32,065
just to make your legs
move was an act of courage

1216
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:34,833
that if, say, you were
living in Sioux City,

1217
01:04:34,932 --> 01:04:36,565
it wouldn't be courageous

1218
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:39,166
to walk to the grocery
store or down Main Street,

1219
01:04:39,266 --> 01:04:41,865
you know, just to have your
legs go back and forth.

1220
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:43,599
But in Vietnam, for me,

1221
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:45,800
just to walk felt incredibly brave.

1222
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,365
I would sometimes look
at my legs as I walked,

1223
01:04:48,465 --> 01:04:50,432

Tim O'Brien's outfit had been
sent into an area of operations

1239
01:08:16,033 --> 01:08:18,800
the Americans called "Pinkville,"

1240
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:20,733
clusters of villages

1241
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:24,199
that included a hamlet they called My Lai.

1242
01:08:26,065 --> 01:08:28,199
O'BRIEN: We hated going there.

1243
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,065
When we'd get the word, "You're
headed for Pinkville,"

1244
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:33,175
one guy would say to another,
"Somebody's gonna die,"

1245
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,559
or, "Somebody's gonna lose a leg."

1246
01:08:34,632 --> 01:08:36,632
We were terrified of the place.

1247
01:08:36,733 --> 01:08:40,166
It was littered with land mines.

1248
01:08:40,265 --> 01:08:42,166
The villagers were...

1249
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:44,065
The expressions on their faces,

1250
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:48,466
including the children of,
say, six or five years old,

1251
01:08:48,565 --> 01:08:53,733
had a mixture of hostility and terror.

1252
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:57,500
I can't say many of the villagers

1253
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,632
came with open arms to us,

1254
01:08:59,733 --> 01:09:01,765
but this place was special.

1255
01:09:01,865 --> 01:09:03,865
And I remember talking to fellow soldiers,

1256
01:09:03,966 --> 01:09:06,233
thinking, "What is it with this place?"

1257
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,632
And then about three-quarters of the way

1258
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:11,365
through my tour in Vietnam,

1259
01:09:11,466 --> 01:09:14,666
the story of the My Lai
Massacre broke in the States.

1260
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:18,966
NARRATOR: On November 12, 1969,

1261
01:09:19,065 --> 01:09:21,600
the Dispatch News Service in Washington

1262
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:25,733
moved a story by investigative
journalist Seymour Hersh.

1263
01:09:27,033 --> 01:09:29,265
It was soon followed by the publication

1264
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:34,332
of graphic photos taken by Army
photographer Ronald Haeberle.

1265
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,632
The story and the pictures
stunned the country.

1266
01:09:39,733 --> 01:09:41,365
HUNTLEY: Charges have been made

1267
01:09:41,466 --> 01:09:44,199
that troops of the Americal Division

1268
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,733
killed as many as 567 South
Vietnamese civilians

1269
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:51,000
during a sweep in March 1968.

1270
01:09:52,265 --> 01:09:54,233
NARRATOR: 20 months earlier,

1271
01:09:54,332 --> 01:09:57,800
on the morning of March 16, 1968,

1272
01:09:57,899 --> 01:10:00,500
105 men from a rifle company

1273
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,765
belonging to the Americal Division,

1274
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,966
and led by Captain Ernest Medina

1275
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:07,199
and Lieutenant William Calley,

1276
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,399
had been ordered to helicopter
into the village of My Lai 4.

1277
01:10:12,733 --> 01:10:15,966
Since arriving in Vietnam,
they had lost 28 men

1278
01:10:16,065 --> 01:10:20,932
to mines and booby traps
and unseen snipers.

1279
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:25,832
Two days earlier, a popular
squad leader had been killed.

1280
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:29,600
They had been told a unit
of main-force Viet Cong

1281
01:10:29,699 --> 01:10:31,365
was waiting for them,

1282
01:10:31,466 --> 01:10:34,233
and they were eager for revenge.

1283
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,000
But they received no hostile fire,

1284
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:42,966
encountered no enemy soldiers.

1285
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:47,733
Instead, over the next four hours,

1286
01:10:47,832 --> 01:10:50,666
Medina, Calley, and their men murdered

1287
01:10:50,765 --> 01:10:58,500
407 defenseless old men,
women, children, and infants.

1288
01:11:08,466 --> 01:11:11,132
Many of the women and girls were raped

1289
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,533
before they were shot.

1290
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,899
There would have been still more slaughter

1291
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,166
had a helicopter pilot named
Hugh Thompson, Jr., not landed

1292
01:11:23,265 --> 01:11:26,666
between the men and some
of their intended targets

1293
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:30,399
and ordered his crew to open
fire on their fellow Americans

1294
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,765
if they did not stop shooting civilians.

1295
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,533
At the same time, just a mile or so away,

1296
01:11:40,632 --> 01:11:45,332
another company murdered 97 more villagers.

1297
01:11:47,332 --> 01:11:50,365
O'BRIEN: And suddenly it was
like a window shade going up,

1298
01:11:50,466 --> 01:11:51,899
and then there's light,

1299
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,065
and we understood what had engendered

1300
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:57,500
this horror in these kids' faces

1301
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,332
and fear and the... and the hatred.

1302
01:12:00,432 --> 01:12:03,966
Hundred and some American
soldiers in four hours or so

1303
01:12:04,065 --> 01:12:06,733
butchering innocent people,

1304
01:12:06,832 --> 01:12:08,899
in all kinds of ways... machine-gunning them

1305
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,300
and throwing them in
wells and scalping them

1306
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:13,265
and killing them in ditches

1307
01:12:13,365 --> 01:12:15,966
and taking a lunch break and
then doing it some more.

1308
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,233
Systematic homicide.

1309
01:12:19,332 --> 01:12:20,865
MIKE WALLACE: What kind of people?

1310
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:21,966
Men, women, children?

1311
01:12:22,065 --> 01:12:23,500
PAUL MEADLO: Men, women, children.

1312
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,300
WALLACE: Babies? MEADLO: Babies.

1313
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:27,233
Uh, Lieutenant Calley came over and said,

1314
01:12:27,332 --> 01:12:29,233
"You know what to do with them, don't you?"

1315
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:30,832
And, uh, I said, "Yes."

1316
01:12:30,932 --> 01:12:34,932
So l took it for granted that he
just wanted us to watch them.

1317
01:12:35,033 --> 01:12:36,800
And he left and came back

1318
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:39,466
about ten or... ten or 15 minutes later,

1319
01:12:39,565 --> 01:12:43,800
and said, "How come you
ain't, uh, killed them yet?"

1320
01:12:43,899 --> 01:12:45,466
You killed how many at that time?

1321
01:12:45,565 --> 01:12:48,065
Well, I fired my automatic, so, uh...

1322
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:50,800
you can't, uh... you just
spray the area on them,

1323
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,265
so you really can't know
how many you killed

1324
01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:56,166
because it comes out so doggone fast.

1325
01:12:56,265 --> 01:13:00,500
So I, I might've killed
about, uh, ten or 15 of them.

1326
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:03,132
Men, women, and children?

1327
01:13:03,233 --> 01:13:04,800
Men, women, and children.

1328
01:13:04,899 --> 01:13:06,966
And babies? And babies.

1329
01:13:08,432 --> 01:13:10,332
Why did I do it?

1330
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:13,233
Because I felt like I was ordered to do it.

1331
01:13:13,332 --> 01:13:15,899
And it seemed like, uh...

1332
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,533
Well, at the time, I felt like
I was doing the right thing.

1333
01:13:22,632 --> 01:13:24,533
I really did.

1334
01:13:24,632 --> 01:13:27,699
Because, uh, like I said, I lost buddies,

1335
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,699
I lost... I lost a good...

1336
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:34,166
damn good buddy... Bobby Wilson...

1337
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:37,932
and it was on my conscience,
and it was on...

1338
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:40,000
So after I done it, I felt good.

1339
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:44,332
But later on that day,
it was getting to me.

1340
01:13:44,432 --> 01:13:47,500
It's so hard, I think, for
a good many Americans

1341
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,632
to understand that young, capable,

1342
01:13:50,733 --> 01:13:54,000
brave American boys

1343
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:57,033
could line up

1344
01:13:57,132 --> 01:14:01,733
old men, women, children, and babies

1345
01:14:01,832 --> 01:14:04,565
and shoot them down in cold blood.

1346
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,533
How do you explain that?

1347
01:14:11,632 --> 01:14:13,565
I wouldn't know.

1348
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,399
(low, distant chatter)

1349
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:27,733
NARRATOR: The killing of civilians
has happened in every war.

1350
01:14:27,832 --> 01:14:32,132
In Vietnam, it was not policy or routine,

1351
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:34,865
but it was not an aberration, either.

1352
01:14:36,432 --> 01:14:41,332
Still, the scale and
deliberateness and intimacy

1353
01:14:41,432 --> 01:14:43,565
of what happened at My Lai

1354
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:44,966
was different.

1355
01:14:45,065 --> 01:14:46,699
SHEEHAN: It was different

1356
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,533
because they were killing
Vietnamese point-blank

1357
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:51,000
with rifles and grenades.

1358
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,432
They were murdering them directly.

1359
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:55,800
They weren't doing it
with bombs and artillery.

1360
01:14:55,899 --> 01:14:57,408
If they'd been doing it
with bombs and artillery,

1361
01:14:57,432 --> 01:14:58,576
nobody would have said a word,

1362
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,080
because it was going on all the time.

1363
01:15:01,033 --> 01:15:02,332
NARRATOR: Not every soldier

1364
01:15:02,432 --> 01:15:04,166
participated in the killings that day.

1365
01:15:04,265 --> 01:15:07,800
Some led villagers away to safety.

1366
01:15:07,899 --> 01:15:10,666
But a failure of military leadership

1367
01:15:10,765 --> 01:15:13,865
at nearly every level had
created the conditions

1368
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:17,365
that made the massacre possible.

1369
01:15:17,466 --> 01:15:21,699
The My Lai story might have
shocked the American public,

1370
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,000
but it was not news to the Army.

1371
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:27,199
It had occurred almost two years before,

1372
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,365
just after the Tet Offensive.

1373
01:15:30,466 --> 01:15:32,832
Hugh Thompson, the helicopter pilot

1374
01:15:32,932 --> 01:15:35,000
who had tried to stop the massacre,

1375
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,932
reported what he had seen,

1376
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,932
but no one in the chain of command

1377
01:15:40,033 --> 01:15:41,265
was willing to act.

1378
01:15:41,365 --> 01:15:45,000
The slaughter was covered up.

1379
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,865
Later, an ex-corporal
named Ronald Ridenhour,

1380
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:50,632
who had heard about what had happened

1381
01:15:50,733 --> 01:15:52,666
from several men who had been there,

1382
01:15:52,765 --> 01:15:56,233
wrote letters to the president
of the United States,

1383
01:15:56,332 --> 01:15:58,132
the secretary of defense,

1384
01:15:58,233 --> 01:16:02,132
and more than two dozen other
high-ranking officials.

1385
01:16:02,233 --> 01:16:05,399
STAN ATKINSON: Personally,
what decision-making process

1386
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,300
did you go through before you
decided to take your action?

1387
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:12,065
I guess I just wrestled
with my own conscience

1388
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:14,432
to try to decide what action to take.

1389
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:16,565
I felt that I had to take some action.

1390
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:18,033
I had to do something.

1391
01:16:18,132 --> 01:16:19,365
I couldn't just...

1392
01:16:19,466 --> 01:16:22,000
just rest with this knowledge
for the rest of my life

1393
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,932
that I couldn't... I couldn't
live with myself if I did.

1394
01:16:25,033 --> 01:16:27,932
NARRATOR: President Nixon's first reaction

1395
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:32,166
was to investigate those who
reported the slaughter.

1396
01:16:32,265 --> 01:16:34,966
"It's those dirty rotten Jews from New York

1397
01:16:35,065 --> 01:16:36,332
who are behind it,"

1398
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:37,865
he told an aide.

1399
01:16:37,966 --> 01:16:42,300
Eventually, Lieutenant
General William R. Peers,

1400
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:46,233
a veteran of 30 months as a
troop commander in Vietnam,

1401
01:16:46,332 --> 01:16:48,033
was assigned to head a panel

1402
01:16:48,132 --> 01:16:50,932
to look into what had really happened.

1403
01:16:51,033 --> 01:16:54,166
Peers found that 30 persons,

1404
01:16:54,265 --> 01:16:56,600
including the division commander,

1405
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:58,932
General Samuel W. Koster,

1406
01:16:59,033 --> 01:17:01,332
had either committed atrocities

1407
01:17:01,432 --> 01:17:05,399
or had conspired to cover them up.

1408
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:13,132
Peers had wanted to call
My Lai a "massacre."

1409
01:17:13,233 --> 01:17:16,500

1515

his ribs shattered, lung
pierced, nerves cut,

1516
01:22:42,966 --> 01:22:47,300
he had spent 17 months in Navy hospitals.

1517
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:50,432
He was now studying at Baker University

1518
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:53,300
in Baldwin City, Kansas.

01:23:26,533 --> 01:23:28,765
Just my family.

1529
01:23:28,865 --> 01:23:31,332
NARRATOR: Musgrave was so hurt

1530
01:23:31,432 --> 01:23:33,432
by the way some people treated him

1531
01:23:33,533 --> 01:23:36,865
that he volunteered to return to Vietnam.

1532
01:23:36,966 --> 01:23:40,600
Because of his injuries, the
Marines turned him down,

1533
01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:44,632
and asked him to help recruit men instead.

1534
01:23:44,733 --> 01:23:46,666
He did for a time,

1535
01:23:46,765 --> 01:23:49,765
but when students asked him
questions about the war

1536
01:23:49,865 --> 01:23:51,632
he couldn't answer,

1537
01:23:51,733 --> 01:23:52,832
he also began to read

1538
01:23:52,932 --> 01:23:57,265
about how and why it was being fought.

1539
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:01,033
MUSGRAVE: I had friends in
country on a second tour,

1540
01:24:01,132 --> 01:24:04,233
and, you know, I, I was still...
considered myself a Marine.

1541
01:24:04,332 --> 01:24:07,132
and... and the more I read,

1542
01:24:07,233 --> 01:24:12,466
the less I found to be able
to defend our presence there.

1543
01:24:12,565 --> 01:24:16,600
So then, I, I just stopped
talking to everybody.

1544
01:24:16,699 --> 01:24:18,733
(dog barking)

1545
01:24:18,832 --> 01:24:22,800
NARRATOR: Musgrave gradually felt
as if he were being torn in two.

1546
01:24:22,899 --> 01:24:26,733
And he was still haunted by
the memory of those Marines

1547
01:24:26,832 --> 01:24:31,399
who had died while he had lived.

1548
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,632
MUSGRAVE: I was dating my .45
in those years, you know.

1549
01:24:34,733 --> 01:24:37,432
Coming home at night after drinking,

1550
01:24:37,533 --> 01:24:39,565
and pressing it up against my temple,

1551
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:42,565
or putting it under my chin,

1552
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:44,966
wondering if this was gonna be the night

1553
01:24:45,065 --> 01:24:47,065
I was gonna have the guts to do it.

1554
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,942
I'd had a round chambered, and
I'd taken the safety off.

1555
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:53,265
Same kind of pistol I carried in Vietnam.

1556
01:24:55,865 --> 01:24:59,199
And I thought, "I'm really
gonna do it tonight."

1557
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:03,100
You know, like, "Whew, I'm
really gonna do it," you know.

1558
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,132
And my dogs... I'd let my dogs out.

1559
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:06,765
I had two dogs.

1560
01:25:06,865 --> 01:25:08,399
And they jumped on the front door

1561
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,800
and scratched on the front door.

1562
01:25:09,899 --> 01:25:11,666
They wanted in.

1563
01:25:11,765 --> 01:25:12,942
And I put the safety back on the pistol

1564
01:25:12,966 --> 01:25:14,733
and set it down and went and let 'em in.

1565
01:25:16,565 --> 01:25:19,233
And they were so open in their love for me

1566
01:25:19,332 --> 01:25:21,000
that I literally said out loud,

1567
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:26,265
"Whoa, if I really want to do
this, I can do this tomorrow."

1568
01:25:26,365 --> 01:25:27,666
And I went back in the room,

1569
01:25:27,765 --> 01:25:29,632
and I put the pistol in the drawer, and...

1570
01:25:29,733 --> 01:25:32,666
and I... I think that
was the closest I came.

1571
01:25:32,765 --> 01:25:34,399
I think maybe I would have killed...

1572
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,733
k-k-killed myself that night.

1573
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,199
But something as simple

1574
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,800
as my dogs wanting back in...

1575
01:25:40,899 --> 01:25:44,166
stopped that thought, you know.

1576
01:25:46,899 --> 01:25:49,899
I'm really glad that it didn't happen.

1577
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,233
But at the time, it just
made so much sense.

JACK TODD: The turning
point for me, I think,

1589
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:34,733
was one evening I spent with
my friend Sonny Walter,

1590

who had been, uh... just been
discharged from the Army,

1591
01:26:37,466 --> 01:26:40,033

1592
01:26:40,132 --> 01:26:42,733
before I went in pleading
with me not to go.

1593
01:26:42,832 --> 01:26:45,399
He even offered to drive me to Canada.

1594

horrible pictures of Vietnam

1752
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:08,399
If, when the chips are down,

1753
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,000
the world's most powerful nation,

1754
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,800
the United States of America,

1755
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:17,765
acts like a pitiful, helpless giant,

1756
01:35:17,865 --> 01:35:21,565
the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy

1757
01:35:21,666 --> 01:35:24,332
will threaten free nations
and free institutions

1758
01:35:24,432 --> 01:35:26,000
throughout the world.

1759
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:30,065
NARRATOR: On April 30, 1970,

1760
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:31,932
President Nixon shocked the world

1761
01:35:32,033 --> 01:35:35,100
by announcing that he had
sent 30,000 American troops

1762
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:38,832
storming into Cambodia.

1763
01:35:38,932 --> 01:35:42,000
The previous month, Prince Norodom Sihanouk

1764
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,300
had been overthrown in a coup.

1765
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:46,733
For years, he had allowed
the North Vietnamese

1766
01:35:46,832 --> 01:35:49,399
to keep sanctuaries in his country,

1767
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,432
but he had not protested

1768
01:35:51,533 --> 01:35:55,033
when American planes bombed them.

1769
01:35:55,132 --> 01:35:57,733
The new president, Lon Nol,

1770
01:35:57,832 --> 01:36:01,699
was an anticommunist, backed
by the United States.

1771
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,100
Nixon now felt he could do

1772
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:07,832
what American generals had
been wanting to do for years...

1773
01:36:07,932 --> 01:36:11,699
pursue the enemy beyond the
borders of South Vietnam.

1774
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,033
The 30,000 American troops

1775
01:36:16,132 --> 01:36:21,300
were joined by 50,000 ARVN soldiers.

1776
01:36:21,399 --> 01:36:23,332
The objective was to attack

1777
01:36:23,432 --> 01:36:26,100
North Vietnamese base
camps and supply lines

1778
01:36:26,199 --> 01:36:29,399
and to buy time for the
South Vietnamese Army

1779
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,899
as it got ready to fight on its own.

1780
01:36:33,899 --> 01:36:36,166
Nixon told the public

1781
01:36:36,265 --> 01:36:39,832
he had ordered an "incursion,"
not an "invasion,"

1782
01:36:39,932 --> 01:36:44,466
intended only to protect
American boys in South Vietnam

1783
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:48,733
and in response to North
Vietnamese "aggression."

1784
01:36:51,632 --> 01:36:55,500
GILLAM: I wasn't worried
about political conflict.

1785
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,233
I was worried about, "Am I gonna be alive

1786
01:36:58,332 --> 01:36:59,800
in the next ten minutes?"

1787
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:04,733
We were on the Western
edge of the invasion.

1788
01:37:04,832 --> 01:37:08,100
We went as far as anybody went in Cambodia.

1789
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:09,365
(gunfire)

1790
01:37:09,466 --> 01:37:10,865
And it was a hot LZ.

1791
01:37:10,966 --> 01:37:15,666
I got holes shot in my backpack.

1792
01:37:15,765 --> 01:37:17,166
I was laying on my face

1793
01:37:17,265 --> 01:37:19,399
and they were shooting
holes in my backpack,

1794
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,466
which means they missed my
head by maybe four inches.

1795
01:37:24,365 --> 01:37:27,699
I really didn't think I would
see the end of that week.

1796
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,966
(gunfire)

1797
01:37:30,065 --> 01:37:31,966
(indistinct chatter on radio)

1798
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,632
NARRATOR: The sight of American
troops crossing the border

1799
01:37:37,733 --> 01:37:41,666
into Cambodia reignited
the antiwar movement.

1800
01:37:41,765 --> 01:37:42,966
Come on, let's go!

1801
01:37:43,065 --> 01:37:45,166
NARRATOR: If the troops were coming home,

1802
01:37:45,265 --> 01:37:47,300
if the war was winding down,

1803
01:37:47,399 --> 01:37:51,300
why had Nixon decided to widen it?

1804
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:54,199
How could invading another country

1805
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:58,166
help bring peace to Southeast Asia?

1806
01:37:58,265 --> 01:37:59,966
HUNTLEY: The reaction on the campuses

1807
01:38:00,065 --> 01:38:01,565
was swift and predictable.

1808
01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:03,265
The students and many of their teachers

1809
01:38:03,365 --> 01:38:04,865
were against the president.

1810
01:38:04,966 --> 01:38:08,132
Princeton students called for
a nationwide student strike.

1811
01:38:08,233 --> 01:38:11,932
Antiwar rallies were planned
at Harvard, MIT, Indiana,

1812
01:38:12,033 --> 01:38:14,166
Purdue Universities and other colleges.

1813
01:38:19,432 --> 01:38:22,666
NARRATOR: On Monday morning, May 4, 1970,

1814
01:38:22,765 --> 01:38:25,265
some 2,000 students gathered on the commons

1815
01:38:25,365 --> 01:38:29,132
at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio.

1816
01:38:29,233 --> 01:38:32,966
Some were simply moving
from class to class.

1817
01:38:33,065 --> 01:38:36,466
Others planned to attend a
rally called to protest

1818
01:38:36,565 --> 01:38:39,166
Nixon's widening of the war

1819
01:38:39,265 --> 01:38:45,033
and the presence of the Ohio
National Guard on campus.

1820
01:38:45,132 --> 01:38:48,166
Governor James Rhodes had
called in the guardsmen

1821
01:38:48,265 --> 01:38:49,632
two days earlier

1822
01:38:49,733 --> 01:38:55,199
after a mob set the old
wooden ROTC building on fire

1823
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,199
and then prevented the fire department

1824
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,666
from putting out the flames.

1825
01:39:02,632 --> 01:39:06,666
Rhodes had compared protestors
to Nazi brownshirts

1826
01:39:06,765 --> 01:39:10,199
and promised to use "every
weapon to eradicate

1827
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:14,533
the worst sort of people
we harbor in America."

1828
01:39:14,632 --> 01:39:16,533
(bell clanging)

1829
01:39:19,166 --> 01:39:24,399
The guardsmen's weapons were
loaded with live ammunition,

1830
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,233
though no one in the crowd knew it.

1831
01:39:26,332 --> 01:39:29,500
MAN: Why do you have to have a gun?!
I don't understand!

1832
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,466
MAN (on megaphone): Leave
this area immediately!

1833
01:39:32,565 --> 01:39:36,332
NARRATOR: The students
were ordered to disperse.

1834
01:39:36,432 --> 01:39:38,065
They stood their ground.

1835
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:40,065
(shouting)

1836
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:47,332
Tear gas scattered some of them.

1837
01:39:47,432 --> 01:39:49,332
(shouting)

1838
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,466
The guardsmen seemed to fall back.

1839
01:40:10,565 --> 01:40:14,666
But then members of Troop G
wheeled around and opened fire

1840
01:40:14,765 --> 01:40:18,800
on students gathered in
and around a parking lot.

1841
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,600
(distorted gunshots echoing)

1842
01:40:50,265 --> 01:40:52,432
PROTESTOR: Somebody call for an ambulance!

1843
01:40:52,533 --> 01:40:54,100
(others shouting)

1844
01:40:54,199 --> 01:40:57,166
There's people dying down here!
Get an ambulance up here!

1845
01:40:57,265 --> 01:40:59,166
(indistinct shouting)

1846
01:41:03,832 --> 01:41:07,199
NARRATOR: 67 rounds in 13 seconds

1847
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:11,699
killed two young women and two young men...

1848
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:17,765
Including an ROTC scholarship student

1849
01:41:17,865 --> 01:41:20,332
who had simply been an onlooker.

1850
01:41:26,033 --> 01:41:30,733
SAM HYNES: That dead child on the ground

1851
01:41:30,832 --> 01:41:34,132
was one of ours.

1852
01:41:34,233 --> 01:41:37,533
If we could kill our own students,

1853
01:41:37,632 --> 01:41:42,733
uh, what had happened to our country?

1854
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,699
NARRATOR: Nine more students were wounded,

1855
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:51,765
one of whom was permanently paralyzed.

1856
01:42:04,132 --> 01:42:08,500
Several hundred angry,
grieving students sat down

1857
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:10,632
and demanded to know why the guardsmen

1858
01:42:10,733 --> 01:42:12,632
had fired on their friends.

1859
01:42:16,132 --> 01:42:18,966
MAN: Sir, you've got a
couple hundred students...

1860
01:42:19,065 --> 01:42:20,432
NARRATOR: An officer ordered them

1861
01:42:20,533 --> 01:42:22,300
to "disperse or we will shoot again."

1862
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:25,300
How long will you give us?
You've got five minutes.

1863
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:28,300
GLENN FRANK: Please listen to me right now!

1864
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:30,899
NARRATOR: Only the anguished pleas

1865
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,565
of geology professor Glenn
Frank averted further tragedy.

1866
01:42:35,666 --> 01:42:37,365
STUDENT: Talk, Dr. Frank. Talk.

1867
01:42:54,899 --> 01:42:58,033
(indistinct voices)

1868
01:43:02,765 --> 01:43:05,600
MIKE HEANEY: That just symbolized for me

1869
01:43:05,699 --> 01:43:09,565
what this war was doing to our culture.

1870
01:43:09,666 --> 01:43:11,432
These were kids on both sides,

1871
01:43:11,533 --> 01:43:14,300
young National Guard boys

1872
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:17,666
who had very little training
and probably scared,

1873
01:43:17,765 --> 01:43:19,899
and not well led

1874
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,800
and-and young men and
women on the other side

1875
01:43:21,865 --> 01:43:23,365
protesting the war out there

1876
01:43:23,466 --> 01:43:25,699
for, you know, idealistic reasons.

1877
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:28,332
And look at what happens

1878
01:43:28,432 --> 01:43:34,466
when we let things get as bad as they got.

1879

("Woodstock" by Joni Mitchell playing)

1880
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:38,865
NARRATOR: According to one national poll,

1881
01:43:38,966 --> 01:43:41,733
58% of the American people

1882
01:43:41,832 --> 01:43:44,666
thought the killings justified.

1883
01:43:47,632 --> 01:43:50,865
The parents of the dead ROTC student

1884
01:43:50,966 --> 01:43:53,600
received a flood of hate mail,

1885
01:43:53,699 --> 01:43:57,065
suggesting that they should be
grateful their boy was dead

1886
01:43:57,166 --> 01:44:01,733
since he'd been "just another communist."

1887
01:44:02,865 --> 01:44:06,832
(man speaking indistinctly over megaphone)

1888
01:44:06,932 --> 01:44:10,432
During the days that followed,
all across the country,

1889
01:44:10,533 --> 01:44:13,100
more than four million college students

1890
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:15,100
demonstrated against the war

1891
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:18,132

1910
01:45:18,533 --> 01:45:22,233
was now back home in Minnesota.

1911
01:45:22,332 --> 01:45:25,800
O'BRIEN: There was a huge march

1912
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:27,699
after the Kent State shootings in St. Paul,

1913
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:30,065
and I joined the march.

1914
01:45:30,166 --> 01:45:35,332
I just wanted to put my body
amidst these 100,000 people,

that word "no" being uttered by
my body, if not by my mouth,

1916

by just making that march.

1917
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:43,699
That same march I was doing in Vietnam

1918
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:46,065
that seemed senseless and purposeless

1919
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:47,300
and without direction,

1920
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:50,233
here it felt sensible and purposeful

1921
01:45:50,332 --> 01:45:53,666
and with direction, heading
for that state capital

1922
01:45:53,765 --> 01:45:57,065
to say no.

1923
01:45:57,166 --> 01:46:00,365

01:46:07,233 --> 01:46:09,666
was a student at Swarthmore College

1927
01:46:09,765 --> 01:46:13,832
near his hometown in eastern Pennsylvania.

1928
01:46:13,932 --> 01:46:18,365
EHRHART: And here's this
very famous photograph.

1929
01:46:18,466 --> 01:46:21,300
And I just looked at this thing.

1930
01:46:25,565 --> 01:46:27,065
And I came unglued.

1931
01:46:29,332 --> 01:46:32,699
I don't know how long I
sat down on the curb,

1932
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,233
and I don't know if I was
there for 15 minutes

1933
01:46:36,332 --> 01:46:37,765
or an hour and a half.

1934
01:46:37,865 --> 01:46:40,100
Just had a breakdown.

1935
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:43,865
Just crying, sobbing uncontrollably.

1936
01:46:43,966 --> 01:46:45,808
All I could think was, "It's
not enough to send us

1937
01:46:45,832 --> 01:46:48,166
"halfway around the world to die.

1938
01:46:48,265 --> 01:46:51,033
"Now they're killing us in the
streets of our own country.

1939
01:46:51,132 --> 01:46:52,500
I have to do something."

1940
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:55,666
And I finally...

1941
01:46:55,765 --> 01:46:57,565
whenever I finally cried myself out,

1942
01:46:57,666 --> 01:47:00,132
I got up and I joined the antiwar movement.

1943
01:47:03,399 --> 01:47:07,765
MUSGRAVE: I remember when the
kids were killed at Kent State,

1944
01:47:07,865 --> 01:47:10,565
and I thought,

1945
01:47:10,666 --> 01:47:13,832
"My God, we're killing
our own children now.

1946
01:47:13,932 --> 01:47:15,666
We've really gone mad."

1947
01:47:15,765 --> 01:47:17,065
And I wasn't...

1948
01:47:17,166 --> 01:47:20,065
That's when I was hiding from things.

1949
01:47:20,166 --> 01:47:22,100
I wasn't in anybody's movement then.

1950
01:47:22,199 --> 01:47:23,865
I was just drinking.

1951
01:47:25,966 --> 01:47:31,300
But that was one of the things that told me

1952
01:47:31,399 --> 01:47:33,699
America needed a wake-up call.
