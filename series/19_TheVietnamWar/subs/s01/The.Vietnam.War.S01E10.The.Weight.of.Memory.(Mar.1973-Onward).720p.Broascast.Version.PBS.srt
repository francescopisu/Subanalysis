35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,066
TIM O'BRIEN: They shared
the weight of memory.

36
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:11,432
They took up what others
could no longer bear.

37
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:18,932
Often, they carried each
other, the wounded or weak.

38
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,599
They carried infections.

39
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:22,800
They carried chess sets, basketballs,

40
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,033

41
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:28,699

(thunder rumbles)

44
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:39,466
They carried diseases, among
them malaria and dysentery.

45
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,832
They carried lice and ringworm
and leeches and paddy algae

46
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:50,233
and various rots and molds.

47
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,400
(rain pouring)

48
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:58,133
They carried the land itself...

49
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,066
Vietnam.

50
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:18,033
("My Country 'Tis of Thee" playing)

51
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:21,033
(mouths): Thank you.

52
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:27,400
(indistinct chatter)

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,966
(applause)

54
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:42,033
I can tell you, as I look back
over those months and years,

55
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:45,432
that we have met with the
wives and the mothers

56
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:49,966
of those of you who were prisoners of war,

57
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:55,800
they were and are the bravest,
most magnificent women

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,365
I have ever met in my life.

59
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:01,175
And now, if they will give me
my official toasting glass,

60
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,532
I will propose the toast.

61
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:05,032
Tonight...

62
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:08,365
NARRATOR: On May 24, 1973,

63
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:10,266
President Nixon invited

64
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:13,565
all the returned prisoners
of war and their families

65
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:15,432
to Washington.

66
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,500
Among them was Everett Alvarez,

67
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,932
the first pilot shot
down over North Vietnam.

68
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,153
EVERETT ALVAREZ: Sometimes,
I feel too much attention

69
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,165
was being paid to us, the P.O.W.s.

70
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,966
And what about the poor guys
that fought the war, those kids?

71
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:36,199
You know, that came home,
um, you know, amputees...

72
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,233
Uh, wounded with the injuries of war.

73
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:44,399
What about them?

74
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,033
We had our own challenges,

75
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,600
and the key was to, to face these

76
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:52,432
and yet maintain our, our honor.

77
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,333
That's what it was.

78
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,766
NARRATOR: Dr. Hal Kushner,

79
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,600
who had been a prisoner
for more than five years,

80
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,132
was unable to attend.

81
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:08,266
He was reunited with his
family at Valley Forge.

82
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:12,365
HAL KUSHNER: We flew to
Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

83
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:16,466
And I came off the helicopter
and I saw my wife...

84
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:22,165
...and my daughter,

85
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:23,966
who I hadn't seen since she was 2 1/2

86
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:26,033
And she was born in 1963.

87
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,199
So she was ten years old.

88
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,000
And my son, who I had never seen,

89
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,300
a week before his fifth birthday.

90
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,066
And he had on a little
tie and a little coat.

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,300
And my mom and dad.

92
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,266
And my mother was just
overcome with emotion.

93
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,165
And I just...

94
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:05,899
It was just an incomprehensible moment.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,233
And we hugged everybody.

96
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,132
And my little boy had a
flag, American flag.

97
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,500
NARRATOR: Like many P.O.W. marriages,

98
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,766
Hal Kushner's would not survive.

99
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,832
On March 29, 1973,

100
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:49,932
the last American troops
left South Vietnam.

101
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:53,665
Fewer than 200 Marines would remain,

102
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:56,365
assigned to guard consular offices

103
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,033
and the American Embassy

104
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:01,333
and other installations in Saigon.

105
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:07,165
Thousands of other Americans,
including C.I.A. agents,

106
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,300
diplomats, and contractors,

107
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,300
stayed behind, as well.

108
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,665
Over the next two years,

109
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:18,065
the forces of North and South Vietnam

110
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:22,199
would continue to savage one another.

111
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,699
And the Vietnamese people
would find themselves

112
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
back where they were at the beginning,

113
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,432
engulfed in an apparently endless civil war

114
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:38,132
and struggling over what kind
of future they would have.

115
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:46,300
For the United States, combat did end,

116
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,533
but controversy over the war did not.

117
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:54,333
TIM O'BRIEN: The best you
could say about Vietnam

118
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,833
was that certain blood was being shed

119
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:00,233
for uncertain reasons.

120
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,132
The blood was for sure...

121
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,766
the bodies, the widows, the orphans...

122
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:05,266
they were certain.

123
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:10,033
Nobody disputed it, the
dead people were dead.

124
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:14,699
But the rectitude of the
war was in great dispute.

125
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,332
Smart people in pinstripes

126
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:18,365
couldn't make their minds up about the war.

127
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,665
And I remember asking myself...

128
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,932
"Was it worth it?"

129
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:43,299
Maybe it was all a big
mistake, and, you know,

130
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,033
what, what was it all about?

131
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:49,066
We answered the call,

132
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:52,033
me and probably 2 1/2 million
other young Americans

133
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,299
who went over there.

134
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,166
It was a cause worth the effort.

135
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:03,765
And sometimes, things just don't turn out

136
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:06,133
and the guys in the white hats don't win.

137
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:08,600
But that doesn't make it, uh,

138
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,000
or doesn't basically take away

139
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,000
from the rectitude of the cause.

140
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,865
Subcommittee will come to order.

141
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:44,165
NARRATOR: Night after night
during the spring, summer,

142
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:46,700
and fall of 1973,

143
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,600
Americans watched the Nixon administration

144
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,000
slowly come apart.

145
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,633
Blackmail,

146
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:55,566
enemies lists,

147
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,633
dirty tricks,

148
00:09:57,732 --> 00:10:00,832
a vice president forced to resign,

149
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:03,865
perjury, cover-up,

150
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:07,265
abuse of presidential power,

151
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:10,566
secret White House tapes.

152
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,042
FRED THOMPSON: Mr.
Butterfield, are you aware

153
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,100
of the installation of
any listening devices

154
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,066
in the Oval Office of the president?

155
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:23,899
I was aware of listening devices.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,633
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:25,732 --> 00:10:27,165
Good evening.

158
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:29,832
The country tonight is in
the midst of what may be

159
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:32,399
the most serious constitutional crisis

160
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,000
in its history.

161
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,932
I told the president about the fact

162
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,299
that there were money demands being made

163
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,332
by the seven convicted defendants.

164
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,533
He asked me how much it would cost.

165
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,832
I told him I could only make an estimate

166
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:48,399
that it might be as high as
a million dollars or more.

167
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,399
He told me that that was no problem.

168
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,432
I had no prior knowledge
of the Watergate break-in.

169
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,765
I neither took part in nor knew about

170
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,700
any of the subsequent cover-up activities.

171
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,092
The one frustrating thing about...

172
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,432
about going to Canada was,

173
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,133
it left me outside the debate here.

174
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:11,932
I felt about... frustrated
with that till this day.

175
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:16,232
NARRATOR: As the Watergate
scandal unfolded, Jack Todd,

176
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:18,533
who had deserted the United States Army

177
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,666
and fled to Canada,

178
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:22,100
had never felt so bitter,

179
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,633
so disenchanted, so out of touch

180
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:27,633
with what the United States
seemed to have become.

181
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:33,466
He asked himself, "How did we
let this gang take charge?"

182
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:38,966
Then he made a decision
he would always regret:

183
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:43,165
he renounced his American citizenship.

184
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:45,232
JACK TODD: I thought it
was a political act,

185
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:48,232
renouncing my American citizenship.

186
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,832
And it was the stupidest thing
I have ever done in my life.

187
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:55,265
I'm a Canadian citizen and I'm proud of it.

188
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:59,100
It's a wonderful country, but
in here, I'm an American.

189
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,308
JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well,
the agreement was called

190
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:10,299
"The Agreement to End the War

191
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,000
and Restore Peace in Vietnam."

192
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,832
And, of course, that was a huge euphemism.

193
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:20,133
It neither ended the war
nor did it restore peace.

194
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:22,666
And if you look at the substance of it,

195
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,176
it really was a withdrawal agreement.

196
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,033
We were withdrawing our forces

197
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,033
in exchange for prisoners of war.

198
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:33,899
Those are the two matters that
were definitively settled

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,500
by the peace agreement.

200
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,633
We got our troops out and
we got our prisoners back.

201
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:47,200
The rest is just all a model
of nebulosity and vagueness

202
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,665
and didn't resolve a darn thing.

203
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:53,232
LAM QUANG THI:

204
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:23,799
NARRATOR: Neither North nor South Vietnam

205
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,165
had had any intention of
observing the cease-fire

206
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,732
called for in the peace
treaty signed in Paris

207
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:34,133
on January 27, 1973.

208
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:36,533
Even before the ink was dry,

209
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:41,000
each side had sought to claim
as much territory as it could

210
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,332
in what became known as
"the War of the Flags."

211
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:47,865
Within three weeks of the ceasefire,

212
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:53,299
there were already some 3,000
violations by both sides.

213
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,765
South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu,

214
00:13:56,865 --> 00:14:00,365
who now commanded the
fifth-largest army on Earth,

215
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:05,899
insisted the ARVN take and hold
every inch of South Vietnam,

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,966
something they had been unable to do

217
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:13,432
even with the help of nearly
600,000 American troops.

218
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,265
(explosion)

219
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,466
Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese
had attacked Tay Ninh,

220
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,732
near the Cambodian border,

221
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:23,666
hoping to establish a rival
capital of their own

222
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:25,700
in the South.

223
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,299
Hanoi installed surface-to-air
missiles near Khe Sanh,

224
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,533
just below the DMZ.

225
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:37,066
At the same time, ARVN
troops attacked enclaves

226
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,633
seized by the North Vietnamese.

227
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:43,865
The fighting went on for months.

228
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,165
Hanoi built a new paved highway

229
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:49,600
within South Vietnam itself,

230
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,899
down which convoys of 200 to 300 vehicles

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,765
soon began streaming:

232
00:14:55,865 --> 00:15:01,700
trucks, tanks, and heavy guns
moving in broad daylight.

233
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,633
And they began laying
down a giant oil pipeline

234
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:10,100
to fuel their vehicles in the South.

235
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,533
Nixon had privately
promised President Thieu

236
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:16,700
that he would retaliate
with American airpower

237
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,033
if Saigon ever seemed seriously threatened.

238
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,666
(gavel banging)

239
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:25,133
But in Washington, week by week,

240
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:28,265
as the secrets of Watergate
kept tumbling out,

241
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:34,566
Nixon's influence on Capitol
Hill steadily weakened.

242
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:39,265
In June of 1973, an energized Congress,

243
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:42,533
reflecting the views of a
majority of Americans,

244
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:45,832
voted to stop all military operations

245
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:50,732
in or over Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia

246
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:52,566
by August 15,

247
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:55,000
and insisted that they not be resumed

248
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,932
without congressional approval.

249
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:00,133
"America wants peace,"

250
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:03,732
Senator Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts declared.

251
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:09,500
"Congress is strong in its
resolve to end the killing."

252
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,765
LEWIS SORLEY: To abandon
the South Vietnamese,

253
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:16,600
when all we were providing
them at the end was money,

254
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,600
was reprehensible,

255
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,365
and disrespected the
sacrifices of all soldiers,

256
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:25,000
ours and the South Vietnamese.

257
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,700
I think the moral obligation,

258
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,865
that doesn't stem from a
philosophical commitment

259
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:31,200
to stopping communism.

260
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:34,265
Now it stems from our keeping our promises

261
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:38,332
to this erstwhile, unfortunate ally.

262
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,200
That they had us as the ally

263
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,533
where the other guys had the Soviet Union

264
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:45,100
and communist China.

265
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,865
Most Americans, I think,

266
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,875
would not like to hear it
said that the communists

267
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,100
were more faithful allies
than the United States.

268
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,365
But that is, in fact, what the case was.

269
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:57,865
ROBERT GARD: While one regrets
that we pulled the rug out,

270
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,732
in some respects,

271
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,865
I think the ultimate outcome
would've been the same.

272
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:08,633
Had we continued, it would have cost

273
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:11,532
probably more lives in the long term

274
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,200
with no change in the outcome.

275
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,500
NARRATOR: In the 18 bloody months

276
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,965
that followed the signing
of the peace accords,

277
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:24,099
South Vietnam's position became
more and more precarious.

278
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,532
But by the summer of 1974,

279
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:30,400
few Americans were paying attention.

280
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,066
They were riveted by what was
happening to their own country.

281
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:37,700
...to investigate fully and completely

282
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,500
whether sufficient grounds exist

283
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,799
for the House of Representatives

284
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,000
to exercise its constitutional power

285
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,432
to impeach Richard M. Nixon,

286
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:51,766
president of the United States of America.

287
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:54,500
SPEAKER: Mr. Danielson? -Aye.

288
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,633
SPEAKER: Mr. Drinan? -Aye.

289
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,566
SPEAKER: Mr. Rangel? -Aye.

290
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,566
SPEAKER: Ms. Jordan? -Aye.

291
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,200
SPEAKER: Mr. Lott? -No.

292
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,066
NARRATOR: On July 27, 1974,

293
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,900
the House Judiciary Committee recommended

294
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,799
that the president be impeached
for abusing his office.

295
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,566
On August 9, rather than face impeachment,

296
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:25,500
Richard Nixon became the first
president in American history

297
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,432
to resign.

298
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:29,365
NIXON: Always remember,

299
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:31,633
others may hate you,

300
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:35,400
but those who hate you don't win

301
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,365
unless you hate them,

302
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:41,299
and then you destroy yourself.

303
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,566
NARRATOR: At the presidential
palace in Saigon,

304
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,365
President Thieu closed his office door

305
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,766
and refused to see anyone.

306
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:52,532
He had staked South Vietnam's survival

307
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,799
on Nixon's personal pledge

308
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,066
that North Vietnamese
aggression would be met

309
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:00,333
by renewed American airpower.

310
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:05,000
Just a few days after the
new president, Gerald Ford,

311
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:06,633
moved into the White House,

312
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,700
Congress cut in half the funds

313
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,665
for military and economic assistance

314
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:15,266
Nixon had promised to deliver to Saigon.

315
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:20,833
Conditions in South Vietnam
continued to deteriorate.

316
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:23,432
With the American military presence gone,

317
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:28,066
one out of every five
civilian workers was jobless.

318
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:30,865
Prices soared.

319
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:37,633
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: There were
many mistakes made by the Americans,

320
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,700
but the biggest mistake

321
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:44,032
was in creating the sense of dependency.

322
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:47,599
Another mistake was in creating
an army in their own image,

323
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:54,000
an army that was used to
fighting a rich man's war.

324
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,566
And South Vietnam was too poor

325
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:58,400
to be able to sustain that kind of war.

326
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,599
NARRATOR: Thieu had steadily
grown more authoritarian,

327
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,700
closing newspapers, restricting
opposition parties,

328
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,566
selling political and
military appointments.

329
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:15,665
A coalition of Catholics
and Buddhists charged him

330
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:19,165
with corrupting every aspect
of South Vietnamese life,

331
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,333
and demanded his resignation.

332
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:24,266
Thousands of demonstrators

333
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:27,333
poured into the streets of Saigon.

334
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,333
Meanwhile, the chronically
underpaid South Vietnamese Army

335
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:37,665
had its pay cut further.

336
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:40,900
It began to disintegrate.

337
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,932
As many as 20,000 men were
deserting each month,

338
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:48,465
most heading home to try to
help their families survive

339
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:51,400
in such hard times.

340
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,599
Those ARVN who stood and fought

341
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,000
often had to do so without
the sophisticated weaponry

342
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:01,833
they'd been trained by
the Americans to use.

343
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,700
Much of the equipment Nixon had provided

344
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,833
was ill-suited to the war
the South was now waging,

345
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:11,799
aircraft for which there
were no trained pilots

346
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,633
or ground crews,

347
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,965
artillery and military vehicles

348
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,865
for which there were no spare parts.

349
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:23,965
And the U.S. Congress was
in no mood to provide more.

350
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:26,400
Fuel ran low.

351
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,432
So did ammunition.

352
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:33,266
Before long, artillerymen
in the Central Highlands

353
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:36,566
could fire just four shells a day,

354
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:42,266
and infantrymen were limited
to 85 bullets a month.

355
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,932
LAM QUANG THI:

356
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,799
NARRATOR: In November of 1974,

357
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,232
the Politburo and the Central
Military Committee met in Hanoi

358
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,599
to discuss strategy.

359
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,299
Some members urged caution.

360
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
They worried that if they tried

361
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,299
to push Saigon to the point
of collapse too quickly,

362
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,099
the Americans would return.

363
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,900
Final victory, they calculated,
would come in 1976.

364
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,566
Party First Secretary Le Duan didn't agree.

365
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:33,599
"Now that the United States
has pulled out," he said,

366
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,400
"it will be hard for them to jump back in."

367
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,766
He ordered a test attack

368
00:22:39,865 --> 00:22:43,266
to see if the Americans would
intervene with airpower

369
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:45,365
as they had during the Easter Offensive

370
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,165
2 1/2 years earlier.

371
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,700
(artillery fire)

372
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,133
In December 1974,

373
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:54,500
North Vietnamese forces
attacked Phuoc Long,

374
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,532
northeast of Saigon.

375
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:04,532
Within three weeks, they had
overrun the entire province

376
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:09,833
and had killed or captured
thousands of ARVN defenders.

377
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:14,900
The United States did nothing in response.

378
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,266
President Ford, preoccupied
with other problems...

379
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:24,365
inflation, unemployment,
tensions in the Middle East...

380
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:26,066
held a press conference

381
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:30,200
that offered the South
Vietnamese no comfort.

382
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,665
REPORTER: Are you considering

383
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:33,575
any additional measures,
beyond a supplemental,

384
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,566
of assistance to the South
Vietnamese government?

385
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,200
I am not anticipating

386
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,200
any further action beyond that supplemental

387
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,599
at this time.

388
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,299
NARRATOR: Washington
seemed to have no interest

389
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,365
in fulfilling the secret pledges

390
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:52,700
Nixon had repeatedly made to Thieu.

391
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,732
He was stunned.

392
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,799
STUART HERRINGTON: With the communist flag

393
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,133
planted in a provincial capital
just to the north of Saigon,

394
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,865
to me, the handwriting was on the wall.

395
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:08,333
I then communicated with
my family, and told them

396
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:11,633
that even though my tour was
supposed to take me till August,

397
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:13,633
that I would be home sooner.

398
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:18,365
And then I began to quietly,
one little box at a time,

399
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:21,865
mail my possessions out of Vietnam.

400
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:26,365
("Kashmir" by Led Zeppelin playing)

401
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,599
NARRATOR: The North
Vietnamese now undertook

402
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,766
a new assault on cities
in the Central Highlands,

403
00:24:31,865 --> 00:24:34,165
including Ban Me Thuot,

404
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:37,465
where their forces outnumbered
the over-extended ARVN

405
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:39,633
nearly six to one.

406
00:24:39,732 --> 00:24:43,333
("Kashmir" continues)

407
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:50,099
Ban Me Thuot fell in two days.

408
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,900
JAMES WILLBANKS: And here is
the second province to fall,

409
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,566
and it falls fairly quickly.

410
00:24:57,665 --> 00:24:59,133
At that point, they realize,

411
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:00,708
"Well, we don't have to wait till 1976,

412
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,965
we can go for it now."

413
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:04,000
NARRATOR: Hanoi was delighted

414
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:07,165
by the Americans' lack of response.

415
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:12,400
But all the previous offensives
Le Duan had set in motion...

416
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,400
in 1964,

417
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,200
in 1968,

418
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,432
in 1972...

419
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:23,333
had ended in failure.

420
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:27,032
This time, he turned to
General Vo Nguyen Giap,

421
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:30,000
the architect of the great
victory over the French

422
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,566
at Dien Bien Phu,

423
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:36,833
who had been sidelined
during the Tet Offensive.

424
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,432
HUY DUC:

425
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,633
NARRATOR: For weeks, the ARVN top command

426
00:26:00,732 --> 00:26:03,799
had warned Thieu that his
already weakened forces

427
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,700
were spread too thinly;

428
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:09,865
that it was no longer possible
to defend the entire country.

429
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:12,633
He had angrily resisted.

430
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:17,099
But now, suddenly, he changed his mind.

431
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,833
Thieu ordered his troops
to abandon the highlands,

432
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:22,700
to withdraw under fire

433
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,532
and then regroup in order
to retake Ban Me Thuot.

434
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:29,133
It would have been a near-impossible task

435
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:31,865
with a carefully worked-out plan.

436
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,000
Thieu had none.

437
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,700
(gunfire)

438
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,700
(explosion)

439
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,200
The result would be disaster.

440
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:46,099
PHAM DUY TAT:

441
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:01,732
NARRATOR: Within a week,

442
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:05,432
Pleiku and Kon Tum were in enemy hands.

443
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,665
BAO NINH:

444
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:25,232
According to Western
diplomats here in Saigon,

445
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,900
the South Vietnamese are
quitting the Central Highlands

446
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,799
because they hope to avoid a complete rout.

447
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,460
The withdrawal is said to be an attempt

448
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:35,465
to save men and equipment
that may become sorely needed

449
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:38,465
in other, more heavily populated
parts of the country.

450
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:42,965
PHAM DUY TAT:

451
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:08,465
NARRATOR: As the ARVN fled south,

452
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:11,865
400,000 civilians fled with them.

453
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:21,133
The enemy blocked the main roads

454
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,500
so that they had to take
a disused back road.

455
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,633
Thousands died,

456
00:28:26,732 --> 00:28:29,200
killed by North Vietnamese shells

457
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:30,965
and machine gun fire,

458
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:33,566
trampled by fellow refugees,

459
00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:36,200
run over by retreating tanks,

460
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,532
blown apart by South Vietnamese bombs

461
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:44,200
dropped by pilots who
mistook them for the enemy.

462
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:48,299
Reporters called it the "Convoy of Tears."

463
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,165
Then, Hue fell.

464
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:12,133
NARRATOR: On March 29, 1975,

465
00:29:12,232 --> 00:29:15,232
the North Vietnamese entered Danang,

466
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,599
South Vietnam's second-largest city.

467
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:23,266
Civilians and soldiers alike tried to flee.

468
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:32,400
(crowd clamoring)

469
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,700
"Danang was not captured," an
American reporter remembered.

470
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,932
"It disintegrated in its own terror."

471
00:29:41,032 --> 00:29:42,799
(plane engine starting)

472
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:53,566
LE MINH KHUE:

473
00:30:57,732 --> 00:31:00,599
NARRATOR: On the same beach
where the U.S. Marines

474
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,232
had landed nearly ten years earlier,

475
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,900
beginning America's combat
involvement in Vietnam,

476
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,066
16,000 ARVN soldiers fought for space

477
00:31:11,165 --> 00:31:14,500
with 75,000 terrified civilians

478
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,432
aboard an improvised fleet of
freighters and fishing boats

479
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:23,365
headed south for Cam Ranh
Bay, Vung Tau, and Saigon;

480
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:28,633
anywhere they thought Northern
troops might not follow.

481
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:38,465
Thousands drowned struggling
to reach the boats.

482
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:41,833
Thousands more were killed by enemy shells

483
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:44,599
raining down on the beach.

484
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:47,766
HO HUU LAN:

485
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:03,432
NARRATOR: Danang, Tam Ky,

486
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:05,799
Quang Ngai, Qui Nhon,

487
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,865
Nha Trang, Cam Ranh Bay.

488
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:13,232
The North Vietnamese kept
moving closer and closer

489
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,032
to Saigon.

490
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:20,266
It was stunning to sit there in Saigon,

491
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:22,965
writing the daily ledes

492
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,766
on the fall of all these places.

493
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:29,865
You just were overwhelmed

494
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:32,732
with ten years' worth of history

495
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:36,932
and seeing all of it come unglued.

496
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:38,232
(explosion)

497
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,900
FRANK SNEPP: At the end of March,

498
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,799
18 North Vietnamese divisions,

499
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,232
with five in reserve,

500
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,500
were now arrayed

501
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,500
against, basically, six
South Vietnamese divisions.

502
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,432
The manpower imbalance

503
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:59,232
was about three or four to one,
in favor of the communists.

504
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,365
This was breathtaking.

505
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:04,200
NARRATOR: The North Vietnamese now decided

506
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:06,099
to move against Saigon

507
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,965
and take it before Ho Chi
Minh's birthday on May 19.

508
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:13,732
It became clear to Thomas Polgar,

509
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:16,799
the C.I.A. station chief in Saigon,

510
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,566
that the time had come to begin
preparing for an evacuation.

511
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,432
There were still some 5,000
Americans in Saigon,

512
00:33:24,532 --> 00:33:26,266
and there were also as many

513
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:29,865
as 200,000 South Vietnamese
and their families

514
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:33,633
who had cooperated with the United States.

515
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:37,566
But Ambassador Graham Martin disagreed.

516
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:39,965
He was a resolute Cold Warrior,

517
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:42,266
who had been appointed to reassure Thieu

518
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:45,000
of continuing American backing,

519
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:47,700
and his feelings had only been intensified

520
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,500
by the death of his son in Vietnam.

521
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,766
He had not been appointed ambassador,

522
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,500
he had told an aide,

523
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,133
to "give Vietnam away to the communists."

524
00:33:58,232 --> 00:34:01,733
The C.I.A. was being alarmist, he said.

525
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:04,000
There would be no attack on Saigon,

526
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:07,333
and, therefore, no evacuation.

527
00:34:07,432 --> 00:34:12,565
President Thieu also continued
to insist all was not lost.

528
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,733
The ARVN were ready to
"fight on to the last bullet

529
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:18,632
and the last grain of rice," he said.

530
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:23,365
Just 40 miles east of Saigon,

531
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:25,599
North Vietnamese forces attacked

532
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,865
the town of Xuan Loc on Highway One,

533
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:33,099
the last obstacle on their way to Saigon.

534
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,900
Although they were
outnumbered and outgunned,

535
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,132
the South Vietnamese commander
refused to retreat.

536
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:44,900
He was determined to keep
the enemy from his capital.

537
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,699
REPORTER: You're certain
that you can hold Xuan Loc?

538
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,233
Surely, surely.

539
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,965
I am certain to you.

540
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:53,766
I am sure with you I can hold Xuan Loc.

541
00:34:53,865 --> 00:34:56,900
Even the enemies uses, you
know, the double forces

542
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,833
or maybe three time more than my forces.

543
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,166
But no problem, sir.

544
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,699
No problem.

545
00:35:04,065 --> 00:35:06,666
FORD: A vast human tragedy

546
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:11,465
has befallen our friends
in Vietnam and Cambodia.

547
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:13,166
NARRATOR: On April 10,

548
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:16,833
President Ford appealed to a
joint session of Congress

549
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:19,632
for emergency aid to Saigon.

550
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:22,233
If they refused and Saigon fell,

551
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,865
Congress, not the White
House, should take the blame.

552
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:28,632
Under five presidents and 12 Congresses,

553
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:32,965
the United States was engaged in Indochina.

554
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:36,532
Millions of Americans served,

555
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:38,632
thousands died,

556
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:43,465
and many more were wounded,
imprisoned, or lost.

557
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:47,965
NARRATOR: The president asked
Congress for $722 million

558
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,766
in military aid.

559
00:35:49,865 --> 00:35:51,632
There was no applause.

560
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:55,065
Most legislators, and their constituents,

561
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,233
thought it was too late
to make any difference.

562
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:03,365
In the end, Congress voted
against any military aid.

563
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:06,000
BUI DIEM: I didn't think that it is good

564
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:10,300
for a big nation like the U.S.
to behave like that.

565
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
Because by that time,

566
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:15,865
we didn't ask for the blood
of American soldiers.

567
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:20,300
I mean, the last minute, they
washed their hands like that.

568
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,333
It is not up to a diplomat
to use strong words

569
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:24,800
against the American,

570
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,166
but I felt deeply sorry about it.

571
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:33,599
SNEPP: We broke every rule in
the book to get people out,

572
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:36,666
the young officers did,

573
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:42,000
while the ambassador continued to stonewall

574
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,233
both the embassy and Washington.

575
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:48,199
NARRATOR: Evacuation plans
were finally drawn up.

576
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,465
There were four options:

577
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:56,965
sealift by cargo ships anchored
in the port of Saigon,

578
00:36:57,065 --> 00:37:00,333
airlift by commercial airliner,

579
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:03,166
a military airlift,

580
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:05,532
and, as a last resort,

581
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:08,065
evacuation by flights of helicopters

582
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:11,266
to a flotilla of U.S. Navy ships

583
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:14,132
in the South China Sea.

584
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:18,500
Ambassador Martin continued
to show little interest.

585
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,465
The slightest sign that the United States

586
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:23,400
would abandon South Vietnam, he said,

587
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,233
would produce panic in the streets.

588
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,400
(gunfire and explosions)

589
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,199
On April 21,

590
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,766
Xuan Loc finally fell to
the North Vietnamese.

591
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:38,965
The ARVN had valiantly held
on for 12 bloody days.

592
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:44,833
Highway One was now open
all the way to Saigon.

593
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:50,099
That evening, President Thieu resigned.

594
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:55,233
Four days later, the C.I.A.
would spirit Thieu to Taiwan,

595
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,266
where an American emissary brought him

596
00:37:57,365 --> 00:38:00,065
a private message from President Ford.

597
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:03,965
It was not a good time for
him to visit America.

598
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:07,766
Antiwar feelings were too strong.

599
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:11,199
"It is so easy to be an enemy
of the United States,"

600
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,699
Thieu said,

601
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,400
"but so difficult to be a friend."

602
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,365
News of Thieu's resignation

603
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,333
had sent thousands of panicked Vietnamese

604
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:24,565
rushing to Tan Son Nhut Airport,

605
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:27,266
hoping to get out of their country.

606
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:32,800
Some had exit visas; many did not.

607
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,465
Marines did what they
could to establish order.

608
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:42,000
Master Sergeant Juan Valdez was
the noncommissioned officer

609
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:46,500
in charge of Marine Corps
Security Guards in Saigon.

610
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,632
He had been one of the first Marines

611
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:52,699
to land in Vietnam in 1965.

612
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,833
VALDEZ: People were trying
to bribe the Marines.

613
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:59,333
You know, they were bringing
money out there, jewelry,

614
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:01,532
to get them out of the country.

615
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,476
I think just about every
Marine that was at the gate

616
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,465
encountered this type of bribes.

617
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:07,900
But they had to refuse them, yeah, yeah.

618
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,266
NARRATOR: Duong Van Mai Elliott's family

619
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:14,065
had fled Hanoi in 1954,

620
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:17,166
leaving behind her older sister, Thang,

621
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:20,099
who had joined Ho Chi Minh's forces.

622
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,500
Now, 20 years later,

623
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:25,532
with the North Vietnamese
closing in on Saigon,

624
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:27,400
they were faced with the prospect

625
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,565
of fleeing once again.

626
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:33,932
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: My
mother didn't want to leave.

627
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:36,766
She said she didn't want
to be a refugee again.

628
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:39,500
She had been a refugee too many times.

629
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,400
Plus, my sister Thang was about to arrive

630
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,932
and meet us after all these years.

631
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:50,965
She said she wanted to stay and see Thang.

632
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:54,432
My father was determined to leave,

633
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:58,532
because he was afraid that if
we stayed, we'd be killed.

634
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:03,166
He got mad at my mother, and they argued,

635
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:05,465
but in the end, my mother yielded

636
00:40:05,565 --> 00:40:09,099
to his, uh, insistence that we should...
they should leave.

637
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:13,166
PHAN QUANG TUE: I knew that
the end was approaching.

638
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:16,365
When you are at the center of the storm,

639
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:18,532
you have to get out.

640
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:23,766
When I myself and my immediate family,

641
00:40:23,865 --> 00:40:25,766
and my father and his immediate family,

642
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:28,400
went to the Tan Son Nhut Airport,

643
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,365
through the whole thing I said,
"This is crazy, you know.

644
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:35,932
Why, why do we have to leave
under these conditions?"

645
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:37,500
It was so humiliating.

646
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,833
And I carry that humiliation
with me to the United States.

647
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:45,632
When I get in line to sign up for a job,

648
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:47,632
you know, I was a...

649
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:51,099
I remind them of the war in Vietnam,

650
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,766
which the Americans hate.

651
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:56,800
You have to lose a nation and a dream

652
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,400
to feel... to feel that humiliation.

653
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:12,233
NGUYEN THANH TUNG:

654
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:24,000
JEAN-MARIE CROCKER: We
have always sent a wreath

655
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:28,166
to his grave at Arlington.

656
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:31,233
Partly in remembrance, of course, of him,

657
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:35,233
but also thinking, if other
grieving people are there,

658
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:39,400
or just people that are
visiting to pay their respects,

659
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,733
that it's good for them
to know that people are,

660
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,132
that the soldiers are remembered.

661
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:02,932
FORD: Today...

662
00:43:03,032 --> 00:43:07,000
America can regain the sense of pride

663
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:09,865
that existed before Vietnam.

664
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:14,733
But it cannot be achieved
by refighting a war

665
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:18,833
that is finished as far
as America is concerned.

666
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,833
(applause)

667
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:24,666
(explosion)

668
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:27,965
NARRATOR: On April 27, 1975,

669
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:31,233
rockets landed in the heart of Saigon.

670
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:34,432
It was the signal for the
North Vietnamese to begin

671
00:43:34,532 --> 00:43:36,833
their main assault on the city.

672
00:43:36,932 --> 00:43:40,300
They attacked from five sides,

673
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,400
"like a hurricane," their commander said.

674
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,065
The White House ordered
all American cargo ships

675
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,532
to sail out to sea without waiting

676
00:43:49,632 --> 00:43:51,865
to take on any passengers.

677
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:55,666
There now could be no organized sealift.

678
00:43:55,766 --> 00:44:00,032
(Jimi Hendrix Experience's "All
Along the Watchtower" playing)

679
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:09,833
NARRATOR: When the
communists began shelling

680
00:44:09,932 --> 00:44:14,000
the seaside town of Vung Tau,
just southeast of Saigon,

681
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,965
thousands of terrified people

682
00:44:16,065 --> 00:44:18,465
clambered into any vessel they could find

683
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:21,400
in hope of rescue by the Americans.

684
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,000
Before the exodus ended,

685
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:27,132
more than 60,000 refugees from Vung Tau

686
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:28,865
would be picked up.

687
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:32,166
But thousands more were left behind,

688
00:44:32,266 --> 00:44:35,932
floating helplessly at sea.

689
00:44:36,032 --> 00:44:37,965
At the American Embassy,

690
00:44:38,065 --> 00:44:41,032
Ambassador Martin cabled Henry Kissinger,

691
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:42,699
now secretary of state,

692
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,000
that "It is the unanimous opinion

693
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,965
"of the senior personnel here

694
00:44:47,065 --> 00:44:52,065
that there will be no direct
or serious attack on Saigon."

695
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:54,333
SNEPP: A lot of us began to wonder

696
00:44:54,432 --> 00:44:57,500
whether he had lost grip on reality.

697
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,400
He had come down with
pneumonia in the final days.

698
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,865
He was terribly enfeebled.

699
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:07,932
And it's possible this
affected his judgment.

700
00:45:08,032 --> 00:45:12,000
NARRATOR: Evacuation planners
had quietly designated

701
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:13,865
two spots within the embassy

702
00:45:13,965 --> 00:45:16,532
as potential helicopter landing zones...

703
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:19,833
a courtyard that could
accommodate large choppers,

704
00:45:19,932 --> 00:45:22,233
and the helipad on the embassy roof,

705
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,800
meant for smaller ones.

706
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,166
An old tamarind tree stood in
the center of the courtyard.

707
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:32,733
Again and again, the Marines
asked Ambassador Martin

708
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,800
for permission to cut it down

709
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,065
so as not to interfere with
the lift-offs and landings

710
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:41,132
they were certain would soon have to begin.

711
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:43,965
He always refused.

712
00:45:44,065 --> 00:45:47,632
That tree was a symbol of
American resolve, he said.

713
00:45:47,733 --> 00:45:51,666
Cutting it down would
send the wrong message.

714
00:45:51,766 --> 00:45:54,632
Meanwhile, General Duong Van Minh,

715
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:56,300
who had been part of the coup

716
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,000
that overthrew President
Diem 12 years earlier,

717
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:03,800
was sworn in as the new
president of South Vietnam.

718
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,699
He called for an immediate cease-fire

719
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,766
and asked that Americans
leave within 24 hours.

720
00:46:12,865 --> 00:46:14,065
(explosion)

721
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:17,166
NARRATOR: On April 29,
at 3:58 in the morning,

722
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:20,000
North Vietnamese rockets began falling

723
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:22,300
on Tan Son Nhut Airport.

724
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,632
The North Vietnamese were just...

725
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:26,300
walking these shells...

726
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,565
these big 130-millimeter artillery shells

727
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,132
all over the airfield,

728
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:32,000
destroying the runway, basically.

729
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:33,365
It was close enough

730
00:46:33,465 --> 00:46:35,075
that you could hear the
incoming go overhead.

731
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:36,166
(whistling, explosion)

732
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:38,465
NARRATOR: Two Marine guards,

733
00:46:38,565 --> 00:46:42,365
Lance Corporal Darwin Judge,
of Marshalltown, Iowa,

734
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:46,666
and Corporal Charles McMahon,
Jr., of Woburn, Massachusetts,

735
00:46:46,766 --> 00:46:48,900
were killed in the barrage...

736
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,300
the last American servicemen
to die in Vietnam.

737
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,400
♪ All along the watchtower...

738
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,599
VALDEZ: I still blame the ambassador.

739
00:46:58,699 --> 00:46:59,932
This shouldn't have happened.

740
00:47:00,032 --> 00:47:02,099
You know, if the ambassador
had taken action

741
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:05,365
and gotten people out of there,
which he was supposed to,

742
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:08,432
this would have never happened.

743
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:10,932
NARRATOR: The runways were cratered

744
00:47:11,032 --> 00:47:12,733
and blocked by wrecked planes,

745
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:16,965
littered with jettisoned
bombs and fuel tanks.

746
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:21,632
The Americans had run out
of evacuation options.

747
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:24,666
It was time to call in the helicopters

748
00:47:24,766 --> 00:47:27,065
from the offshore fleet.

749
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,432
There was no way

750
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:30,532
all of the remaining South Vietnamese

751
00:47:30,632 --> 00:47:32,833
could be evacuated.

752
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:36,733
(chain saws buzzing)

753
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:39,500
The tamarind tree in the embassy compound

754
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,465
was finally hacked down

755
00:47:41,565 --> 00:47:44,465
so helicopters could begin landing.

756
00:47:44,565 --> 00:47:47,699
VALDEZ: So they had to chop
this big tamarind tree down,

757
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,199
cut it in pieces, tow it away.

758
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,199
And then they had to get
the fire department

759
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,965
to wash all the debris and everything

760
00:47:55,065 --> 00:47:56,365
so when the choppers land,

761
00:47:56,465 --> 00:47:58,065
they wouldn't suck up all those debris

762
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,599
into the, uh, into the engines.

763
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:03,500
NARRATOR: Just after 11:00 a.m.,

764
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,233
a prearranged signal to
evacuate was broadcast

765
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:10,233
over a special radio
frequency in the capital:

766
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:14,965
"The temperature in Saigon
is 105 degrees and rising."

767
00:48:15,065 --> 00:48:16,675
("White Christmas" by
Tennessee Ernie Ford playing)

768
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,432
♪ I'm dreaming...

769
00:48:18,532 --> 00:48:20,932
NARRATOR: It was supposed to
be followed by Bing Crosby

770
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:23,166
singing "White Christmas."

771
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:25,833
But the disc jockey
couldn't find the record

772
00:48:25,932 --> 00:48:31,065
and played Tennessee Ernie
Ford's version instead.

773
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:35,032
Americans and Vietnamese with proper papers

774
00:48:35,132 --> 00:48:37,865
gathered at pre-arranged collection points

775
00:48:37,965 --> 00:48:40,465
and boarded convoys of buses.

776
00:48:40,565 --> 00:48:44,400
Angry South Vietnamese beat
on the sides of the vehicles

777
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,865
as they moved through the crowded streets

778
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,000
to the airport.

779
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:53,532
Philip Caputo, now covering
the fall of Saigon,

780
00:48:53,632 --> 00:48:56,365
was among the evacuees.

781
00:48:56,465 --> 00:48:59,532
PHILIP CAPUTO: We were evacuated
from Tan Son Nhut Air Base.

782
00:48:59,632 --> 00:49:03,599
But we drove past the embassy,
and you just saw this scrum,

783
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:08,465
this horde of people pressing
up against the walls,

784
00:49:08,565 --> 00:49:11,400
and Marines standing on the wall

785
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,766
and gun-butting people
to, uh, to keep them...

786
00:49:16,865 --> 00:49:19,199
to keep them from pouring over the walls.

787
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,166
NARRATOR: The evacuees at
the airport were divided

788
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:25,099
into helicopter teams of 50 each,

789
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,333
and led down a long hallway to the tarmac.

790
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,833
Someone in Caputo's group joked

791
00:49:30,932 --> 00:49:36,000
about finally seeing "light
at the end of the tunnel."

792
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:38,065
The choppers take off.

793
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:41,632
And they're flying, uh...
flying toward the coast.

794
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:45,266
And you could look down
and all you could see,

795
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:47,532
all around Saigon, all around the airfield,

796
00:49:47,632 --> 00:49:51,099
were just these plumes of
smoke from burning buildings,

797
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,532
from exploding artillery shells.

798
00:49:53,632 --> 00:49:56,432
And I'll never forget going
over that coastline,

799
00:49:56,532 --> 00:50:00,465
seeing the entire 7th
Fleet... dozens and dozens...

800
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:03,565
and this enormous fleet
out there like that.

801
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:08,532
And I just remember this sense
of, of disbelief, completely.

802
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:11,699
Disbelief and relief at the same time.

803
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,040
VALDEZ: There were anywhere
from 10,000 to 12,000 people

804
00:50:17,065 --> 00:50:19,300
surrounding the embassy.

805
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,699
We're supposed to get
Americans out of there.

806
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,032
And we were supposed to
get South Vietnamese

807
00:50:25,132 --> 00:50:27,900
that worked for us in the embassy.

808
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,233
The C.I.A. was behind us,

809
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:31,608
and they were pointing at the people

810
00:50:31,632 --> 00:50:33,465
who were supposed to get out.

811
00:50:33,565 --> 00:50:36,266
But every time you reached out
to grab a specific individual,

812
00:50:36,365 --> 00:50:38,132
other people were grabbing your hands

813
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:40,199
and trying to pull you
down with them, you know,

814
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,699
so that you could help them out.

815
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,365
SNEPP: Some Americans had left so rapidly,

816
00:50:45,465 --> 00:50:48,032
they'd left the radios behind.

817
00:50:48,132 --> 00:50:52,166
So their Vietnamese friends
were on the radios

818
00:50:52,266 --> 00:50:54,032
begging to be rescued.

819
00:50:54,132 --> 00:50:56,400
"I'm Han, the driver."

820
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,632
"I'm Mr. Ngoc, your translator."

821
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:04,465
I realized what the Americans
had often done in Vietnam.

822
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:09,500
They had forgotten that
these were human beings.

823
00:51:11,632 --> 00:51:13,932
My experience in Vietnam

824
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:20,166
had often been like a
B-52 strike from on high.

825
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:24,099
I never had to confront the
consequences of my action.

826
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:27,333
I could just let the bomb doors open

827
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:31,666
and still remain detached.

828
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:34,000
NARRATOR: Elsewhere in the embassy,

829
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:38,166
Marines frantically destroyed
classified documents.

830
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:41,266
VALDEZ: The top of the roof
had two big incinerators

831
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:43,800
right underneath the helicopter pad.

832
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,365
And the Marines burned classified material

833
00:51:46,465 --> 00:51:48,432
around the clock.

834
00:51:48,532 --> 00:51:50,599
But to my understanding, even when we left,

835
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:54,333
there was still classified
material left behind.

836
00:51:54,432 --> 00:51:58,000
SNEPP: Well, when the choppers
finally began coming in,

837
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:00,833
the downdraft ripped open those bags

838
00:52:00,932 --> 00:52:03,233
and there was classified material

839
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:06,599
all over the parking lot.

840
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:08,532
When the North Vietnamese arrived,

841
00:52:08,632 --> 00:52:14,333
they apparently Scotch-taped
that material back together

842
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:16,599
and it became a blood
list that they could use

843
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:19,932
to track down people, Vietnamese,
who'd worked for us.

844
00:52:20,032 --> 00:52:23,800
NARRATOR: Embassy officials
dumped bags of currency

845
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,266
into an oil drum

846
00:52:25,365 --> 00:52:27,032
and set it afire.

847
00:52:27,132 --> 00:52:29,800
Millions of dollars in contingency funds

848
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,000
went up in smoke.

849
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:35,733
"This will be the final
message from Saigon station,"

850
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:39,900
the C.I.A. chief Thomas
Polgar wired to Washington.

851
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,833
"It has been a long fight and we have lost.

852
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:47,766
"Those who fail to learn from history

853
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:49,833
"are forced to repeat it.

854
00:52:49,932 --> 00:52:54,166
"Let us hope that we will not
have another Vietnam experience

855
00:52:54,266 --> 00:52:56,932
"and that we have learned our lesson.

856
00:52:57,032 --> 00:53:00,365
Saigon signing off."

857
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:06,632
More than 50 U.S. helicopters

858
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:09,800
now crisscrossed the sky over Saigon,

859
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,333
picking up evacuees from
designated rooftops,

860
00:53:13,432 --> 00:53:15,666
as well as the embassy,

861
00:53:15,766 --> 00:53:19,000
ferrying them to the fleet far out at sea,

862
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:20,900
then returning for more.

863
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,365
Some desperate South Vietnamese officers

864
00:53:25,465 --> 00:53:27,300
also commandeered helicopters

865
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,666
for themselves and their families,

866
00:53:29,766 --> 00:53:31,699
dangerously crowding the decks

867
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,300
of the American aircraft carriers.

868
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,233
There was no room for them.

869
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,932
WILLBANKS: The image
that remains in my mind

870
00:53:40,032 --> 00:53:41,965
is the picture of the helicopter

871
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:44,800
being pushed over the side of the carrier.

872
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,032
The helicopter was everything in Vietnam.

873
00:53:48,132 --> 00:53:50,932
I mean, it was dust-off, it was resupply,

874
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:53,365
it was fire support, it was everything.

875
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:58,500
All I could think of was:
what a waste, what a waste.

876
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:01,032
As I watched that all unfold,

877
00:54:01,132 --> 00:54:05,132
I, I felt responsible.

878
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:06,365
I was ashamed.

879
00:54:06,465 --> 00:54:08,432
We had told these people

880
00:54:08,532 --> 00:54:10,699
that we would be there to support them

881
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,300
and we were not.

882
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,166
SNEPP: About 9:15 on the last night,

883
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:24,400
Polgar came and he said,
"We've got to all leave.

884
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,108
"We've been ordered by
headquarters to leave.

885
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:27,733
Let's go."

886
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:31,932
NARRATOR: Ambassador Martin had
wanted to be the last man to leave.

887
00:54:32,032 --> 00:54:35,733
But at about 4:00 in the
morning of April 30,

888
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:40,099
a CH-46 touched down on the embassy roof.

889
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:44,132
Its pilot carried orders
from the president himself.

890
00:54:44,233 --> 00:54:48,032
Martin was to leave, now.

891
00:54:48,132 --> 00:54:50,532
"I guess this is it," he said.

892
00:54:50,632 --> 00:54:52,699
As Martin was helped aboard,

893
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,365
he was handed the furled American flag

894
00:54:55,465 --> 00:54:59,632
that had flown from the
flagstaff the previous day.

895
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:05,632
He lifted off at 4:58 a.m.
and headed out to sea.

896
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:09,699
President Ford had also
ordered that from then on,

897
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,099
only Americans would be evacuated.

898
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:18,000
Tens of thousands of South Vietnamese

899
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:19,965
would be left behind,

900
00:55:20,065 --> 00:55:22,699
and more than 400 were still waiting

901
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,400
in the embassy courtyard.

902
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,132
Time and again, they had been assured

903
00:55:27,233 --> 00:55:31,099
helicopters were on the
way to pick them up.

904
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:33,766
HERRINGTON: I was directed

905
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:37,065
to stay with the Vietnamese
and keep them warm,

906
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:39,766
meaning, "Don't give any hint

907
00:55:39,865 --> 00:55:45,432
that all these promises we
made to them are for naught."

908
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:47,632
I felt sick at heart, I had a hard time.

909
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:49,599
It was dark out, so I didn't have to worry

910
00:55:49,699 --> 00:55:52,733
about looking these folks in the eye.

911
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:55,865
But I made my excuse and,
um, (speaks Vietnamese)...

912
00:55:55,965 --> 00:55:57,833
"I have to go to the bathroom."

913
00:55:57,932 --> 00:56:01,199
And left into the landscaping,

914
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,099
circuitous route to the
back door of the embassy,

915
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:05,833
to the chancery building,

916
00:56:05,932 --> 00:56:08,233
and made my way to the roof.

917
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:13,099
NARRATOR: Some 129 Marines
remained in the compound.

918
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:14,400
They did their best

919
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,833
to pull back into the embassy
and up onto the roof

920
00:56:17,932 --> 00:56:19,400
without alerting the Vietnamese

921
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,565
that they were about to be left behind.

922
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:25,699
VALDEZ: We locked ourselves
inside the embassy

923
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,099
and found ourselves up on the roof.

924
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:31,565
It was actually after we
got up on top of the roof

925
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:33,608
that we started seeing all
these masses of people.

926
00:56:33,632 --> 00:56:36,000
Some of them had already come
on the embassy compound.

927
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:37,599
And they broke those doors.

928
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:40,500
And that's how those, uh, South Vietnamese

929
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:44,032
were able to get inside the embassy.

930
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:50,965
RON NESSEN: This action closes a
chapter in the American experience.

931
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:55,532
The president asks all
Americans to close ranks,

932
00:56:55,632 --> 00:56:59,833
to avoid recriminations about the past,

933
00:56:59,932 --> 00:57:02,766
and to work together on the great tasks

934
00:57:02,865 --> 00:57:05,865
that remain to be accomplished.

935
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:10,365
Now, to, uh, give you details of
the events of the past few days

936
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:12,233
and to answer your questions,

937
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:13,699
Secretary of State Kissinger.

938
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,108
REPORTER: Mr. Secretary, are you confident

939
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,333
that all the Americans
that wanted to come out

940
00:57:17,432 --> 00:57:19,132
are out of Saigon,

941
00:57:19,233 --> 00:57:20,733
and do you have any idea

942
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:22,608
of the number of Americans
who remain behind?

943
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:25,266
I have no idea of the number of Americans

944
00:57:25,365 --> 00:57:26,932
that remain behind.

945
00:57:27,032 --> 00:57:30,465
Uh, I am confident that every American

946
00:57:30,565 --> 00:57:31,833
who wanted to come out,

947
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:35,032
uh, is, is out.

948
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:38,032
What we need now in this country

949
00:57:38,132 --> 00:57:42,132
is to heal the wounds and
to put Vietnam behind us.

950
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:46,900
NARRATOR: An aide handed Kissinger a note.

951
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,932
It said that the 129 Marines

952
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:54,199
had somehow been left
behind on the embassy roof.

953
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,666
Helicopters were dispatched
to pick them up.

954
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,666
Eventually, only Sergeant Valdez

955
00:58:00,766 --> 00:58:05,465
and his ten-man embassy
security unit remained.

956
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,032
But then, an hour went by

957
00:58:08,132 --> 00:58:10,632
with no sign of any more helicopters.

958
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:13,199
Their radio was dead.

959
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,400
The Marines had no way to contact the fleet

960
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,833
to see if anyone was on the way.

961
00:58:19,932 --> 00:58:21,632
VALDEZ: Everything stopped.

962
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:23,432
We're being left behind.

963
00:58:23,532 --> 00:58:26,333
People are sitting around in
their own little thoughts,

964
00:58:26,432 --> 00:58:29,132
uh, not doing too much talking.

965
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:32,233
We pretty much decided that we
were going to fight it out,

966
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:33,666
use these small arms that we had

967
00:58:33,766 --> 00:58:36,099
and just fight it to the end.

968
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:40,965
We started seeing two puffs of
smoke coming from out at sea.

969
00:58:41,065 --> 00:58:44,199
As they got closer, then
we were able to determine

970
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,932
that they were helicopters.

971
00:58:46,032 --> 00:58:48,199
It was a relief.

972
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,675
One of the Marines, I believe
it was Staff Sergeant Sullivan,

973
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:51,766
my assistant,

974
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:53,465
grabbed me and started pulling me in

975
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:55,032
as the ramp's going up.

976
00:58:55,132 --> 00:59:01,599
NARRATOR: At 7:53 a.m., April 30, 1975,

977
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:06,000
the last helicopter lifted
off the embassy roof.

978
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:08,632
Master Sergeant Juan Valdez

979
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:13,365
was the last American to climb aboard.

980
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:15,865
(sirens wailing)

981
00:59:15,965 --> 00:59:18,266
The government of South Vietnam

982
00:59:18,365 --> 00:59:20,900
had less than five hours to live.

983
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:30,065
President Minh spoke from
the palace at mid-morning.

984
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:33,865
He urged what was left of
the South Vietnamese Army

985
00:59:33,965 --> 00:59:35,699
to stop fighting.

986
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:40,365
"We are here waiting," he said,
"to hand over the authority

987
00:59:40,465 --> 00:59:44,632
in order to stop useless bloodshed."

988
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,833
NARRATOR: At noon,

989
01:01:07,932 --> 01:01:11,766
North Vietnamese tanks
flying Viet Cong flags

990
01:01:11,865 --> 01:01:13,666
smashed their way through the gates

991
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:15,699
of the presidential palace.

992
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:21,032
Within hours, victorious soldiers

993
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:24,932
were calling Saigon "Ho Chi Minh City."

994
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:32,266
All over town, ARVN soldiers
tore off their uniforms

995
01:01:32,365 --> 01:01:36,032
and did their best to melt into the crowds.

996
01:01:36,132 --> 01:01:38,300
Families burned their photo albums

997
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,166
so there would be no evidence

998
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:45,166
that their sons or husbands had
ever fought for South Vietnam.

999
01:01:47,465 --> 01:01:51,599
Colonel Tran Ngoc Toan had
been fighting the communists

1000
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:53,699
for more than 12 years,

1001
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,666
and had survived terrible wounds

1002
01:01:55,766 --> 01:01:58,432
suffered at the Battle of Binh Gia.

1003
01:01:58,532 --> 01:02:00,833
He was leading what was left

1004
01:02:00,932 --> 01:02:04,099
of the 4th South Vietnamese
Marine Battalion

1005
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:09,199
near Bien Hoa, 20 miles east of Saigon.

1006
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,000
His commanding general had long since

1007
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:16,365
bribed his way aboard a
ship and fled the country.

1008
01:02:16,465 --> 01:02:21,166
An American friend had urged
Toan to get out, too.

1009
01:02:21,266 --> 01:02:23,166
He refused.

1010
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,865
NARRATOR: A South Vietnamese police officer

1011
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:11,065
walked to a memorial built to honor

1012
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:14,599
those who had fallen
defending South Vietnam.

1013
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:17,733
He saluted it, stood there for a time,

1014
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:21,333
and then shot himself in the head.

1015
01:03:21,432 --> 01:03:24,699
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: It
was a very messy ending

1016
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,632
to a very messy war.

1017
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:30,065
I felt a sense of relief,

1018
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:33,965
but also a sense of sadness when it ended.

1019
01:03:34,065 --> 01:03:38,932
I felt relief that the
killing, destruction,

1020
01:03:39,032 --> 01:03:41,199
finally came to an end,

1021
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,400
and I didn't care which side won.

1022
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,865
To me, Vietnam won.

1023
01:03:45,965 --> 01:03:47,833
Vietnamese people won

1024
01:03:47,932 --> 01:03:51,166
because they finally could live normally.

1025
01:03:51,266 --> 01:03:56,800
And sad because I saw that
my family was again fleeing,

1026
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,865
and this time from their homeland,

1027
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:02,333
and their future was very uncertain.

1028
01:04:02,432 --> 01:04:05,465
And I knew that with the
communists taking over,

1029
01:04:05,565 --> 01:04:09,965
Vietnamese society would
be changed drastically.

1030
01:04:10,065 --> 01:04:12,565
NARRATOR: Lo Khac Tam had been fighting

1031
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:16,300
in the North Vietnamese Army
for nearly ten years now,

1032
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,699
beginning with the bloody
clash in the la Drang Valley,

1033
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,900
the first full-scale battle
of the American war.

1034
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,432
Now he was watching that war's end.

1035
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,465
LO KHAC TAM:

1036
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:05,565
In Vietnam, we finally have
reached the end of the tunnel,

1037
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:07,900
and there is no light there.

1038
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,500
What is there, perhaps, was
best said by President Ford,

1039
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,932
"a war that is finished."

1040
01:05:14,032 --> 01:05:17,565
LEWIS SORLEY: I happened
to be at a conference

1041
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:19,032
at Tufts University,

1042
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:21,733
and the dean there was a former ambassador

1043
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,699
who spoke to us late on that day,

1044
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,099
as it turned out, the fateful day.

1045
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:29,432
And he said he had just
come back from Washington,

1046
01:05:29,532 --> 01:05:33,166
where the spring weather was beautiful

1047
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:35,865
and the daffodils were in bloom,

1048
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:42,266
to Boston, where it was gloomy
and gray as it was in his heart.

1049
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:47,300
And people hissed him and booed him.

1050
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,699
I was there in uniform.

1051
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,065
One of my great regrets
was that I did not get up

1052
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:55,099
and start laying waste to those people

1053
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,500
who disrespected the ambassador

1054
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:59,565
and his sorrow at the
fall of South Vietnam.

1055
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:02,065
I got a call from the V.V.A.W.
national office

1056
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,733
from some friends of
mine from the old days.

1057
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,833
They were having a big celebration,

1058
01:06:06,932 --> 01:06:09,965
drinking booze and, "Ah, well,
it's a great day, isn't it?"

1059
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:13,000
And I said, "Are you nuts?"

1060
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:16,000
I said, "No, it's not a great day."

1061
01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:19,000
To see America leaving like that,

1062
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:23,766
after we'd given almost 60,000
of our sons and daughters,

1063
01:06:23,865 --> 01:06:27,365
that wasn't something to celebrate.

1064
01:06:27,465 --> 01:06:29,333
I knew we were abandoning

1065
01:06:29,432 --> 01:06:32,900
millions of South Vietnamese
that had trusted us,

1066
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,800
thrown in their lot with us.

1067
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,032
That wasn't anything to celebrate.

1068
01:06:39,132 --> 01:06:41,500
I thought it was just one
of the saddest moments

1069
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,233
I'd ever seen in American history.

1070
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,365
So when some future
politician, for some reason,

1071
01:06:47,465 --> 01:06:51,465
feels the need to drag
this country into a war,

1072
01:06:51,565 --> 01:06:53,365
he might come out here to Arlington,

1073
01:06:53,465 --> 01:06:55,565
and stand maybe right over there somewhere,

1074
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:59,532
to make his announcement and
to tell what he has in mind.

1075
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:09,199
BAO NINH:

1076
01:08:29,265 --> 01:08:31,966
(cheering)

1077
01:08:32,065 --> 01:08:35,432
TOM VALLELY: In Vietnam, the
Communist Party is triumphant.

1078
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:38,199
And they have exceptionalism, too.

1079
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,065
And their exceptionalism gets in their way

1080
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:45,832
just like our exceptionalism
got in our way.

1081
01:08:45,932 --> 01:08:49,733
So they unify the country
in a military sense,

1082
01:08:49,832 --> 01:08:54,199
and then they, they don't really
unify the country after that.

1083
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:58,800
They, they try, but they fail.

1084
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:01,666
NARRATOR: In the end,
there was no bloodbath

1085
01:09:01,765 --> 01:09:04,733
on the scale many had feared,

1086
01:09:04,832 --> 01:09:09,300
but hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of people in the countryside

1087
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:11,000
are thought to have been killed

1088
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:16,332
in individual acts of revenge
or political retaliation.

1089
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:19,500
Those who had served the Thieu regime,

1090
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,166
from generals to ordinary clerks,

1091
01:09:22,265 --> 01:09:25,899
were required to undergo re-education.

1092
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,832
Enlisted men were assured

1093
01:09:27,932 --> 01:09:31,500
they would only have to submit
to three days of "study."

1094
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,132
Officers needn't attend
for more than a month.

1095
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,466
PHAM DUY TAT:

1096
01:10:08,065 --> 01:10:10,199
NARRATOR: A million and a half people

1097
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:15,000
are believed to have undergone
some form of indoctrination.

1098
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:19,565
ARVN cemeteries were
bulldozed or padlocked,

1099
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:22,565
as if the memory of an
independent South Vietnam,

1100
01:10:22,666 --> 01:10:25,466
and those who had died for that cause,

1101
01:10:25,565 --> 01:10:28,699
could both be obliterated.

1102
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,320
DUONG VAN MAI ELLIOTT: The communists,

1103
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,733
in their effort to erase vestiges

1104
01:10:33,832 --> 01:10:35,432
of the former regime,

1105
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:39,533
have not allowed the South Vietnamese

1106
01:10:39,632 --> 01:10:43,033
who lost their sons in the war

1107
01:10:43,132 --> 01:10:48,600
to mourn, to have their graves
and to honor their memory.

1108
01:10:48,699 --> 01:10:52,265
It caused a division
that lasts to this day,

1109
01:10:52,365 --> 01:10:57,265
that the winners would not
accommodate the losers

1110
01:10:57,365 --> 01:10:59,300
in some way.

1111
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:05,399
NGUYEN NGOC:

1112
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:17,765
NARRATOR: After 30 years of war,
much of Vietnam lay in ruins.

1113
01:11:17,865 --> 01:11:20,500
Three million people are
thought to have died,

1114
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,800
North and South.

1115
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:26,565
Still more had been wounded.

1116
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:30,899
Thousands of children fathered
by American servicemen

1117
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,832
had been left behind.

1118
01:11:33,932 --> 01:11:40,265
Villages needed to be rebuilt,
land had to be reclaimed.

1119
01:11:40,365 --> 01:11:43,733
Cities were choked with refugees.

1120
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:46,632
Millions were without work.

1121
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:51,000
President Ford imposed an economic embargo.

1122
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:56,966
Washington refused to recognize
the new government of Vietnam.

1123
01:11:57,065 --> 01:11:59,800
But Le Duan and his allies on the Politburo

1124
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,233
remained optimistic.

1125
01:12:02,332 --> 01:12:05,565
"Nothing more can happen,"
one committee member said.

1126
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:08,265
"The problems we face now are trifles

1127
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:11,632
compared to those in the past."

1128
01:12:11,733 --> 01:12:14,500
Le Duan resolved, with Soviet help,

1129
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,565
to turn all of Vietnam into what he called

1130
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:22,466
an "impregnable outpost
of the socialist system."

1131
01:12:22,565 --> 01:12:26,765
Hanoi forcibly collectivized
agriculture in the South,

1132
01:12:26,865 --> 01:12:29,233
virtually abolished capitalism,

1133
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:31,832
nationalized industries,

1134
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:34,365
and appointed planners to run it all

1135
01:12:34,466 --> 01:12:37,899
along strict communist lines.

1136
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,033
The result would be economic disaster.

1137
01:12:42,132 --> 01:12:47,000
Inflation rose as high as 700% a year.

1138
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,765
People starved.

1139
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,666
BAO NINH:

1140
01:13:18,765 --> 01:13:21,632
NARRATOR: To compound its problems,

1141
01:13:21,733 --> 01:13:25,300
Vietnam found itself, once again, at war,

1142
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:28,932
caught between the interests
of the two communist powers

1143
01:13:29,033 --> 01:13:31,932
that had once been its staunchest allies,

1144
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:34,565
China and the Soviet Union.

1145
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:35,899
(gunshot, man yells)

1146
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,065
After the brutal Maoist regime in Cambodia

1147
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:40,666
raided border areas,

1148
01:13:40,765 --> 01:13:44,832
Vietnamese troops, with Soviet
arms and encouragement,

1149
01:13:44,932 --> 01:13:49,533
crossed the frontier in
1978 and overthrew it.

1150
01:13:49,632 --> 01:13:51,765
A frustrating ten-year

1151
01:13:51,865 --> 01:13:54,365
counterinsurgency campaign followed

1152
01:13:54,466 --> 01:13:59,100
that some called "Vietnam's Vietnam."

1153
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,033
Before it was over,

1154
01:14:01,132 --> 01:14:04,932
the Vietnamese would lose
some 50,000 more men,

1155
01:14:05,033 --> 01:14:10,100
almost as many as the Americans
had lost in their war.

1156
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:11,500
(explosions and gunfire)

1157
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,466
Meanwhile, communist China,

1158
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:17,432
determined to punish Vietnam
for invading Cambodia,

1159
01:14:17,533 --> 01:14:20,132
and to show Moscow it would
not have a free hand

1160
01:14:20,233 --> 01:14:21,932
in Southeast Asia,

1161
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:26,533
sent 85,000 troops storming
into northern Vietnam.

1162
01:14:26,632 --> 01:14:29,899
They devastated areas along the border

1163
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,800
before the Vietnamese pushed them back.

1164
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,365
ED BRADLEY: The South China Sea, 1978.

1165
01:14:39,466 --> 01:14:43,100
They come ashore at the
rate of 10,000 a month,

1166
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,666
much faster than the United
States or any other nation

1167
01:14:45,765 --> 01:14:47,565
is willing to accept them.

1168
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:51,666
They come chasing an elusive memory:

1169
01:14:51,765 --> 01:14:53,865
the promise of America.

1170
01:14:53,966 --> 01:14:59,265
NARRATOR: A million and a half people
would eventually flee Vietnam:

1171
01:14:59,365 --> 01:15:02,365
supporters of the old Saigon regime,

1172
01:15:02,466 --> 01:15:04,399
refugees from the renewed fighting

1173
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,466
along the Cambodian border,

1174
01:15:06,565 --> 01:15:09,332
and ethnic Chinese residents of Vietnam,

1175
01:15:09,432 --> 01:15:13,832
whom the new government had
treated especially harshly.

1176
01:15:13,932 --> 01:15:18,100
Hundreds of thousands of
the boat people died.

1177
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:20,432
Others suffered in refugee camps

1178
01:15:20,533 --> 01:15:22,832
throughout Southeast Asia.

1179
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:32,132
Some 400,000 eventually made it to America,

1180
01:15:32,233 --> 01:15:34,966
where they settled in nearly every state,

1181
01:15:35,065 --> 01:15:37,865
industrious, entrepreneurial,

1182
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:41,699
more eager to take part in
American political life

1183
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,300
and more likely to become American citizens

1184
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:48,800
than other immigrant groups from Asia.

1185
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:52,865
But for that first generation
of Vietnamese Americans,

1186
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:58,000
memories of their homeland
could never be erased.

1187
01:15:59,132 --> 01:16:04,265
TRAN NGOC CHAU (speaking English):

1188
01:16:45,132 --> 01:16:46,865
KARL MARLANTES: I remember I was

1189
01:16:46,966 --> 01:16:49,000
with one of my daughters, uh... (chuckles)

1190
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,332
at an intersection and
some guy came up behind me

1191
01:16:51,432 --> 01:16:54,466
and blasted the horn.

1192
01:16:54,565 --> 01:16:56,666
When I came to my senses,

1193
01:16:56,765 --> 01:16:58,699
I was on the hood of his car,

1194
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,765
about to, trying to kick his windshield in.

1195
01:17:01,865 --> 01:17:04,105
And I went... and there's
people all over looking at me.

1196
01:17:04,132 --> 01:17:05,800
I mean, this is crazy. This is crazy.

1197
01:17:05,899 --> 01:17:07,741
And then I started going,
"Well, this is weird."

1198
01:17:07,765 --> 01:17:10,065
I sort of slinked back
to my car and, you know,

1199
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,841
my daughter, she's about
four, looking at me,

1200
01:17:11,865 --> 01:17:12,976
"Wow, what's that all about?"

1201
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,400
And I go, "What is that all about?"

1202
01:17:14,432 --> 01:17:15,565
I had no idea.

1203
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:18,033
I had no idea that it was
even related to the war.

1204
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:23,932
NARRATOR: It is as old as war itself.

1205
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:27,000
The ancient Greeks called
it "divine madness."

1206
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:34,865
It was "soldier's heart" in the Civil War,

1207
01:17:34,966 --> 01:17:39,565
"shell shock" during the First World War

1208
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:42,000
and "combat fatigue" in the Second.

1209
01:17:45,966 --> 01:17:49,033
Following Vietnam, it was given a new name,

1210
01:17:49,132 --> 01:17:52,466
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder...

1211
01:17:52,565 --> 01:17:55,199
PTSD.

1212
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:59,932
MARLANTES: And what you learn
is that PTSD doesn't go away.

1213
01:18:00,033 --> 01:18:03,300
But now if someone honks the horn,

1214
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:04,800
and it startles me, I'm still...

1215
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:06,500
My heart rate's still going to go up,

1216
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,608
and it'll be there for five
minutes and I'm like this.

1217
01:18:08,632 --> 01:18:11,265
But, "Ten, nine, it's just some asshole,

1218
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:13,466
"he's had a bad day at
work, eight, seven, six,

1219
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:15,408
"it's not... no one's
shooting at you, you're safe,

1220
01:18:15,432 --> 01:18:17,041
it's seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one."

1221
01:18:17,065 --> 01:18:18,600
And I can control it,

1222
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:19,966
whereas I couldn't do it before

1223
01:18:20,065 --> 01:18:22,132
because I didn't understand
what was going on.

1224
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:26,166
NARRATOR: Adding to the
pain many veterans felt

1225
01:18:26,265 --> 01:18:30,432
was their country's eagerness
to forget the war.

1226
01:18:30,533 --> 01:18:33,065
There were few parades.

1227
01:18:34,565 --> 01:18:40,166
In many ways, everyone came
home from Vietnam alone.

1228
01:18:41,966 --> 01:18:43,565
When I got home,

1229
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:45,033
and my mom and dad were there,

1230
01:18:45,132 --> 01:18:47,600
my brothers and sisters, my wife.

1231
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,399
And we're embracing and...

1232
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:56,699
I couldn't relate to my wife
or my mother what I had seen,

1233
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,100
what I had done in Vietnam.

1234
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:02,432
I could've talked to my brothers about it,

1235
01:19:02,533 --> 01:19:05,699
but they, they knew I didn't want to.

1236
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,632
And so it just, uh,
something unsaid, you know.

1237
01:19:08,733 --> 01:19:10,699
"Welcome back, Vince.

1238
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,765
You've been through the, the
wringer, but welcome back."

1239
01:19:16,699 --> 01:19:18,966
NARRATOR: In April 1981,

1240
01:19:19,065 --> 01:19:21,632
a panel of eight architects and sculptors

1241
01:19:21,733 --> 01:19:23,699
gathered in an airplane hangar

1242
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:27,365
at Andrews Air Force
Base outside Washington.

1243
01:19:27,466 --> 01:19:30,300
They were there to choose
the winning design

1244
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,466
for a Vietnam memorial
for the nation's capital

1245
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:36,300
from more than 1,400 submissions.

1246
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:44,132
The memorial was the brainchild
of a single stubborn veteran,

1247
01:19:44,233 --> 01:19:47,166
a former rifleman named Jan Scruggs,

1248
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:50,666
who, after suffering a
frightening flashback,

1249
01:19:50,765 --> 01:19:53,533
told his wife he wanted
to "build a memorial

1250
01:19:53,632 --> 01:19:56,865
"to all the guys who served in Vietnam.

1251
01:19:56,966 --> 01:20:00,000
It'll have the name of everyone killed."

1252
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,600
With other veterans,

1253
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:04,533
he established a nonprofit organization,

1254
01:20:04,632 --> 01:20:07,233
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund,

1255
01:20:07,332 --> 01:20:11,399
and went to work collecting
money and making plans.

1256
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:16,065
In the end, some 650,000 Americans

1257
01:20:16,166 --> 01:20:19,632
would contribute more than $8 million.

1258
01:20:19,733 --> 01:20:24,399
The judges chose submission number 1026.

1259
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,632
(applause)

1260
01:20:25,733 --> 01:20:27,632
SUSAN PETERSON: 21-year-old Maya Ying Lin,

1261
01:20:27,733 --> 01:20:29,800
an architect student at Yale University,

1262
01:20:29,899 --> 01:20:32,065
got the $20,000 prize.

1263
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:34,000
Her winning design is comprised

1264
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,565
of two elongated triangles
of black granite,

1265
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:39,132
inset into a hill and
inscribed with the names

1266
01:20:39,233 --> 01:20:44,000
of the 57,692 men and women
who died in the war.

1267
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:48,399
Lin, whose parents emigrated
from China in the 1940s to Ohio,

1268
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,966
thought she wouldn't win

1269
01:20:50,065 --> 01:20:52,500
because her design was too
strange and too strong.

1270
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,733
I had a general idea that I
wanted to describe a journey,

1271
01:20:55,832 --> 01:20:59,000
a journey that would make
you experience death

1272
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,565
and where you'd have to be an observer,

1273
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:04,332
where you could never really
fully be with the dead.

1274
01:21:04,432 --> 01:21:06,476
It wasn't going to be something
that was going to say,

1275
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,265
"It's all right, it's all over,"

1276
01:21:08,365 --> 01:21:09,432
because it's not.

1277
01:21:09,533 --> 01:21:12,332
NARRATOR: Differences about the war

1278
01:21:12,432 --> 01:21:16,500
colored people's feelings
about the proposed design.

1279
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:20,000
Some who believed that the war
had been unjust and immoral

1280
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:23,666
feared the monument was
somehow meant to glorify it.

1281
01:21:25,132 --> 01:21:28,600
Others feared its stark
design failed to do justice

1282
01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:32,565
to the cause for which
Americans had fought.

1283
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:35,265
The writer Tom Wolfe dismissed it

1284
01:21:35,365 --> 01:21:38,365
as "a tribute to Jane Fonda."

1285
01:21:38,466 --> 01:21:40,442
TOM CARHART: I don't care
about artistic perceptions.

1286
01:21:40,466 --> 01:21:42,500
One needs no artistic education

1287
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,065
to see this memorial design for what it is:

1288
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,666
a black scar.

1289
01:21:47,765 --> 01:21:49,600
Black, the universal color

1290
01:21:49,699 --> 01:21:52,100
of sorrow and shame and degradation

1291
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:54,932
in all races and all societies worldwide.

1292
01:21:55,033 --> 01:21:58,033
In a hole, hidden as if out of shame.

1293
01:21:58,132 --> 01:22:00,800
JANICE CONNALLY: Mr. Chairman,
members of the commission,

1294
01:22:00,899 --> 01:22:02,500
I speak as an individual,

1295
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,100
a member from the general public.

1296
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:09,733
What are the memorable images
from the war in Vietnam?

1297
01:22:09,832 --> 01:22:11,332
A guerrilla,

1298
01:22:11,432 --> 01:22:13,932
shot at point-blank range.

1299
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:16,565
A naked girl, afire, running,

1300
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,800
screaming down a dusty road.

1301
01:22:20,332 --> 01:22:22,365
I think Maya Lin was right

1302
01:22:22,466 --> 01:22:25,765
in going beyond these kinds of images.

1303
01:22:25,865 --> 01:22:30,632
She resolved all the pain and
conflict of that unhappy time

1304
01:22:30,733 --> 01:22:35,399
in a simple message of
sacrifice and quiet heroism.

1305
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:40,300
NARRATOR: In an official vote of
support for Maya Lin's design,

1306
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:44,033
the American Gold Star
Mothers spoke for many.

1307
01:22:44,132 --> 01:22:45,932
"Nowadays," they said,

1308
01:22:46,033 --> 01:22:48,899
"patriotism is a complicated matter.

1309
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,033
"But perhaps that is why

1310
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,033

1311
01:22:53,132 --> 01:22:56,500
"merging gently with the sloping earth

"convey the only point about the war

1313
01:22:59,132 --> 01:23:01,199
"on which people may agree:

1314
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:04,533
that those who died should be remembered."

RION CAUSEY: As you got out of the
car and you approached the wall,

1321
01:23:58,365 --> 01:24:02,932
the intensity of which, it grabs you...

1322
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:05,600
You go up...

1323
01:24:08,899 --> 01:24:10,332
You see the names,

1324
01:24:10,432 --> 01:24:11,733
you touch the names...

1325
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:16,365

SORLEY: I did not like

1329
01:24:37,399 --> 01:24:39,132
the Vietnam wall.

1330
01:24:39,233 --> 01:24:43,000
I considered it an ugly, black ditch

1331
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,765
and that it said the only people that, uh...

1332
01:24:46,865 --> 01:24:49,000
to be commemorated are the dead,

1333
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:53,565
not because they're heroes,
but because they're victims.

1334
01:24:55,065 --> 01:24:58,000
I didn't go.

1335
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,265
Until...

1336
01:25:01,365 --> 01:25:03,466
one year...

1337
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:06,600
they were going to put the
wreath in front of...

1338
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:08,733
the name of my roommate.

1339
01:25:08,832 --> 01:25:11,466
(voice breaking): I had, I had to go.

1340
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:14,899
So I've gone every year since then

1341
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,800
to remember those we, we lost.

1342
01:25:18,899 --> 01:25:20,800
And, um...

1343
01:25:20,899 --> 01:25:22,432
I walk down to the far left

1344
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:27,332
and I run my fingers over that name.

1345
01:25:34,065 --> 01:25:36,233
You go to that wall,

1346
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:39,432
and even my son, who was nine
years old when I first took him,

1347
01:25:39,533 --> 01:25:42,565
and you see over 58,000 names,

1348
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:47,932
and you know that unwritten
behind or beside each name,

1349
01:25:48,033 --> 01:25:52,132
there's a mother or a father
or a wife or a daughter

1350
01:25:52,233 --> 01:25:56,332
whose lives were forever shattered

1351
01:25:56,432 --> 01:25:59,100
by that damn war.

1352
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,033
NANCY BIBERMAN: I've been to
the wall, more than once.

1353
01:26:08,132 --> 01:26:10,000
When I look back at the war and, you know,

1354
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,100
think of the horrible things, you know,

1355
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:15,600
we said to, you know,
vets who were returning,

1356
01:26:15,699 --> 01:26:19,466
you know, calling them
"baby killers" and worse,

1357
01:26:19,565 --> 01:26:25,399
I, you know... I feel very sad about that.

1358
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,065
I can only say that, you
know, we were kids, too,

1359
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:31,500
you know, just like they were.

1360
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,332
It grieves me, it grieves me today.

1361
01:26:34,432 --> 01:26:37,966
It pains me to think of
the things that I said

1362
01:26:38,065 --> 01:26:39,533
and that we said.

1363
01:26:39,632 --> 01:26:43,132
And I'm sorry.

1364
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,533
I'm sorry.

1365
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,800
(bird calling)

1366
01:26:58,666 --> 01:27:00,399
CAROL CROCKER: I didn't want to go.

1367
01:27:01,733 --> 01:27:08,365
And it was a beautiful summer morning.

1368
01:27:08,466 --> 01:27:13,765
Went to the Lincoln Memorial first.

1369
01:27:13,865 --> 01:27:18,100
A comforting place to be.

1370
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:20,233
And...

1371
01:27:20,332 --> 01:27:25,265
And then crossed the street and
walked in towards the entrance.

1372
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,666
And, as you know, at first, you
can't really see the wall,

1373
01:27:28,765 --> 01:27:32,365
and you're coming down
into the grassy hill.

1374
01:27:32,466 --> 01:27:37,265
And when I caught sight of it,

1375
01:27:37,365 --> 01:27:40,500
I literally lost my breath.

1376
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:44,300
Of course, I wept.

1377
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:50,765
I had help getting lifted
up so I could touch it.

1378
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:53,565
I found my brother's name.

1379
01:27:57,733 --> 01:27:59,733
I looked at my brother's name

1380
01:27:59,832 --> 01:28:04,033
in the company of all those other people.

1381
01:28:06,132 --> 01:28:08,733
There was sadness.

1382
01:28:08,832 --> 01:28:13,300
But now he wasn't alone, either.

1383
01:28:13,399 --> 01:28:16,899
He was in the company of people.

1384
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,600
And he was there

1385
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:24,065
for people to know and to think about.

1386
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,832
And he wasn't forgotten.

1387
01:28:25,932 --> 01:28:27,632
And he wasn't lost.

1388
01:28:27,733 --> 01:28:32,033
It was incredibly healing
and freeing for me.

1389
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:42,033
As I was walking towards it
from the reflecting pool,

1390
01:28:42,132 --> 01:28:44,932
there were so many names on those walls.

1391
01:28:45,033 --> 01:28:48,966
And all of a sudden, my throat swole up,

1392
01:28:49,065 --> 01:28:50,899
and I thought, "I can't do this.

1393
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,100
I can't do this right now."

1394
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:56,432
And I collapsed.

1395
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:03,899
And all the tears I'd been holding back...

1396
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:07,932
I didn't cry, I sobbed.

1397
01:29:08,033 --> 01:29:11,932
I was on my knees, sobbing.

1398
01:29:12,033 --> 01:29:15,500
I couldn't stop, I couldn't get my breath.

1399
01:29:18,265 --> 01:29:23,265
And I was so grateful to
God that it was there.

1400
01:29:23,365 --> 01:29:26,199
I thought,

1401
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,932
"This is going to save lives.

1402
01:29:29,033 --> 01:29:31,932
This is going to save lives."

1403
01:30:16,065 --> 01:30:18,399
VALLELY: I was struck by its beauty

1404
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,365
and how at peace Vietnam
looked from the air.

1405
01:30:21,466 --> 01:30:24,065
I had a sense of anticipation in my body.

1406
01:30:24,166 --> 01:30:26,399
I had worked hard for
many months with others

1407
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:30,932
to organize this trip and
to negotiate our arrival

1408
01:30:31,033 --> 01:30:32,142
with the Vietnamese government.

1409
01:30:32,166 --> 01:30:33,199
How do you do?

1410
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,432
Toi ten Tom Vallely.

1411
01:30:34,533 --> 01:30:37,265
VALLELY: I came back to
Vietnam as a veteran

1412
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:39,500
to learn from history,

1413
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,565
and to see how the place had changed.

1414
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:44,565
(laughter)

1415
01:30:44,666 --> 01:30:46,733
There had only been 200 Americans

1416
01:30:46,832 --> 01:30:48,399
that had been to Vietnam since 1975,

1417
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,100
and most of them had been correspondents

1418
01:30:50,132 --> 01:30:51,699
and had been in the South.

1419
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,300
(clamoring, horn honking)

1420
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:57,265
Many of the kids, you'd
walk down the street,

1421
01:30:57,365 --> 01:30:59,065
and they'd go, "Lien Xo, lien Xo,"

1422
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:00,565
which means "Russian."

1423
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:02,033
And you'd go, "Nolien Xo,

1424
01:31:02,132 --> 01:31:04,600
toi la nguoi My"... "I'm an American."

1425
01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:07,265
And their face would light up,
and they'd go, "American!"

1426
01:31:07,365 --> 01:31:09,265
And it would spread like wildfire

1427
01:31:09,365 --> 01:31:11,300
through the schoolyard, or the street

1428
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:13,265
that Americans were here.

1429
01:31:13,365 --> 01:31:15,765
And they'd come out and they'd
be very, very friendly.

1430
01:31:15,865 --> 01:31:19,432
(laughter)

1431
01:31:19,533 --> 01:31:20,632
Goodbye.

1432
01:31:20,733 --> 01:31:23,233
Goodbye! Goodbye!

1433
01:31:23,332 --> 01:31:24,800
(laughter)

1434
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:33,100
NARRATOR: Tom Vallely had served
with the Marines in Vietnam.

1435
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:38,800
16 years later, the country drew him back.

1436
01:31:38,899 --> 01:31:41,365
He founded the Vietnam Program

1437
01:31:41,466 --> 01:31:43,765
of the Kennedy School at Harvard,

1438
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:50,065
and helped educate some of the
country's future leaders.

1439
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:53,233
I got very, very involved
in the reconnecting

1440
01:31:53,332 --> 01:31:55,600
between the United States and Vietnam,

1441
01:31:55,699 --> 01:31:58,365
and how that reconnection takes place,

1442
01:31:58,466 --> 01:32:03,432
I spent a decade of my life
putting those pieces together.

1443
01:32:03,533 --> 01:32:05,733
NARRATOR: Although the United States

1444
01:32:05,832 --> 01:32:09,000
did not have diplomatic
relations with Vietnam,

1445
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:12,966
veterans had begun coming
back on their own,

1446
01:32:13,065 --> 01:32:18,132
revisiting places where they had fought...

1447
01:32:19,265 --> 01:32:22,332
...meeting old foes...

1448
01:32:24,432 --> 01:32:28,166
...planting trees and building schools,

1449
01:32:28,265 --> 01:32:32,233
trying to put the war behind them.

1450
01:32:33,765 --> 01:32:36,699
Vallely worked closely with other veterans,

1451
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,332
including three United States senators,

1452
01:32:40,432 --> 01:32:44,166
who became among the most
influential American advocates

1453
01:32:44,265 --> 01:32:46,932
for normalizing relations:

1454
01:32:47,033 --> 01:32:49,733
John McCain from Arizona,

1455
01:32:49,832 --> 01:32:54,699
who had endured six years
as a prisoner of war;

1456
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,832
John Kerry from Massachusetts,

1457
01:32:57,932 --> 01:33:01,332
the ex-commander of a Swift Boat;

1458
01:33:01,432 --> 01:33:04,533
and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,

1459
01:33:04,632 --> 01:33:08,065
a former Navy SEAL.

1460
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:11,332
Their task would not be easy.

1461
01:33:11,432 --> 01:33:14,699
Hanoi insisted the United States make good

1462
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:19,332
on a promise to provide
funds for reconstruction.

1463
01:33:19,432 --> 01:33:22,399
For its part, the United States demanded

1464
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,166
a complete accounting

1465
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:27,399
of the 2,500 Americans whose remains

1466
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:30,000
had never been recovered.

1467
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:35,500
Hanoi, which had more than
300,000 missing of its own,

1468
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:40,166
refused to cooperate.

1469
01:33:40,265 --> 01:33:45,100
But events both within Vietnam
and far beyond its borders

1470
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:49,500
slowly moved things along.

1471
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:22,500
NARRATOR: Le Duan died in 1986.

1472
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,899
His successors adopted
what they calleddoi moi,

1473
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,565
a more pragmatic reformist economic policy.

1474
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:37,233
As the Cold War ended,
Soviet aid disappeared,

1475
01:34:37,332 --> 01:34:42,432
and Hanoi finally began to help U.S.
military teams

1476
01:34:42,533 --> 01:34:46,265
search for American remains.

1477
01:34:46,365 --> 01:34:50,899
VALLELY: The architects of normalization

1478
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,199
are the Vietnamese.

1479
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:56,332
It's not the Americans.

1480
01:34:56,432 --> 01:34:58,666
And the normalization of Vietnam

1481
01:34:58,765 --> 01:35:03,800
is a strategy of the
Vietnamese Communist Party

1482
01:35:03,899 --> 01:35:06,166
to join the world.

1483
01:35:06,265 --> 01:35:07,765
They want to join the world.

1484
01:35:07,865 --> 01:35:11,033
And the United States makes it
hard for them to join the world.

1485
01:35:11,132 --> 01:35:14,000
So John McCain insists,

1486
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,966
"Yeah, you want to have normalization?

1487
01:35:16,065 --> 01:35:19,332
All your prisoners need to be
out of re-education camp."

1488
01:35:19,432 --> 01:35:21,800
"You want normalization?"

1489
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:24,966
John Kerry... "I need all the
information about the missing."

1490
01:35:26,966 --> 01:35:29,466
NARRATOR: In 1994,

1491
01:35:29,565 --> 01:35:32,399
after the Vietnamese met
the Americans' demands,

1492
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:36,733
the United States lifted its trade embargo.

1493
01:35:36,832 --> 01:35:41,466
Full normalization came the following year.

1494
01:35:41,565 --> 01:35:44,899
The new American ambassador
was Pete Peterson,

1495
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,132
who had spent six years
in Hanoi as a P.O.W.

1496
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,765
In November of 2000,

1497
01:35:54,865 --> 01:35:58,033
President Bill Clinton traveled to Vietnam,

1498
01:35:58,132 --> 01:36:02,033
the first American president
to visit that country

1499
01:36:02,132 --> 01:36:05,699
since Richard Nixon reviewed U.S.
troops there

1500
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,699
31 years earlier.

1501
01:36:10,632 --> 01:36:12,500
BARACK OBAMA: Now we can say something

1502
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,300
that was once unimaginable:

1503
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:18,466
Today, Vietnam and the
United States are partners.

1504
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:23,199
We have shown that hearts can change,

1505
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:24,966
and that a different future is possible

1506
01:36:25,065 --> 01:36:28,899
when we refuse to be prisoners of the past.

1507
01:36:33,899 --> 01:36:35,932
LE CONG HUAN:

1508
01:37:33,966 --> 01:37:36,733
MIKE HEANEY: I went back to Vietnam.

1509
01:37:36,832 --> 01:37:40,632
I got in touch with a
provincial vets organization.

1510
01:37:44,932 --> 01:37:47,265
This is a huge organization
of Vietnamese vets,

1511
01:37:47,365 --> 01:37:50,765
all former enemies.

1512
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,332
All former enemies.

1513
01:37:52,432 --> 01:37:55,233
But now, mellowed quite a bit, like me.

1514
01:37:55,332 --> 01:37:57,800
You know, they're guys my age, grandpas.

1515
01:37:57,899 --> 01:38:03,800
And after we got past the initial
checking each other out,

1516
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:07,332
and is this a political thing or not,

1517
01:38:07,432 --> 01:38:15,132
they could not have been more
gracious and more loving.

1518
01:38:15,233 --> 01:38:20,199
They took me under their
wing like a brother soldier.

1519
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:25,899
We exchanged painful memories, stories.

1520
01:38:28,932 --> 01:38:33,033
And I did a little ceremony
honoring the guys I'd lost,

1521
01:38:33,132 --> 01:38:36,565
honoring the Vietnamese
enemies that we'd killed.

1522
01:38:36,666 --> 01:38:40,632
And just telling them, you know,
they could be at peace now.

1523
01:38:46,065 --> 01:38:49,966
It was a wonderful, wonderful trip.

1524
01:38:52,033 --> 01:38:53,765
You know, you don't...

1525
01:38:53,865 --> 01:38:56,565
You don't get closure,
but you get some peace.

1526
01:38:56,666 --> 01:38:59,033
You get some peace... I got some peace.

1527
01:39:09,132 --> 01:39:13,932
NARRATOR: In Vietnam, the
land has largely healed.

1528
01:39:14,033 --> 01:39:17,765
Old animosities have mostly been buried.

1529
01:39:19,832 --> 01:39:22,533
But ghosts remain.

1530
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:26,600
Americans and Vietnamese

1531
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:28,765
work together to clean up places

1532
01:39:28,865 --> 01:39:32,199
where Agent Orange has poisoned the earth.

1533
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:36,565
Unexploded ordnance,
half-hidden in the ground,

1534
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:40,865
still takes lives each year.

1535
01:39:40,966 --> 01:39:44,832
Aged mothers and fathers
from northern Vietnam

1536
01:39:44,932 --> 01:39:47,199
still roam the south,

1537
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:48,466
seeking to discover

1538
01:39:48,565 --> 01:39:51,100
what happened to their sons and daughters.

1539
01:39:54,733 --> 01:39:59,432
LO KHAC TAM:

1540
01:40:51,166 --> 01:40:54,733
NGUYEN NGOC:

1541
01:41:48,033 --> 01:41:52,399
SAM WILSON: As we finally came
lurching out of Vietnam...

1542
01:41:53,765 --> 01:41:59,033
We were beginning to doubt ourselves.

1543
01:41:59,132 --> 01:42:03,699
And, uh, that's a foreign
feeling for an American.

1544
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:07,765
We, we seldom doubt ourselves.

1545
01:42:07,865 --> 01:42:12,865
This turned out to be the most
bitter, the most divisive...

1546
01:42:12,966 --> 01:42:15,699
or second-most bitter and
second-most divisive...

1547
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,365
war in our entire history.

1548
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:22,966
And we still hurt because of it.

1549
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:28,966
We have feelings of guilt about Vietnam.

1550
01:42:31,065 --> 01:42:34,500
NARRATOR: More than four
decades after the war ended,

1551
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,832
the divisions it created between Americans

1552
01:42:37,932 --> 01:42:41,399
have not yet wholly healed.

1553
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:45,699
Lessons were learned and then forgotten;

1554
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:50,699
divides were bridged and then widened;

1555
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:57,033
old secrets were revealed and
new secrets were locked away.

1556
01:42:57,132 --> 01:43:01,265
The Vietnam War was a tragedy,

1557
01:43:01,365 --> 01:43:05,265
immeasurable and irredeemable.

1558
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:11,632
But meaning can be found
in the individual stories

1559
01:43:11,733 --> 01:43:14,100
of those who lived through it,

1560
01:43:14,199 --> 01:43:17,332
stories of courage and comradeship

1561
01:43:17,432 --> 01:43:19,399
and perseverance,

1562
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:22,899
of understanding and forgiveness

1563
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,865
and, ultimately, reconciliation.

1564
01:43:33,233 --> 01:43:36,666
O'BRIEN: "They shared the weight of memory.

1565
01:43:36,765 --> 01:43:40,033
"They took up what others
could no longer bear.

1566
01:43:40,132 --> 01:43:43,832
"Often, they carried each
other, the wounded or weak.

1567
01:43:43,932 --> 01:43:47,733
"They carried infections.

1568
01:43:47,832 --> 01:43:49,966
"They carried chess sets,

1569
01:43:50,065 --> 01:43:52,500
"basketballs,

1570
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:56,132
"Vietnamese-English dictionaries,

1571
01:43:56,233 --> 01:44:02,832
"insignia of rank, Bronze
Stars and Purple Hearts,

1572
01:44:02,932 --> 01:44:09,600
"plastic cards imprinted
with the Code of Conduct.

1573
01:44:09,699 --> 01:44:12,666
"They carried diseases,

1574
01:44:12,765 --> 01:44:16,100
"among them malaria and dysentery.

1575
01:44:16,199 --> 01:44:22,533
"They carried lice and
ringworm and leeches,

1576
01:44:22,632 --> 01:44:28,666
"paddy algae and various rots and molds.

1577
01:44:28,765 --> 01:44:35,132
"They carried the land itself... Vietnam,

1578
01:44:35,233 --> 01:44:39,065
