ROGER HARRIS: Soldiers adapt.

38
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,832
You go over there with
one mindset, you know,

39
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,365
and then you adapt.

40
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,466
You adapt to the atrocities of war.

41
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,032
You adapt to...

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,599
...killing and dying, you know.

43
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,599
After a while it doesn't bother you.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,360
Well, I should say it
doesn't bother you as much.

45
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:25,233
When I first arrived in
Vietnam, there were some...

46
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:26,500
(sighs)

47
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,109
there were some interesting
things that happened

48
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,365
and I questioned some of the Marines.

49
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:36,099
I was made to realize that this
is war, and this is what we do.

50
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,365
And that stuck in my head.

51
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:40,466
This is war.

52
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,633
This is what we do.

53
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:46,466
And after a while you embrace that.

54
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,966
This is war.

55
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,432

This evening I came here to
speak to you about Vietnam.

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,765
There is progress in the war itself,

59
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:15,165
rather dramatic progress
considering the situation

60
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:19,900
that actually prevailed when we
sent our troops there in 1965.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,332

NARRATOR: The American military
command in Vietnam, MACV,

75
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:07,599
claimed to have killed 200,000 enemy troops

76
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,466
and had told the president

77
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,600
that the all-important "crossover point"...

78
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:15,899
the moment when U.S. and
ARVN forces were killing

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,065
more Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops

80
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:22,665
than the enemy could replace...
appeared to have been reached

81
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:25,733
in almost all of South Vietnam.

82
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,100
But the United States had suffered

83
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,899
nearly 75,000 casualties.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,466
By July 4, 14,624 Americans had died,

85
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:40,233
and, off the record,

86
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:44,766
many officers were much less
sanguine than their commanders.

87
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:50,266
From Saigon, R.W. Apple of
theNew York Time s summarized

88
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:55,033
their views: "Victory is not
close at hand," he wrote.

89
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:58,932
In fact, "It may be beyond reach."

90
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:03,932
("Are You Experienced?" by the
Jimi Hendrix Experience playing)

91
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,966
(rapid gunfire)

92
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:11,500
It was true that the enemy
rarely won a battle

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,432
in the traditional military
sense that they drove

94
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:16,466
the Americans from the field.

95
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,832
But it was also true
that no American victory

96
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:21,665
seemed to matter.

97
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:27,332
Battered enemy units were
quickly reinforced and rearmed.

98
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:31,000
Pacification... winning the hearts and minds

99
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,766
of the South Vietnamese
people... was not working.

100
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:39,165
Saigon still controlled only
a fraction of a country

101
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,266
roughly the size of Florida,

102
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:43,132
and its government remained

103
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:47,466
unpopular and riddled with corruption.

104
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:51,165
President Johnson had been
forced to raise taxes

105
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:54,665
to meet the war's ever-climbing cost.

106
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:58,899
His ambitious social program...
his War on Poverty...

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,533
was in retreat.

NARRATOR: The president would have
to send the Army into Detroit

113
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,399
to end five days of rioting

114
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,832
that left 43 dead and
hundreds of buildings razed.

115
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:33,033
Twenty-six more died in Newark, New Jersey,

116
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:35,733
demonstrating yet again how wide a gap

117
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:40,365
remained between black and white Americans.

118
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:46,266
Only a third of the country saw
any sign of progress in Vietnam,

119
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,399
and half of the country now disapproved

120
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,766
of the president's handling of the war.

121
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:57,000
Meanwhile, Le Duan and his comrades

122
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,399
who ran things in Hanoi,
were secretly planning

123
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,033
a new offensive that they
believed would destroy

124
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,966
what they called the puppet
government in Saigon

125
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:11,832
and convince the United States
the war could never be won

126
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,766
on the battlefield.

127
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:19,699
JAMES WILLBANKS: There's the old
apocryphal story that, in 1967,

128
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,766
they went to the basement of the Pentagon

129
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:24,105
when the mainframe computers
took up the whole basement,

130
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,300
and they put on the old
punch cards everything

131
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,919
you could quantify... numbers of ships,

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,341
numbers of airplanes, numbers of
tanks, numbers of helicopters,

133
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:34,233
artillery, machine gun, ammo...
everything you could quantify,

134
00:07:34,332 --> 00:07:37,365
put it in the hopper and said,
"When will we win in Vietnam?"

135
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,100
Went away on Friday.

136
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,132
The thing ground away all weekend.

137
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,199
Came back on Monday and there
was one card in the output tray

138
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,199
and it said, "You won in 1965."

139
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,132
The only problem is the enemy gets a vote

140
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,865
and they weren't on the punch cards.

141
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:03,100
NARRATOR: There were nearly half a
million American soldiers in Vietnam

142
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,432
by the middle of 1967,

143
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:08,233
with thousands more on the way.

144
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:12,632
Only 20% would ever be in combat.

145
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:16,233
The rest served in support units.

146
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:19,932
None of them had been taught
very much about the people

147
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,865
against whom... and for whom...
they had been asked to fight.

148
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:27,798
Troops called the Vietnamese "gooks"...

149
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,200
a term first used by U.S. Marines to refer

150
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:33,533
to the people of Haiti and Nicaragua

151
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:37,232
during the American occupation
of those countries,

152
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:41,100
and then applied to the
Asian enemy in Korea.

153
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,165
Or "slopes," an epithet for the
Japanese during the Pacific War,

154
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:51,200
or "dinks," an Australian
term for the Chinese.

155
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,899
And so in basic training they taught you

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,166
that you were going to be fighting gooks.

157
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:59,166
It was part of the song that you sang

158
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:01,466
as you jogged down the road.

159
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,832
As you went through bayonet training,

160
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:06,232
you were not talking about Vietnamese.

161
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:09,633
You were always talking about gooks.

162
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:13,232
Vietnamese might be people,
but gooks are-are...

163
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:14,732
are close to being animals.

164
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:19,100
NARRATOR: Gis called
Vietnamese homes "hooches"...

165
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,100
a corruption of the Japanese
word for dwelling places

166
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,466
that they had learned during
the battle for Okinawa

167
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,765
in the Second World War.

168
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:33,033
Soldiers referred to older
Vietnamese women as "mama sans,"

169
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,732
the term they used for
women who ran whorehouses

170
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:38,633
in occupied Japan.

171
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:41,566
The Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese

172
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,932
called Gis "invaders," "imperialists,"

173
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,765
and (speaking Vietnamese)...

174
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:49,765
"American bandits."

175
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:59,732
South Vietnam had been divided
into four tactical zones.

176
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:04,166
By the summer of 1967,
American troops were fighting

177
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:05,932
in all four of them.

178
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:11,066
In IV Corps, the "Brown Water Navy"

179
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,932
patrolled the rivers and canals and marshes

180
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:17,232
of the densely populated Mekong Delta,

181
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:20,466
searching for the enemy.

182
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:25,200
In III Corps, the Army continued
to sweep the thick jungles

183
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:28,765
of the Iron Triangle,
the Viet Cong sanctuary

184
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:32,432
near Saigon that was supposed
to have been permanently denied

185
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:37,966
to the enemy by big American
operations earlier in the year.

186
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:41,232
In II Corps, a series of bloody battles

187
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:45,966
in the Central Highlands around
Dak To temporarily drove

188
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:51,200
North Vietnamese troops back
into Cambodia and Laos.

189
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,832
But some of the most intense
combat would take place

190
00:10:55,932 --> 00:11:00,299
in I Corps... made up of the
five northernmost provinces

191
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,432
of South Vietnam... where
the Marines would bear

192
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:05,865
the brunt of the fighting.

193
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,265
More than two-and-a-half
million people lived there,

194
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:11,500
all but 2% of them within

195
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,899
the narrow rice-growing river valleys

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,700
along the South China Sea.

197
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,566
The Marines wanted to eradicate
the Viet Cong there,

198
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,966
and provide security to the people,

199
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,932
village by village, hamlet by hamlet.

200
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:29,700
The vast, largely empty
highlands that stretched

201
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,033
westward all the way to
Laos, the Marines argued,

202
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,899
could be left to the enemy.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,500
"The real war is among the people,"

204
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,466
said Marine lieutenant
general Victor Krulak,

205
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:44,200
"and not among the mountains."

206
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,700
But General William Westmoreland,

207
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,799
the American commander,
feared that thousands

208
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,700
of North Vietnamese Army
regulars... the NVA...

209
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:58,000
were planning to seize the
two northernmost provinces.

210
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,265
Finding and destroying them
remained his first goal.

211
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,932
(helicopter blades beating)

212
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:07,832
He insisted the Third Marine Division

213
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:10,166
move north to meet that challenge,

214
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:15,666
establish a base at Dong Ha and
man strongpoints at Gio Linh,

215
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:23,166
Con Thien, Cam Lo, Camp Carroll,
the Rockpile and Khe Sanh.

216
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:26,865
Khe Sanh overlooked Route
9, the East-West highway

217
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:30,600
that Westmoreland hoped would
one day carry American troops

218
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,700
across the border into Laos,
where North Vietnamese men

219
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,633
and supplies were streaming
south on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

220
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:45,033
But the thousands of Marines
monitoring the border

221
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:48,232
would find themselves within
range of highly accurate

222
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:51,966
North Vietnamese artillery
and rocket launchers

223
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,932
hidden within the DMZ.

You came here at full strength?

228

00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:10,432
Six.

00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,133
it slowed everything down.

234
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,765
And the artillery comes in everywhere.

235
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:25,299
And, ah, it just gets pretty futile

236
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,665
and frustrating sometimes.

of Fairmount, Missouri, who
had volunteered to join

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,700
the 3rd Marine Division,

247
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,700
was sent to the battle-scarred
countryside around Con Thien,

JOHN MUSGRAVE: For the Marines in northern
I Corps in the 3rd Marine Division

251
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,332
in the spring and summer
of 1967 we called the DMZ

00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,865
the "Dead Marine Zone."

253
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:13,765
NARRATOR: Musgrave's 1st
Battalion had already suffered

254
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:17,399
so many casualties in a
series of bloody sweeps

255
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,133

258
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,500
MUSGRAVE: I joined the Marine
Corps to be in the varsity.

259
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,066
And I felt like I wasn't
varsity unless I was up north

260
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,466
fighting the NVA.

261
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:39,700
I have never regretted that decision.

262
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,200
There were times when we
were under artillery fire,

263
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:47,865
where I thought, you know,
"What-what were you thinking?"

264
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:53,666
Here it is in a nutshell: if
I lived to be 63 years old,

265
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,865
I didn't want to look in
the mirror some morning

266
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,406
and have a guy looking back at
me that hadn't done everything

267
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,232
for what he believed,

268
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:04,100
that let somebody else do the harder part.

269
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,765
Every major contact I remember
with the NVA was initiated

270
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:13,399
by them ambushing us.

271
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,832
They wouldn't hit us unless
they outnumbered us.

272
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:18,832
And we were fighting in their yard.

273
00:15:21,832 --> 00:15:23,166
They knew the ground; we didn't.

274
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,932
They were just really good.

275
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:41,232
LE VAN CHO:

276
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:50,566
NARRATOR: The North Vietnamese
carried Soviet-made,

277
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:53,633
seemingly indestructible AK-47s.

278
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:59,932
The Marines had to fight with
newly issued M-16 rifles

279
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:04,232
that had for a time a
potentially fatal design flaw:

280
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:07,066
they needed constant cleaning

281
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,299
and often jammed in the
middle of firefights.

282
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,466
MUSGRAVE: Their rifles worked; ours didn't.

283
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:16,966
The M-16 was a piece of shit.

284
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,706
You can't throw your bullets at the enemy

285
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:20,066
and have them be effective.

286
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:24,600
And that rifle malfunctioned
on us repeatedly.

287
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,600

00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:39,133
HO HUU LAN:

289
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:53,332
My hatred for them was pure.

290
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,033
Pure.

291
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:57,032
I hated them so much.

292
00:16:58,365 --> 00:16:59,732
And I was so scared of them.

293
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,133
Boy, I was terrified of them.

294
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,566
And the scareder I got,
the more I hated them.

295
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,799
MUSGRAVE: I only killed one
human being in Vietnam.

296
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,165
And that was the first
man that I ever killed.

297
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,299
And I was sick with guilt
about killing that guy

298
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,432
and thinking I'm going to have to do this

299
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,700
for the next 13 months.

300
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,266
I'm-I'm going to go crazy.

301
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:52,165
And I saw a Marine step
on a bouncing Betty mine,

302
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:55,465
and that's when I made
my deal with the devil

303
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:59,299
and that I said, "I will never
kill another human being

304
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,633
"as long as I'm in Vietnam.

305
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:06,833
"However, I will waste as
many gooks as I can find.

306
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:10,299
"I'll wax as many dinks as I can find.

307
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,432
"I'll smoke as many zips as I can find.

308
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:16,599
But I ain't gonna kill anybody," you know?

309
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,032
Turn the subject into an object.

310
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,133
It's Racism 101.

311
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:24,333
It turns out to be a very necessary tool

312
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:27,000
when you have children fighting your wars,

313
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:29,833
for them to stay sane doing their work.

314
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:38,799
NARRATOR: On one early
patrol, Musgrave watched

315
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,566
an American fighter swoop down
to drop napalm on enemy troops

316
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,000
hidden behind a hedgerow.

317
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,799
He could hear their AK-47s
firing at the plane

318
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,566
until the instant they
were engulfed in flames.

319
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,400
"If the enemy is willing to
die like that," he thought,

320
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,400
"this is going to be one very long war."

321
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,133
MUSGRAVE: They knew if they
would pop the ambush close

322
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:06,833
and then get amongst you,

323
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:10,465
we couldn't or would hesitate
to call in air on ourselves.

324
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:17,732
So that... firefights like
that we called brawls.

325
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,700
They were very intimate.

326
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,299
And they were very deadly.

327
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,232
And they were absolutely terrifying.

328
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:32,465
NARRATOR: The Marines were spread too
thin to hold any of the territory

329
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:35,032
they fought so hard to take.

330
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:39,633
Again and again, they were
sent out from one stronghold

331
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:43,833
or another along the DMZ,
looking for enemy soldiers.

332
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,566
MUSGRAVE: The disillusionment for
me began when I was going back

333
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:50,732
to fight at places we'd
already fought before.

334
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,365
We had fought, captured, and then left

335
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:56,532
and the NVA came right back.

336
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,799
You don't like getting wounded

337
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,633
in places you've already been before.

338
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,232
War is a real estate business.

339
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,200
We're supposed to take real
estate away from the enemy

340
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,165
and then deny the enemy
access to that real estate.

341
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:18,465
NARRATOR: On the morning of July 2,
1967, the 1st Battalion launched

342
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:22,865
yet another sweep of the
area northeast of Con Thien.

343
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:26,732
When they reached a crossroads
called "The Marketplace,"

344
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:31,200
barely a mile and quarter from
their base, they were ambushed.

345
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:34,700
One company was virtually annihilated.

346
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:43,232
John Musgrave's company rushed
to rescue the survivors,

347
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,232
only to be pinned down there as well.

348
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,833
It was one of the worst days the
Marine Corps endured in Vietnam:

349
00:20:53,932 --> 00:21:00,133
53 dead and 190 wounded were
carried off the battlefield.

350
00:21:00,232 --> 00:21:04,299
Thirty-four more dead
had to be left behind,

351
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,133
and when Marines fought their
way back two days later

352
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:11,066
to retrieve their bodies,
they found that a number

353
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:17,232
had died because their M-16s had
jammed as the enemy closed in.

354
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,532
Many had been executed, shot in the face

355
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:23,432
or back of the head at close range.

356
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,465
Some bodies had been booby-trapped,

357
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:29,432
others mutilated.

358
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:32,766
MUSGRAVE: Marine amphibious
force headquarters

359
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:36,633
was so desperate to get
North Vietnamese prisoners,

360
00:21:36,732 --> 00:21:39,932
that they offered us
three day in-country R&R

361
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,133
if we'd bring a prisoner in.

362
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:43,599
Yeah, good luck.

363
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,099
You know?

364
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,500
Don't you know who...
what we're doing up here?

365
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,299
Do you know who we're fighting?

366
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:53,665
I want to make this clear,
we did not torture prisoners

367
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:56,665
and we did not mutilate them.

368
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:06,700
But to be a prisoner you had to
make it to the rear, you know.

369
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,133
If he was with... fell into our hands

370
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,133
he was just one sorry fucker.

371
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:25,266
I don't know how to explain
it that it would make sense.

372
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:30,165
("Green Onions" by Booker T.
& the M.G.s playing)

373
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:34,575
HARRIS: Roxbury, where I grew up,

374
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,333
was the African-American neighborhood,

375
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:40,266
and South Boston was the
Irish-Catholic bastion.

376
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:42,165
You know, there was a lot of hate.

377
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:45,900
South Boston folks hated us, we hated them.

378
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,266
And ironically, um...

379
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,833
(sighs)

380
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:51,665
You know, you end up in a war.

381
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,732
And the Vietnamese didn't care

382
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,641
whether you were from
Roxbury or South Boston.

383
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:59,665
They saw you as American.

384
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:03,000
And they wanted to kill you
because you're American.

385
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:07,400
NARRATOR: Private Roger Harris had
joined the Marines in part, he said,

386
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,865
because he wanted to be "a gladiator,"

387
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:13,099
a killer of his country's enemies.

388
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,432
On July 28, two weeks after

389
00:23:16,532 --> 00:23:20,599
John Musgrave's badly mangled
1st Battalion was pulled back

390
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,432
to rest and recover,

391
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:26,566
Roger Harris and the 2nd
Battalion moved out of Con Thien

392
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:30,432
and into the southern half of
the Demilitarized Zone itself.

393
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,208
HARRIS: We wanted the North Vietnamese Army

394
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:36,566
to expose themselves.

395
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,599
So, basically, you put the bait out there,

396
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,032
and then we could call in
and rain hell on them.

397
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:48,465
NARRATOR: Roger Harris's
battalion advanced into the DMZ

398
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:53,066
along a rough cart track that
led to the Ben Hai River.

399
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:57,400
But planners had failed to
see that a concrete bridge

400
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,400
over an impassable stream

401
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,900
was too narrow and too weak
to carry armored vehicles.

402
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,766
Now the Marines had no choice
but to violate a cardinal rule

403
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,400
of infantry tactics...

404
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,532
turn around and try to go
back the way they had come.

405
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:18,766
The enemy was waiting.

406
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:21,566
(explosion, rapid gunfire)

407
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,665
Massive ambushes and...

408
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,232
(gunfire, shouting)

409
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:33,299
...and, um, a lot of death.

410
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,299
And...

411
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,465
...craziness.

412
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:43,465
NARRATOR: The Marines were forced to
run a bloody gauntlet of mortars,

413
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:47,400
machine gun fire and
rocket-propelled grenades.

414
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,200
HARRIS: I had the utmost respect for
the North Vietnamese Army soldiers.

415
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:58,566
When you see someone jump out
and confront a tank, you know,

416
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,799
with a big 50-caliber machine gun on it

417
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,833
and a 90-millimeter cannon on it,

418
00:25:03,932 --> 00:25:08,133
and an individual takes on the tank,

419
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:09,865
I think that says something.

420
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,299
NARRATOR: Roger Harris's
company held up the rear,

421
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,266
hounded by enemy soldiers on all sides.

422
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:23,865
The Marines staggered back out of the DMZ

423
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:27,066
alongside the battered armored vehicles

424
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:30,965
heaped with dead and wounded Americans.

425
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:33,965
The battalion suffered 214 casualties.

426
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:40,566
HARRIS: Wasn't a good
day for Marines at all.

427
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:41,932
A lot of people died.

428
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:43,272
People got their legs shot off.

429
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,232
People got run over by tanks.

430
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:50,766
I don't want to talk
about it because it's...

431
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,500
it's not a good day, wasn't a good day.

432
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:06,000
LO KHAC TAM:

433
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:08,665
This is "bau cu", the day
of voting in Vietnam,

434
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:11,665
and it's a solemn day in the
village of Hung Thao Phu

435
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:14,400
and in other villages
throughout the country.

436
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,965
And these people have dressed
up in their Sunday best for it.

437
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,833
NARRATOR: South Vietnamese
prime minister Nguyen Cao Ky

438
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:26,833
had crushed his Buddhist opponents in 1966,

439
00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:29,333
but he had been forced by the Americans

440
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:32,766
and his political rivals to
make at least tentative moves

441
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:36,532
toward democracy... election
of a national assembly,

442
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:39,799
a new constitution, and
a promise of elections

443
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,099
for president and vice president.

444
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,000
But when Ky's old adversary
Nguyen Van Thieu declared

445
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,900
he wanted to challenge Ky for the top spot,

446
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,165
things in Saigon had threatened
to come apart again.

447
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,239
PHAN QUANG TUE: We were watching
the rivalry between Thieu and Ky.

448
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,333
And that was a game.

449
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:04,333
In Vietnam, the country
was watching like a...

450
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,200
we were watch... watching a movie.

451
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:09,500
And Thieu and Ky was watching as to,

452
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,400
not whoever had the support of the people,

453
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,833
but who had the support of the
Americans and the White House.

454
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:20,266
NARRATOR: Ellsworth Bunker,
the American ambassador,

455
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,833
called both men to his
residence and warned that

456
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:27,700
the United States would not
tolerate another power struggle:

457
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:31,365
Thieu and Ky needed to meet
with their fellow generals

458
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:33,965
and decide who would run for president

459
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:36,599
and who would be his running mate.

460
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,133
Thieu emerged on top.

461
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:42,200
He was unassuming and unflappable,

462
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,865
interested largely in accumulating power

463
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:48,099
and personal wealth and
was thought unlikely

464
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,932
ever to embarrass Washington.

465
00:28:51,032 --> 00:28:54,500
Ky would be his vice president.

466
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:59,566
Together, they won with
only 35% of the vote.

467
00:28:59,665 --> 00:29:02,766
No one who had called for an end to the war

468
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:05,099
had been allowed to run.

469
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,732
Many Buddhists had boycotted the election,

470
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:12,932
and Viet Cong intimidation had
kept many more from the polls.

471
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:16,000
But the State Department
immediately declared

472
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:19,000
the election an important "step forward."

473
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,333
Some South Vietnamese did
believe that a measure

474
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:27,566
of stability had finally been achieved.

475
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,700
Others were not so sure.

476
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:36,500
TUE: In terms of corruption,
yes, they were corrupt.

477
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,266
Both Thieu and Ky, they
abused their position.

478
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:45,232
We pay a very high price for having leaders

479
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:48,000
like a Ky and Thieu.

480
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,500
And we continue to pay the price.

481
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:55,732
("Soul Dressing" by Booker T.
& The M.G.s playing)

482
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,665
EVA JEFFERSON PATERSON: My father
was in the United States Army.

483
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:01,400
And then when the Air Force
came about he switched over

484
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,833
to the Air Force.

485
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:08,732
I grew up out of the country
in desegregated settings.

486
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,700
I was usually the only little
black girl in the class.

487
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:13,799
If you look at my class pictures I look

488
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,500
like the little chocolate chip
in the vanilla ice cream.

489
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,500
I was always a good student.

490
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,333
I remember people saying,
"Oh, you speak so well."

491
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:25,299
And the unstated part
is "for a black girl,"

492
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,099
probably a Negro girl or
colored girl, at that point.

493
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,833
NARRATOR: Eva Jefferson's father
had served a year on airbases

494
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:36,532
in Vietnam and returned home
convinced the United States

495
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:39,165
had no business being there.

496
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:42,865
But when his daughter entered
Northwestern University

497
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:48,032
in the Chicago suburb of
Evanston in September 1967,

498
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:52,432
the war was not uppermost
in students' minds.

499
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:55,833
PATERSON: The war was not really an issue.

500
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:57,766
It's like, "Well, no, the president has

501
00:30:57,865 --> 00:30:59,833
"our best interests at heart.

502
00:30:59,932 --> 00:31:01,732
"He, of course, would only prosecute a war

503
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,200
that made sense."

504
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,066
And I think most of America felt that way.

505
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,133
("Strange Brew" by Cream playing)

506
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:10,266
NARRATOR: At the University of Nebraska,

507
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:13,299
Jack Todd also supported the war.

508
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,766
He had felt so strongly about it
in 1966 that he had signed up

509
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:20,833
for Marine officer training.

510
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:23,532
I went into the Marine Corps

511
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,932
thinking this was all I wanted to do.

512
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:27,965
I mean my... my goal was to be commander,

513
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:29,365
a platoon commander in Vietnam.

514
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,232
NARRATOR: But as time went
by and the war went on,

515
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,700
Todd and many of his fellow students

516
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,465
began to change their minds.

517
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:42,232
TODD: All young people go through changes.

518
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,165
But we were going through
astronomical changes

519
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:47,500
at such a rapid rate.

520
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,066
All the music, the culture,
everything that we listened to,

521
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:55,266
everything that we thought was transforming

522
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:59,165
and the core of it all was
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.

523
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,099
It just kept going in the background.

524
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,976
First, it was kind of
like a background noise

525
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,880
and then it got to be the
elephant in the room.

526
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,932
And then it was the elephant
sitting on your head

527
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:08,665
and we... we couldn't escape this.

528
00:32:08,766 --> 00:32:12,099
NARRATOR: Todd attended
officer training school

529
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,900
at Camp Upshur in Quantico, Virginia.

530
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,900
But doubts about the war
followed him there, too.

531
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:22,809
TODD: I guess the emotional
things that were happening

532
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,333
on the ground, the photographs
that we saw, the news images,

533
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:28,400
and the fact that there was
no discernible progress,

534
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,833
that really started to eat
away at what we thought.

535
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:35,032
In the summer of '67, I was
at Camp Upshur, you know,

536
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,532
wanting to go kill Vietnamese people.

537
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:42,000
And in October, I was
completely against the war.

538
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,865
JOHNSON: Westmoreland came
in last night to me...

539
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:52,000
And he says that he has
concentrated more firepower

540
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:55,665
and bombing in the last week on the DMZ

541
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:59,599
and they've concentrated more
on us than has ever been

542
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,799
concentrated in any equivalent period

543
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,432
in the history of warfare...

544
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:04,700
EVERETT DIRKSEN: Yeah.

545
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,042
JOHNSON: ...much more
than was ever poured on

546
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,400
Berlin or Tokyo,

547
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,900
and that his only defense
of the DMZ to stop

548
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,900
this aggression up there
with the North Vietnamese

549
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,665
trying to come in is bombing
their gun positions.

550
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,232
DIRKSEN: Yeah.

551
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,208
JOHNSON: And it would just be
suicide if we stopped the bombing

552
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:24,465
as these idiots talking about.

553
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:26,232
When you say stop the bombing

554
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:29,099
you say, "Kill more American Marines."

555
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,099
That's all it means.

556
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,465
DIRKSEN: Yeah.

557
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:34,799
JOHNSON: Now if we stop
bombing, without their talking

558
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,665
and without any reciprocity on their part,

559
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,833
it just means we kill more
Americans, that's all

560
00:33:39,932 --> 00:33:40,932
DIRKSEN: Yeah.

561
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:51,532
NARRATOR: Neither the ongoing
bombing of the North,

562
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:55,066
nor the concentrated
bombing around the DMZ,

563
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:57,099
nor the behind-the-scenes offers

564
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,799
made by President Johnson to stop it

565
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,833
had any discernible effect on Le Duan

566
00:34:02,932 --> 00:34:06,300
and the other men who ran North Vietnam.

567
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,365
But Le Duan, like Lyndon Johnson,

568
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:11,432
was in trouble that summer.

569
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:14,400
The war with the Americans
had produced little more

570
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,432
than a bloody stalemate.

571
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:19,500
Some Viet Cong commanders in the South

572
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,865
resented Hanoi's insistence
on directing their tactics.

573
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:28,166
Many North Vietnamese civilians
were weary of the war

574
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,166
and of the bombing that
had disrupted their lives

575
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:34,800
and destroyed so much of
their infrastructure.

576
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,465
The country's most revered figures,

577
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:42,065
Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen
Giap, were urging patience,

578
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:46,233
continuing to wage a war of
attrition, they still believed,

579
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,432
would pay off in the end.

580
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:53,065
Hanoi's Soviet and Chinese patrons offered

581
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:56,065
conflicting advice, as well.

582
00:34:56,166 --> 00:35:00,400
To silence his critics
and break the stalemate,

583
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,965
Le Duan began to devise and promote

584
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:06,432
a new and riskier version
of the plan for victory

585
00:35:06,532 --> 00:35:10,000
he had tried in 1964.

586
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:15,565
He called it the "General
Offensive, General Uprising."

587
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:19,400
North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong units would launch

588
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,733
scores of coordinated attacks
on South Vietnamese cities

589
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,965
and towns and military bases.

590
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:29,300
That offensive, Le Duan believed,

591
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,932
would ignite a mass civilian uprising.

592
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:37,500
These simultaneous blows would
destroy the Saigon regime

593
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,532
and leave Washington with
no choice but to withdraw.

594
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:34,232
WILLBANKS: We talk about our own hubris.

595
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:36,400
There's some hubris on their side as well.

596
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,365
And once they had convinced themselves

597
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:41,199
that this was going to be a great success,

598
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,300
it is what some wags have called
drinking your own bathwater.

599
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:47,108
They decided it's going to be a victory,

600
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:49,132
even though there are
people in the South saying,

601
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:50,666
"Hey, this is not a great idea."

602
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:54,532
But these people are
charged with subjectivism

603
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:57,266
and basically are told to
shut up and keep rolling.

604
00:36:57,365 --> 00:37:01,666
NARRATOR: Le Duan neutralized
those who opposed his plan.

605
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:04,900
Members of General Giap's
staff were arrested.

606
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,565
So was Ho Chi Minh's secretary.

607
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,333
HUY DUC:

608
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:28,932
NARRATOR: Hundreds of less prominent
figures... journalists, students,

609
00:37:29,032 --> 00:37:32,266
even highly decorated
heroes of the French War...

610
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:34,500
were also rounded up.

611
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,432
Many were locked up in
the old French prison

612
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:41,233
that the American POWs
also confined there called

613
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,800
the "Hanoi Hilton."

614
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,632
The date eventually chosen
for the attack would be

615
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:51,300
January 31, 1968,

616
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,432
the first day of the Vietnamese
Lunar New Year celebration,

617
00:37:55,532 --> 00:37:58,400
known as Tet.

618
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,465
Hundreds, then thousands, of
North Vietnamese regulars

619
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:05,666
in civilian clothes began
slipping southward

620
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:10,400
to join tens of thousands of
Viet Cong already in place.

621
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:13,532
HO HUU LAN:

622
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,865
HUY DUC:

623
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:23,632
NARRATOR: In preparation
for the coming offensive,

624
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:26,432
the North Vietnamese hoped to lure American

625
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:29,699
and South Vietnamese
forces away from cities

626
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,065
and big military bases.

627
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:35,599
To do that, they would
mount a series of assaults

628
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:41,233
on remote outposts near
Cambodia, Laos, and the DMZ.

629
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:46,300
These preliminary attacks became
known as the "Border Battles."

630
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,733
Con Thien would be the first.

631
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,199
In September and October,

632
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,300
John Musgrave's and Roger Harris's outfits

633
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,865
took turns defending Con Thien

634
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:04,865
as the North Vietnamese tightened
the noose around them.

635
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:08,599
The only way in or out was by helicopter.

636
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,233
Con Thien in Vietnamese
means "Hill of Angels."

637
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,300
(explosion)

638
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,865
MUSGRAVE: Time at Con Thien
was time in the barrel.

639
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:25,099
(multiple explosions)

640
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,233
We were the fish, they had the shotguns,

641
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,400
they stuck in the barrel and blasted away.

642
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,199
And they were gonna hit
something every shot.

643
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,300
Because Con Thien was such a small area,

644
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,333
and they pounded it with that artillery

645
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:40,432
from North Vietnam, they couldn't miss.

646
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,400
HO HUU LAN:

647
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,599
I've never been, uh, as afraid.

648
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,965
In fact that's why I'm not
afraid of anything now.

649
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:56,432
I mean...

650
00:40:56,532 --> 00:40:57,865
there's nothing you can do.

651
00:40:57,965 --> 00:41:01,632
You just listen to the sounds
of the rockets coming over.

652
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:05,266
And you just pray that
they don't land on you.

653
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:08,000
The big question really
seems to be whether or not

654
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,365
the North Vietnamese intend
to overrun Con Thien.

655
00:41:11,465 --> 00:41:14,300
The Marines have tripled
the number of troops

656
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,733
guarding the outpost,

657
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,408
and they've moved up more
battalions to be ready

658
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:19,000
to reinforce.

659
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:21,032
MUSGRAVE: I sat in water.

660
00:41:21,132 --> 00:41:22,932
I slept in water.

661
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:26,699
I ate in water, because
our holes were full.

662
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,965
I mean a flooded foxhole
could drown a wounded man.

663
00:41:29,065 --> 00:41:31,666
HARRIS: Spend your day
filling up sand bags,

664
00:41:31,766 --> 00:41:35,432
trying to create barriers that
you just put another layer on,

665
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:37,199
put another layer on.

666
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,766
A lot of mud, blood, uh...

667
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:43,065
and artillery.

668
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:45,553
MUSGRAVE: It's red clay up there.

669
00:41:45,632 --> 00:41:48,266
And it's real sticky and it
could just grab onto you

670
00:41:48,365 --> 00:41:50,166
and pull your boots off.

671
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:51,632
It's hard to run in that stuff.

672
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:53,432
And running, when you're at a place

673
00:41:53,532 --> 00:41:55,142
where they're firing
heavy artillery at you,

674
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,365
running's pretty important.

675
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:01,199
During the siege in the fall of 1967,

676
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,432
we were getting newspaper
articles in the mail

677
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:06,865
from our families and we
were being called the Alamo.

678
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:09,833
You know, hey, we knew what the Alamo was.

679
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:12,000
We knew what happened there.

680
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:15,699
(explosions)

681
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,699
(men shouting)

682
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,900
(explosions continue)

683
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,900
HARRIS: Like almost like every
hour there'd be a barrage.

684
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:28,632
People get blown to bits,
literally blown to bits.

685
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:32,432
You find a... a boot
with a leg in it, right.

686
00:42:32,532 --> 00:42:34,932
And so is the leg white or black?

687
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:36,992
So who... who was the white
Marine that was here?

688
00:42:37,065 --> 00:42:38,132
Who was the black?

689
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:40,333
So then you try to remember and you tag it

690
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,800
and put that in the green bag.

691
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,565
And that's what goes back, you know,

692
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:46,932
as Marine Lance Corporal so and so.

693
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:50,065
And so, but sometimes you're
not even sure because the body

694
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,242
has literally been blown to
bits, and the only thing

695
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:54,833
that's left is a foot or a piece of an arm.

696
00:42:54,932 --> 00:42:59,500
MUSGRAVE: I carried a wallet calendar
from Clifford Forlow Insurance.

697
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,733
He was my dad's insurance agent.

698
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:05,365
And I marked off each of
the days religiously.

699
00:43:05,465 --> 00:43:10,032
And then in October, we
went up to Con Thien again.

700
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:15,000
I just stopped, because I
thought, "This is pointless.

701
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:17,233
"I'm not getting... I'm not gonna go home.

702
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,733
"I'm not gonna make it home.

703
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,766
What... you know, what's the point?"

704
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,766
So I just quit marking them off.

705
00:43:24,365 --> 00:43:26,642
HARRIS: I had the opportunity
to call my mother, you know.

706
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:29,233
And I was telling my mother
what was happening over there

707
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,465
and I was telling her how
she shouldn't believe

708
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:35,365
what she sees in the newspaper
and-and sees on television

709
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:37,666
because we're losing the war.

710
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:40,266
And I said, "You'll
probably never see me again

711
00:43:40,365 --> 00:43:43,632
"because we're the most northern
outpost that the Marines have,

712
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:45,132
"you know.

713
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:47,441
"We could literally could look
right into North Vietnam.

714
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:49,932
We could see the sparks
when the guns fired on us."

715
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:53,300
And I said, "And everybody in
my unit is dying, you know.

716
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,266
And I probably won't be coming back."

717
00:43:55,365 --> 00:43:57,465
And my mother said, "No,
you're coming back."

718
00:43:57,565 --> 00:44:00,400
She said, "I talk to God every
day and you're special.

719
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,733
You're coming back."

720
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,199
And I said, "Ma, everybody's
mother thinks that

721
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,900
"they're special, you know.

722
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,965
I'm putting pieces of
special people in bags."

723
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,865
And I was feeling that
my mother's in denial.

724
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:15,233
She just doesn't want to face
the fact that her only son

725
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,266
is gonna die in Vietnam.

726
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:18,865
And I said, "Ma, this isn't a joke."

727
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:20,642
I said, "Everybody's dying
over here, you know.

728
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:21,733
Everybody's dying."

729
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,365
And she said, "You're not gonna die.

730
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:24,865
You're not gonna die."

731
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:27,199
And, uh, the last thing she said to me was,

732
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,365
"God has a plan for you."

733
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:30,599
And I said, "Yeah, right."

734
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:31,699
And I hung up.

735
00:44:32,632 --> 00:44:34,300
(explosion)

736
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:39,300
Mr. Stout, during what period
of time were you in Vietnam?

737
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,565
I was in Vietnam from September of 1966

738
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:44,865
to September of 1967, one year.

739
00:44:44,965 --> 00:44:46,333
And with what unit?

740
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:48,199
With the 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne.

741
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,666
During the time that you were in Vietnam,

742
00:44:50,766 --> 00:44:52,800
did you personally witness any atrocities

743
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,833
on the part of American troops?

744
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:55,932
Yes, I did.

745
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,900
NARRATOR: Dennis Stout from
Phoenix, Arizona, had enlisted

746
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,800
in the Army at 20, and served
nine months in combat.

747
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,400
Wounded three times, he
became an Army reporter

748
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,266
covering the 327th Regiment
of the 101st Airborne.

749
00:45:15,365 --> 00:45:19,699
He would spend most of his time
with a unique commando platoon

750
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,199
called "Tiger Force"...

751
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,532
small, handpicked teams,
capable of remaining

752
00:45:24,632 --> 00:45:27,365
in the jungle for weeks at a time,

753
00:45:27,465 --> 00:45:30,099
fast-moving and deadly,

754
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:33,965
intended to "out-guerrilla the guerrillas."

755
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,000
Tiger Force fought in six
different provinces,

756
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,199
repeatedly suffering heavy losses.

757
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,632
(rapid gunfire)

758
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:47,699
RION CAUSEY: If you've lost your
best friend and you want revenge,

759
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,032
it's the officers who say,
"No, you can't do that."

760
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:54,233
And if you do it, then
there's consequences.

761
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,065
But when the officers, and it
includes the platoon leader

762
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:00,099
and the battalion commander,
are telling you that this is

763
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:04,833
what you're supposed to do, then
it gets completely out of hand.

764
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:08,932
NARRATOR: Some at MACV worried
that such a freewheeling outfit,

765
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,800
operating on its own, would
be difficult to control.

766
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,500
(gunfire)

767
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:18,132
But General Westmoreland and
commanders in the field

768
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:22,766
admired Tiger Force for
its reliable ferocity.

769
00:46:22,865 --> 00:46:26,900
In the summer of 1967, Tiger Force was sent

770
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,500
to the fertile Song Ve Valley.

771
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,532
The entire population
had already been herded

772
00:46:32,632 --> 00:46:37,199
from their homes and crowded
into a refugee camp.

773
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,532
But some had come back
to resume the farming

774
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,900
they had always done.

775
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,565
The valley had officially been
declared a free-fire zone,

776
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:51,766
and Tiger Force's officers
took that literally.

777
00:46:51,865 --> 00:46:55,733
"There are no friendlies,"
one lieutenant told his men.

778
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:58,666
"Shoot anything that moves."

779
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:05,132
Over a seven-month period,
they killed scores

780
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:07,733
of unarmed civilians.

781
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:11,333
Among their victims were
two blind brothers;

782
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:15,932
an elderly Buddhist monk;
women, children, and old people

783
00:47:16,032 --> 00:47:18,199
hiding in underground shelters;

784
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,565
and three farmers trying to plant rice.

785
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:26,065
All were reported as
"enemy... killed in action."

786
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:32,865
STOUT: These atrocities
were committed by soldiers

787
00:47:32,965 --> 00:47:35,199
of units I was assigned to as a reporter

788
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,132
for the Army newspapers, such as...

789
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:40,699
NARRATOR: Tiger Force was
not the only platoon

790
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,365
Dennis Stout covered that crossed the line.

791
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:47,532
One such incident was the rape and killing

792
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:49,432
of a Vietnamese girl.

793
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:54,333
She was captured, kept for interrogation.

794
00:47:54,432 --> 00:47:57,300
Over a two-day period, she was raped, then,

795
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,209
on the morning of the third
day, she was killed.

796
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:02,632
Was she raped by more than one person?

797
00:48:02,733 --> 00:48:06,300
Yes, all but the medic and myself,

798
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,160
and possibly one other
man from the platoon.

799
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,233
Did you protest?

800
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,400
Did you try in any way
to have them stopped?

801
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,766
Yes. After the rape incident, I complained

802
00:48:14,865 --> 00:48:19,266
to the battalion sergeant major,
and his response was that

803
00:48:19,365 --> 00:48:21,632
this type of thing happens in all wars,

804
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:25,032
and that I was not to mention
it; it was a common occurrence.

805
00:48:25,132 --> 00:48:29,432
Then later, I went to the
chaplain, told him about it,

806
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,766
he made an investigation himself,

807
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:34,132
found that this was true, went with me

808
00:48:34,233 --> 00:48:35,666
to the sergeant major.

809
00:48:35,766 --> 00:48:39,833
The sergeant major then said that...

810
00:48:39,932 --> 00:48:41,852
well, he told the chaplain
to stick to religion,

811
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,432
sent him away, and then
he told me to keep quiet,

812
00:48:45,532 --> 00:48:49,199
that I did nothave t o return
from the next operation.

813
00:48:50,733 --> 00:48:53,800
NARRATOR: Years later,
another soldier came forward

814
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,599
with more allegations of war crimes,

815
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:00,166
and an Army investigation
would find probable cause

816
00:49:00,266 --> 00:49:05,166
to try 18 members of Tiger
Force for murder or assault.

817
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:08,766
But no charges were ever brought.

818
00:49:08,865 --> 00:49:12,000
The official records were
buried in the archives.

819
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,800
WILLBANKS: They should
have all gone to jail.

820
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,365
They were guilty of murder.

821
00:49:17,465 --> 00:49:18,833
Period.

822
00:49:18,932 --> 00:49:22,365
At the same time, I felt
like that incident,

823
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:25,632
which I think was an
aberration, not the norm,

824
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:28,333
tarred all veterans, and there
are hundreds of thousands

825
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,199
of veterans who went and did their duty,

826
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,733
and as honorable as they possibly could,

827
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:34,599
and they're tarred with the same brush.

828
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:39,965
KARL MARLANTES: One of the things
that I learned in the war is that

829
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:44,699
we're not the top species on
the planet because we're nice.

830
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,965
We are a very aggressive species.

831
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:49,733
It is in us.

832
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:53,166
And people talk a lot about
how, "Well, the military turns

833
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:56,233
kids into killing machines" and stuff.

834
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:00,565
And I'll always argue that
it's just finishing school.

835
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:05,300
What we do with civilization
is that we learn to inhibit

836
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,733
and rope in these aggressive tendencies.

837
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:11,166
And we have to recognize them.

838
00:50:11,266 --> 00:50:15,065
I worry about a whole country
that doesn't recognize it.

839
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:17,108
'Cause you think of how
many times we get ourselves

840
00:50:17,132 --> 00:50:20,465
in scrapes as a nation because
we're always the good guys.

841
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:23,432
Sometimes, I think if we
thought that we weren't always

842
00:50:23,532 --> 00:50:25,865
the good guys, we might
actually get in less wars.

843
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:30,199
(static humming)

844
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,565
REPORTER: Mr. Rubin,

845
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:34,400
how do you realistically expect
to shut down the Pentagon?

846
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,599
The Pentagon represents
the murder of people

847
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:38,965
throughout the world.

848
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:41,199
And the American people have no control

849
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,699
of what their government's doing.

850
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,266
And so we're going to go there
in the scores of thousands,

851
00:50:46,365 --> 00:50:49,432
and block doors and fill hallways,

852
00:50:49,532 --> 00:50:51,565
so the work of the Pentagon stops.

853
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:53,800
Because the work of the
Pentagon should stop.

854
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,175
The only thing to do with the
Pentagon is to shut it down.

00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,465
or in Washington every
fall and every spring.

866
00:51:29,565 --> 00:51:32,599
We decided that we would
go to the demonstration

867
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:36,266
in Washington at the Lincoln
Memorial in the fall of '67,

868
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:38,965
but we would take as many people
out of that demonstration

869
00:51:39,065 --> 00:51:42,865
as we could and lead them to the Pentagon.

870
00:51:42,965 --> 00:51:47,432
And at the Pentagon, try to
do something more militant

871
00:51:47,532 --> 00:51:51,166
than simply stand around and
make speeches opposing the war,

872
00:51:51,266 --> 00:51:54,233
which is what these
demonstrations had become.

Just the idea of getting

of the United States military...

910
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:38,766
It was the first time that
antiwar demonstrators

911
00:53:38,865 --> 00:53:43,266
had confronted active-duty
military personnel.

912
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:45,965
We didn't consider them the enemy.

913
00:53:46,065 --> 00:53:49,532
We considered them victims of the war.

914
00:53:49,632 --> 00:53:54,733
But we began to see our own
government as the enemy.

NARRATOR: President Johnson believed
that international communism

916
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:01,699
was somehow behind the demonstration.

917
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,166
He had directed the CIA to
come up with the evidence,

918
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:09,032

00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,166
This is General Eisenhower.

922
00:54:14,266 --> 00:54:15,476
How've you been, Mr. President?

923
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,432
I'm doing fine under the circumstances.

924
00:54:18,532 --> 00:54:21,166
But we just had hell, and
these college students,

925
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:23,132
I've had Hoover in after them.

926
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:26,666
They came marched here, and
we arrested 600 of them,

927
00:54:26,766 --> 00:54:29,865
and we gave 29 of them pretty tough times.

928
00:54:29,965 --> 00:54:33,300
We found most of them really
were mentally diseased.

929
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,465
Hoover's taken 256 that turned
in supposedly their draft cards.

930
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,932
So, you're dealing with mental problems,

931
00:54:40,032 --> 00:54:42,166
I think that we talk too damn much

932
00:54:42,266 --> 00:54:44,465
about civil liberties and
constitutional rights

933
00:54:44,565 --> 00:54:46,032
of the individual and not enough

934
00:54:46,132 --> 00:54:47,565
about the rights of the masses.

935
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,008
EISENHOWER: That's why we have it.

936
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:51,000
We have freely elected
people and we've got to

937
00:54:51,099 --> 00:54:52,500
stand behind them.

938
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:55,065
JOHNSON: I think your
government's in trouble, General.

939
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,032
I think it's in... I
don't want to say this.

940
00:54:57,132 --> 00:54:58,833
But I think we're in more danger

941
00:54:58,932 --> 00:55:00,833
from these left-wing influences now

942
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:03,800
than we've ever been in
37 years I've been here.

943
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,932
And they're working in
my party from within.

944
00:55:07,032 --> 00:55:09,599
And Bobby thinks he's going
to get the nomination.

945
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:13,932
NARRATOR: Allard Lowenstein, a
38-year-old attorney from New York,

946
00:55:14,032 --> 00:55:17,065
shared the antiwar fervor
of the protestors,

947
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:18,965
but he believed the most effective way

948
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:22,766
to end the fighting was to work
within the political system,

949
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:24,666
not outside it.

950
00:55:24,766 --> 00:55:27,500
The answer, he said, was
to stop Lyndon Johnson

951
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,166
from getting a second
full term as president.

952
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:35,432
He had traveled the country
all year in search of someone

953
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:38,166
willing to challenge the
president in the upcoming

954
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:40,199
Democratic primaries.

955
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,500
He asked Senator Robert
Kennedy of New York,

956
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,599
who had begun to criticize
the Johnson administration

957
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:48,099
over the war.

958
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:51,500
He asked Lieutenant General James Gavin.

959
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,565
He asked Senator George
McGovern of South Dakota.

960
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,800
They all turned him down.

961
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,532
Lowenstein kept looking.

962
00:56:06,532 --> 00:56:11,632
At Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
on November 17, 1967,

963
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:14,965
friends and family of a
fallen soldier gathered

964
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:18,532
for a funeral, one of
five military funerals

965
00:56:18,632 --> 00:56:21,032
held there that month.

966
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:25,865
First Sergeant Pascal Cleatus
Poolaw had been killed

967
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,465
as he tried to drag one of his wounded men

968
00:56:28,565 --> 00:56:33,333
off the battlefield near
the village of Loc Ninh.

969
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:38,565
He was a remarkable soldier, had
been awarded one Silver Star

970
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:44,132
in World War II, two more in
Korea, and was awarded a fourth,

971
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:48,465
posthumously, for his gallantry in Vietnam.

972
00:56:48,565 --> 00:56:51,632
He was a Kiowa Indian.

973
00:56:51,733 --> 00:56:54,599
He and three of his sons were among

974
00:56:54,699 --> 00:56:59,699
the 42,000 Native Americans
who would serve in Vietnam,

975
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,500
the highest per capita service
rate of any ethnic group

976
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,766
in the United States.

977
00:57:05,865 --> 00:57:10,800
Pascal Poolaw's widow
spoke at the ceremony.

978
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,532
"He has followed the trail of
the great chiefs," she said.

979
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:19,833
"His people hold him in
honor and highest esteem.

MUSGRAVE: I didn't hear the word
"hippie" until I was at Con Thien

993
00:58:09,932 --> 00:58:11,341
and we got aPlaybo y, somebody
got aPlayboy in the mail,

994
00:58:11,365 --> 00:58:14,266
which was obviously very important to us.

995
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,465
And there was an article on Haight-Ashbury

996
00:58:16,565 --> 00:58:18,165
and pictures of the girls running around

997
00:58:18,233 --> 00:58:19,865
without their tops, you know, free love.

998
00:58:19,965 --> 00:58:21,365
And they were hippies.

999
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:23,965
And we thought it was "hip
pie" cause it had two Ps.

1000
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:25,833
You know, "Hey, I'm gonna go home

00:58:25,932 --> 00:58:27,266

You know, even I could score.

1005
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:36,766
But the only information I
had of the peace movement

1006
00:58:36,865 --> 00:58:38,500
came fromStars and Stripes.

1007
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:42,132
And that wasn't a real objective newspaper.

1008
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:44,565
And so I hated them

1009
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:46,565
before I ever even knew
anything about them.

continued to make life miserable

for John Musgrave and the
other Marines at Con Thien.

1013
00:59:00,565 --> 00:59:04,565
But by early November, the worst
of the shelling had ended.

1014
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,166
American airstrikes,
artillery, and Navy fire

1015
00:59:08,266 --> 00:59:11,565
had taken a fearful toll
on the besieging enemy.

1016
00:59:13,365 --> 00:59:18,833
Before dawn on November 7, two
companies of Musgrave's outfit

1017
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,666
were sent half a mile into the countryside

1018
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:25,065
northwest of the base to
sweep the area again.

area that was old hedgerows

1021

Very difficult to see very far.

1022

In the clear area, we had
three NVA show themselves

rounds out of their AKs

1036
01:00:10,965 --> 01:00:14,266
And... we went.

1037
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,099
(gunfire)

1038
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:19,565
And I can't tell you a whole
lot about the ambush.

1039
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:21,699
I was one of the first people to be shot.

1040
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,599
One round put me down.

1041
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:25,233
(gunfire)

1042
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:28,800
And my grenadier was down, and
we were trying to get him back.

1043
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:33,000
And Marines, from the
first day in boot camp,

1044
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:35,599
you learn that Marines
don't leave their dead,

1045
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:39,233
and they never, never leave their wounded.

1046
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:43,365
And that's why I'm alive today.

1047
01:00:43,465 --> 01:00:47,733
First guy that came for me...
I was lying on my face...

1048
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:49,233
(gunfire)

1049
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:51,766
he reached down and stuck
his arms under my shoulders

1050
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:56,233
and lifted me up and the
machine gun wasn't any far,

1051
01:00:56,333 --> 01:01:01,932
was maybe nine feet, ten feet
at the most, away from me.

1052
01:01:02,032 --> 01:01:03,565
This is a very intimate ambush.

1053
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:04,666
It's a brawl.

1054
01:01:04,766 --> 01:01:06,166
(gunfire)

1055
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:10,333
And he fired a burst into
my chest that blew me out

1056
01:01:10,432 --> 01:01:13,965
of the Marine's arms that was
holding me and then he was shot.

1057
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:16,532
(gunfire)

1058
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:22,865
Another very brave young Marine,
this 18-year-old from Louisiana,

1059
01:01:22,965 --> 01:01:26,000
his first firefight, had seen what happened

1060
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,266
and still came for me.

1061
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:34,032
And he reached for me, and he was
shot I think in the forearm.

1062
01:01:34,132 --> 01:01:36,932
And he was laying beside me.

1063
01:01:37,032 --> 01:01:38,876
Now, I've got a hole through
my chest big enough

1064
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,465
to stick your fist through.

1065
01:01:41,432 --> 01:01:42,632
I'm dying and I know it.

1066
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:43,865
(gunfire)

1067
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:46,565
And I heard this horrible
screaming going on,

1068
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:50,333
and I was trying to figure out
who was screaming like that,

1069
01:01:50,432 --> 01:01:51,699
because it sounded so...

1070
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,766
(distant gunfire)

1071
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:00,333
And then I realized it was me.

1072
01:02:03,065 --> 01:02:05,500
When they began to drag us
out, they were being pursued

1073
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,400
by the North Vietnamese,
and they would drop us

1074
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,166
and lay on top of us.

1075
01:02:11,266 --> 01:02:12,599
They knew... we were both dying.

1076
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:16,032
The grenadier had been shot in
the right side of his chest.

1077
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,233
They knew... we were both dead.

1078
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:21,000
But we were still alive.

1079
01:02:21,099 --> 01:02:22,632
So, they weren't gonna leave us.

1080
01:02:22,733 --> 01:02:24,833
They would die before they would leave us.

1081
01:02:24,932 --> 01:02:26,976
And they covered us with
their bodies and fired back

1082
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,233
at the NVA and then they'd jump
up and drag us a little farther

1083
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,666
and then drop us and lay back on top of us.

1084
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:35,632
And I kept telling them to leave me.

1085
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,365
And I meant it. I meant it.

1086
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:41,599
But all of a sudden I got scared
that they might really leave me.

1087
01:02:42,965 --> 01:02:43,965
(distant gunfire)

1088
01:02:44,065 --> 01:02:46,532
I was triaged three times.

1089
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:49,465
And the senior corpsman said,

1090
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,276
"He's either shot through
the heart or the lungs.

1091
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,508
There's nothing I can do for him."

1092
01:02:52,532 --> 01:02:54,199
And he just turned away.

1093
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,400
I went, "Well, okay."

1094
01:02:57,365 --> 01:03:01,032
And then, a helicopter came in.

1095
01:03:01,132 --> 01:03:02,699
And they threw me into the bird.

1096
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,099
(distant helicopter blades humming)

1097
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,432
And the corpsman on the bird
straddled me, stood over me,

1098
01:03:08,532 --> 01:03:11,532
and looked down at me, and then
looked up at the door gunner

1099
01:03:11,632 --> 01:03:15,432
and went... get me out of the way

1100
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:16,608
because he couldn't work on me.

1101
01:03:16,632 --> 01:03:18,166
I was a dead man.

1102
01:03:18,266 --> 01:03:20,132
(muted helicopter blades beating)

1103
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:22,132
And they flew me to Delta Med at Dong Ha.

1104
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:26,266
And I thought, "Okay, I made it this far."

1105
01:03:26,365 --> 01:03:28,045
And this doctor comes over and looks at me

1106
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:29,666
and I'm conscious.

1107
01:03:29,766 --> 01:03:32,000
I'm lucid.

1108
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,500
And he checks a couple of things.

1109
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:34,876
And I've got this huge hole in me.

1110
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,441
And he looks at me right
in the eye, and he says,

1111
01:03:36,465 --> 01:03:38,233
"What's your religion, Marine?"

1112
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:40,400
And I said, "Well, I'm a Protestant."

1113
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,642
And he says, "Get a chaplain over here.

1114
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:43,266
I can't help this man."

1115
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:44,365
And then he walked away.

1116
01:03:45,733 --> 01:03:51,000
Another surgeon walks by,
and he looked at me,

1117
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:55,199
and I was raised to
always be nice to people.

1118
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:59,099
And when he looked at me, I
smiled at him and nodded.

1119
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:03,365
And he said, "Why isn't
somebody helping this man?"

1120
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:04,766
And inside I'm going,

1121
01:04:04,865 --> 01:04:06,625
"Yeah, why isn't somebody
helping this man?"

1122
01:04:07,699 --> 01:04:10,632
When they put me to sleep, I thought,

1123
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:13,766
"Boy, this is really it," you know.

1124
01:04:13,865 --> 01:04:16,465
And it was kind of, "Okay, God,

1125
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:19,166
into your hands, I deliver my spirit."

1126
01:04:20,365 --> 01:04:22,233
And I thought that was it.

1127
01:04:24,233 --> 01:04:26,433
And when I woke up in the
surgical intensive care ward,

1128
01:04:26,532 --> 01:04:28,932
which was a Quonset hut,

1129
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,565
I thought, "Holy mackerel."

1130
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:35,699
I just couldn't... I couldn't believe it.

1131
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,900
Yesterday over Hanoi,

1132
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,766
three American planes were shot down

1133
01:04:42,865 --> 01:04:45,500
and at least two of their pilots captured.

1134
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,132
One of them was Lieutenant
Commander John McCain III,

1135
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:52,400
the son of the U.S. Naval
commander in Europe.

1136
01:04:53,733 --> 01:04:56,166
BAO NINH:

1137
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:33,500
NARRATOR: Hanoi was so pleased
to have captured the son

1138
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,000
of an American admiral that they
allowed a French journalist

1139
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,632
to interview McCain in the hospital.

1140
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:44,032
He had just had his broken bones
set without even an aspirin

1141
01:05:44,132 --> 01:05:45,565
for the pain.

1142
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:46,906
INTERVIEWER: What is your name?

1143
01:05:46,965 --> 01:05:50,032
Lieutenant Commander John McCain.

1144
01:05:50,132 --> 01:05:53,199
How many raids have you
done until the last one?

1145
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,065
About 23.

1146
01:05:55,166 --> 01:05:59,865
In which circumstances
have you been shot down?

1147
01:05:59,965 --> 01:06:04,733
I was on a flight over the city of Hanoi,

1148
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:11,932
and I was bombing and I was
hit by either a missile

1149
01:06:12,032 --> 01:06:13,733
or anti-aircraft fire.

1150
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:20,833
I'm not sure which, and the
plane continued straight down,

1151
01:06:20,932 --> 01:06:28,932
and I ejected and broke
my leg and both arms

1152
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:36,365
and went into a lake;
parachuted into a lake.

1153
01:06:36,465 --> 01:06:41,333
And I was picked up by
some North Vietnamese

1154
01:06:41,432 --> 01:06:47,500
and taken to the hospital,
where I almost died.

1155
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,865
I would just like to tell...

1156
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:56,666
...my wife...

1157
01:06:57,465 --> 01:07:00,032
...I will get well...

1158
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:09,300
...and I love her and I
hope to see her soon.

1159
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,400
NARRATOR: After the
interview, McCain was beaten

1160
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,565
for not expressing sufficient
gratitude to his captors.

1161
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,266
(soldiers conversing)

1162
01:07:25,365 --> 01:07:29,800
NARRATOR: All through the fall
of 1967, the North Vietnamese

1163
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,632
and the Viet Cong continued their
series of "Border Battles"

1164
01:07:33,733 --> 01:07:36,266
in preparation for their
surprise offensive,

1165
01:07:36,365 --> 01:07:38,300
still months away.

1166
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,199
Con Thien, where John Musgrave was wounded,

1167
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,766
had been the first.

1168
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:47,599
Then came the ARVN base at Song Be.

1169
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,166
The South Vietnamese outpost adjacent to

1170
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:53,400
the provincial capital
of Loc Ninh was next.

1171
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,432
There, large units of North Vietnamese

1172
01:07:56,532 --> 01:08:00,333
and Viet Cong regulars mounted
a coordinated attack,

1173
01:08:00,432 --> 01:08:03,800
and then fought for five days
to hold on to the ground

1174
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:07,766
they'd gained, something
they had never done before.

1175
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:11,466
American commanders were puzzled.

1176
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:16,199
Then, in early November,
reports reached MACV

1177
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,565
that five North Vietnamese regiments

1178
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:22,966
and a Viet Cong battalion...
some 7,000 men in all...

1179
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:25,666
had begun massing in the Central Highlands

1180
01:08:25,765 --> 01:08:30,432
around the U.S. Special
Forces camp at Dak To again.

1181
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:35,166
Among the North Vietnamese
regulars was Nguyen Thanh Son,

1182
01:08:35,265 --> 01:08:38,565
who had been so eager to
fight that he too had filled

1183
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:42,765
his pockets with rocks
to pass his physical.

1184
01:08:43,932 --> 01:08:46,666
NGUYEN THANH SON:

1185
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,365
NARRATOR: As the NVA deployed their troops,

1186
01:09:00,466 --> 01:09:03,399
Westmoreland sent his to Dak To,

1187
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,065
exactly what the enemy wanted him to do.

1188
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:12,399
Among the Americans were the men
of the elite 173rd Airborne,

1189
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,100
Westmoreland's Fire Brigade.

1190
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,699
MATT HARRISON: We all knew in a general
sense that we wouldn't be brought back

1191
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,733
if there wasn't something big going on.

1192
01:09:27,832 --> 01:09:33,265
You just knew that the area was
crawling with North Vietnamese,

1193
01:09:33,365 --> 01:09:37,899
and that they were there not
to avoid contact with us,

1194
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,733
but they were there to
have contact with us.

1195
01:09:42,132 --> 01:09:44,399
NARRATOR: First Lieutenant
Matthew Harrison was now

1196
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,265
with Alpha Company of the 2nd Battalion,

1197
01:09:47,365 --> 01:09:49,899
the same rifle company
that had been ambushed

1198
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,233
and so badly shattered back in
June on the slopes of Hill 1338,

1199
01:09:55,332 --> 01:09:58,000
just 14 miles to the east.

1200
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,733
HARRISON: This wasn't like the Viet
Cong where if you could find them,

1201
01:10:01,832 --> 01:10:03,100
you could kill them.

1202
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,500
Our problem wasn't finding them.

1203
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,881
Our problem was what to do
with them once you found them.

1204
01:10:06,932 --> 01:10:12,100
NARRATOR: The 174th NVA
Regiment was waiting.

1205
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:16,000
Nguyen Thanh Son and his
men were already dug in

1206
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,166
on the high ground they knew
the Americans would want

1207
01:10:19,265 --> 01:10:24,000
to command: Hill 875.

1208
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,199
NGUYEN THANH SON:

1209
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:50,399
NARRATOR: On Sunday
morning, November 19, 1967,

1210
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,000
Alpha, Charlie, and Delta
Companies were ordered

1211
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,000
to take Hill 875.

1212
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:00,565
Matt Harrison had been
wounded in an earlier fight

1213
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:03,500
and was not permitted to accompany his men.

1214
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,899
He anxiously followed their
progress over the radio.

1215
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,699
Heavy artillery and flights of
F-100s blasted the hillside

1216
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,632
ahead of them, meant to
knock out enemy positions

1217
01:11:16,733 --> 01:11:19,932
before the paratroopers
ever got within range.

1218
01:11:21,565 --> 01:11:23,733
NGUYEN THANH SON:

1219
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,199
NARRATOR: The three companies
moved up the slope,

1220
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,733
Charlie and Delta in the lead,

1221
01:11:41,832 --> 01:11:45,033
Alpha bringing up the rear.

1222
01:11:45,132 --> 01:11:48,600
The paratroopers stepped
warily into a clearing

1223
01:11:48,699 --> 01:11:51,932
filled with fallen trees from
the morning's bombardment

1224
01:11:52,033 --> 01:11:56,832
and only a little over 300
yards from the summit.

1225
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,800
NGUYEN THANH SON:

1226
01:12:10,265 --> 01:12:11,932
(gunfire)

1227
01:12:12,033 --> 01:12:15,033
NARRATOR: Thousands of automatic
weapon rounds ripped through the air.

1228
01:12:15,132 --> 01:12:18,199
Chinese-made grenades
came rolling and bumping

1229
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,699
down the slopes.

1230
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,033
The Americans sought cover where
they could behind fallen trees,

1231
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:26,733
scrabbled at the earth with their helmets,

1232
01:12:26,832 --> 01:12:29,033
trying to dig fighting holes.

1233
01:12:29,132 --> 01:12:31,865
(gunfire)

1234
01:12:31,966 --> 01:12:33,332
(soldiers yelling)

1235
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,733
(rapid gunfire)

1236
01:12:35,832 --> 01:12:38,733
Charlie and Delta companies
were pinned down

1237
01:12:38,832 --> 01:12:41,733
and being torn to pieces.

1238
01:12:41,832 --> 01:12:43,065
(gunfire)

1239
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,000
Meanwhile, near the foot of the hill,

1240
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,199
other North Vietnamese troops
surprised Alpha Company

1241
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,632
from behind.

1242
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:52,800
They were first spotted
moving up through the trees

1243
01:12:52,899 --> 01:12:56,600
by a private from the Bronx
named Carlos Lozada.

1244
01:12:56,699 --> 01:12:59,865
As the men of his company
scrambled up the slope,

1245
01:12:59,966 --> 01:13:01,765
dragging their wounded with them,

1246
01:13:01,865 --> 01:13:04,432
Lozada provided what cover he could,

1247
01:13:04,533 --> 01:13:07,300
firing his M-60 machine gun from his hip...

1248
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:10,132
before a bullet hit him in the head.

1249
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:16,332
He would be awarded a
posthumous Medal of Honor.

1250
01:13:16,432 --> 01:13:20,332
Back home, the battle led the nightly news.

1251
01:13:20,432 --> 01:13:22,033
(helicopter humming)

1252
01:13:22,132 --> 01:13:25,033
WALTER CRONKITE: The Battle of
Dak To is now on its 19th day,

1253
01:13:25,132 --> 01:13:27,432
and already ranks among
the bloodiest campaigns

1254
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:28,966
of the Vietnam War.

1255
01:13:29,065 --> 01:13:30,699
There's no sign yet of any let-up.

1256
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,332
Over the weekend, three companies

1257
01:13:32,432 --> 01:13:36,432
of the 173rd Airborne Brigade
moved down this river valley,

1258
01:13:36,533 --> 01:13:39,432
up which North Vietnamese
normally infiltrate,

1259
01:13:39,533 --> 01:13:42,600
until they got down here by Hill 875.

1260
01:13:42,699 --> 01:13:45,033
Then, they came under
heavy fire from the hill.

1261
01:13:45,132 --> 01:13:47,233
Two of the three companies
charged the hill,

1262
01:13:47,332 --> 01:13:49,199
the other stayed back as a rear guard.

1263
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,632
They found a...

1264
01:13:50,733 --> 01:13:53,865
HARRISON: By early afternoon,
the three companies

1265
01:13:53,966 --> 01:13:56,233
had basically been decapitated.

1266
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:58,132
The company commanders were dead;

1267
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:01,300
most of the officers and
most of the NCOs were dead.

1268
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:03,100
(soldiers yelling)

1269
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,899
NARRATOR: The survivors from
all three companies clustered

1270
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,699
in the clearing and did
their best to set up

1271
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,466
a defensive circle.

1272
01:14:10,565 --> 01:14:15,199
American bombs and napalm
pounded enemy positions

1273
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,800
until it grew almost too dark to see.

1274
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:21,666
NGUYEN THANH SON:

1275
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:51,899
NARRATOR: Then, another American plane
roared in and dropped two bombs.

1276
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
One landed among the hidden enemy troops.

1277
01:14:56,233 --> 01:15:00,800
The other fell directly on the Americans.

1278
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:05,699
In a fraction of a second, 42 were killed.

1279
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,733
A badly hit lieutenant managed
to find a working radio.

1280
01:15:09,832 --> 01:15:13,265
"No more fucking planes,"
he shouted into it.

1281
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:16,100
"You're killingus up here."

1282
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:17,565
(explosion)

1283
01:15:17,666 --> 01:15:19,932
The fighting on the hillside continued.

1284
01:15:20,033 --> 01:15:24,466
The men ran out of water, began
to run out of ammunition.

1285
01:15:24,565 --> 01:15:29,300
Helicopters that tried to ferry
in supplies were shot down.

1286
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:37,765
The following day, Matt Harrison
was able to chopper in.

1287
01:15:37,865 --> 01:15:39,466
HARRISON: It was chaos.

1288
01:15:39,565 --> 01:15:42,365
It was collections of guys
who had who had tunneled

1289
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:44,666
and dug down behind trees.

1290
01:15:44,765 --> 01:15:48,199
These were guys who had gone
without water in that heat

1291
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,800
for two days.

1292
01:15:49,899 --> 01:15:53,899
And almost every one of them was wounded.

1293
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,033
And then all around were bodies,

1294
01:15:58,132 --> 01:16:02,432
guys who had been shot and blown up.

1295
01:16:02,533 --> 01:16:04,166
It was the third circle of hell.

1296
01:16:06,932 --> 01:16:11,399
NARRATOR: On November 23, two
fresh battalions of the 173rd

1297
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,033
finally made it to the top of the hill,

1298
01:16:14,132 --> 01:16:16,966
for which so many had died.

1299
01:16:17,065 --> 01:16:18,832
But the night before,

1300
01:16:18,932 --> 01:16:21,832
the surviving North Vietnamese
troops had slipped down

1301
01:16:21,932 --> 01:16:28,166
the other side and disappeared
into Cambodia and Laos.

1302
01:16:28,265 --> 01:16:30,899
The powers that be decided
it would be important

1303
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,466
to our morale for us to be in on
the taking the top of the hill.

1304
01:16:35,565 --> 01:16:40,800
I had 26 guys left out of a
company that started out of 140,

1305
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:43,565
and all 26 had been wounded.

1306
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:47,966
NARRATOR: Then Harrison and his
exhausted men were helicoptered

1307
01:16:48,065 --> 01:16:49,832
to the top of yet another hill.

1308
01:16:49,932 --> 01:16:51,632
(helicopter blades whirring)

1309
01:16:55,565 --> 01:16:57,800
It was Thanksgiving.

1310
01:16:57,899 --> 01:17:01,166
Chinook helicopters clattered
down out of the sky,

1311
01:17:01,265 --> 01:17:04,899
carrying huge containers of hot
turkey and mashed potatoes

1312
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,500
and cranberry sauce so
that the 173rd could have

1313
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,533
their Thanksgiving dinner.

1314
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:14,199
If there are any more
remote or dangerous spots

1315
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,340
to spend Thanksgiving Day
in Vietnam than this one,

1316
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:18,500
then most of these men
have never seen them.

1317
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,000
HARRISON: There was a TV cameraman
and reporter off to the side

1318
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,699
using us as a backdrop.

1319
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,500
And I remember hearing the reporter intone,

1320
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,666
"Today is November 23, Thanksgiving Day,"

1321
01:17:29,765 --> 01:17:33,533
and I was really angry.

1322
01:17:33,632 --> 01:17:37,533
It's as though we were entertainers.

1323
01:17:39,033 --> 01:17:44,832
NARRATOR: 107 Americans
had died taking Hill 875;

1324
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:47,800
another 282 were wounded.

1325
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:49,632
Ten more were missing.

1326
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:53,565
The number of North Vietnamese
casualties is unknown,

1327
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:57,632
but their losses are thought
to have been staggering.

1328
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:03,565
Back in June, Matt Harrison had
lost two West Point classmates

1329
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:06,300
on Hill 1338.

1330
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:09,432
He lost two more on Hill 875.

1331
01:18:09,533 --> 01:18:13,166
Of the eight with whom he had
served in the 2nd Battalion,

1332
01:18:13,265 --> 01:18:17,565
four were now dead and
two had been wounded.

1333
01:18:20,132 --> 01:18:23,600
HARRISON: To take tops of mountains
in a triple canopy jungle

1334
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,832
along the Cambodian-Laotian
border accomplished nothing

1335
01:18:26,932 --> 01:18:29,100
of any importance.

1336
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:35,399
The Battle for Hill 875
was, in my thinking today,

1337
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:38,865
a microcosm of what we were
doing and what went wrong

1338
01:18:38,966 --> 01:18:40,399
in Vietnam.

1339
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:44,233
There was no reason to take that hill.

1340
01:18:44,332 --> 01:18:48,033
We literally got to the top of the hill

1341
01:18:48,132 --> 01:18:54,899
about mid-day on November
23 and sat there for,

1342
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,832
I don't know, half an hour, an hour,

1343
01:18:56,932 --> 01:19:00,899
just kind of gathering ourselves
and everything together.

1344
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,265
Chinooks came in, took us off the hill.

1345
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:08,233
And I doubt that there's
been an American on Hill 875

1346
01:19:08,332 --> 01:19:10,399
since November 23.

1347
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,765
We accomplished nothing.

1348
01:19:12,865 --> 01:19:16,399
WILLIAM WESTMORELAND: A new
phase is now starting.

1349
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,432
We have reached an important
point when the end

1350
01:19:19,533 --> 01:19:21,800
begins to come into view.

1351
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:27,065
NARRATOR: As Matt Harrison and
his men fought for Hill 875,

1352
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:29,800
the Johnson administration was in the midst

1353
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:31,699
of a "Success Offensive,"

1354
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:36,666
a PR campaign aimed at shoring
up support for the war

1355
01:19:36,765 --> 01:19:39,265
and the way it was being waged.

1356
01:19:39,365 --> 01:19:43,666
MACV released a new and
surprisingly low estimate

1357
01:19:43,765 --> 01:19:47,699
of enemy forces to show how
much damage the United States

1358
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,166
had done to them.

1359
01:19:49,265 --> 01:19:53,632
It was only two-thirds of the
total suggested by the CIA,

1360
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:56,166
because, after a bitter
and prolonged debate

1361
01:19:56,265 --> 01:19:59,132
behind the scenes, Westmoreland had chosen

1362
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:02,300
to exclude from it the
part-time guerrillas...

1363
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:06,432
farmers, old men, women, even children...

1364
01:20:06,533 --> 01:20:10,265
who helped place the mines,
grenades, and booby traps

1365
01:20:10,365 --> 01:20:12,432
that accounted for more than a third

1366
01:20:12,533 --> 01:20:15,065
of all American casualties.

1367
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:18,199
General Westmoreland also told the press

1368
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,832
that the impressive body
counts his commanders reported

1369
01:20:21,932 --> 01:20:24,533
were "very, very conservative."

1370
01:20:24,632 --> 01:20:27,100
It probably represented, he said,

1371
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:31,765
"50 percent or even less of the
enemy that has been killed."

1372
01:20:31,865 --> 01:20:35,565
Ambassador Ellsworth
Bunker joined the chorus,

1373
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:39,365
using a metaphor first
used 13 years earlier

1374
01:20:39,466 --> 01:20:42,000
by the French commander in Vietnam,

1375
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:46,666
not long before their great
defeat at Dien Bien Phu.

1376
01:20:46,765 --> 01:20:50,000
And I think we're now
beginning to see light

1377
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,466
at the end of the tunnel.

1378
01:20:51,565 --> 01:20:54,699
Mr. Ambassador, you talk about
light at the end of the tunnel.

1379
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,332
How long is this tunnel?

1380
01:20:56,432 --> 01:20:59,000
Well, I don't think that you can put it

1381
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:04,899
into any particular timeframe,
a situation like this.

1382
01:21:06,432 --> 01:21:10,765
NARRATOR: LBJ's Success
Offensive succeeded.

1383
01:21:10,865 --> 01:21:14,199
The number of Americans who
believed the United States

1384
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:18,966
was making real progress in the war grew.

1385
01:21:19,065 --> 01:21:22,399
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara

1386
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:26,565
did not take part in the
public relations campaign.

1387
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:30,300
He had become so disillusioned
with the war he'd done so much

1388
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:32,899
to plan and prosecute that he wrote

1389
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,332
another secret memo to the president,

1390
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:39,365
advising Johnson to freeze
American troop levels,

1391
01:21:39,466 --> 01:21:43,100
turn over ground operations
to the South Vietnamese,

1392
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,600
and halt the bombing of North Vietnam

1393
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:48,699
"in order to bring about negotiations."

1394
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,432
There was no reason to
believe, McNamara wrote,

1395
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:56,233
that the prolonged "infliction
of grievous casualties,

1396
01:21:56,332 --> 01:21:59,000
"or the heavy punishment
of air bombardment,

1397
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:02,065
"will suffice to break the
will of the North Vietnamese

1398
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:03,600
"and Viet Cong.

1399
01:22:03,699 --> 01:22:06,832
"The continuation of our
present course of action

1400
01:22:06,932 --> 01:22:11,800
"in Southeast Asia would be
dangerous, costly in lives,

1401
01:22:11,899 --> 01:22:15,132
and unsatisfactory to the American people."

1402
01:22:15,233 --> 01:22:18,432
Johnson never responded.

1403
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:21,565
Instead, he arranged for McNamara to become

1404
01:22:21,666 --> 01:22:24,600
the president of the World Bank.

1405
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:28,533
McNamara would keep silent about
the doubts he had harbored

1406
01:22:28,632 --> 01:22:30,733
since the beginning of the ground war

1407
01:22:30,832 --> 01:22:34,332
for the next 28 years.

1408
01:22:34,432 --> 01:22:37,432
His successor as defense secretary would be

1409
01:22:37,533 --> 01:22:38,765
Clark Clifford,

1410
01:22:38,865 --> 01:22:42,432
a prominent Washington
lawyer and trusted counselor

1411
01:22:42,533 --> 01:22:46,000
to Democratic presidents, whom
Johnson was sure would be

1412
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:47,832
supportive of the war.

1413
01:22:47,932 --> 01:22:50,000
Students of Harvard...

1414
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,399
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, Allard
Lowenstein's yearlong search

1415
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,932
for a Democratic challenger
to the president

1416
01:22:56,033 --> 01:22:58,065
had finally succeeded.

1417
01:22:58,166 --> 01:23:04,132
On November 30, 1967, Minnesota
senator Eugene McCarthy

1418
01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:06,100
announced that he would run.

1419
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:08,832
This is an issue which has to be taken

1420
01:23:08,932 --> 01:23:12,365
to the people of the country
in the campaign of 1968.

1421
01:23:12,466 --> 01:23:13,500
(crowd cheers)

1422
01:23:15,565 --> 01:23:18,565
NARRATOR: By the end of 1967,

1423
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:24,132
20,057 Americans had died in Vietnam.

1424
01:23:24,233 --> 01:23:27,500
The time had come, General
Westmoreland said,

1425
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,466
for an "all-out offensive on all fronts."

1426
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:38,733
But the enemy was just a
month away from launching

1427
01:23:38,832 --> 01:23:41,865
an all-out offensive of its own.

1428
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,220
