1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:02,901
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:05,496
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:14,843
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:20,584
<i>Michael Bluth and his family were
meeting with their new attorney.</i>

6
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:23,930
Look, this is not the first time I've been
brought in to replace Barry Zuckerkorn.

7
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,256
I think I can do for you
everything he did...

8
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,955
plus skew younger...
with juries and so forth.

9
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:30,691
Any other questions?

10
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:33,791
Yes. How can you be even cuter in person
than you are in your ads?

11
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:36,393
<i>Are you a CEO, CFO or other executive...</i>

12
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:38,803
<i>facing these or similar charges?</i>

13
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:43,867
Why should you go to jail for
a crime someone else... noticed?

14
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,745
You don't need double-talk.
You need Bob Loblaw.

15
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:49,783
<i>Bob Loblaw no habla espanol.</i>

16
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:52,445
Well, we're not here to talk
nonsense to Bob Loblaw.

17
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,886
We need to find out if the government
has a good case against us.

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,950
I mean, there is a lot of proof that
my father was building houses in Iraq.

19
00:00:57,993 --> 00:01:00,723
Well, your father claims he was
put up to it by a British syndicate.

20
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,114
<i>And you've been threatened.
Isn't that correct?</i>

21
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,423
<i>It was.</i>

22
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:06,729
How would you like someone going after
some stupid person in your family?

23
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:09,565
Now, back off, you!@%$? ponce!

24
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,400
It's been a week.
Nothing's happened.

25
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:14,600
Yeah, but you're not the one stuck
under house arrest like a sitting duck.

26
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,609
Oh, yeah. That's my father.

27
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:19,236
That's why we had the meeting
here... so he couldn't interfere.

28
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:22,748
Interfere? I oughta pull down
your pants and spank your ass raw.

29
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:25,251
I'm sorry.
Have we met?

30
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:28,789
Oh, yes. This is Larry Middleman.
He's your father's surrogate.

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,154
- Surrogate?
- That's right, you dumb!@%$.

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,250
I hired this guy to wear
a camera in his hat...

33
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:36,091
so he could be my eyes and ears
while I'm stuck in this penthouse.

34
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:39,224
This camera helps me
keep tabs on you idiots...

35
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:41,427
while this thing rubs my ankle raw.

36
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:44,994
- I mean, look at this thing.
- I can't even go in the hallway...

37
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:48,440
- Without hearing that...
- Beep, beep, beep.

38
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:51,273
That's one of my partners.
Excuse me.

39
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,745
Uh, I would like to be
one of your partners.

40
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:56,647
Do you think he got that?
The two meanings?

41
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,651
He's running pretty fast.
I think he did.

42
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:00,713
Well, he was flirting earlier.
I'll tell you that.

43
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:03,656
Just so you know,
I'm looking to get divorced.

44
00:02:03,758 --> 00:02:05,282
- Are you interested?
- Yes.

45
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:12,133
Let's call that a half hour.

46
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:13,707
So you're not the only one
who's got a date later.

47
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,203
You've got a date?

48
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,305
Her name's Rita. She
teaches children at a

49
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:19,330
private school, and we're
just having lunch.

50
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,534
Oh, lunch. Well, you better
bring some dog food.

51
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:25,204
All the girls you date are dogs.
Dogs love dog food, right, Pop?

52
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,577
Shut up, you idiot.
I'm trying to watch the game.

53
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:30,116
Just trying
to make you laugh, Dad.

54
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:32,914
<i>- It's all I ever wanted.
- Smith the catcher...</i>

55
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:35,751
You know, Gob, she's not a dog.
It's just the opposite actually.

56
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:40,920
She's exquisitely beautiful. She's fun,
carefree, smart, full of surprises.

57
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:44,430
<i>Including the fact that
she was working with this man...</i>

58
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,865
<i>who was currently
dropping her off for her date.</i>

59
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:50,267
Now all this fun and carefree act
is only gonna fool him for so long.

60
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:52,192
I'm a big girl.

61
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,035
Yeah. Well, if he finds
out what you really are...

62
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,838
he might not make things
so simple for you.

63
00:02:56,945 --> 00:03:00,346
Rita, don't forget your hat.

64
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,550
- Who am I kidding? She's too good for me.
- How do you think I feel?

65
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:10,181
Bob Loblaw's a handsome,
professional man...

66
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,886
and I'm only used to...
well, none of those things.

67
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:16,054
Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting
that I was a professional twice over?

68
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:19,895
An analyst and a therapist.
The world's first "analrapist."

69
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:23,767
Yes, and you were almost arrested
for those business cards.

70
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:25,640
Yes. No, it did not look
good on paper, but I

71
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:27,432
didn't stop because of
the police inquiries.

72
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,636
I stopped to raise our little daughter.

73
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:33,202
But since we both have started
to grow hair in unexpected places...

74
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:36,148
I suppose I shall soon
be working as a leading man...

75
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,412
and she may soon start dating.

76
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,080
<i>Maeby had already started dating.</i>

77
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:43,214
Another date with, uh, Steve Holt?

78
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:45,452
Yeah. We're gettin' pretty serious.

79
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,621
<i>They weren't. She was just avoiding her
real crush on George Michael.</i>

80
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,596
That Steve sure knows
how to please a lady.

81
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,500
Good. I was hoping
he would be gifted sexually.

82
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:59,062
I guess it makes sense. You know,
uh, older guys expect certain things.

83
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:02,268
- They do?
- What a fun, sexy time for you.

84
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:04,777
I'd be very careful
of these British people.

85
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,746
They're gonna try to get their hands on
any evidence they can to hurt the family.

86
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,749
So you're saying shred the evidence?

87
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,082
No, that's illegal. The prosecution
is entitled to that evidence.

88
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:15,918
- Without it, they don't have a case.
- So shred the evidence?

89
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:19,118
That's a felony. And I certainly couldn't
endorse anything like that.

90
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:21,161
Got ya. Wink.

91
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:23,697
Wink. Did you say wink?

92
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,323
<i>- Or did you wink?
- He said that too, Dad.</i>

93
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,299
We'll talk soon, folks. Thank you.

94
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:31,099
Where are you going?
Where is the surrogate going?

95
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:34,141
Stay there. I want to see what
he's gonna say. Don't leave.

96
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:36,142
See ya, Pop.

97
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,906
You know, Gob, instead of trying
to impress your fake father...

98
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:41,175
maybe you should spend
some time with your real son.

99
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:44,446
- Steve Holt's not my son.
- Steve Holt? The moron jock?

100
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,986
That's my son, you pothead.

101
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,840
Hey, that's my son!

102
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:50,615
Wait. So that means that
Steve Holt is my cousin?

103
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:54,286
- And Maeby's cousin too.
- I guess. Shoot, I'm late for my date.

104
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:57,559
Yeah. At the kennel!

105
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,898
You lobbed that one right over
the plate, Michael. Home run.

106
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:05,200
<i>And Michael hurried to the British
section of Orange County for his date.</i>

107
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:08,071
Crazy American!
Get out of the road!

108
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:12,545
<i>Only to find that Rita had chosen Wee
Britain's one American-themed restaurant.</i>

109
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:15,047
Oh, hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

110
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,984
Oh, no bother. I've been having
such fun on this spaceship.

111
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,419
Strike one, huh?
Shall we go ahead and sit down?

112
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:29,429
Hey, dudes, I'll get you
a couple of 64-ounce colas...

113
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,761
to wash down
this basket of doughnuts...

114
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:35,267
I guess this is what
the British think of Americans.

115
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,032
- We like our food.
- Whatever do you mean?

116
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,300
Yeah.

117
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:43,008
Uh, you know, uh, Rita,
you're gonna figure this out eventually...

118
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,571
but I have not been on a date
in a long, long time.

119
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
- Neither have I.
- I wonder why.

120
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,910
I'll bet men
ask you out constantly.

121
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,386
Not men like you. I seem
to only meet little boys.

122
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:56,616
Part of that might be that
you spend your day at a preschool.

123
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:59,193
And they think the stupidest
things are funny.

124
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:01,762
Yeah, that's a cultural problem
is what it is, you know.

125
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:04,696
Your average American male
is in a perpetual state of adolescence...

126
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,699
you know,
arrested development.

127
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,701
<i>Hey, that's the name of the show!</i>

128
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:12,864
No attention span. You know,
can't even carry on a typical conver...

129
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:16,273
<i>Michael thought he spotted the man
who'd threatened him earlier.</i>

130
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:18,869
Well, I'm gettin' back
on the space shuttle.

131
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,880
No, no, no. Sorry. Sorry.
Sit, please.

132
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:23,746
Let's talk about you.
Tell me about your family.

133
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:27,379
Well, they're pushy, bossy,
want to control me.

134
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:32,051
What about your family?
I'd love to meet your family.

135
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,650
<i>Michael knew from experience...</i>

136
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:36,356
<i>that this would not turn out well.</i>

137
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:40,230
Once or twice a week,
we get a...

138
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,235
Have a little more.

139
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:45,067
If you like the small, why don't
you come back for the medium?

140
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:50,110
Right? You can see that, right?

141
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,702
I probably should
warn you about my mother.

142
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:55,681
- Hi.
- Let's start behind the fridge.

143
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:58,480
<i>So he came up with
a solution so simple...</i>

144
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,578
<i>he wondered why he'd
never told anyone it before.</i>

145
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,487
I don't have a family.

146
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,356
I can't believe I've never
told anybody that before.

147
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:09,521
That's so sad.

148
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:11,997
Yes, sad. Super sad.
Shall we eat?

149
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:16,704
<i>Michael had started a relationship...</i>

150
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:18,774
<i>by lying about the existence
of his family.</i>

151
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,866
I think this went
really well, huh?

152
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:23,605
- Maybe sometime we can have dinner?
- Could I see your house?

153
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:26,375
<i>Michael was caught
off-guard by the question.</i>

154
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:30,380
No. No. I... I can't do that.

155
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:33,387
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Uh, bye.

156
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,390
<i>And he vowed not to be
caught off-guard again.</i>

157
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:39,052
I didn't mean that we...

158
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,062
So did he invite you over, then?

159
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:43,758
Not yet, but he will.

160
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:46,699
<i>So Michael went back to work.</i>

161
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:49,067
Hey, who brought in the wood...

162
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:55,743
Gob, you can't shred this evidence.
You'll end up in jail.

163
00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:59,747
Dad told me to.
How can I say no to that face?

164
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:03,341
Get this stuff out of here and put it
somewhere where Dad can't get to it.

165
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:05,842
Are you in on this too?

166
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:08,254
No, I'm just here to go out
to lunch with your father.

167
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:11,020
<i>And he said he's never
felt more free in his life.</i>

168
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:15,757
<i>- I'm like a bird up there.
- Did you tell him about my medal?</i>

169
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:18,959
- Medal? What for?
- Oh, who knows what they were saying.

170
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:25,536
- Do you agree? Say thank you.
- Thank you. Wow.

171
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:29,441
- I have so many people to thank.
- Private Asher, step forward!

172
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,809
It's probably because
a seal bit off his hand.

173
00:08:31,914 --> 00:08:35,475
The army has taken to giving
medals for being food.

174
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:38,452
<i>- Just then...
- Look at him go tied to that deck chair!</i>

175
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:41,853
It's so simple.
My ankle monitor...

176
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,290
only goes off when
I go out the front door.

177
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:46,794
We need balloons.
A party!

178
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:49,456
- We need to throw a party for...
- Buster's stupid thing.

179
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,931
Larry, go get some balloons.

180
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:55,095
<i>And Michael found a way
to get Rita to his house after all.</i>

181
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:58,002
That's a great idea.
Honor Buster tomorrow night.

182
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:00,907
We'll get the whole family over to
the penthouse, show him our support.

183
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:04,071
Well, I suppose it's better
than drinking alone. What time?

184
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,343
Doesn't matter to me. I can't be there.
I've got a date with Rita.

185
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,819
Well, Mom's probably right.
I couldn't stand up to a seal.

186
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,821
I don't really deserve
a medal or a party.

187
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:16,858
No, you deserve this.
Here, take my business card.

188
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,723
No, no. It's pronounced "a-nalra-pist."

189
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:21,922
It wasn't really the pronunciation
that bothered me.

190
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:25,489
You see, Buster, it wasn't the seal
that you couldn't stand up to.

191
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:27,694
It was Lucille.

192
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:30,637
Oh, I'm getting chills.

193
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,368
If this was a Lifetime
moment of truth movie...

194
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:35,376
this would be our act break.

195
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:38,606
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

196
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:42,013
<i>And later, Lindsay was
on the phone with Bob Loblaw.</i>

197
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:45,315
I love Tobias, but he's
never fulfilled me sexually.

198
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,389
Can you catalog
for me the various ways...

199
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,390
you'd been promised to be fulfilled...

200
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,653
whether or not said promise
was made explicit?

201
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:53,888
- You want me to be explicit?
- Yes.

202
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:56,294
But I will be needing
to get off in four minutes.

203
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,028
<i>Well, let's see if I can't
hit that target for you.</i>

204
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,627
<i>The next day,
on the way to pick up Rita...</i>

205
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:07,607
<i>Michael stopped by his house to make sure
there were no signs of his family...</i>

206
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,837
<i>only to discover there was nothing but.</i>

207
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:12,881
- What the hell is all this?
- Gob brought all this stuff in.

208
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:15,212
And, Mom, what is with
all the family photos?

209
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:18,378
Oh, I'm teaching Buster
to stand up for himself.

210
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:21,616
- I'm surrogating your mother.
- By wearing her sealskin coat?

211
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:24,887
Michael, I have tried on everything,
and nothing seems to be working.

212
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:28,088
I thought the Donna Karan worked.
You just didn't have the right shoes.

213
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:31,894
Look, I've gotta get rid of any evidence
of my family, including you guys.

214
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,901
Get outta here!

215
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:36,437
<i>See? Now, that's how
you stand up to Mother.</i>

216
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:38,507
<i>Meanwhile, worried about Steve Holt's...</i>

217
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:41,441
<i>sexual expectations,
Maeby tried to cancel her date.</i>

218
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:44,604
My whole family and I now have
to go to my grandma's house...

219
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:46,614
- because my uncle lost his hand.
- Awesome!

220
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,741
So you and I can party
alone at your house.

221
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,445
<i>Maeby was too young
to know what to do.</i>

222
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:55,149
<i>Ironically, in her after-school job
as a movie studio executive...</i>

223
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:58,921
<i>she'd just green-lit two films
that dealt with the very issue.</i>

224
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:01,758
- Rock the house.
- All right.

225
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:04,332
<i>George Michael also
didn't know what to do.</i>

226
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:07,561
<i>If he pointed out that the two
were cousins to drive them apart...</i>

227
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,969
<i>he might be burning the very bridge
that he one day hoped to cross.</i>

228
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:13,541
- I'm doing your cousin tonight.
- So are you.

229
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:16,874
- What?
- She's your cousin too.

230
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:20,506
<i>Back at the penthouse,
party preparations were under way.</i>

231
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:23,983
He's not wearing that to the party.
I've got the exact same thing.

232
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,486
No, he was just "analraping" me.
Then Michael barged in...

233
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:29,285
and kicked us out so he
could shred all the evidence.

234
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:31,872
- Shred the evidence?
- I thought he didn't want us to do that.

235
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:35,386
He didn't want us to get into trouble.
He's taking the heat.

236
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:39,127
He's doing that for us?
And on the night of his date with Rita.

237
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:41,863
Who he didn't want to bring over here.
Probably because...

238
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:45,031
let's face it... you people haven't been
great with the others.

239
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:47,905
Well, in our defense, Mom,
we're not exactly dog people.

240
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,070
- We've got to start being nicer.
- I'm starting right now.

241
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,512
- Buster, the party's not for you anymore.
- Oh, okay.

242
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:56,483
It's a "welcome Rita" party.

243
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:58,986
I know where she works.
We can pick her up and surprise her.

244
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:02,717
You're so right.
This is better than a party for me.

245
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:05,589
Oh, come on. Grow a pair.

246
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,626
You know, we need some weather balloons for
this party, and maybe a tank of hydrogen.

247
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:14,601
You know, really float those suckers.

248
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:16,672
<i>Meanwhile, Michael was
hiding the evidence...</i>

249
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:19,502
<i>wherever he could
when he heard from his brother.</i>

250
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:22,976
<i>Hey, friend. Gob here.
We really want you at the party.</i>

251
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:27,106
<i>We're really nice now.
And, God, we love you.</i>

252
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:29,707
Damn it.

253
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:32,344
<i>And the family picked up
Rita in the only vehicle...</i>

254
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,775
<i>- big enough to hold them all.
- Hey, hey. Excuse me. Rita?</i>

255
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:38,452
- I'm Rita.
- We're here to pick you up for Michael.

256
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:40,688
Uh, you can just go in the cabin.

257
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:48,268
- Michael?
- Oh, he's not here.

258
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:51,738
- We're his family.
- Oh, his family.

259
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:54,935
- We're nice.
- I'm sorry. I have to leave.

260
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:57,376
Oh, no, you cannot leave.
Drive, Lindsay!

261
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,449
- Bye!
- We're doing this for Michael.

262
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,779
- Stop her, Buster.
- What am I supposed to do?

263
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:06,048
- Stop her! - Stop yelling at me!
- I'm leaving!

264
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:08,589
<i>And that's when Buster
noticed the seal on Rita's backpack.</i>

265
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:19,295
<i>Hey, talk about cathartic.
Now, that's an act break.</i>

266
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:25,074
<i>Buster had overcome his fear of seals.</i>

267
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:28,771
<i>Unfortunately, he'd done so by
knocking out Michael's new girlfriend.</i>

268
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,348
- What the hell did you do?
- You curious, Mom?

269
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:34,247
- I can show you.
- Uh, you made a mistake.

270
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:37,150
You're human.
Except for the hand.

271
00:13:37,255 --> 00:13:40,622
It's okay. She's alive.
And soft. Soft and alive.

272
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:44,024
All right, let's not add that
to the charges. What'll we do?

273
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:46,653
She's gonna tell Michael.
And he won't hear the good stuff.

274
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,925
He'll just hear about the beating.

275
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:52,264
Wait. Maybe we can give her
a "forget-me-now." Here you go, hot dog.

276
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,838
- Take the pill.
- What's a forget-me-now?

277
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,373
They're pills that create
a sort of temporary "forgettiness."

278
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:59,130
If somebody finds out
how you do a trick, you

279
00:13:59,143 --> 00:14:00,808
give them one, and they
forget the whole thing.

280
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,015
Oh.

281
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:03,142
It's a mainstay of the
magician's tool kit.

282
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,613
Like how clowns always have
a rag soaked in ether.

283
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:08,618
Gob, this is flunitrazepam.
It's a roofie.

284
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,211
- Those are illegal!
- Shut up, Mom.

285
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:13,381
Don't make me give you
another one of these.

286
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:17,961
Lindsay, help me! Three!

287
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:24,033
<i>Back at the house,
Michael finished his work...</i>

288
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:26,069
<i>and, now late,
rushed to pick up Rita.</i>

289
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,630
<i>Moments later, Maeby prepared to tell
Steve she wasn't ready for romance.</i>

290
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:33,176
Well, this sends a mixed message.

291
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:36,041
<i>Just as Steve showed up
to call things off with his cousin.</i>

292
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:38,809
- You did all this for me?
- Yes.

293
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,249
Well, I'm gonna go get sexy.

294
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:47,516
<i>And Michael missed Rita.</i>

295
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:52,858
Damn it. Strike two.

296
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:56,593
Take it down. We don't want
anything that says Rita.

297
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:59,602
<i>Hi. It's Michael.
I will be coming to the party...</i>

298
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:02,696
<i>because I love you too.</i>

299
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:05,332
Okay. We need a new banner.

300
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:08,139
<i>And that's when Michael found Rita.</i>

301
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:10,146
Rita.

302
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:12,773
- Why am I on a bus bench, Michael?
- I get it.

303
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:16,877
I'm sorry. But the rest of the night's
gonna be all about you, I promise.

304
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:18,888
Great. Great.

305
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,185
I am gonna have to make one quick stop,
maybe you'd just wait in the car.

306
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,783
It's just gonna be
two seconds, I promise.

307
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:26,728
<i>And so Michael raced up to pay
his quick respects to Buster.</i>

308
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:29,527
Ah, there he is...
my favorite son.

309
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:31,932
- Everybody's favorite son!
- Mr. Wonderful!

310
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:35,369
Well, I had a great time.
I wish I could've stayed longer.

311
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:38,533
This is a great party, huh?
Tell Buster I stopped by, please.

312
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:40,634
- I do have to leave.
- Oh, no, no, no.

313
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:43,805
The party is not for Buster anymore.

314
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:45,815
- No, Michael. It's for you.
- Me.

315
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:48,715
Take a look at banner, Michael!

316
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,586
You guys did all of this for me?
"Family love"...

317
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,750
<i>- Michael?
- Everyone froze.</i>

318
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,387
<i>Michael feared he'd been caught
in a lie about his family.</i>

319
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:01,556
<i>His family feared
they'd been caught...</i>

320
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,466
<i>by a woman they clubbed,
drugged and left on a bench.</i>

321
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,470
<i>It was awkward.</i>

322
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:10,370
- Who's this?
- Mother! Mother!

323
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:13,535
This is from the army.
I have to report for duty tomorrow!

324
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:15,908
It says by accepting this
medal, I was reenlisting.

325
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:17,913
I didn't hear them say that.

326
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:20,540
<i>Perhaps if the sergeant had
spoken more slowly, she would have.</i>

327
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:23,381
In acceptance of this medal, you proudly
waive all rights to private citizenship...

328
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:26,013
and hereby reenlist in the armed services
of the United States.

329
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:28,023
If you agree with this,
say thank you.

330
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,491
Thank you.

331
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:33,758
What am I gonna do?
I can't go back there. I've never been!

332
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:36,993
- Who are these people?
- This is my family.

333
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:39,535
No. No.
I don't like these people.

334
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:42,606
Me. You mean... She means me.
Because I lied...

335
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:46,609
about having a family, because
I was embarrassed by them.

336
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,611
And I'm ashamed of that.

337
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:50,613
I have to leave.

338
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:55,382
Strike three.

339
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:58,614
You said you didn't have a family?

340
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:01,954
- Everybody's favorite son.
- Mr. Terrible.

341
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,395
And her?
Too good for us? Huh.

342
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,692
Buster, you should've
finished the job.

343
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,064
- Job? What job?
- Did I say job? I meant Gob.

344
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:15,502
Buster's the one that hit her.
I just gave her the roofie.

345
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:17,369
- Roofie?
- Forget-me-now.

346
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:19,375
You beat and drugged Rita?

347
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,872
- Take this and love us again.
- No, no, no!

348
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:26,040
- Just take it!
- No, Gob!

349
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,414
Um, I'm leaving too.

350
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:34,148
Well, no good deed
goes unpunished.

351
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:36,226
Oh, look, it's not all bad.

352
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:40,058
I got Buster feeling
better about his... medal.

353
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:43,224
Not anymore.
I'm getting rid of this thing.

354
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:46,599
It has caused me nothing
but pride and self-respect!

355
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:48,831
<i>Buster went to get rid of the medal...</i>

356
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,874
<i>he finally felt he deserved...</i>

357
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:53,910
<i>but it was exactly when George Sr.
Was making his escape.</i>

358
00:17:54,011 --> 00:17:56,172
Farewell to you all!

359
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:02,677
<i>But it turns out that hydrogen
is more explosive than helium.</i>

360
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:15,526
<i>And George Michael came home
to find an unconscious Steve Holt.</i>

361
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:18,534
- What have you guys been doing?
- I gave him a roofie.

362
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:20,570
A girl's gotta grow up sometime.

363
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:23,037
- He's your cousin!
- My cousin?

364
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,474
I should have told you that. Now you've
drugged him and had your way with him.

365
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:29,432
How is that even possible?

366
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:31,309
No, George Michael.
We didn't do anything.

367
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:33,906
I just wanted him to think
we did. Don't you see?

368
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,646
<i>I drugged him not to go
all the way with him.</i>

369
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:40,315
Well, I think even the antidrug people
are gonna be okay with that.

370
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:43,825
- Well, let's get his pants back on.
- You took his pants off?

371
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:46,226
<i>And Michael tried to salvage...</i>

372
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,662
<i>the remains of the files
from the car fire.</i>

373
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:51,360
- You call the attorney?
- Yeah, but he's not taking our calls...

374
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:53,562
because apparently
the retainer is all used up.

375
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:56,333
He took my call.
He's very good.

376
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,499
Yeah, that's how the retainer
got eaten up, okay?

377
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:00,649
The secretary took it all
down here on a transcript.

378
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:03,078
Ugh. She's very good too.

379
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,013
<i>- I'm not paying for this.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?</i>

380
00:19:06,117 --> 00:19:08,290
I don't know, Lindsay.
Thing you say on page

381
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:10,486
seven looks like it could
be worth some money.

382
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:15,856
- Speaking to me yet?
- It's only been an hour.

383
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,047
Here's what I don't understand.
What were you

384
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,158
guys doing with Rita
in the first place?

385
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:22,858
We just wanted to do
something nice for you, Michael...

386
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,367
'cause you do so much for us.

387
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:27,369
I guess we screwed it up.

388
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:30,372
No, I screwed it up, 'cause
I was trying to impress her.

389
00:19:30,474 --> 00:19:32,840
Let's face it.
She's probably too good for me.

390
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:36,276
No. What you need to do
is go to her and ask for another chance.

391
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,110
She'd be lucky
to have you, Michael.

392
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:44,216
Thanks, Gob.
Sometimes you do surprise me.

393
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,789
I've got one more surprise for you.

394
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:51,185
<i>It ain't easy being wh...</i>

395
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:53,786
<i>And Michael did try again with Rita...</i>

396
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:56,526
<i>but this time determined
to keep no secrets.</i>

397
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:59,728
I wanna tell you everything,
if... if you're willing to listen.

398
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm a very good listener.

399
00:20:03,107 --> 00:20:06,474
Great. We'll start
with the misdemeanors...

400
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:09,978
and then we're gonna push
right on through to the lighter treasons.

401
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:12,276
So, 1983...

402
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:15,147
<i>For British eyes only...</i>

403
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:20,322
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

404
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:23,325
<i>Lindsay tries to work off
her debt with Bob Loblaw.</i>

405
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:25,486
I'm willing to debase myself.

406
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:29,225
Get a maid's uniform
and come by my house around 7:00.

407
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,664
No way to misinterpret that.

408
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:32,668
<i>Except the one.</i>

409
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:39,675
<i>And a traumatized Steve Holt
needs a father.</i>

410
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:42,678
I've made a huge mistake.

411
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:48,113
I know the feeling.
I had you.

412
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:51,514
I'm your father, Steve Holt.

413
00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:53,715
I can't hide from it anymore.

414
00:20:53,824 --> 00:20:57,225
I won't forget this, Dad.

415
00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:07,366
I will.

416
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,608
I will.
