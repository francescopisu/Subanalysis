1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,260
<i>Now the story
of a wealthy family</i>

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,470
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,140
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,850
<i>It's...</i>

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,150
<i>Michael Bluth was visiting
the family business,</i>

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,610
<i>hoping to find Lucille Austero,</i>

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,740
<i>who was now a majority stakeholder,</i>

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,320
<i>to thank the woman...</i>

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,290
- They closed the company.
<i>- ...for forgiving his debt.</i>

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,330
- Don't mind me, I work downstairs.
- Hi.

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,040
Doing a little lunch looting.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,080
- You?
- It was my family's company.

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,130
I'm Michael Bluth.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,840
Hey.
You guys put me in my first house.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,260
Oh, yeah,
a lot of people's first house was a Bluth.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,140
No, no, I was part of that
Cornballer class action suit.

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,300
- I see.
- Yeah,

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,220
I made enough to put a down payment
on a Sitwell.

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,930
Well, we've put a lot of people
in Sitwells, too.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,860
Uh... oh, God, well, you caught us.

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,400
Didn't think anybody would be getting on
while we were getting off.

22
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,200
What did you do to the Bluth Company?

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,950
You've been president two weeks.

24
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,200
- Took us to the next level.
- An iPhone 5 charger!

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,330
Fourth floor.

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,120
<i>Even the landlord was surprised
by the move.</i>

27
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,410
Not only would you have to pay

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,670
a penalty to get out of your old lease,
but the rent is double.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,800
Just to see the roof of a Rite Aid?

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,050
<i>Which was the first that G.O.B.
had heard of the view.</i>

31
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,930
I'll take it.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,220
Okay, okay. Okay.

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,300
Ding.

34
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,640
So?

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,060
What do you think?

36
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,350
It used to be a 2 Hour Teeth,
the whole place.

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,230
Yeah, I remember the screams.

38
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,730
I guess it was the 90 Minute Tooth guys
across the street

39
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,940
that put the 2 Hour guys out of business.

40
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,190
I did see that the old Blockbuster
is becoming

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,780
an "Hour Mouth," so those guys
gotta be shitting themselves.

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,200
Why did you move the business?
This is exactly the same.

43
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,540
Says the guy who hasn't seen
the roof of the Rite Aid yet.

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,500
Where's the nitrous?

45
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,040
This will not be used
as the conference room?

46
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,840
Uh, no. I had to kind of...
I had to move it,

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,000
just, uh, for a couple reasons, actually.

48
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,050
A, I wanted a bigger office.
- That feels likeÂ the heart of it. - Yeah, it is,

49
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,010
- but, uh... Hey.
- Sure.

50
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,310
Check out that view.

51
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,980
Boy, what's a bike tire doing on the roof of the Rite
Aid? Yeah, that's the $14,000 a month question, isn't it?

52
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,480
When they said you were the president
of the Bluth Company,

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,150
I assumed it was in name only.

54
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,730
That they hired you to actually work
seems wrong.

55
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,780
Do you even know what a mortgage is?

56
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,950
No, he doesn't. He doesn't know anything.

57
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,320
You do, though.

58
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,410
You're the smart Bluth,
I can see it in your eyes.

59
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,000
You read, don't you?

60
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,040
Adhir is a holdover
from the Austero Company.

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,670
He's our compliant officer.

62
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,630
Or as I like to call him, Chief Worrywart.

63
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,840
It's "compliance officer."

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,260
Uh, hey, uh, so you worked
for the Austero Company?

65
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,010
Uh, they forgave a big debt of mine.

66
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,470
How would I get ahold
of Lucille Austero?

67
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,350
- No one knows, I'm afraid.
- Okay.

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,270
That's it,
go to your office, Adhir.

69
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,070
He's the chief compliant officer,
so he has to do whatever I comply.

70
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,070
I'm assuming that's

71
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,490
where the conference table went.

72
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,280
It's probably too big
for that room,

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,200
and I would get it out,
but I can't quite remember

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,740
how I got it in there.

75
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,000
Like you, I'm about to go underwater,
but before I go,

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,500
I'd like to give you some advice:
you're not good at this.

77
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,920
Yeah. I know. But it's important to Dad.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,590
Want to know the thanks I'm getting?

79
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,960
Dad is giving a trophy to Lindsay, not me,

80
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,510
for the family of the year
ceremony tonight.

81
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,720
Hm. Great, well,

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,140
Dad didn't get a trophy for doing
what you're doing, and he actually did it.

83
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,930
Well, that's not the worst way
to make Dad love me.

84
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,400
I will get a trophy
for Dad, for... something.

85
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,980
- Mm.
- Figure that out later.

86
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,070
Dad's never gonna give you
what you're looking for.

87
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,190
And, uh,
maybe that's how it should be.

88
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,650
Maybe when sons grow up,
they're not supposed to be too close

89
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,860
to their fathers.

90
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,660
And maybe the best thing
a father can do for his son

91
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,290
is disappear for a while
and let him figure out

92
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,040
what kind of man
he wants to be on his own.

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,710
At least, that's what I've tried to do.

94
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,880
Then why did you move
into your son's dorm room?

95
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,590
That was a year, okay?

96
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,590
And not even a full year,
because I got there at Thanksgiving.

97
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,260
Okay, well, goodbye forever, G.O.B.

98
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll be seeing you tonight.

99
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,100
<i>Michael returned to the model home
to get his scuba equipment.</i>

100
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,270
<i>But before he left town,
he thought he'd take</i>

101
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,610
<i>one last look
at his son's childhood bedroom.</i>

102
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,190
Uh... George Michael?

103
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,240
Father.
It's me, George Michael.

104
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Think fast.

105
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,240
Tobias.

106
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,870
Michael.
Yes, well, this is embarrassing.

107
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,710
Not only are you finding me
in your son's pants,

108
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,960
but you're also finding out
how the sausage is made.

109
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,840
I don't understand a thing you said.

110
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,300
Well, I was doing some character work
for, um,

111
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,510
uh...

112
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,430
I'm doing a little character work
to prepare

113
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,220
for the awards ceremony...

114
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,270
How did...

115
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,600
Why do they only have one...?

116
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,150
Yes... oh! Uhp!

117
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,650
- Okay, back...
- You all right?

118
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,190
Oh! Um...

119
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,440
There you go.

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,070
- Just an acting exercise.
- Sure.

121
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,740
You're supposed to be George Michael now?

122
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,490
Oh, well, it's a character role,
really, and let's face it.

123
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,910
No one was buying me as a straight man.

124
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,540
It was a little off-brand.

125
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,330
I'm just trying to find

126
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,000
my place in the Bluth family...

127
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,040
...now that, uh...

128
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,050
Lucille's almost done with me
as her therapist

129
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,470
and Lindsay has...
what does Gwyneth Paltrow say?

130
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,050
"Consciously un-cuckold" me.

131
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,890
You want to stay a part
of the Bluth family?

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,680
I have a feeling...

133
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,100
you do, too.

134
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,390
Despite your claims of leaving.

135
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,690
No, no, it's not a claim. I'm leaving.

136
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,020
You always seem to be.

137
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,270
Well, I'm doing it.

138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,070
I'm gonna map the ocean floor.

139
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,400
Michael, if I could...

140
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,110
put my therapist leggings on
for one second.

141
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,240
- Just sit, sit, sit, sit, sit,
- Yeah, sure.

142
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,030
- sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
- Tobias, please.

143
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,830
I would just say that

144
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,750
you're trying to run away from people
before they have a chance

145
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,830
to run away from you,
because that's what the people

146
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,330
you love do.

147
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,340
Isn't it?

148
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,300
What people? Your wife.

149
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
- Uh...
- Your son.

150
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,670
Or should I say...

151
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,640
...me?

152
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,300
Don't. Uh, you know...

153
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,390
- "Why'd Mommy leave, Daddy?"
- Tobias...

154
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,940
"I didn't leave.
I loved you bo..."

155
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,600
I don't think you want to go there, okay?

156
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,020
Yes, yes, yes. I suppose I did...

157
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,070
start too high.

158
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,150
Okay, let's bring everyone down an octave.

159
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,780
- "Why did Mommy leave, Daddy?"
- Tobias...

160
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,820
- "I didn't leave. I loved you both."
- Listen.

161
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,860
Tobias, listen,
I don't want you playing my son.

162
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,030
And I'm not confused at all
about what happened to Tracey.

163
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,330
Really?
Because you certainly never talk about it.

164
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,330
I was raising a son.
Think I want to burden him

165
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,290
with memories
that are gonna make him feel worse?

166
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,050
Please. What about Michael's memories?

167
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,550
Why can't you go back to the last place
you saw Tracey? Hmm?

168
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,180
- The family beach cottage?
- No, no,

169
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,140
I was thinking more, uh, uh,

170
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,720
- metaphorically.
- Yeah.

171
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,930
But that's where we spent
the last months of her life.

172
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,940
And-and after she died,

173
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,400
the family sold that house.

174
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,310
It was one of the kindest things

175
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,280
that-that they ever did for me.

176
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,150
- Do you think that I should go there?
- Uh,

177
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,450
my number one rule is
"don't tell Michael...

178
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,870
what to do."
Now, um, I will say, though,

179
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,830
I wish I had known
you'd had such depth

180
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,830
before I gave your part away
to a less experienced actor.

181
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,290
I didn't know there was such a thing.

182
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,210
Get your stuff. We're out of here.

183
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,130
And where are we going, Father?

184
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,920
Nowhere.
I was just practicing the new skit.

185
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,760
Remember the lineÂ where he says,

186
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,760
- "Get your stuff"?
- I'm improv'ing,

187
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,260
you over-intending schmactor.

188
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,220
This is the simplest character
in the entire family.

189
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,180
He has one personality trait:

190
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,810
he always comes back.

191
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,020
Well, that and he always has his hands
in his pockets.

192
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,150
You got peanuts in there?

193
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,440
Okay, why am I staying here for this?

194
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,480
Why can't I just be your son?

195
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,570
Oh, there is no son anymore.
He cut the part.

196
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,360
And I can't be your father.
I'm not a straight man.

197
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,280
<i>Why are </i>we <i>staying here for this?
Anyway, Michael,</i>

198
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,910
<i>in his haste to leave town,
arrived at the dock</i>

199
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,750
<i>for his ocean floor mapping expedition</i>

200
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,830
<i>for what he was certain
was a six-bells departure.</i>

201
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,710
No, we leave at 6:00 p.m.

202
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,210
You telling me we've got a 14-bell delay?

203
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,250
I don't know, man.
But we leave in seven hours.

204
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,760
Yeah. Okay.

205
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,590
<i>And he was encouraged
to use the time</i>

206
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,430
<i>to try out his undersea
camera survey equipment.</i>

207
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,680
All right, let's have it.
Great. Look at that, huh?

208
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,970
<i>And once in the water,
Michael felt like he was</i>

209
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,190
<i>finally able to let go of the past
and forget about</i>

210
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,310
<i>everything he was leaving behind.</i>

211
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,860
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
felt no such peace.</i>

212
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,910
<i>Although he was surprised
that his evasive run-in with his father...</i>

213
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,990
There's enough of these
for this to be a thing?

214
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
<i>...was less dramatic</i>

215
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,200
<i>than he recalled.</i>

216
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,660
<i>And he sought out Maeby
at what she'd said was her new place.</i>

217
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,870
- Hello.
- Looking for a grandparent?

218
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,420
No, thank you. I...
No, I have enough. I'm, uh...

219
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,210
I think I might be at the wrong address.

220
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
I'm looking for someone
who I cannot imagine meets

221
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,880
- your residency requirements here.
- Rose, he's fine.

222
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,340
It's all right. He's with me.

223
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,300
This is
where you're living, a senior center?

224
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,890
Yeah, just wait.
Hey, Rose, do you mind?

225
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,720
Thank you. I needed somewhere
to lay low

226
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,230
until the Perfecto thing blew over.

227
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,150
But you said
this place was incredible.

228
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,690
- This is incredible!
- Right?

229
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,190
Why is the lobby
so off-putting?

230
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,860
That's what the seniors do
to keep the young people away.

231
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,990
They don't want "dot-commers" taking over.

232
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,200
- Nice. Like you and me.
- Exactly.

233
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,950
How were you able to get in?

234
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,700
When I came back from Mexico,

235
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,250
I found a parking pass
in Lucille 2's Cadillac, right?

236
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,920
And, apparently,
she kept a place for these "trysts"

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,880
with old lovers from years ago.

238
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,880
Or they were co-owners or something.

239
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,760
But they just kept it here, empty,

240
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,470
until one of them needed it.

241
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,090
So that was lucky.

242
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,350
I just had to make myself
look older, you know?

243
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,430
Yeah, I would think that that'd
be a great use of the gray wig.

244
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,060
No, I went down that road.

245
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,850
<i>But wasn't expecting
how upsetting it is</i>

246
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,400
<i>to see one's self grown old.</i>

247
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,770
<i>The moment
when a young woman realizes...</i>

248
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,900
Oh, my God,
I've become my father.

249
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,940
âª <i>In the most delicious way! </i>âª

250
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,450
Oh, so this is a choice.

251
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,780
I didn't want to say anything,

252
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,370
but I was like, "Maeby looks
like a 65-year-old."

253
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,200
- What if I told you I was 75? Hmm?
- Holy shit.

254
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,660
- You look fantastic.
- Right?

255
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,330
It's the teeth. It's the same guy
who's doing my meth teeth,

256
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,290
you know,
for the family of the year thing.

257
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,380
Where I write a speech for my mom,
she talks about how great I am, then...

258
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,050
Then you open your mouth
and you're like,

259
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,220
"So why do I have to turn tricks
for meth money?"

260
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,470
I don't know how you keep
all your scams straight.

261
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,560
Well, this old lady one is a big,
big score.

262
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,230
I mean, when people catch on,
they either forget or they die.

263
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,940
And, I mean,
this place is a dream.

264
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,440
Nobody even locks their doors.

265
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,980
Of course,
what is there to steal?

266
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,150
A few barstools and some family pictures?

267
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,160
Anyway, that's how I got those barstools
and all these great pictures of grandkids.

268
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,910
- What a beautiful family you've stolen.
- Mm.

269
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,910
What are you gonna do if Lucille 2
or the friend she owns this with shows up?

270
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,660
He kind of already has.

271
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,710
<i>Maeby had only been
in the place for a week</i>

272
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,630
<i>and had spent most of that time
trying to trap a swan in her condo...</i>

273
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,010
What's your problem? It's tuna.

274
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,760
<i>...when she came across a stranger,</i>

275
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,090
<i>whom longtime viewers
will be mildly surprised</i>

276
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,850
<i>- to recognize is Stan Sitwell.</i>
- Hello.

277
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,600
- <i>But whom Maeby did not.</i>
- Hello.

278
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,020
Do you live in one of these?

279
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,270
- This one's mine, yes.
- Well, that's strange.

280
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,980
Do you realize this condo
is listed as Lucille Austero's?

281
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,810
Yes. I am her.

282
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Sister.

283
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,280
I am her sister.

284
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,610
You're going the wrong way.

285
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,950
Annette?

286
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,740
Great idea. Do you think they have one?

287
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,740
Have what?

288
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,450
Annette. Yes, that's me.

289
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,750
And you are?

290
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,000
Stan. I must admit,
I'm a little confused right now.

291
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,710
Our agreement was that this place
would revert back to me once Lucille...

292
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,430
...gave up her interest.

293
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,350
Well, I don't know anything about that.

294
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,310
She signed it over to me.

295
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,390
I'd like to see that paperwork.

296
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,600
Yes.

297
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,650
Well, I recently moved here
from New Orleans,

298
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,190
- and I...
- <i>Maeby was proud of this lie.</i>

299
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,700
...lost all my personal paperwork
in Hurricane Cantina.

300
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,620
Ooh. That's complicated.

301
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,080
Yes. It is.

302
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,370
Unless I'm expected to lose a home
for the second time.

303
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,000
Of course, I could just pack up
my shorty shorts,

304
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,710
my silky pajamas, my peekaboo bras,

305
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,590
my ticklers, sex knobs, and lacy hoo-has

306
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,050
and hit the road.

307
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,430
I can't ask you to do that.

308
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,850
<i>This place is yours?</i>

309
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,260
Not yet, but maybe I'll kick him out
sooner than later.

310
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,430
Maybe I'll kick him out
once he gets off that goddamn chair.

311
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,390
That's him?

312
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,270
- Yeah.
- Why aren't we whispering?

313
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,730
Oh. He can't hear a thing.

314
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,110
- He's got horrible aids.
- Â <i>Shoedini!</i>

315
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,110
<i>The world's first shoe horn...</i>

316
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,110
Oh, hearing aids.

317
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,070
Yeah, yeah, here they call them aids.

318
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,280
The other ones they call
aids.

319
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,620
Don't worry, if he asks who you are,
I'll just tell him you're Tom Collins.

320
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,750
He's always asking for a Tom Collins.

321
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,870
Believe me, I'm in over my head enough
as it is being George Maharis.

322
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,460
Which is what I wanted to talk
to you about.

323
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,170
So I told my Dad
that I was still dating Rebel.

324
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,920
What? Why'd you do that?

325
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,630
You told me to do it. It was your idea.

326
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,590
- Mm-mm.
- I mean, I still haven't even seen her

327
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,180
- since I punched him.
- No, no, no.

328
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,600
I told you that your dad
is still in love with Rebel.

329
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,600
And that telling him you haven't seen her
would be more hurtful.

330
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,310
You perverted that into a way to not hurt him. And then
I had to turn down this scuba trip, which is also rude,

331
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,780
and if he finds out he's gonna say,

332
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,240
"You lied to me, George Michael,
and that's worse."

333
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,240
You know he's gonna say
"and that's worse."

334
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,280
You would've had to lie about scuba,
'cause you would've been scared.

335
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,410
Why do you say I'm scared of scuba?
I'm not.

336
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,580
You passed out at the aquarium.

337
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,670
They make you feel like you're underwater
with all these giant...

338
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,750
- Dolphins?
- I think that was some kind of smiling,

339
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,880
kind of bemused baby shark.

340
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,670
I don't know, things are volatile

341
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
with my dad right now.
It feels very combustible.

342
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,850
Feels like we're on the edge of
physical menace or something,

343
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,470
which I've trained myself for,
but has he been training, too?

344
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,810
What was that in the hallway?

345
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,850
Look. Here's my advice. Okay?

346
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,140
You go to Rebel's,

347
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,650
you take my bag of lacy ticklers,
hoo-ha bras, dog toys,

348
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,900
and sex knobs with you.

349
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,110
And you act like you're expecting
a booty call,

350
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,150
as the old people think
the young people say.

351
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,070
All right?
You tell her, "I'm here for a quickie,

352
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,200
and I'm out of here."

353
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,620
Mr. Brash.
And she'll drop you like a buttered cane.

354
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,790
- Something old people say?
- Yeah. I'm trying to get it going.

355
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,830
- That's cool.
- <i>George Michael's father</i>

356
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,080
<i>had drifted farther south
than he realized,</i>

357
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,710
<i>despite swimming with a GPS system</i>

358
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,970
<i>that cost roughly as much
as Buster's left thumb.</i>

359
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,630
<i>And he soon found himself</i>

360
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,470
<i>on a part of the beach he hadn't been to
in over 20 years.</i>

361
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,230
âª <i>I'm coming home </i>âª

362
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,310
âª <i>Home, homeÂ </i>âª

363
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,770
I love that house.

364
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,860
Yeah. My family used to own it
back in the '80s.

365
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,030
Too bad they sold it,
it's worth a fortune now.

366
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,280
My wife died there.

367
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,660
Ovarian cancer, actually.

368
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,280
- He's a liar.
- And...

369
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,950
He shouldn't have said that.

370
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,950
- Ignore the man.
- Good to see you.

371
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,960
<i>And Michael decided that
perhaps Tobias was right.</i>

372
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,300
<i>Perhaps he did need to look the grim truth</i>

373
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,340
<i>of mortality... in the face.</i>

374
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,350
Oh shit, he found out.

375
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,940
<i>Michael had just discovered</i>

376
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,310
<i>his family never sold
their family cottage.</i>...lied to me, and that's worse.

377
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,690
I am stunned. I just...
I literally said it would be so great

378
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,740
if my family had kept the cottage.

379
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
We did.

380
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,740
I know. You shouldn't have.

381
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,410
Well, then either way, you're unhappy.

382
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,160
I mean, pick a lane.

383
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,620
You pick... you pick a lane.

384
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,250
What did you want us to do, Michael?

385
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,790
It was a horrible time
for the housing market.

386
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,840
Were we supposed to lose
our precious daughter-in-law

387
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,130
and a couple hundred grand
in the same year?

388
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,090
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- Because we love you.

389
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,260
- And nobody wanted your feelings hurt.
- Mm.

390
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,220
- That was rule one.
- Rule one?

391
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,100
It slipped down a little
when we put in the new floors.

392
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,440
And by that point, you were already dating

393
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,020
and in love with that total re...

394
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,820
that totally lovely Rita.

395
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,740
Uh, she was a smart cookie, that one.

396
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,990
Nice try, Mom.

397
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,280
And we didn't want to bring up
those bad old memories.

398
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,280
Besides, this place already
has enough bad ones for me.

399
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,330
My mother died here.

400
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,790
G.O.B. was born here.

401
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,830
And I'm sure you've heard,

402
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,880
it was also your father's pad.

403
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,710
Only from the next room.

404
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,590
Please believe me,
if I could turn back time,

405
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,590
- I never would've answered that door.
- I know.

406
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,550
Were you slightly worried

407
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,260
that I might come out here one day, Mom?

408
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,520
H-Honestly, I never thought
you'd get past the guard gate.

409
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,060
I could barely get past them
when Tobias and I got here.

410
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,400
Tobias.
He's the one that put coming out here

411
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,980
- in my mind in the first place.
- He what?

412
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,690
- As a metaphor.
- You're out!

413
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,650
But I've already pinked away my sideburns

414
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,780
to play Buster at the family of the year
ceremony tonight.

415
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,530
And Buster's already invited a date.

416
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,910
Come out
and meet your boyfriend, Lucille.

417
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,000
Murph?

418
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, I see you finally figured out
how to use that contraption.

419
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,090
I'm on the phone.

420
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,420
- Just one second.
- What? I'm talking on the phone.

421
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,260
Who are you talking to?

422
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,850
Didn't you tell me I was supposed
to be busting with my girlfriend?

423
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,310
I said, you're Buster's girlfriend.

424
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,890
Oh. Hang on.

425
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,850
Wait. Wait.

426
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,980
- Am I supposed... Am I your boyfriend?
- No!

427
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,860
You are... I'm... A girl.

428
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,400
You're a girl, Linds,
uh, Murphy B... Lucille.

429
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,780
- Is he supposed to be me?
- Uh-uh-uh, Lucille Number 2.

430
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,870
She's quite the grande dame.

431
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,450
It's basically Michael
without the peanut pockets.

432
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,000
You know,
you're playing her like you played

433
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,210
that stammering mess of a Buster,
and it won't do.

434
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,000
Sometimes I don't even think
that you want to be an actor.

435
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,300
Actually, sometimes,
I think I want to be a dog doctor. Ow!

436
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,550
This is the role of a lifetime.

437
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,930
Now, I know 50 gentlemen

438
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,470
who would tuck their last nut
to play this part.

439
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,180
Okay?
Now, he saves it for the day.

440
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,730
When you see him at the campaign event,
you'll think you're looking at

441
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,980
a 72-year-old pink mustachioed
Lucille Austero.

442
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,690
- We can't have Lucille Austero!
- We can't have Lucille Austero.

443
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,530
She's running against Lindsay,
for God's sake.

444
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,530
For God's sake.

445
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,700
I don't even know why I'm having
this conversation.

446
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,120
You're out!
We don't even need a Buster.

447
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,660
Well, at least you're being honest
about that.

448
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,450
So you admit you've got Buster.

449
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,750
This again?
Why would I hide Buster from you?

450
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,580
You want me to think that he's missing.

451
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,630
You're trying to teach me a lesson.
You're tryingÂ to get even

452
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,130
because I'm trying to teach...

453
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,590
I don't know why you're trying

454
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,880
to teach me a lesson,
so lesson not learned, Mother.

455
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,640
Michael, did you do something

456
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,140
for which we should be
teaching you a lesson?

457
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,640
Mother!

458
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,100
He's here, isn't he?

459
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,650
Tell me he's not in that bedroom,

460
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,270
- not where Tracey...
- Don't go in there.

461
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,400
...spent her last...

462
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,900
Oh, someone told Michael.

463
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,410
Does this mean we can start leaving towels
on the floor?

464
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,700
What are you doing?

465
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,240
I'm making this into a trophy for Dad.

466
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,040
I can't wait to see
the one you got yourself.

467
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,910
Uh, yeah, Michael. Please.

468
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,630
I'm the president or CEO
or whatever of the Bluth Company.

469
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,960
I control the company checkbook,
so I don't need

470
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,800
false things to make me feel important.

471
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,970
- Okay.
- There's no trophy for that.

472
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,470
<i>Although he did visit</i>

473
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,470
<i>- a trophy store earlier that day.</i>
- It's a good time to be in this business.

474
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,810
Everyone gets a trophy.

475
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,730
I tell people to stay away
from the business.

476
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,230
It's always been a lousy business,
and these days

477
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,150
- everybody shops online.
- Everybody gets a trophy.

478
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,360
A trophy, huh? Yeah.

479
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,780
Well, that may be, but tell me this,

480
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,280
how many people get a whole
trophy store?

481
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,240
Oh, yeah.

482
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,950
You can't be serious.

483
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,000
So the guy was like,
"Are you shitting me?"

484
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,830
That's usually the sign
that you've made yourself a great deal.

485
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,090
So, I told him, "I'm gonna need you
to cobble together one last trophy,

486
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,250
old trophy cobbler,

487
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,590
for the family of the year
ceremony tonight."

488
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,970
And I said, "I want you to find
the biggest golden anchor you can find."

489
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,470
So they didn't have one of those?

490
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,430
No, he didn't even have keys
to the back room. Also, the heat doesn't turn off.

491
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,640
This took a couple hours,
so once I give this to Dad,

492
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,900
then I'll have Joni Beard
give me the deed to the trophy store.

493
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,070
Wait till you see it!

494
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,400
I'm not gonna be there. Oh, uh...

495
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,160
let me ask you a question,
and I want you to be honest with me.

496
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,030
Are you doing something with Busty?

497
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,120
<i>Michael was referring
to his missing brother, Buster.</i>

498
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,040
<i>But G.O.B., who hadn't been with a woman
since he'd gotten closer to this man...</i>

499
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,130
I was wondering what
you were going to pop out of.

500
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,840
<i>- ...I mean this one...
- VÃ¡monos.</i>

501
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,630
<i>...thought that "Busty"
was referring to this woman...</i>

502
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,010
Where's the nitrous?

503
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,510
<i>...whom he really hadn't done
much fooling with at all.</i>

504
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,100
<i>Which is why he answered...</i>

505
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,220
<i>- eventually...
-</i> Yes.

506
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,900
Got my answer.

507
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,480
You really don't care
about your children's feelings, do you?

508
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,400
Oh, you're one to give parenting lessons.

509
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,990
I hear I'm not the only one
whose son has a nasty left hook.

510
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,030
Hmm, yeah, well...

511
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,240
You know, at least he did something

512
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,780
that we have not been able to do.

513
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,870
He stood up for himself
when his father was wrong.

514
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,580
In fact, it might be the thing

515
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,290
that I'm most proud of him for.

516
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,500
Hope he knows that.

517
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,380
Uh, he definitely does not.

518
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,090
- What's that?
- I just saw him...

519
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,220
uh, heard him, rather... at the model home
when I was on my way out.

520
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,630
- George Michael's at the model home?
<i>-</i> Well, if it wasn't him,

521
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,180
it was somebody who certainly did

522
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,060
a heck of a lot better
impression of him than me.

523
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,230
- Well, that could be anyone.
- Well, well...

524
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,520
Goodbye forever.

525
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,480
See you tonight.

526
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,900
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

527
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,110
<i>So, Michael changed
and raced to the model home.</i>

528
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,240
<i>But his hopes for an emotional</i>

529
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,280
<i>- father-son reunion...</i>
- Hey.

530
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm sorry if things got, uh...
Are you crying? Hey.

531
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,200
<i>...were ruined...</i>

532
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,370
- Hey.
- Oh.

533
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,710
<i>...by an emotional father-son reunion.</i>

534
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,830
Tonight's the big night.

535
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,420
Family of the year day.

536
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,340
What are you doing
in George Michael's bed?

537
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,210
Oh... just a little...

538
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,130
...just a little
weep and sleep, you know.

539
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,260
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

540
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,800
Want to be the big man, so...

541
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,470
Can't do it at the office, obviously,
and Lindsay's at the penthouse,

542
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,100
and I can't go to the cot...

543
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,770
Well, we don't... We only...
we only have the penthouse,

544
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,350
- so I-I, uh, I came here.
- Mmm.

545
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,730
I know about the cottage.

546
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,400
- I hated that rule.
- Okay.

547
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,940
- Michael?
- Hmm.

548
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,150
- I hated <i>both </i>rules.
- Oh, yeah, the towels.

549
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,490
Can I ask you a question?

550
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,110
How'd you get past the guard gate?

551
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,660
I came from the water.

552
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,450
I knew it. I told her. I told her,
"He's gonna take us from the beach."

553
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,830
Well, I am glad. I am glad you did.

554
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,620
Yeah, it's just your mother and her rules.

555
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,040
And I hated "no sand in the living room."

556
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,670
Why have a beach house

557
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,380
if every member of the family
can't enjoy it?

558
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,720
You look like
you're not enjoying anything.

559
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,970
- You all right?
- Yeah.

560
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,470
Your mom and I are...

561
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,390
We're not together.

562
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,060
We're not together in the...

563
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,560
well, I guess in, uh,
every meaning of that word.

564
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,270
I assumed that, but, uh,
why aren't you enjoying that?

565
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,900
Because your mom
is being courted, Michael.

566
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,610
Someone is fawning all over her.

567
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,070
- I knew she had Buster.
- No.

568
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,160
- I knew it.
- This one's not Buster.

569
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,330
I mean, I wish that guy was Buster.

570
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,830
Him I could fight, you know? You see,

571
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,330
this guy got past me.

572
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,670
How can your mother do this to me?

573
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,960
I knew I should've sold that property

574
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,000
when Stacy died.

575
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,130
Tracey.

576
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,800
No, we would've lost a fortune

577
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,260
if we sold when Tracey died.

578
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,930
No, Stacy was the paralegal
I used to bring out there

579
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,260
who went into insulin shock

580
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,390
at the very height of the market.

581
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,890
Sad.

582
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,350
How can she do this to me?

583
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,600
Yeah.

584
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,270
How can your mother do this?

585
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,810
<i>Actually,
she hadn't done anything yet.</i>

586
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
<i>But a few weeks earlier at the cottage...</i>

587
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,320
When my daughter wins this election,
we're going to be wall-to-wall wall.

588
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,820
<i>ZÃ ijiÃ n.</i>

589
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,870
<i>...a nuisance washed up
on her beach.</i>

590
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,120
You know, I smashed my phone

591
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
a couple years ago, too. With a hammer.

592
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,620
Never missed it.

593
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,000
Miss the hammer, but I guess that's why

594
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,380
God made rocks.

595
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,790
But God made those rocks

596
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,960
and put them
in front of my cottage for me,

597
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,630
so let's just leave them there.

598
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,800
I know the law pretty well,

599
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,680
and I can pick up any rock I want.

600
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,930
Well, what do you use those for,
anyway, Sand Hippie?

601
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,720
- Making a yoga garden?
- No.

602
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,180
I throw 'em at people that got no business

603
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,940
being on this part of the beach.

604
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,900
<i>He had done so for years...</i>

605
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,360
<i>Van Halen was in town
this weekend rocking audiences.</i>

606
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,280
<i>But some beachgoers are getting
rocked in a different way</i>

607
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,570
<i>by a group calling themselves
the Newport Bay Boys.</i>

608
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,410
<i>...in what started
as a cool, rich kid surfer gang</i>

609
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,780
<i>that had been possessive</i>

610
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,330
<i>about Newport's most beautiful cove...</i>

611
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,410
<i>Nirvana was in town
this weekend rocking audiences.</i>

612
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,750
<i>But some beachgoers are getting rocked
in a different way...</i>

613
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,040
<i>...and became a group</i>

614
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,670
<i>of kind of hip, middle-aged surfer men</i>

615
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,300
<i>defending their coastline.</i>

616
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,050
<i>50 Cent was in town
this weekend rocking audiences,</i>

617
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,510
<i>but some beachgoers are getting rocked
in a different way.</i>

618
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,810
I think we're good, guys. They're gone.

619
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,470
Yeah, they're gone.

620
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,810
I'm Dusty.

621
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,390
That's a nice way to say it.

622
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
But let's not make a habit of this,
shall we?

623
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,520
Now, take your bucket full of rocks

624
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,770
and be gone.

625
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,980
<i>But a habit of it he did make.</i>

626
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,470
Hey!

627
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,390
Get off my beach, you stupid seagulls.

628
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,470
Oh, hi.

629
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,600
Care to join me
for a glass of breakfast wine?

630
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,060
<i>And before long,
they were in the first stages</i>

631
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,440
<i>of a beautiful</i>

632
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,900
<i>early October-late November
relationship.</i>

633
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,280
I mean, he's attracted to her.

634
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,110
He's attracted to her.

635
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,280
I'm sorry. Why would he be
attracted to her if he's blind?

636
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,700
And how did he burn off his fingertips?

637
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,990
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

638
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,330
I may have added the fingertips.

639
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,370
I assume if he's blind,
he's gotta feel her face.

640
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,380
But you said you never saw him
touch her face?

641
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,880
I never said he was blind.

642
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,000
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.
It's probably just

643
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,800
some harmless one-way flirting.
You know, or a Russian prank show.

644
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,970
Maybe I deserve it, you know,

645
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,430
'cause I can't, uh...

646
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,890
I can't deliver the goods.

647
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,510
I shouldn't have lied to you, Michael.

648
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm not one to judge.

649
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,520
You know, look, I just...
I just told my son

650
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,440
that I broke up
with the woman that he's seeing,

651
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,610
and in retrospect,

652
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,690
I don't know, maybe she did not hear

653
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,070
"I'm leaving" when I said, uh,
"I ain't going nowhere."

654
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,240
Sounds like a "goodbye forever" to me.

655
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,530
Right? But if she tells my son,
uh, what I said,

656
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,410
you know what he's gonna say.

657
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,330
Uh, "You lied, and that's worse."

658
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,160
Yeah, you know, they can't wait
to say stuff like that.

659
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,000
Mm-hmm. Well,

660
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,790
I gotta tell her that that's
the last she's gonna see of me.

661
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,300
Yeah. I mean,
at least it won't destroy her life

662
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,670
like your mother did mine.

663
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,550
Yep. You gonna be okay here?

664
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,720
- I ain't going nowhere.
- Perfect.
