1
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,350
<i>While attempting to bail out
his brother, Buster,</i>

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,600
<i>Michael had accidentally bailed out
the family attorney.</i>

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,100
- What's it gonna cost to get Buster out?
<i>-</i> I don't know. What's he in for?

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,560
- Murder? Manslaughter?
- No. No.

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,600
There's no murder.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,190
He tampered with evidence
when Lucille 2 went missing.

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,150
- I would say over $50,000.
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,110
Yeah, well, I told you, I'm tapped out.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,490
Couldn't you embe...
borrow from your company?

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,080
What are you talking about?
Lucille Austero is a majority shareholder.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,660
We're gonna be under scrutiny.

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,290
Doesn't George Michael have a company
that he can em... borrow from?

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,540
You need $15,000?

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,000
No. No, not at all.
No, please, son, not from you.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,090
I'd never ask you for money. Come on.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,970
And it's <i>50,000</i>

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,390
that I'm <i>not </i>asking you for, not 15, okay?

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,430
Which I could probably lend you.

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,100
- Oh, I don't need it.
- Huh? No? Good. Yeah?

20
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,640
Good, good.

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,810
So your Fakeblock's doing well?

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,100
<i>George Michael had been
looking for an opportunity</i>

23
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,150
<i>to come clean about Fakeblock...</i>

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,730
- Been meaning to ask.
<i>- ...but this wasn't it.</i>

25
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
Yeah, well, Fakeblock's money is
all tied up in legalities,

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,910
- patenting, marketing.
- Sounds amazing.

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,160
Good for you, good for you. Good for him.

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,910
We're trying to figure out
the Buster thing.

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,660
Well, if we can't use the company money
to get Buster out,

30
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,000
you better figure out a way to do it,
Barry...

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,920
or I'll use my own lawyer.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,510
What are you talking about,
another lawyer?

33
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,800
You don't have the courtesy to wait
until I'm disbarred?

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,640
Is this a divorce guy? Oh, this hurts.

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,510
Give me a second, I'll be all right.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,310
I was gonna use your divorce
to pay off my peekaboo lawyer.

37
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,100
His name is Dustin Radler,
and I haven't hired him,

38
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,940
because technically,
he's given up the rat race.

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,150
Oh, God, the giving up the rat race guy?

40
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,570
This is the sand hobo?

41
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,030
Uh, it's just a question.

42
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,860
Are you guys doing something?

43
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,490
Don't say it!

44
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,530
Please, I can't... I can't hear it.

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,450
He tickles my fancy.

46
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,580
Your what? Is the...

47
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,460
What part of Mom is the fancy?

48
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,330
You do not want to know
what I'm picturing,

49
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,380
and it's not what you think.

50
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,840
Oh, stop.

51
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,210
We walk on the beach.

52
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,800
We like the feel
of the sand on our feet.

53
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,010
Oh, God, the thought of your feet.

54
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,300
It's fine.

55
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,930
I'm glad you have someone to talk to.

56
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,310
Well, maybe I'll go check on Buster.

57
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,980
Wow.
Mom really has him fancy-whipped, huh?

58
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,600
You don't want to bring another lawyer
into this.

59
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,520
You don't want to go in fully armed,
because the DA,

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,860
she's up for reelection,
and she's a killer.

61
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,570
God, I even hate to say her name.

62
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,530
Yeah, Lottie Dottie DA, my asshole.

63
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,700
Okay. When it comes to Buster:
a total press blackout.

64
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Couldn't agree more.
We have to be diligent.

65
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,660
- No media.
- Uh...

66
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,830
are we talking about reality or, uh,

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,380
scripted, as well,
because I've got...

68
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,960
Why would there be a scripted
about the family?

69
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,220
Weren't you working on one
with Ron Howard?

70
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,140
You're saying
that's not grandfathered in.

71
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,850
'Cause it was before the murder.

72
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,430
Michael, tell me that movie

73
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,060
you were producing about us
is not still happening.

74
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,360
I do not think that it is. I mean, I...

75
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,900
I gave the releases to Kitty,
but the industry does not move fast.

76
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,950
Well, then, talk to Kitty
and get them back.

77
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,530
Can't. Kitty hates me.

78
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,280
Did you catch this?

79
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,120
Man, that's priceless.

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
First, you eat it with Buster,

81
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,120
then you step in it with the movie,

82
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,080
and now you're eating
what you stepped in,

83
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,590
because Kitty hates you.

84
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,340
Guess Michael's the geo-bead today.

85
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,300
Did you say "geo-bead"?

86
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,970
Yeah, it's one of Dad's expressions...
When somebody screws up, Dad said it.

87
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,510
One of his "you'll figure it out
someday" expressions.

88
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,180
- Okay.
- Know what? You're lucky,

89
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,600
'cause Kitty's sweet on me,
so I'll go with you.

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,440
- No, thank you. Nope.
- I could go. Or just...

91
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,320
Would that be helpful if I did?
Or am I just being a G-O-B?

92
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,650
Uh...

93
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,780
G-O-B spells "Gob," you geo-bead,

94
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,200
so why don't you s... ah. Well, today's the day.

95
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,700
Why are you even still here?
Go find your wife.

96
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,410
I don't know where she is.

97
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,580
Well, track down the ex-boyfriend.

98
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,250
And take Tonto with you.

99
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,670
Yes, of course, Marky Bark.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,380
From the cuckolding.

101
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,220
I think I might have an idea
of where I can, I think.

102
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,430
- Come on!
- Coming!

103
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,550
<i>And as Tobias rushed off
with his newfound son,</i>

104
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,470
<i>George Michael and his cousin</i>

105
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,720
<i>- caught up.
-</i> I can't believe this is the third

106
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,730
"welcome home from prison" party
we've thrown.

107
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,060
Yeah.

108
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,400
Know what we should do?

109
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,150
Why don't we make out again
and teach them a lesson?

110
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,740
I can't, 'cause my dad's here,
and he thinks I'm still dating Rebel.

111
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,070
And how would our making out
teach them a lesson?

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,580
T-Teach Rebel a lesson.
I meant, teach Rebel.

113
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,830
I'm supposed to have
a date with her later.

114
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,120
Wait, so you <i>are </i>still dating her?

115
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,670
What happened to our plan,

116
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,420
where you show up demanding sex
after ghosting her

117
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,790
for two months,
and she breaks up with you?

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,630
Didn't I tell you?
She was out of town for two months,

119
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,130
and it looked like I was waiting
for her when she got home,

120
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,220
and she thinks
we're closer than ever now.

121
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,510
I've agreed to go to this barbecue
at her dad's house.

122
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,510
I can't meet her family. I...

123
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,310
Hey, George Michael, uh... Ah, hey.

124
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,690
Did thatÂ Murphybrown thing upset you?

125
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,150
Oh, did that actress die?
Oh, you, 2015.

126
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,570
Oh, no, this is different.
The, uh... Tobias's friend,

127
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,110
his name is Murphybrown,

128
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,360
and it's more than just his acting friend.

129
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,740
It's his boyfriend.

130
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,990
No, it's his son.

131
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,030
His boyfriend's son.

132
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,950
Oh, I'm sorry, Maeby.

133
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,870
Are you... jealous?

134
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,160
No, of course not.

135
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,880
I mean, the guy grew up
not even knowing his father.

136
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,420
- If anything, I'm... jealous.
- Hmm.

137
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,300
Yeah, that... that is a great word for it.

138
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,550
Did I overhear that Rebel
does not want you to meet her family?

139
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,180
No, it's that they're having

140
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,350
some barbecue thing today
over at her dad's house...

141
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,390
And you were not invited. Ay, ay, ay.

142
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,600
No, I think I could show up.
- She didn't seem into it... - Well,

143
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,320
I'm the wrong one to ask.
When I was briefly interested

144
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,990
in Rebel, you know,

145
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,280
and even that overstates it,
I failed the Ron test big-time.

146
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,540
Okay? And in fairness to Ron,
I also thought that he was...

147
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,830
Her...

148
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,960
Her lover?

149
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,460
...boss.

150
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,090
But listen, you take your time.

151
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,550
Don't rush trying to fit in
with that crowd.

152
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,170
They're probably looking for a yes-man
or a suck-up.

153
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,590
That's not your style.

154
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,180
No. No, well, I had a great role model.

155
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,390
Aw, bless you.

156
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,220
Yeah, I also had a...

157
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,640
Well, bless you.

158
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,480
If you end up meeting that family,

159
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,190
one good rule to follow is...
- do not bring Tobias. - Be myself.

160
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,150
Be yourself, George Michael.

161
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,730
George Maharis.

162
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,150
Yes, be George Maharis,
George Michael.

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,270
I had to give her Buster.

171
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,890
The movie couldn't be me
and George Michael. We were both dating Rebel,

172
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,810
and she didn't know
that he was my son.

173
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,190
- It was a disaster.
- Right.

174
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,480
You didn't know who I was dating,
so you accused me of being the other man.

175
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,950
- Who were you dating?
- Julie Bowen!

176
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,280
<i>Actually, it was Tony Wonder,</i>

177
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,030
<i>a man Gob had been longing
to hear from ever since</i>

178
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,410
<i>the gay magician poofed
into his life,</i>

179
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,710
<i>- and then, just as quickly...</i>
- Oh,.

180
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,750
<i>...disa-poofed.</i>

181
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,500
The Rebel thing
almost ruined my relationship with my son.

182
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,460
And I think that it's a good thing

183
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,460
she's lost interest in George Michael.

184
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,180
- I have to tell you...
- That never made sense.

185
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,340
It never made sense.

186
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,430
It never made sense,
because, you know,

187
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,310
he doesn't fit in with those people,
and I think that George Michael and I

188
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,680
are gonna be closer than ever.

189
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,890
He's gonna need a father...
still needs a father.

190
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,150
The only mother figure he's ever had

191
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,360
- in his life was...
- Oh, it was Mom.

192
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,940
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

193
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,030
Huh, poor kid.

194
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,820
- I can't imagine.
- Nor can I.

195
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,380
- Wait, <i>we </i>had Mom.
- You know, in a way, she was <i>our </i>mom.

196
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,460
<i>George Michael
was seeking motherly advice</i>

197
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,130
<i>from a cousin</i>

198
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,590
<i>- who'd been living as a grandma.</i>
- Aha.

199
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,260
I heard we're getting a visit
from the grandson. Want a lick?

200
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,770
- Oh, my God, no.
- Good, more for me.

201
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,600
- Gonna have more? I can come back.
- No, no. Come on in.

202
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,940
I heard you're having
relationship trouble.

203
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,400
I'll go get your...
What do you call her? Gangie?

204
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,400
Maeby...

205
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,570
I <i>should </i>call her that.

206
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,320
Uh, yeah, relationship problems.

207
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,700
- Gangie gets it.
- Yeah, she sure helped me.

208
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,370
Imagine finding love at my age.

209
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,240
It is hard to imagine, but, uh,

210
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,450
maybe you'll find something else,
like a hobby

211
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,910
- or a napkin.
- Mm.

212
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,040
Annette, your grandson's here.

213
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,670
I have no makeup on,

214
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,800
- I'm a mess. Cover your eyes.
- Too late.

215
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,840
I won't look.
If your grandson wasn't here, I'd probably take a peeky-weeky.

216
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,180
Well, hey,
what a surprise... honey.

217
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,970
You're living with this guy?

218
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,680
Hey, my fake identity is none of
your fake identity's business, okay?

219
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,600
Speaking of that,
things have gotten worse.

220
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,860
Not only does my dad think Fakeblock
is real, and I've got money

221
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,820
I won't share with him
when he needs to bail out Buster,

222
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,030
but he also thinks I should
take things slower with Rebel.

223
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,860
I don't know,
but here's my idea about her.

224
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,740
What do women really want?

225
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,410
Their fathers' attention.

226
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,740
And Ron Howard is a buttoned-down guy,
right?

227
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,540
What if he doesn't like you?

228
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,120
What if you show up to the barbecue
with pink hair?

229
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,330
- Pink hair?
- Yeah.

230
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,500
I saw it on someone recently,
and it made me want to puke. Trust me.

231
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,800
You are gonna be like, "Burn!"

232
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,090
That's starting to tingle.

233
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,890
Let me know when it starts to burn.

234
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,430
- It's gonna burn?
- Did I not make that clear?

235
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,930
Nobody said getting out of a relationship
would be painless.

236
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,440
You should talk about
getting out of a relationship.

237
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,400
I think your friend Stan
might be interested in you

238
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,770
in a way that you don't want him
to be interested.

239
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,570
That would explain
why he's offering to do my laundry.

240
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,490
Well, whatever gets him to do my laundry,
huh?

241
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,950
Yeah, no, I'll suss it out.

242
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,910
This lie I'm living might be
sending him mixed signals.

243
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,910
<i>At that moment,
some mixed signals</i>

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,250
<i>were also being sent
on Pacific Coast Highway...</i>

245
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,000
Technically,
they had to call me Rock Monster.

246
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,670
<i>...as Tobias
and his newly found son</i>

247
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,430
<i>were headed to Mexico
to find his newly lost wife.</i>

248
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,090
And John Beard actually said

249
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,550
I was one of the more popular predators,

250
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,970
so whatever gets your name
and weight out there.

251
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,020
But I want to hear about <i>your </i>dreams.

252
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,940
I don't know.
I'm really good at computers.

253
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,850
It's fun, too.

254
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,900
Kind of like the only time I feel alive.

255
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,320
No, no, your dreams,

256
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
not what you think will make you rich.
Your passion.

257
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,530
Oh, also maybe being,
like, a doctor for animals,

258
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,280
or their dogs, 'cause sometimes,
if I look at an animal,

259
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,580
there's, like, a special connection.

260
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,330
Dreams! Dreams.

261
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,330
I didn't ask,
"What part of a dog do you want to touch?"

262
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay, let's try this in reverse.
Uh, you're famous.

263
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,800
Uh, what is the thing you do
that makes everyone clap?

264
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,180
Ooh! Once I got claps
for doing a juggling ball thing,

265
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,390
'cause I'd unicycle
in Haiti when I was volunteering...

266
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,270
Yes! Clowning, yes!
Now, you're dreaming.

267
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,060
That's your dream.

268
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,400
Well, perhaps we should juggle
your priorities.

269
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,310
Oh.

270
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,070
<i>And Michael
was preparing his brother</i>

271
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,240
<i>to persuade Kitty to give back
their movie rights.</i>

272
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,070
Good. Here comes Kitty.
Here she comes.

273
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,820
- I believe in you. You can do her.
- What?

274
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,910
<i>This. </i>You can do this...
<i>to </i>her.

275
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,500
Michael! Whatever it is, the answer is no,
unless you want the answer to be no,

276
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,960
- and then, it is yes.
- Well, Gob, I want you to,

277
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,500
- uh, to see who's here.
- Gob.

278
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,260
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

279
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,680
I was gonna say, they look puffy and red.

280
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,810
- You guys need to get a room, huh?
- Right?

281
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,350
Why don't you guys get a room,

282
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,350
and I can say hi to Ron?
What do you think?

283
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,230
He's not in the office today.
He has some family event.

284
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,900
- Oh, is that today?
- But since he's not here,

285
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,780
how would you like
to get inside of a LEM?

286
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,240
If I could j... Um, Michael.

287
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,860
- I just...
- Yeah?

288
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,740
- I can't do this.
- No. You're gonna be fine.

289
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,030
You're gonna be fine.
You were built for this, okay?

290
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,790
I can see she's got gum
in her mouth.

291
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,540
She can hear you.

292
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,130
You're overthinking it.
Nothing to worry about.

293
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,420
- It was in the past. You've been there.
- Let me get out of your hair.

294
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,090
- And you can get in my hair.
- God, no.

295
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,590
You can't make me touch her hair.

296
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,180
- I'm not gonna touch her hair.
- Come on, Gob.

297
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,470
<i>And nearby,
George Maharis was ready to alienate</i>

298
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,390
<i>his soon to be ex-girlfriend's family</i>

299
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,060
<i>with a head full of Tobias Pink hair.</i>

300
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,480
Hey! There you are.

301
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,360
Dad, this is George Maharis.

302
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,070
- Oh, neat to meet you.
- Neat to meet you.

303
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,780
Rebel says neat things about you.

304
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,580
What's up?

305
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,750
<i>Unfortunately,
Maeby left the dye in too long,</i>

306
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,460
<i>- and it turned out to be...</i>
- Look.

307
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,920
Howard Red.

308
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,960
No, it isn't. It... It's...

309
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,220
- Imagine if it was pink, though.
- Yeah, but it's not.

310
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,130
It's Howard Red.
Cheryl, look at what this kid did.

311
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,760
It's like our hair.

312
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,930
Someone's come a-courtin'.

313
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,390
You're fitting in already.

314
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,810
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's just my family.

315
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,270
We Howards don't just laugh
when things are funny.

316
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,530
We laugh when we're happy.

317
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,900
And when things are uncomfortable, too.

318
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,320
You mean, when bad reviews
start rolling in?

319
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,790
So, Rebel tells me

320
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,330
that you're an entrepreneur,
some sort of security software?

321
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,210
Oh, Dad, it's called Fakeblock,
and it's amazing.

322
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,710
The company's gonna go under
by next week. We're broke.

323
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,220
Guess I'm not exactly
daddy's dream boyfriend, am I?

324
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,220
Listen, don't worry
about that company stuff.

325
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,270
- When I started Imagine...
- <i>With Brian Grazer.</i>

326
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,980
...the company was up to its neck in debt,
but look at me...

327
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,690
- <i>And Brian.</i>
- ...now.

328
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,610
And in those early days, I can't tell you

329
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,610
how many times I felt like a fraud.

330
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,950
But I'll tell you a secret,
everyone feels that way.

331
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,990
<i>George Michael was touched
by the advice...</i>

332
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,790
But enough business talk.
Tell me, do you like hot dogs?

333
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,040
<i>...but he made one last attempt</i>

334
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,870
<i>to offend his host...</i>

335
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,290
No, I don't like hot dogs.

336
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,010
- <i>...but couldn't.</i>
- I love them.

337
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,970
- No.
- Oh, my God.

338
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,180
You're good. You're good.

339
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,940
<i>What a neat group.</i>

340
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,900
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was trying
to get in the mood with Kitty.</i>

341
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,910
Hard to believe
they used to put monkeys in these.

342
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,740
My guess?

343
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,240
They wouldn't be able
to figure out a lot of this stuff.

344
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,370
Yeah. Monkeys are kind of dumb.

345
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,040
I'd like to see one get out of here
quickly in an emergency.

346
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,420
They'd be all...

347
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I have to get out of here.

348
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,760
Get me out of here.

349
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,430
Ah, too good,
too good, too good.

350
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,430
So...

351
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,390
surely you didn't want
to be alone with me

352
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,600
to talk about monkeys in space.

353
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,730
No. I did not want to be alone
with you at all.

354
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,530
Remind me not to forget my gum.

355
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,030
One sec. Probably my brother.

356
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,700
- "Did you trick her into it yet?"
- "Trick her into what?"

357
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,540
"Giving us our rights back, you geo..."

358
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,830
It's Tony. I gotta take this.
Can I get some privacy?

359
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,580
- We're sealed in here.
- I gotta get out.

360
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,380
- You can't turn that...
- Get me out of here.

361
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,960
- No, no!
- It'll go to voicemail!

362
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,210
I gotta blow the hatch!

363
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,840
- That's the chute!
- God, I just...

364
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,180
'mazing Jesus.

365
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,390
<i>Hey, it's Tony.</i>

366
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,060
Oh.

367
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,600
If I'd known, I wouldn't have picked up.

368
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,650
I think that we're stuck in here.

369
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,110
- Where are you?
- <i>Oh, um...</i>

370
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,400
I'm in a LEM. Where are you?

371
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm in a Tumi... suitcase.

372
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,700
I think I'm in baggage claim
at Long Beach Airport.

373
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,070
My assistant's picking me up,

374
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,240
unless she takes
another gray Tumi by mistake,

375
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,790
then I go to unclaimed.

376
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,290
<i>- That's how we lost the Amazing Frederick.</i>
- I would've claimed you.

377
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,420
I'll bet.

378
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,050
Since I'm getting back in town,
I thought I owed you a call.

379
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,470
<i>So, let's get together.</i>

380
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,390
I can't right now. I've got this thing...

381
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,480
...I'm stuck in the LEM with.

382
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,940
<i>That's the other thing.</i>

383
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,940
I don't think we can actually hang out,
anyway.

384
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,820
I mean,
I'm the flamboyant gay magician.

385
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,070
<i>You're the super straight
Christian magician.</i>

386
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,860
<i>We'll taint each other's brand.</i>

387
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,030
Yeah.

388
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,990
I guess we're...
different in the same way.

389
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,620
Same, in a different way.

390
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,910
- Different...
- Same...

391
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,630
- ...in a same, different way.
- ...in a different way, same.

392
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,000
- Different, wifferent...
- Same way.

393
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,010
- ...in a same gay way?
- Different same.

394
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,470
- It...
- Wame.

395
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,470
Wow. Guess that's over.

396
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,640
Yup. Talk about a sign.

397
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,550
<i>And that's when they realized</i>

398
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,720
<i>there was a time
when they could speak in unison,</i>

399
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,430
<i>but I guess it was over now.</i>

400
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,520
I gotta run.
I better shut up and listen for "wonder."

401
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,270
<i>Wait, so is this goodbye...</i>

402
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,030
How much did you hear?

403
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,910
<i>And George Sr.
visited his prison alma mater</i>

404
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,200
<i>for the first time
since his son had been incarcerated.</i>

405
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,910
This is where I ate a battery
during my first week at recess. No, no, "yard." Don't call it recess.

406
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,840
Well, it's a little too late for that,
Dad.

407
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,210
I've been trying to figure out prison
on my own.

408
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,670
- I know. Sorry...
- George Bluth! Oh, my God.

409
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,640
- I've never seen you in street clothes.
- Duck?

410
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,010
I almost didn't recognize you
without the flashlight in your mouth.

411
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,100
Sorry to be rude.
This is my son, Buster.

412
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,730
Charmed, I'm...

413
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,560
No touching.

414
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,980
<i>And perhaps
that was why George Sr.</i>

415
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,150
<i>decided he owed it to his son</i>

416
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,360
<i>to share some
of his own caged wisdom.</i>

417
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,950
Buster,
you have to toughen up now.

418
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,290
You're in lock-up, all right?
They'll circle like jackals.

419
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,000
You gotta be strong,
especially with the skinheads.

420
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,330
Skinhead gets in your face,
you charge back at him.

421
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,330
You pop him fast.

422
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,670
That's the only way you can get respect.

423
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,210
That one there's
been giving me looks.

424
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,880
No. That's not a skinhead.

425
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,430
That's a guard.
You charge at a guard, they'll kill you.

426
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,640
Oh, yeah. That I should know.

427
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,260
But with a skinhead,
that's how you get respect.

428
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,230
I got more respect then,
with these animals,

429
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,150
than I get with your...
with your mother now.

430
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,150
I can't...

431
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,230
I can't satisfy her.

432
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,490
- Really? It's so easy.
- No, I mean,

433
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,660
we are no longer together.
Your mother kicked me out.

434
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,200
- Oh, there's an opening.
- No, no, no.

435
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,740
No, she doesn't want anything
to do with either of us.

436
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,450
She has found someone new.
She's found a younger man.

437
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,870
- Yeah.
- Oh.

438
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,420
Sort of a son with benefits.

439
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,170
They said that I'd lose my old lady,

440
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,210
and I said, "Not mother!"

441
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,550
- Okay.
- "She'll wait for me!"

442
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,010
Shh.

443
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,300
The thought of her
singing to him goodnight.

444
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,310
I can't take it. I can't take it.

445
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,190
I know. I know.

446
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,770
No touching.

447
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,320
<i>And that's when George Sr.</i>

448
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,610
<i>decided to have someone else
put him out of his misery.</i>

449
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,820
I know what I have to do.

450
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,570
- What are you gonna do?
- I know.

451
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,780
What are you gonna do?

452
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,450
I know what I have to do.

453
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,740
- Oh... are you...
- I'm sorry.

454
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,370
Jesus Christ, George.

455
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,710
I was so mad when I thought
you didn't recognize me.

456
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,960
<i>âª What could be better? âª</i>

457
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,880
God, this place has changed.

458
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,680
<i>George Michael was also</i>

459
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,010
<i>finding a reunion more pleasant
than he expected.</i>

460
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,550
Your dad is so nice.

461
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,560
- It's been his job since he was two.
- Huh.

462
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,480
Sometimes, you want to look
in your parents' perfect,

463
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,150
- sweet, kind faces, and tell them off.
- Punch them.

464
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,560
Why would you say that?

465
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,770
No, no, I... That...

466
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,070
I don't feel that way,
but certain kids do.

467
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,280
There's a website about it.

468
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,490
Although, everyone knows
it's biased in favor of the dads.

469
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,080
- Your company should shut that site down.
- Well...

470
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,080
<i>And George Michael,
finding himself smitten</i>

471
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,670
<i>with Rebel and her family,
decided to come clean...</i>

472
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,830
To be honest, I don't know
if there's gonna be a company.

473
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,460
<i>...until she said this.</i>

474
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,050
Is it a money thing?

475
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,090
If you need money,
I can loan it to you.

476
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,390
Everybody needs a bailout now and then.

477
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,430
It'll give me a stake in the company.

478
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,180
<i>And the prospect of
helping his family...</i>

479
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,440
Well, speaking of family,
I actually could use a little...

480
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,110
<i>...proved too great
a temptation.</i>

481
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,860
...bailout money, as you put it.

482
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,940
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

483
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,610
Oh, my God, You are great.
Why don't we talk about it tomorrow?

484
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,110
Ah, I can't do it tomorrow.
I've got reshoots.

485
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,370
All the Mexico stuff.

486
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,780
And so you know,
my ex-boyfriend will be there.

487
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,410
But if I know you're gonna be here
when I get back...

488
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,370
Then when you're back.

489
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,160
Yes! Wait. What color's your hair gonna be?

490
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,460
It's like kissing your cousin. Ugh.

491
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,420
Ew. Okay. Gross, okay. Got it.

492
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,640
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby was concerned
that Stan's strange behavior was romantic,</i>

493
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,220
<i>so she tried to discourage it.</i>

494
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,720
Maybe I'm trying to prove
something to my clueless dad.

495
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,560
Anyway, I guess that's why
I can't make a relationship work.

496
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,400
Does that upset you?

497
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,860
Annette, it does,
if you must know the truth,

498
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,440
'cause your dad was a fool.

499
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,740
I see the real you: a special,
wonderful, unique,

500
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,410
67-year-old woman
who amazes me every day.

501
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,200
<i>And that's when Maeby realized
what it was about</i>

502
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,450
<i>Stan's behavior that was so confusing.</i>

503
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,830
It would be my pleasure
to be the man in your life

504
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,750
that your father never was.

505
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,590
<i>It was paternal, and, touched,</i>

506
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,800
<i>all she could think of to say was...</i>

507
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,760
- Bury me.

508
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,300
<i>And Maeby's actual father,</i>

509
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,680
<i>and his newfound son, Murphybrown,</i>

510
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,680
<i>arrived at the last place
he'd seen Lindsay:</i>

511
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,770
<i>Father B's now-abandoned property.</i>

512
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,980
Keep an eye out for Lindsay.
That is why we're here.

513
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,270
Wait, is that her? Is that Lindsay?

514
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,480
Oh, yes. Lindsay! It's us! It's us! Hi!

515
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,530
Oh, no. That's a sickly cactus
with a plastic bag on it.

516
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,870
Right. For a second,
I was like, "Is that Lindsay?"

517
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,370
I suppose it's true.

518
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,910
The desert makes one see

519
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,500
- what one wants to see.
- Hmm. Yeah.

520
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,080
Is that two barrel-chested,

521
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,500
strapping men
on horseback approaching us?

522
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,550
You are not welcome
on this land.

523
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,010
There must be some mistake.

524
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,050
No, there is no mistake.

525
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,680
I regret to inform you
that you are trespassing.

526
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,600
Mm... no, this land belongs
to George Bluth.

527
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,640
Oh. I see.

528
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,400
- And are you George Bluth?
- N...

529
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,570
<i>It was a part
that Tobias had played before.</i>

530
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,900
You are about to witness why
a career in entertainment

531
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,990
can come in handy.

532
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,990
Yeah, that's right.

533
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,660
I'm the last guy you want to kick off
of your la... his land... my land.

534
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,710
- Our land.
- No.

535
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,420
Oh, I did not realize
you were Mr. George Bluth himself.

536
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,260
Well, Mr. George Bluth,
we have some papers for you to sign.

537
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,010
Oh, is that right?

538
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,630
Well, how about I just...

539
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,340
use my son Michael
as a signing surface?

540
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,600
- Get up.
- Okay.

541
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,350
<i>Tobias wasn't the only
one trespassing</i>

542
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>on someone else's property,
as Michael had decided</i>

543
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,350
<i>to do what he was certain
Gob couldn't:</i>

544
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,400
<i>take matters into his own hands.</i>

545
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,610
I can't tell you how many times
I've felt like a fraud.

546
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,280
But I'll tell you a secret, everyone...

547
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,280
Hey, Ron. Michael.

548
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,870
From that untitled Bluth project.

549
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,160
- Then I dated Rebel.
- Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah.

550
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,080
Prayer hands.

551
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,080
Yeah. Listen, a lot of stuff has changed
with the family.

552
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah. I heard about that.

553
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,540
Oh, has it gotten out?

554
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,500
Not to the general public,

555
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,420
but at Imagine, we hear everything.

556
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,130
<i>You know I'm as straight</i>

557
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,890
as they come, I just got a lot
on my mind right now

558
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,930
with work, slash, am I gay,
slash, Buster's in jail.

559
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,220
- He is? What for?
- Well, just for...

560
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,640
for maybe killing this woman
my family owes money to.

561
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,060
I think it was his robot hand.

562
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,860
- Get me Ron.
- It's hush-hush.

563
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,440
Okay, so then you might understand why

564
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,110
we don't want a movie about it.

565
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,400
Absolutely.
You'd have to cut too much.

566
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,370
This has true crime limited series
written all over it.

567
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,540
That way, my Rebel could be in it, too.

568
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,790
She's no Bryce, but she's like a robot.

569
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,790
Gives the exact same performance
every take. Real time-saver.

570
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,790
So, yes, let's do this.

571
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,340
Here's the thing. Right now,
my family is not looking for publicity.

572
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,180
The other way to look at it is
if I heard about it,

573
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,430
it's out there.

574
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,640
Best way to manage press
is to get in front of it.

575
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,890
Hey, Dad. We need you
for the three-legged race.

576
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,980
- Also, can you start the music?
- I don't know how to, Reed.

577
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,400
Oh. I must've heard that.
I must've heard that.

578
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,570
Right? Sure. That, uh... so you get...

579
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,820
- Do you get the scripts read to you?
- Uh...

580
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,570
This is my son, Reed.

581
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,860
My dad knows how to read.

582
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,330
Yes.

583
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,370
Nice to meet you.
Uh, yeah. Whenever.

584
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,160
I see why
you named him Reed.

585
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,250
He seems smart.

586
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,460
Hey, thanks for sneaking in.

587
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,090
Yep.

588
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,760
<i>As he rushed to get out
before running into Rebel,</i>

589
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,800
<i>Michael ran into yet another
famous Howard.</i>

590
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

591
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,060
Avoiding the three-legged race,
I see.

592
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,220
Bryce!

593
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,480
I'm sorry, but I just can't, Reed.

594
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,980
Oh,
talking to your brother Reed. I get it.

595
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,270
Michael Bluth. Pleasure.

596
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,900
- Hi. Bryce.
- Yeah, no. I know.

597
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,360
Oh, yes. Yes, you dated my sister,
didn't you?

598
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,030
Well, even that overstates it.

599
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,820
We weren't together long
before we broke up.

600
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,080
- You know, very clean break.
- Oh.

601
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,000
I was gonna say hi,
but I ain't not going somewhere.

602
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,000
But I-I'm going somewhere.
Never mind.

603
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,000
Listen, you dodged a bullet.
She's a user.

604
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,420
She's got a new guy.
And she's using him.

605
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,800
Yeah?
But I heard that's ending.

606
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
No, are you kidding? He's trapped.

607
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,470
- Hmm.
- In her web.

608
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,970
She's with him
because of his Internet company.

609
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,010
You know that, right?

610
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,140
You think so?
Do you think that she's just using him?

611
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,480
Yeah. And I'm pretty sure
it's not for his body.

612
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,650
Oh, well... I mean, I don't know the guy,

613
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,730
but I saw a picture.

614
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,940
I think he's got a great build.
You know? Um, he's wiry.

615
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,570
You wouldn't want him to be taller.

616
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,660
I like the young man's body.
Okay? I do.

617
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,950
Yeah, well,
that's very weird of you.

618
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,790
Still, such a kiss-up.

619
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,910
He's even dyed his hair
Dallas Howard Red.

620
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,540
- I get it. It's a hot new dye,
- New dye?

621
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,750
but you're not supposed
to leave it in that long.

622
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,880
Look at him. Ugh.
He looks like aÂ jack-o'- lantern.

623
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,970
- Put your head down.
- What...

624
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
- Dork.
- Can I exit through the house?

625
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,930
I don't want the user
to create a dramatic scene.

626
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,680
No. Don't worry about that.

627
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,350
I have seen her get laughs
doing <i>The Glass Menagerie.</i>

628
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,810
Oh. I don't get it.

629
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,480
<i>Michael was hoping
to avoid an awkward run-in</i>

630
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,320
<i>with his son at the valet,</i>

631
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,660
<i>when he came across a way
to find out when the coast was clear.</i>

632
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,450
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

633
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,280
Yeah, that's a sweet setup there.

634
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,120
I wanted to take a peek.
Do you mind?

635
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,750
I want to check out my son.

636
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,370
Uh, that I understand.

637
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,080
My name is Rance Howard,
Ron's dad.

638
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,250
I thought you worked here. Hi.

639
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,550
Well, I like to stay busy,
keep an eye on my son, too.

640
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,840
Oh, yeah? You still have to do that?

641
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,680
That's a father's job.
Doesn't start at 9:00 and end at 5:00.

642
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,560
It's 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

643
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,770
Even as they get older, huh?

644
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,480
It gets even harder,
'cause they think they know it all.

645
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,730
You still have to be there for them
when they make mistakes.

646
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,570
Or sometimes they need
to cry a little bit

647
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,820
because sometimes a person needs
to cry a little bit.

648
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,820
Unless that person is a dad.

649
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,870
For a father must
bear his load lightly,

650
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,830
and yet, beneath the mask,
a watchful eye never wanders.

651
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,580
For it is through this glance

652
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,840
that a wisdom beyond words
must be passed.

653
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,460
That's an interesting take.

654
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,090
Because I think a girl
might be using my son,

655
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,350
but I don't exactly have a way
to keep an eye on her...

656
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,600
Oh, I see you met my dad.

657
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,180
He doesn't say much,
but we're sure glad he's around.

658
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,400
Although,
hopefully he didn't share his thoughts

659
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,940
about climate change, did he?

660
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,570
- Hoax!
- He was great company.

661
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,070
<i>That's when Michael found a way
to keep an eye on the woman</i>

662
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,650
<i>who might be using his son.</i>

663
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,490
Know what else is a good company?

664
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,910
Imagine Entertainment.

665
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,000
And I think that I want to go forward
with that docuseries after all.

666
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,870
That's great news. Hey, Jocelyn!

667
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,000
Would you mind bringing down
the standard TV contracts, please?

668
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,210
Streaming contracts,
cable or broadcast?

669
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,800
- A streamer!
- No residuals.

670
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,220
Jocey will have those down
in just a minute,

671
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,840
and if we're quick, we can get
an interview with your brother

672
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,340
while he's still in jail.

673
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,140
You know, you can't beat
those visuals.

674
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,310
Put a little atmosphere
in there, you filter it...

675
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,690
Nice low-angle shot for the close-up...

676
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,780
Oh, a wide shot.
Tell it in one image.

677
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,360
<i>Yes, a wide shot.</i>

678
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,400
Wide shot.

679
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,950
<i>Michael returned home...</i>

680
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,490
How did it go with Gob and Kitty?

681
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,750
<i>...where his mother
had been lying in wait.</i>

682
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,830
Tell me he got her to kill the movie.

683
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,880
Well,
I think he probably forgot to ask.

684
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,710
That's okay 'cause I spoke to Ron.

685
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,550
He was very happy to see me.
It felt good.

686
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,010
That's just Hollywood BS.

687
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,760
Well, I think it's gonna help us.

688
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,800
You think what is going to help us?

689
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,140
Oh, God. I'm burying the lead.

690
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,970
The Bluth project is dead because...

691
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,600
it's gonna be a streaming series.

692
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,100
We said no leaks,
and now we're streaming over everyone?

693
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,150
I'm not telling it well. The point is,

694
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,900
Ron's gonna do
an introductory interview,

695
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,570
okay, with Buster, as research

696
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,610
about the family's history,
and what...

697
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,200
Michael, they cannot go
into our family's past.

698
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,580
They certainly can't do
a TV show about it.

699
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,200
It's never gonna get that far.

700
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,370
It's gonna send a signal to the DA

701
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,830
that if they hold Buster,
they're looking for trouble.

702
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,750
Think about it.

703
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,040
If the nicest man in the world

704
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,750
goes in there with his camera
and crew,

705
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,800
and he tells Buster
he believes in his innocence...

706
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,340
They'll drop the charges
quicker than you can blink your...

707
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,050
Initiate, at least,
the blinking of the eyes.

708
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,470
The opening of the eyes is, uh,

709
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,600
a bit of a guestimate lately.

710
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,430
And what if Buster chokes?

711
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,890
I guess that's what Ron's for.

712
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,400
<i>That would prove
to be a very...</i>

713
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,110
<i>No, you'll see on the next
"On the Next."</i>

714
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,570
<i>On the next </i>Arrested Development...

715
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,990
On the next shot,
I know we said close-ups. No, wide.

716
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,580
<i>...Ron Howard arranges</i>

717
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,200
<i>a jailhouse interview with Buster...</i>

718
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,540
Here we go.

719
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,080
Showtime.

720
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,000
<i>...and Buster remembers
George Sr.'s advice.</i>

721
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,920
A skinhead.

722
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,670
I'm gonna kill you,
you bleeping skinhead!

723
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,510
Oh, hey!

724
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,340
Skinhead!

725
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,470
See what I did to skinhead?

726
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,560
Mm. Make a note.

727
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,640
Forget the wide shots.

728
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,020
50/50 and matching overs.

729
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,520
<i>And Maeby enjoys her
new paternal relationship.</i>

730
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,020
Look how happy they look together.

731
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,780
Just like us.

732
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,030
<i>Until this happens.</i>
