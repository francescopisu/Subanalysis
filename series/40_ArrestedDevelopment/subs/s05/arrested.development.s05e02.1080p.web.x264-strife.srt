1
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,930
<i>Michael had decided
to leave town,</i>

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,970
<i>and needed to get out of
his obligation to make a movie</i>

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,430
<i>- about his family.</i>
- Michael! You had one job.

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,350
You had to get your son
to sign the releases!

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,100
Ron Howard wants to make
a heartfelt father-son drama

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,190
that has a good clean message
for his illegitimate daughter to star in.

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,980
Don't pull this on me!
We've already reserved

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,190
the soundstages and he's already started paying off - the Hollywood Foreign Press.
- <i>No, they're great.</i>

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,160
<i>- She's funny.</i>
- I understand all of that.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Okay, but Rebel is part of
the reason why I can't do this.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,330
My son is dating her,
and I don't want to get

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,910
in the way. If I could talk to Ron,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,790
- No. No. I am in charge
- I'm sure he and I...

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,830
of this movie right now.
My ass is on the line

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,170
while Ron makes a real movie in Mexico.

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,130
- Mexico, okay.
- You don't understand

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,840
how hard it is in Hollywood right now.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,420
You have to crank out family dramas

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,090
before they let you make
your dream superhero movie.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,100
Do you have a dream superhero movie?

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,510
I want to remake <i>Spider-Man 2,</i>
the first one.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,060
Or something that at least has a hook.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,810
- ...little girl!
- Oh, God! Damn it.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,020
My brother Buster has something
better than a hook.

25
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,780
A robot hand. Okay?
And there's a cop looking for him.

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,990
- Hmm.
- And they can't find Lucille 2.

27
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,160
And I found Buster in the attic
in scuba gear.

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,120
It's intriguing.
I think that's your movie.

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,660
- That's your guy.
- No.

30
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,620
Okay, I've got his release right here.

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,080
<i>In fact,
it was the only family member's release...</i>

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,540
You're out of the movie.
You're out of the movie.

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,340
<i>- ...he hadn't destroyed.</i>
- You're out of the movie.

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,210
You're out of the movie!
Know what?

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,670
- You're out of the movie.
- Fine.

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,090
Hey, Dad, how ya doing?

37
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,050
- You're out of the movie!
- <i>With Buster,</i>

38
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,760
it is not father-son,
it's more mother-son.

39
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,720
But if you could get Rebel
to play Lucille, you know...

40
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,230
If she could go that unlikable.

41
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,810
So that's his release right here.

42
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,400
These are the other releases.
You need tape,

43
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,020
but they're pretty clean.

44
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,400
You're off the picture, Michael.
I'll give you your 500 bucks.

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,320
- I get paid?
- They're Imagine dollars.

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,990
They're redeemable in the gift shop.

47
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,240
- That's Ron Howard.
- Brian's on the 50.

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,200
It's a severance thing they're doing
because of Ron's need to be loved

49
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,910
and Brian's conflict avoidance issues.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,250
<i>Michael had gotten into something
he wanted no part of.</i>

51
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,130
I'm sure they've got
a very old relationship.

52
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,630
I could tell you stories.

53
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,710
<i>But she wouldn't dare.
And after a quick stop downstairs...</i>

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,300
I think I'm gonna take

55
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,180
one <i>Gung Ho </i>kimono, okay?

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,550
Oh, and maybe a Brian wig. That's fun.

57
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,890
Oh, we only sell these as a set.

58
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,390
They were getting very competitive.

59
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,060
- Were they?
- Brian was.

60
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,480
<i>...and another call to his son...</i>

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,350
<i>You've reached George Maharis.</i>

62
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,730
Did you want that Rebel Alley hair?

63
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,070
Oh. Uh, no no.

64
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,730
That's... that is mine.

65
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,990
- I came with that. Uh, okay.
<i>- ...Michael headed home</i>

66
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,700
<i>to tell Buster his plan
for making the family come back.</i>

67
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,580
I've sent away the fumigator,
and all you got to do,

68
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,410
so we can declare you missing,

69
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,450
is stay out of sight for about 72 hours.

70
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,080
- Milford style.
- Hmm?

71
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,000
- I'm a Milford man, Michael.
- Yeah?

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,790
Winner of 1982's Least Seen on Campus.

73
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,670
I wish I could've seen their faces

74
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,970
- at the ceremony.
- We just,

75
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,340
you know, we gotta play this right
and, uh,

76
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,970
you gotta make sure you don't...

77
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,890
- well, show your hand.
- This is one of only two things

78
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,480
the Army warns us about
when they issue these.

79
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,060
Boy, Kitty does not know
what she's sitting on.

80
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,230
Pal, I'm gonna call you from,
uh, wherever I end up,

81
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,400
and you're gonna be great.

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,490
I-I just don't understand why
I can't go with you, Michael.

83
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,320
It's about teaching them a lesson.

84
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,740
- Mm-hmm.
- So... And I just,

85
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,780
I got in a big fight with my son,
you know.

86
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,450
It was my fault. For so many years,

87
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,910
I was his mom and dad, so...

88
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,250
Maybe that's a role
I can play in your life.

89
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,330
Don't say...

90
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,170
Mom. Mmm.

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,550
I thoughtÂ you were gonna say Dad.

92
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,010
- Mm-mm.
- But, you know,

93
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,380
it's a bummer
that you can't come with me, Buster,

94
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,140
but you need to stay and talk to the cops.

95
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,350
Cops? What cops?

96
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,020
- Why would you bring the cops into this?
- They're already looking for you.

97
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,270
What? The cops are looking for me?

98
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,520
<i>- A </i>cop, actually.
- I can't be talking to the cops.

99
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,690
- Listen.
- I don't do good with the cops.

100
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,230
I didn't do anything.
I don't know what's going on.

101
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,570
- Relax.
- I ain't got no truck with no blue.

102
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,780
Nothing to worry about.

103
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,070
They're looking for Lucille Austero.
They want to question you.

104
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,870
Why would I know anything about Lucille 2?
I hope you didn't say we were dating.

105
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,080
Uh, well, I mean, you...
you did live with her.

106
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,580
Well, I lived with Mother.
Did you think we were dating?

107
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,630
Question's been asked.

108
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,960
- Do you actually know where Lucille 2 is?
- No!

109
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,420
No! A thousand times, no!

110
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,010
Is that what they'll ask?

111
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,010
'Cause it's not like I'm gonna
remember details

112
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,930
about where I saw her
and what we fought about.

113
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,100
Oh, you fought?

114
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,390
You kept me from Mother? You sent her to prison?

115
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,770
Should I not say that?

116
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,980
- I'm not good with the cops.
- Right.

117
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,860
What if Lucille 2 doesn't come back?

118
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,280
Don't worry about that.
She... I just spoke to her today.

119
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,030
- What? In person?
- Yeah. Uh, no.

120
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,160
On the phone. She's fine.

121
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,410
Well, you could've told me that
from the beginning.

122
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,790
This is not about Lucille 2.
This is about teaching Mom

123
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,000
- a lesson, you know.
- Oh.

124
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,580
I mean, she just splits town

125
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,920
and assumes
I'm gonna take care of everything?

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,710
You know, this is just a way to, uh...

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
- Give Mom a little scare.
- Yeah.

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,300
Yeah. Let them race back into town
and save everyone for a change.

129
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,680
There's nothing to worry about.

130
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,640
Just Mama's worst nightmare.
Buster's missing.

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,520
Oh, and his bath has gone cold.

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,480
<i>Buster was on board.</i>

133
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,190
Maybe have a full psych panel
while you're in there, too.

134
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,110
Oh, those things are so easy to beat.

135
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,320
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything,</i>

136
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,870
<i>and the one son who had no choice</i>

137
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,490
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

138
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,170
<i>It's...</i>

139
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,300
<i>Having traveled south of the border,</i>

140
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,220
<i>George Sr.
and his son G.O.B. found themselves</i>

141
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,680
<i>at a Mexican singles bar.</i>

142
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,930
- It's dead.
- Yeah. Second place in a row.

143
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,310
<i>Each looking for an excuse
for their lack of heterosexual vigor.</i>

144
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,430
Where are all the blondes? It's just...

145
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,060
<i>But it wasn't a blonde
G.O.B. was thinking about.</i>

146
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,980
<i>His recent rivalry
with magician Tony Wonder</i>

147
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,280
<i>had blossomed into a kind of friendship...</i>

148
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,110
<i>before contracting into a rivalry again.</i>

149
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,780
Same.

150
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,160
<i>Which suddenly became a...</i>

151
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,450
<i>oh, let's say,
boarding school romance.</i>

152
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,160
Uh, this place is full of...

153
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,670
<i>cincos </i>and <i>mayos.</i>

154
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,670
We need to find out
whatever the word for ten is.

155
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,550
- Find that.
- It's ten.

156
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,630
- Every culture uses ten.
- Ten. <i>It wouldn't matter if it was an 11,</i>

157
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,510
<i>because George Sr., too,
had changed recently...</i>

158
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,640
It blew off at the CVS parking lot.

159
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,230
<i>...having lost all sexual feeling of late</i>

160
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,230
<i>- despite some very progressive therapy.</i>
- Hopi Indians believe that this spot...

161
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,520
- Okay.
- ...when manipulated,

162
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,270
can create sexual feeling.

163
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,230
- That's my penis.
- You don't have to tell me.

164
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,900
<i>Which sent him into his crisis...</i>

165
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,950
I can get hard,
so let's focus on you.

166
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,280
<i>...of masculinity.</i>

167
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,700
Hey, these are from the ladies
across the bar.

168
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,950
- They're <i>primas.</i>
- <i>Primos, </i>huh?

169
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,250
I've gotta be honest, I've seen better.

170
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,960
Huh? Eh.

171
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,210
No, it means cousins.

172
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,380
One hates her father,
and the other hates her grandfather.

173
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,260
<i>It seemed the cervezas</i>

174
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,220
<i>weren't the only thing being handed
to the guys on a platter.</i>

175
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,260
I don't know about you,
but I'd prefer the thrill of the hunt,

176
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,970
- as opposed to...
- If we wait,

177
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,640
something a little better will come along.

178
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,890
Thank you.

179
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,850
Not trying to fall
head over heels here.

180
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,360
Yeah. Yeah.

181
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,400
Not super eager to be, uh,
missing somebody.

182
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,610
- Yeah.
- I mean, who you love.

183
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,370
- Place gives me the creeps. Let's get out.
- Yeah. It's dead.

184
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,120
<i>But back in America,
Michael was working on a way</i>

185
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,210
<i>to make his runaway family return.</i>

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,170
So, we gotta wait about 48 hours
before we declare you missing,

187
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,000
- and then they put out an APB.
- APB.

188
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,500
"Aw, poor Buster."

189
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,630
- That's nice.
- Well...

190
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,340
You gotta lay low long enough
for Mom and Dad to hear about it.

191
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,720
And, pal, I would take you with me,
but truth is, I just,

192
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,640
I don't know if I'm gonna come back.

193
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,650
Oh.

194
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,110
What's so funny?

195
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,650
You always come back to save the family.
We joke about that all the time.

196
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,990
Well, I don't know what the joke is.
I've been trying to do the right thing.

197
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,660
"Hi, I'm Michael,

198
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,080
and I save everyone so I feel special,
even though you don't deserve it.

199
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,620
I'm leaving. I won't be coming back."

200
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,920
- Buster...
- "Oh!

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,710
Look who's back.

202
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,500
I thought we were supposed to go
with a."

203
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,050
"Mmm, you would know, Mother.
You practically invented

204
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,050
when you get sauced!"

205
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,840
"How dare you point that limp

206
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,100
hook at me when I saved you from one!

207
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,730
I can't believe I pushed you
out of my,

208
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,020
you useless freak!"

209
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,310
Covered a lot of ground there.

210
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,270
Yeah.

211
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,400
Although I'm glad
I won't be leaving you alone.

212
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,400
Oh, I'm going with you?

213
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,530
No, I'm going to Mexico or something,

214
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,530
and you gotta go to the police station.

215
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,910
- Oh, right. Why do they arrest me?
- They don't.

216
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,660
You go to the police station
'cause you say,

217
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,500
"Heard you were looking for me.
Here I am."

218
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,500
Oh, but you said a cop had questions
for me.

219
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,670
Mm-hmm. About Lucille 2.

220
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,710
And I'm not gonna answer
any questions, right?

221
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,960
- No. Answer the questions.
- When Barry says it's okay.

222
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,260
Barry's not there. No attorneys.
Just tell the truth.

223
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
Okay, like, bad example,

224
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,100
I saw Lucille 2's lifeless body
sprawled across the stair car?

225
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,270
Perfect.
If that's what happened, tell them.

226
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,020
Nothing to be nervous about, okay?

227
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,860
Lucille 2 is probably gonna be back

228
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,230
from whatever bender she's on.

229
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,400
She's gonna be as dry as, uh...

230
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,030
well, Lucille 1.

231
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,610
I can hear Mother winking now.

232
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,620
So, I got some groceries.
These are gonna have to last.

233
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,990
You already got into the candy bears, huh?

234
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,870
This is literally one of only

235
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,710
two things the Army warns about
when they issue these.

236
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,080
- Let me help.
- I think they spent

237
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,590
$27 million on the wrong guy.

238
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,710
Don't you say that about you. Well...

239
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,420
Maybe you do say that. Maybe that's important to
say. <i>And certain his mother would have to return</i>

240
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,010
<i>to take responsibility
for this particular son,</i>

241
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,060
<i>Michael went to say goodbye to his own.</i>

242
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,520
Ooh.

243
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,400
Hey, I am outside your door.

244
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
I was this close to telling you.
You inside?

245
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,900
<i>Hi, it's Lucille Austero.</i>

246
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,410
- No!
<i>- I've been looking for you.</i>

247
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,490
Note, I mean.

248
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,410
I know, I'd left you a note,

249
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,290
and, can you hear me?

250
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,370
Hello? Hello? Here we go again.

251
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,710
Getting disconnected.

252
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,960
This is why you always... leave a note.

253
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,260
Always leave a note.

254
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,050
Where's that from?

255
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,640
<i>Michael discovered
a note he'd already written.</i>

256
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,510
"Are you avoiding me? Ha ha.

257
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,470
Leaving town for a while. Love you.

258
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,060
- Michael Bluth."
- <i>It worked well.</i>

259
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,270
<i>But perhaps if Michael
had taken a few seconds</i>

260
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,900
<i>to write an original note
before leaving town,</i>

261
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,450
<i>he would've run into George Michael,
who was coming to see him...</i>

262
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,990
<i>only to come across a cousin
he didn't recognize.</i>

263
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,830
- Hey. Know if anyone's home?
- Uh, yeah, Buster's in there.

264
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,580
But if you're looking for Michael,
you just missed him.

265
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,170
Oh, so much for apologizing.

266
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,090
I'm telling you, he's moved on.

267
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,930
- Okay? You should, too.
- I just found out

268
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,590
my dad went to Mexico without telling me.

269
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,760
Welcome
to the shitty parents club.

270
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,600
- No, no, we don't have kids.
- No.

271
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,220
<i>Although there was a kid</i>

272
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,390
<i>that Maeby was eager to get away from.</i>

273
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,190
You know,
Mexico sounds far from Perfecto.

274
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,770
So that's perfect.
What do you say? Screw it!

275
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,400
No rules. Anything goes.

276
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,950
<i>A rebounding George Michael
found the offer intriguing.</i>

277
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,950
- Just the cousins.
- Mm-hmm.

278
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,370
<i>Which turned out to be...</i>

279
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,120
<i>- Primos!
- ...this crew.</i>

280
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,250
- Why do you keep yelling that?
- Stop it.

281
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,540
Ah.

282
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,250
<i>Not far away,
Michael was also heading to Mexico.</i>

283
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,590
<i>And after taking care
of one last bit of business...</i>

284
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,840
<i>It's Buster Bluth, that's right.</i>

285
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,640
<i>Uh, yeah, I'm completely sure
he's been gone 72 hours.</i>

286
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,430
<i>As a matter of fact,
his bath has grown cold.</i>

287
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,020
<i>So that's, uh, an alarm bell right there.</i>

288
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,730
<i>...Michael was ready
to hit bottom</i>

289
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>- and go off the map.</i>
- <i>Thanks so much.</i>

290
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,690
<i>But that's hard to do</i>

291
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,110
<i>when you're driving a car
that makes maps.</i>

292
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,650
No pictures, thank you!

293
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,490
Put your phones down.
We take the pictures.

294
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,280
<i>When the fleet
of recovery vans arrived</i>

295
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,030
<i>from the search engine
Michael had been working for,</i>

296
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,200
<i>he discovered that the car
that takes the pictures</i>

297
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,460
<i>- was no longer under his control.</i>
- No! Window up.

298
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,210
- Window...
- Hi, I'm Dave from Mapping.

299
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,670
She's Lisa from Traditional Search.

300
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,550
- And that's Jeff.
- I'm Jeff from Earth.

301
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,420
- Hi. Hi, guys.
- We heard we had a runaway ostrich,

302
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,550
and, uh, we need you to return the car.

303
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,510
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Am I under arrest?

304
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,850
Oh, no. They never arrest the drivers.

305
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,730
They do come down pretty hard
on the cars,

306
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,060
but it's cheaper to just retrain
the people instead.

307
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,110
It sounds super futuristic and dystopian,
but it's really not.

308
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,360
<i>Earth was right.</i>

309
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,980
<i>Because once he had been
escorted back</i>

310
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,650
<i>to the impressive campus
of company headquarters,</i>

311
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,990
<i>Michael found himself settling into a new</i>

312
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,620
<i>and generally carefree life,</i>

313
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,290
<i>one that couldn't have been farther</i>

314
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,160
<i>from the bottom
he'd forgotten about hitting.</i>

315
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,330
<i>Ironically, Michael's son</i>

316
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,210
<i>had also experienced car troubles
in Mexico,</i>

317
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,630
<i>and he wandered across
his grandfather's deserted land</i>

318
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,220
<i>hoping to find a spare tire...</i>

319
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,840
Can't believe
you didn't know who I was.

320
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,970
<i>- ...and lose a third wheel.</i>
- Well, there's nothing we can say.

321
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,680
I wouldn't blame you if you took off
and you don't come back.

322
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,020
Nah.

323
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,310
<i>Primos </i>stick together.

324
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,440
Oh. "Cousin." It means "cousins."

325
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,650
That makes sense.

326
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,280
<i>But the land proved
not to be deserted, after all.</i>

327
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,950
<i>And as the menacing horsemen
descended on the travelers,</i>

328
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,490
<i>George Michael found himself tempted</i>

329
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,410
<i>to bring up his dust allergies...</i>

330
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,540
- We got a lot of dust.
<i>- ...but hinted at them instead.</i>

331
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,580
<i>And they would soon discover...</i>

332
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,500
You are not welcome here.

333
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,050
Oh, so sorry, we j... Our car broke down.

334
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,590
We thought we might
find somebody we know.

335
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,340
My grandfather owns this land.

336
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,720
That is not what the sign says.

337
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,020
âª <i>Mr. </i>Efe<i>Â </i>âª

338
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,140
I am the elder here. This is our land.

339
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,650
And you would be wise to never
be seen here again. Strum!

340
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,400
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we must say buenos dÃ­as.

341
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,030
<i>- Vamos, vamos.</i>
- Play the guitar, old man!

342
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,450
Strum! Strum!

343
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,660
<i>And George Michael asked
the question anyone might.</i>

344
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,580
Who were those scary, handsome Mexicans

345
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,960
on those magical horses?

346
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,750
They just looked like old white men to me.

347
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,880
Oh.

348
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,630
We should probably get out of here.

349
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,380
Yeah, I mean,
I've got a big job on Monday, anyway.

350
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,760
I was gonna have to leave early,
and I didn't know how to tell you.

351
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,260
But now we can just all go together.

352
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,600
<i>And that's when he saw his opening.</i>

353
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,520
Never.

354
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,600
Never. Are you...?

355
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,190
No. I mean, we're Bluths.

356
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,860
We're gonna stay. Maeby, too. We're...

357
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,320
The two of us are gonna stay.

358
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,820
<i>And soon,
being with his cousin was no longer</i>

359
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,910
<i>- an obstacle...</i>
- Crazy asshole.

360
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,700
<i>...to George Michael's hope
of being with his cousin.</i>

361
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,200
I was wondering how you were
gonna get rid of him.

362
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,410
- Was I that obvious?
- I just know that you don't like

363
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,580
standing up to people
on horses with guns.

364
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,920
No, I never really was that guy.

365
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,420
- Let's find a bar.
- Okay. Yeah, I'd love that.

366
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,750
<i>And so, after getting out
of their dusty clothes,</i>

367
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,000
<i>the two did just that.</i>

368
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,800
<i>And George Michael</i>

369
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,130
<i>was soon getting a real feel
for the people.</i>

370
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,970
Hey. You're not gonna believe this.

371
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,180
I met these guys that are actually
from Orange County. And two of them also go to UCI.

372
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,350
Two of them are named Noah,
but not the two that you'd think.

373
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,310
- Cool?
- Really cool.

374
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,230
They're staying here, renting a place
while they do this language course.

375
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,560
We could stay with them.

376
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,570
I'm thinking about heading back.

377
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,650
N... Wait, look.

378
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,240
If this is about me firing you
from Fakeblock,

379
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,700
there's something you should know.

380
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,700
Fakeblock doesn't actually exist.

381
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,410
Are you telling me that the software

382
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,080
that's supposed to keep
people's computers unhackable

383
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,590
and keep any kind of information private
doesn't exist?

384
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,210
How did you find out?

385
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,090
It was easy. I just looked in
your computer under "Secrets."

386
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,180
Oh, you looked
in my "Please Don't Read" folder?

387
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,140
No, that one was empty.
I found it in "Just Odds and Ends."

388
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,810
Great, you got past my double bluff.

389
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,600
It's okay, George Michael.
You worry too much.

390
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,810
Yeah, that keeps me up at night, actually.

391
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,110
I just feel like I gotta move on
with my life, you know?

392
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,610
Find some meaning.

393
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,860
Get going with my own goop.

394
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,610
Goop? What is goop?

395
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,120
If you have to ask,
you probably don't know what it is.

396
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,660
I don't know what it is.

397
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,620
I feel like maybe
you don't know what it is.

398
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,080
Maybe it's "go-op"?

399
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,210
To me, that would make less sense. Maybe that's what "go-op" is.

400
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,380
Not everything always making sense.

401
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,550
<i>It isn't.</i>

402
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,760
<i>Meanwhile,
George Sr. and G.O.B. continued trying</i>

403
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,260
<i>to out-goop each other.</i>

404
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,010
I won't tell Mom
about all the ladies you're

405
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,140
if you don't tell Mom
about all the ladies I'm.

406
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look at that one coming up.

407
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,600
Where, where? Oh, my God.

408
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,060
Oh, she's hot. She's so hot. Dibs!

409
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,940
No, no, no, Daddy saw her first.

410
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,780
- Daddy dibs.
- She got a friend or...?

411
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,280
She's got a friend! That's a friend?

412
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,240
<i>Bush. Trash bag and bush.</i>

413
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,620
- Thought it was a woman.
- Yeah.

414
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,080
- Like, hunched over, right?
- Yeah.

415
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,960
Like, with the...
I wanted to do her so bad.

416
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,880
Wow. I mean, I...
And I really liked her friend.

417
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,090
Me, I liked her, too.

418
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,220
- That was a ten-gallon Hefty sack?
- Oh, yeah.

419
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,220
- Yeah, a ten. Definitely a ten.
- Yeah. Yeah. Nice.

420
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,260
I like.

421
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,600
I like... a ten.

422
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,480
<i>And Lucille, at the behest of
her court-mandated therapist,</i>

423
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,230
<i>- was struggling to make sense of things.</i>
- Am I horrible for saying these things?

424
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,070
No. But I was doing the math,
and I still think

425
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,070
you're gonna have a problem
with this final "raped murderer."

426
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,870
But who cares about him?

427
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,160
Oh, this is pointless.

428
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,500
How many more sessions
do I have to endure

429
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,710
until I'm done with...

430
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,040
no offense... you?

431
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,920
Legally, two. But I am in the family.

432
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,010
I mean... this is my family.

433
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,060
My daughter is divorcing you.
This is it.

434
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm confused by the word "it."

435
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,520
Are you implying that you
don't want to see me anymore?

436
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm confused by the word "anymore."

437
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,270
There are many things
I can do for this family.

438
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,530
You've lost touch with your daughter.
Put me in, for God sakes.

439
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,320
- I thought this was <i>my </i>time.
- It is your time. Yes, yes.

440
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,410
But as your therapist,
I'm pointing out that I know

441
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,620
that you build these walls
to keep out, for instance,

442
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,620
your surviving children-in-law.

443
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, don't talk to me about walls.

444
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,040
That's why we're in this mess.

445
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,340
My husband buys land
so we can get a contract

446
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,380
to build a little something on the border.

447
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,920
A-a wall.

448
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,010
And we did everything right.

449
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,470
<i>Well, not everything.</i>

450
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,430
<i>They did buy land on the border...</i>

451
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,810
- You live here?
<i>- ...to sell back to the government.</i>

452
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,270
- The check.
- <i>And they paid off</i>

453
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,350
<i>- a politician...</i>
- I am gonna put this on my <i>wall.</i>

454
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,520
<i>...to stir up xenophobia.</i>

455
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,110
We have got to build a wall
between us and Mexico.

456
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,980
- Yeah, yeah.
- <i>Of course, they made</i>

457
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,400
<i>- a few rookie mistakes.</i>
- I bribed Love to get the wall,

458
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,950
and I don't have the land to build it on!

459
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,030
<i>Well, they had it.</i>

460
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,330
<i>It was just on the wrong side
of the border.</i>

461
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,790
<i>Which they might have known
had George's brother Oscar</i>

462
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,830
<i>- not burned the signs.</i>
- It's okay to burn these?

463
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,250
Well, this is America.
They don't want us to burn signs,

464
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,920
they shouldn't write 'em in Spanish.

465
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,760
<i>And so, Lucille did
what her own government might do.</i>

466
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,630
Who better than the Chinese
to help us build a wall, right?

467
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,220
- <i>She borrowed from the Chinese.</i>
- That's good enough.

468
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,100
<i>Of course, none of this</i>

469
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,560
<i>- was okay with the woman...</i>
- How dare you?!

470
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,310
<i>- ...who owned a majority stake...</i>
- Lucille...

471
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,350
<i>- ...in the company.</i>
- ...Two

472
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,940
I can't be running a company
that's building a wall

473
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,230
I campaigned against!

474
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,570
<i>And with their politician
out of the race,</i>

475
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,280
<i>their future looked bleak.</i>

476
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,150
So, unless some angel descends
on a golden chariot,

477
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,700
we're completely over-leveraged.

478
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,700
And maybe you don't want
to get hurt because,

479
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,330
as I say, hurt people... hurt people.

480
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,080
Oh, that's nice.

481
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,300
I always say,
"Make people cry, make people cry."

482
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,010
But yours includes the people

483
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,380
who don't want to give you
the satisfaction. <i>Tobias decided to err on the side</i>

484
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,350
<i>of Lucille keeping him on as a therapist.</i>

485
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,310
You know what, let's lock that in there.

486
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,890
And I'd say we've made
some real good progress today.

487
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,810
Yes.
I really think this is working.

488
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,940
Swimming!

489
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,360
Hurt people, hurt people.

490
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,740
<i>Lindsay had also made it to Mexico,</i>

491
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,780
<i>and was enjoying the fact that
men were more respectful.</i>

492
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,280
<i>Puta </i>Night is Thursday.

493
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,000
- That's so nice. No, I'm not.
- <i>That was based on her belief</i>

494
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,290
<i>- that </i>"puta" <i>meant "young."</i>
- No. <i>Puta.</i>

495
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,330
I try to stay out of the sun.

496
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,170
<i>And that's when she saw
what appeared to be</i>

497
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,090
<i>- a Mexican version of her father.</i>
- Oh, my God.

498
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,340
Lindsay. What are you doing here?

499
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,140
Guess I just had to get away.

500
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,060
I was just ordering lunch.
Can I buy you lunch?

501
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,220
Oh, yeah. I'm so hungry, I could eat.

502
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,810
<i>Lindsay's daughter, meanwhile,</i>

503
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,890
<i>discovered that her trip back home...</i>

504
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,190
- This is as far as we go.
<i>- ...took a detour.</i>

505
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
Oh.

506
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,360
- You live here?
- No.

507
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,820
These people have nothing.

508
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,990
We are lucky. We have next to nothing.

509
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,530
We are helping these people
because nobody else will.

510
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,540
They've been kicked out
of the only country they've ever known

511
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,540
because of the cruelty
of your president...

512
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,540
Barack Obama.

513
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,080
Their old country is their mother,

514
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,750
new country is their father.

515
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,960
Imagine if your mother
and your father did not want you.

516
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,760
So, you're trying to, like,
teach them a lesson or...?

517
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,970
We're volunteers.

518
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,630
Who did you think the water was for?

519
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,550
Oh.
I thought you were just trying to get me

520
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,600
to give you a higher Uber rating.

521
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,980
<i>And Maeby decided to stay
and help.</i>

522
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,570
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
settled into a different kind</i>

523
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,440
<i>of "south of the border" lifestyle.</i>

524
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,700
Mexico.

525
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,860
It's like being in the Spanish dorms

526
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,910
of the UCI sister campus
in Spain all over again.

527
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,950
<i>He was noticing subtle differences
in the cuisine.</i>

528
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,580
God, the salt is different here.

529
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,960
It's fatter or something, right?

530
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,170
- We're from Orange County.
- <i>He reached out to locals.</i>

531
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,000
Dude, I'm from San Diego.
They want everyone to think we're Mexican.

532
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,510
- My name's Noah.
- <i>He met another Noah.</i>

533
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,180
- Noah, get over here.
- <i>Noah met another Noah.</i>

534
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,720
- What up, dawg?
- <i>And soon five,</i>

535
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,010
<i>I want to say,
indistinguishable Americans</i>

536
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,770
<i>- had Mexico on its heels.</i>
- You didn't know this was Noah?

537
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,690
- <i>They saw foreign films.</i>
- I'm glad someone had the guts

538
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,060
to give the Minions their own movie.

539
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,570
It's great
because it's subtitled in Spanish,

540
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,530
but we don't have to read.
It's in English.

541
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,570
If you don't want to see 'em,
you can block 'em.

542
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,650
<i>Started trends.</i>

543
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,500
<i>They discovered
charming native communities...</i>

544
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,500
<i>where local artisans
peddled their wares.</i>

545
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,630
- Mexico.
- <i>Adopted customs</i>

546
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,880
<i>like the midday break, or siesta.</i>

547
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,090
Yes! Who left the air conditioning on?

548
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,430
- Oh, me. I never left.
- <i>And while George Michael</i>

549
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,810
<i>- was enjoying his status quo...</i>
- <i>Why'd we go out?</i>

550
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,390
<i>...Lucille was on the verge
of an emotional breakthrough</i>

551
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,270
<i>that could possibly change her life.</i>

552
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,520
...and our whole life
is turned upside down.

553
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,940
This is my time. Your session ended.

554
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,150
<i>That's when she heard something...</i>

555
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,900
<i>...that would definitely change her life.</i>

556
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,450
<i>...candidate descended
the escalator intoÂ the lobby.</i>

557
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,870
<i>I will build a great, great wall
on our southern border.</i>

558
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,910
Which was my idea!

559
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,290
And I will have Mexico pay
for that wall.

560
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,460
Okay.

561
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,500
That is a clever twist.

562
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,260
<i>Michael had been
at Search for a month.</i>

563
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,220
<i>In that time,
he'd developed himself physically...</i>

564
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,350
And then lunge.
Duck, sweep the leg, lunge.

565
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,100
<i>...been given a new company car.</i>

566
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,100
Ted, I think you see your daughter coming.

567
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,770
You're not expecting this,
but she's coming in hot

568
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,980
- with a right...
- <i>He'd gotten to teach a class</i>

569
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,230
<i>he'd successfully persuaded management
to try out.</i>

570
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,450
Mona, I know your husband's down,
he probably needs medical attention,

571
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,490
but you got another son on your flank.

572
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,080
And, everybody, we're going to duck,
sweep the leg, and lunge.

573
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,370
And he comes back again.
And we sweep the leg and lunge.

574
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,250
That's great.
Everybody put down your cactus.

575
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,420
Let's all huddle up.
Okay, now that you're loose,

576
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,080
we're gonna do some Mom Attacks Son,

577
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,960
we're gonna do Dad Attacks Daughter,

578
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,130
and then we're gonna do
Dad Attacks Mom...

579
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,880
<i>But he still felt something
was missing from his life</i>

580
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,220
<i>- when he found a way to satisfy a dream.</i> 
- Wow, satisfy an old dream. Boy, do you really have to spend 1,000 bucks on the gear, though?

581
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
- Not if you have your own.
- Mm.

582
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,810
Yeah. Yeah, well, not here,

583
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,230
but I could drive home and get it.

584
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,860
Course, I could see my family.

585
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,860
<i>A family Michael hadn't seen
in some time.</i>

586
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,150
<i>So he decided...</i>

587
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,530
Ah, what the heck.
For 1,000 bucks, it's worth the risk, huh?

588
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,250
<i>Michael returned
to a model home he left in some disgrace.</i>

589
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,580
<i>And he wasn't particularly
proud of what he did next.</i>

590
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,790
Hola. Window cleaner!

591
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,880
<i>I shall be neither seen
nor heard.</i>

592
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,640
- <i>I blue myself.</i>
- <i>It's vodka.</i>

593
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,680
<i>It goes bad once it's opened.</i>

594
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
<i>I heard the jury's still out
on science.</i>

595
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,890
- <i>It was an emotional moment.</i>
- <i>Window cleaner!</i>

596
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,270
<i>Until right at the end there.</i>

597
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,570
<i>And that's when he found
a letter from Lucille 2.</i>

598
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,910
She forgave the debt.

599
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,580
<i>And feeling bad
that he'd been forgiven by someone</i>

600
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,040
<i>he wanted to forget,
he decided to thank her in person.</i>

601
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,420
<i>But, tired of hiding, he decided</i>

602
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,050
<i>- to say hello to his own family.</i>
- Hello?

603
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,640
<i>Speech! Speech!</i>

604
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,850
<i>You're my third
least favorite child.</i>

605
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,310
<i>...like a Motherboy Ball.</i>

606
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,480
<i>And when they weren't home,
he found himself missing them.</i>

607
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,150
<i>I should ask if she wants
to get pre-pre-engaged.</i>

608
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,150
- Lucille 2?
- <i>I want that pie covered.</i>

609
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,610
<i>- And not with your face.</i>
- Hello?

610
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,450
- Told you he'd come!
- Hey!

611
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,580
It's on, it's on, it's on.

612
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,700
- Look at him fighting me!
- G.O.B.!

613
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,750
- I haven't seen you in a year!
- It's been two months. Get your hands off.

614
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,540
Oh, yeah? What's the last thing
you remember us doing?

615
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,920
- What do you remember?
- What? No.

616
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,430
- Enough!
- <i>Michael Bluth - gets up.</i> - A lot of hands down there.

617
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
- They weren't my hands.
- Oh. Okay.

618
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,930
Harmless bathhousing
amongst brothers, yes?

619
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,350
<i>And George Michael dips his toe</i>

620
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,150
<i>- into the Mexican nightlife.</i>
- Guys, it's 9:00.

621
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,230
Gives us 30 minutes till they shut down
that last machine at Pinkberry.
