00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,290
(narrator) North Field, on the island
of Tinian, in the Marianas,

3
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:12,511
1500 miles south of Japan.

4
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:21,567
In the summer of 1945 this was
the biggest air base in the world.

5
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:24,520
Here, on August 5,

6
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:28,205
the world's first uranium bomb
was loaded into a B-29 bomber -

7
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:32,269
named Enola Gay
after its pilot's mother.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,484
Next morning, before dawn,
the Enola Gay took off.

9
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,938
Its target - Hiroshima.

10
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,540
On April 12, 1945,

11
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:51,946
Franklin Roosevelt, President
of the United States, died suddenly.

12
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,162
The nation mourned its lost leader.

13
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,062
He had brought them from the depths
of economic depression 12 years before,

14
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:11,476
now he had led them
to the eve of victory in a world war.

15
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,075
Two months before his death,
Roosevelt had been at Yalta, in Russia,

16
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:21,794
laying the political foundations
of the post-war world.

17
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:26,055
Roosevelt and Churchill wanted
to restore democracy to Eastern Europe,

18
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:28,196
particularly Poland.

19
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:32,690
They also asked Stalin to confirm that
Russia would join the war against Japan

20
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:35,875
three months
after the defeat of Germany.

21
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,907
In a cheerful atmosphere,

22
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:42,243
the "big three" thought
they had reached agreement.

23
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,582
(man) Yalta was really
the high point of the relationship

24
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,193
between the three men.

25
00:02:47,272 --> 00:02:50,829
Victory was in the air,
the Germans were in retreat,

26
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,982
and so there was a good deal more talk,

27
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:58,088
in addition to military matters,
of the future.

28
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,234
Poland again became

29
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,839
the most troublesome point.

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,796
And it's interesting that

31
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:07,677
both Roosevelt and Churchill

32
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:10,124
felt they had an agreement with Stalin.

33
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:14,962
(narrator) The problem with Poland -
as with all Eastern Europe -

34
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:19,148
was that the Western leaders wanted
a freely elected government there.

35
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:23,482
The Soviets wanted a government
friendly to Russia.

36
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:27,588
They thought the West
understood and accepted this.

37
00:03:28,395 --> 00:03:33,338
Poland, from their point of view, was
not going to be an outpost of the West -

38
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,558
nor any of the Balkan countries.

39
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:39,480
They thought they'd had
various agreements

40
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:42,886
about spheres of influence
with Mr Churchill -

41
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,650
if they left Greece
pretty much in British hands,

42
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:49,415
they could have certain
proportional influences

43
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:53,705
in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria,
particularly Poland.

44
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:59,541
My impression at Yalta

45
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,572
was that the Russians thought

46
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:08,319
we had in substance
accepted that demand.

47
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:13,233
(narrator) After Yalta,
Roosevelt lived for only two months.

48
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:17,227
Even by then, he and Churchill
had become disillusioned

49
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:21,676
by the interpretations the Russians
were putting on what was agreed there.

50
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:25,476
The very, very tough exchange
of telegrams on both sides

51
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:27,310
between Stalin and Roosevelt

52
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:30,308
makes it very plain
that Roosevelt, before he died,

53
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:32,722
knew that Stalin
was breaking his agreements.

54
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:35,946
I think it went sour because

55
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:38,318
the military developments

56
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,620
strengthened Russia's hands

57
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:45,033
and that where
the Russians had felt it necessary

58
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,566
to be considerate of Western opinion
at Yalta,

59
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:51,670
a few months later
they didn't feel any such necessity

60
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:54,243
because the war was going so well
for them,

61
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:58,466
and therefore they swept aside
some of the engagements they'd got into.

62
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:02,025
That certainly applied
particularly about Poland.

63
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:06,437
(narrator) Roosevelt had been seen
as a friend by the Russians.

64
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:09,361
His successor, Harry Truman,
was an unknown quantity -

65
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,851
both to them and to his own advisers.

66
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:18,182
I left, as soon as Roosevelt died,
to go back to see Mr Truman.

67
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:20,477
I wanted to be sure
that President Truman

68
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:23,205
understood the position
of our relationships,

69
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:26,845
because there had been
so much euphoria in the air

70
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:32,868
about the warm relationships
that existed with our gallant allies.

71
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:38,968
And I got home within a week
of the time Roosevelt had died.

72
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:42,928
I found, my first experience
with President Truman,

73
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:45,145
I found he was an avid reader.

74
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:48,100
I found he'd read all the telegrams

75
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:53,051
and understood from those messages
the difficulties we were going to have.

76
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:57,503
(narrator) The arrival
of their foreign minister, Molotov,

77
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,948
in Washington on April 23 gave Truman
a chance to prove, as he put it,

78
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:04,325
that he would
"stand up to the Russians".

79
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:08,209
(newsreel) Even as his arrival raised
hopes on the thorny Polish question,

80
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:12,039
the world learned that Russia had
signed a 20-year pact of friendship

81
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,923
with Poland's Warsaw government.

82
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:16,872
This Polish government
had no pro-Western members.

83
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,450
They were all pro-Soviet.

84
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:22,129
The Western leaders
were angry and upset.

85
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:26,958
Molotov saw Truman and his secretary of
state, Stettinius - Alger Hiss's boss.

86
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:29,184
By that time...

87
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:35,823
the Polish situation
had, to use a gentle word, crystallised.

88
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:38,628
The Russians were moving forward.

89
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:44,457
They seemed to be paying no attention
to the kind of provisional government

90
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:49,093
that the British and Americans
had hoped for.

91
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:58,038
Therefore protests - angry protests -
were going to the Russians about that.

92
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:03,366
And Truman decided to have a showdown,
at which he was gifted.

93
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:10,006
On that occasion, as you know from
what is now part of the history books,

94
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:14,295
he accused Molotov, in effect,

95
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:16,183
of violation of the agreements,

96
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:17,485
as early as that.

97
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:21,823
This was a strange thing to do in
the midst of a war, by no means yet won,

98
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:25,077
with an important ally - but he did it.

99
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,531
And it ended by Molotov saying:

100
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:32,101
"I've never been talked to like this
in my life",

101
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:35,783
and Truman saying: "Well, keep
your agreements and you won't be" -

102
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,200
just like a schoolteacher.

103
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:43,421
Stettinius, who'd been present, told me
the next morning - he was still shaken -

104
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:46,331
he said, "I thought
the whole conference was off."

105
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:50,365
Well, that was
an unfortunate conversation.

106
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:55,772
It was one of the first diplomatic
conversations that Truman had,

107
00:07:55,852 --> 00:08:02,410
and I can only say that it was not
a diplomatic statement on Truman's part.

108
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:06,667
He used good, solid Missouri language,
which was very definite,

109
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:10,004
and Molotov had talked
to other people that way,

110
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:12,921
but had had no one
talk to him that way.

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,756
So he was very much upset,

112
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,358
and I gained the impression that
he thought this was a new voice,

113
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:23,885
not Roosevelt any more,
but a more aggressive president.

114
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,691
(narrator) When he was sworn in,

115
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,718
Truman had said he would continue
Roosevelt's policies.

116
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,755
But his sudden harshness with Molotov

117
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,399
now worried the secretary of war,
Henry Stimson.

118
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,206
The day after the confrontation,

119
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:39,581
Stimson told Truman about something
he thought could transform

120
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:41,417
America's dealings with Russia.

121
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:44,601
Stimson's biographer, McGeorge Bundy.

122
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:47,599
Stimson wrote to Truman,

123
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,853
"I think it is very important
that I should have a talk with you

124
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:54,775
as soon as possible
on a highly secret matter."

125
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:57,874
"I mentioned it to you
shortly after you took office,

126
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,444
but have not urged it since on account
of the pressure you've been under."

127
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:06,507
"It, however, has such a bearing
on our present foreign relations

128
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:11,457
and has such an important effect
upon all my thinking in this field,

129
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:16,673
that I think you ought to know about it
without much further delay."

130
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:22,616
The next day, April 25,
Stimson explained to Truman

131
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:25,802
that his view of foreign policy -
Stimson's -

132
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:30,911
was dominated by
the imminent prospect of atomic power,

133
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:33,935
and the terms which might be got
from Russia

134
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:36,895
in exchange for sharing atomic secrets.

135
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:41,221
(narrator) It was Truman's first
detailed news of the atomic bomb

136
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,796
and its diplomatic potential.

137
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,708
He asked Stimson to head a committee
to decide its military use.

138
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:53,536
By this time, in great secrecy, two
kinds of atomic bomb had been developed,

139
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:59,373
one based on uranium, the other
on a man-made element, plutonium.

140
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,011
The uranium bomb did not need testing -
but there was only one.

141
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:07,041
The plutonium bombs -
easier to produce in quantity -

142
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:09,111
would have to be tested before use.

143
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:11,652
The first would be ready by July.

144
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:14,410
A special unit
of the American Air Force

145
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:16,750
had begun practising
the tactics involved

146
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:20,235
in dropping one very large bomb,
with great accuracy,

147
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:22,351
then getting away as fast as possible.

148
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:26,229
Its commander was Colonel Paul Tibbets.

149
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,757
(Tibbets) Up to this point,

150
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:32,401
anything in the way of an error
in bombing up to 500 or 600 feet

151
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,588
was considered good bombing.

152
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:38,302
So I told them then: "If you have
a 100-foot error from 25,000 feet,

153
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,146
you're just a borderline case."

154
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:42,446
"I want it less than 100."

155
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,403
I was told immediately,
"You can't do this."

156
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:49,393
So I said, "I don't know why not."
They said, "Nobody's ever done it."

157
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:51,888
I said, "That's no reason
why it can't be done."

158
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,426
"Practice, they tell me, makes perfect."

159
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:57,415
"So we'll practise and you'll practise
until you do it."

160
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:09,607
(narrator) From their forward bases
in the Mariana Islands,

161
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:12,945
American B-29 bombers
were already attacking Japan's cities

162
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:15,060
with more conventional weapons.

163
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,239
To begin with, the results were poor.

164
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:26,758
General Curtis LeMay developed a new
tactic: low-level incendiary raids.

165
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:31,788
(LeMay) With aerial photography
you could outline a general area,

166
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,550
but not precisely.

167
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:38,193
You just couldn't avoid
doing collateral damage,

168
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:41,906
and I'm sure we burned down
a lot of Japanese buildings

169
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:47,591
that had nothing to do
with the war industry at all.

170
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:53,731
This, of course, is one of the sad
things of war that can't be helped.

171
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:59,669
(narrator) On March 9, 1945, 2,000 tons
of incendiaries were dropped on Tokyo,

172
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:02,592
destroying 16 square miles of the city.

173
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:06,042
80,000 civilians died -

174
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:10,334
more that night in Tokyo than
in the whole of England in the Blitz.

175
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,709
Most suffocated in the firestorm.

176
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,667
LeMay now attacked city after city.

177
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:19,200
It looked as if the B-29s alone
might defeat Japan.

178
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,838
(LeMay) It wasn't until
General Arnold asked the direct question

179
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:24,573
"How long will the war last?",

180
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:27,641
and then we sat down
and did some thinking about it,

181
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:32,435
and it indicated that we would be

182
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:35,920
pretty much out of targets
around 1 September,

183
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:37,916
and with the targets gone,

184
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:42,639
we couldn't see much of any war
going on at the time.

185
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,306
(narrator) By the spring of 1945

186
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:57,101
Japan was helpless in the face
of American air and naval power.

187
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:02,244
Most of the Japanese merchant fleet
and navy had been sunk.

188
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:08,262
An effective blockade had cut off Japan
from her overseas army,

189
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:11,029
grounded most of her air force
for lack of fuel,

190
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:14,326
and threatened her population
with starvation.

191
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:20,233
American fighter-bombers roamed at will,
backing up the devastating fire raids.

192
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:24,069
Many Japanese politicians realised

193
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:27,866
that their country
could not hold out much longer.

194
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:35,534
April 1: American troops
land on Japanese soil -

195
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:39,799
Okinawa, only 350 miles
from the mainland.

196
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,367
They face fierce resistance.

197
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,743
But as the battle starts,
the growing peace party in Japan

198
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:51,689
secure the appointment of a new cabinet,
led by Admiral Suzuki.

199
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:57,096
When the Suzuki cabinet
came into existence,

200
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:01,354
the military situation was deplorable,

201
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:08,716
and, moreover, the economic plight
of our nation was quite apparent.

202
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,018
The military command...

203
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:19,578
tried to squeeze the last drop,
so to speak, of the nation's blood,

204
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:24,139
in order to prosecute harder
the useless war,

205
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:29,288
but it became evident
to any sensible man

206
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,923
that we were at the end of our tether.

207
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:36,072
(speaks Japanese)

208
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:41,333
(translator) The younger officers
in the army, the extremists,

209
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:44,357
thought that we should fight
to the bitter end,

210
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:46,504
until every man had been killed.

211
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:51,650
But the war minister, General Anami,
didn't agree.

212
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,018
He thought that if we fought on
until the Americans invaded the mainland

213
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,507
and then hit their forces hard
on the beaches once,

214
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:04,810
we could then negotiate peace
on terms more favourable to Japan.

215
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:10,560
(narrator)
But Truman would not negotiate.

216
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:13,670
He told Congress so in May,
after Germany's defeat.

217
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:20,187
(newsreel) Our demand has been,
and it remains, unconditional surrender.

218
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:26,437
I want the entire world to know

219
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:33,726
that this direction must and will remain
unchanged and unhampered.

220
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:39,982
(narrator) Truman now faced
two major problems:

221
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,357
how to deal with the Russians in Europe,

222
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:46,852
and whether to ask them to fulfil their
pledge to join the war against Japan.

223
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:51,602
In Germany, Russian and Western troops
exchanged toasts,

224
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,864
but already Churchill was sending
urgent messages to Truman

225
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,398
warning that an iron curtain was being
drawn down in Europe by Russia.

226
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:01,235
The "big three"
must meet quickly before, as he put it,

227
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:03,888
"the armies of democracy melted".

228
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,679
And Truman had a new secretary of state,
James Byrnes.

229
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,291
Byrnes wanted to finish the war
against Japan

230
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,202
before the Russians could join in

231
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:16,386
and cause problems
for the West in Asia, too.

232
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:19,951
It was ever-present in my mind

233
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,633
that it was important

234
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:30,971
that we should have an end to the war
before the Russians came in.

235
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:33,034
(narrator) But Stimson wanted to avoid

236
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,182
hasty decisions in Europe
or the Far East

237
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:38,258
before the bomb was ready.
He wrote to Truman:

238
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:41,474
"Over any such tangled weave
of problems,

239
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,312
the atomic secret would be dominant."

240
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:50,568
"It seems a terrible thing to gamble
with such big stakes in diplomacy

241
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:54,371
without having your master card
in your hand."

242
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,661
Truman reassured Stimson -

243
00:16:57,748 --> 00:17:02,538
the "big three" meeting was postponed
until July 15

244
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:05,025
on purpose "to give us more time".

245
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:08,866
(narrator) Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt's
close friend whom Stalin trusted,

246
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,172
was sent to Moscow in May

247
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:13,734
to take the heat temporarily
out of the Polish issue.

248
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:17,150
He reported back
that he had smoothed things over.

249
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,182
Stalin had also promised - unprompted -

250
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,874
to join the war against Japan
on August 8.

251
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:25,134
While Hopkins was in Moscow,

252
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:28,740
Stimson's committee
reached its decision.

253
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:31,352
The committee studying the atomic bomb

254
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:37,485
unanimously recommended that it be used
as soon as possible, without warning,

255
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:41,320
against a major
Japanese military establishment.

256
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:44,087
Only this, Stimson thought,

257
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:49,229
would provide the psychological blow
which might induce Japan to surrender.

258
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:52,296
Although he agreed
with some of Truman's advisers

259
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,742
that the Japanese
should be given an ultimatum

260
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,126
which made it clear
they could keep the emperor,

261
00:17:58,206 --> 00:18:04,567
he opposed announcing this until
after the bomb had at least been tested.

262
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,451
But after the war he wrote,

263
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:10,633
"It is possible,
in the light of the final surrender,

264
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:14,116
that a clearer and earlier exposition

265
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:17,683
of American willingness
to retain the emperor

266
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:21,142
could have produced
an earlier ending of the war."

267
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,211
(narrator) June 18: Washington.

268
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:30,308
General Eisenhower is given a hero's
welcome after his victory in Europe.

269
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:32,377
In the White House that day,

270
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:35,714
Truman is asked to approve
his joint chiefs of staff's plans

271
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,830
to invade Japan in November.

272
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:41,049
We gathered up our papers
and started to go out,

273
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:43,271
and Mr Truman spotted me and said:

274
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,310
"Mr McCloy, nobody gets out of this room

275
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,224
without expressing himself -

276
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,574
everybody else has."

277
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:50,375
"Do you think I have

278
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:52,713
any other alternative?"

279
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:57,235
I looked over at Colonel Stimson -
he liked to be called Colonel -

280
00:18:57,321 --> 00:19:00,038
he'd been colonel of a regiment
in World War I,

281
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,960
rather than Secretary -

282
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,760
I looked over at Stimson
and he nodded, he said, "Go ahead."

283
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:09,362
So I started in,
and I said that I thought that

284
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:11,353
we ought to have our heads examined

285
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:16,686
if we didn't begin to think in terms
of a political culmination of the war

286
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:18,342
rather than a military one.

287
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:22,709
And I said I'd give them some terms -

288
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:26,197
I'd send a message over to them,
I'd spell out the terms.

289
00:19:26,284 --> 00:19:30,420
And Mr Truman said, "Well, what
are your terms? What would you do?"

290
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,221
I hadn't quite prepared for
the actual dictation

291
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,334
of the surrender terms at that point,

292
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:37,400
but I started in and I said,

293
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:40,203
"In the first place,
I'd say you can have the mikado,

294
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:42,545
but he's got to be
a constitutional monarch -

295
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:45,648
you've got to have a representative
form of government."

296
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:50,796
"You can have access to, but
not control over, foreign raw materials

297
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:54,399
so you can have a viable economy..."
I spelled it out as best I could.

298
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,197
"And I'd say,
'Besides that, we've got a new force,

299
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:02,834
and it's in the form
of a new type of energy

300
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,178
that will revolutionise warfare,

301
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:09,663
destructive beyond any contemplation."
I said I'd mention the bomb.

302
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:14,537
Well, mentioning the bomb, even
at that late date, in that select group,

303
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:16,262
it was like they were all shocked

304
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:19,368
because it was
such a closely guarded secret.

305
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:23,174
It was comparable
to mentioning Skull and Bones at Yale,

306
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:25,618
which you're not supposed to do.

307
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:29,994
But Mr Truman said, "This is the sort
of thing I was trying to reach for -

308
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,803
get that all spelled out."

309
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:35,712
At that point Stimson did come in
and joined in support of my position,

310
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,052
but then later on Mr Byrnes,
who was then secretary of state,

311
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:41,009
who was not present,

312
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:45,454
vetoed the idea
of offering them the mikado.

313
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:50,367
One can only speculate
as to what would have happened

314
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,897
if we had put the message
to the Japanese

315
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:56,581
in the form that I indicated,
including the mikado.

316
00:20:56,664 --> 00:21:01,225
I always had the feeling, in view of
some of the information we've had since

317
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:08,126
of the tendency on the part of some
of the real military hotheads in Japan,

318
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:10,851
to think that this was perhaps
the best way out,

319
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:15,261
that we might have been able
to avoid the dropping of the bomb.

320
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:19,980
(narrator) By this time,
the battle for Okinawa is almost over.

321
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:22,127
12,000 Americans had died,

322
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:26,578
a bloody foretaste of what invasion
of the mainland might cost.

323
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:30,610
For the Japanese,
the lesson was harsher still.

324
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,246
100,000 died,

325
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:41,006
and, for the first time in the war,
their soldiers surrendered in thousands.

326
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:47,523
As the last resistance ended,
on June 22,

327
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:52,169
the new Japanese cabinet
made its first move towards peace.

328
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,235
Ultimately,
we had to conduct negotiations

329
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:58,608
with our military opponents -

330
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:01,455
that is to say, America and Britain -

331
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:05,745
but the high command
refused categorically

332
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,660
to entertain any idea of

333
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:13,846
starting conversations
with the enemy powers.

334
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:20,940
The only great power left out
of the enemy camp was the Soviet Union,

335
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:24,196
because of the fact that nominally

336
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:28,919
there existed still the neutrality pact,

337
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:36,557
and so this was the only window open
for peace endeavours -

338
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:40,192
and this window looked
towards the north.

339
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,189
And so we argued it out
with the military command,

340
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:50,404
and the military command
finally, reluctantly,

341
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:55,775
acceded to our request that we start
negotiations with the Soviet Union

342
00:22:55,854 --> 00:23:01,408
in order to arrive
at the final destination,

343
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:04,253
which was Washington and London.

344
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:08,009
(narrator) But it was the Chinese
foreign minister, not the Japanese,

345
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:10,808
that Stalin had been meeting.

346
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:16,871
A huge Japanese army still occupied
parts of China, including Manchuria.

347
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:19,860
The Russians and Chinese
were negotiating terms

348
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:23,119
under which
Stalin would attack that army.

349
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:27,188
When Truman sailed to Europe on July 7
to meet Stalin and Churchill,

350
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:31,941
he knew, through intercepted messages,
that Japan wanted an end to the war,

351
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:35,509
but not unconditional surrender.

352
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:39,775
Truman and Byrnes
now had several options open to them -

353
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:42,342
they could modify the surrender terms,

354
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:45,599
they could encourage the Russians
to invade Manchuria,

355
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:50,824
they could demonstrate the atomic bomb,
they could invade Japan itself.

356
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:57,919
But Truman decided that he would drop
atomic bombs on Japan without warning.

357
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,524
This alone, he hoped,
would end the Pacific war quickly,

358
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,558
before the Russians joined in.

359
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:08,046
And it would immensely strengthen
American bargaining power in Europe.

360
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:10,036
The decision had already been taken

361
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:13,799
when Truman arrived
for the "big three" meeting on July 15.

362
00:24:16,682 --> 00:24:21,777
The next morning, just before dawn,
at a remote desert site in New Mexico,

363
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,959
Robert Oppenheimer and the team
that had built the bomb

364
00:24:25,044 --> 00:24:28,841
witnessed the first atomic explosion.

365
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,672
(Oppenheimer) I remembered
the line from the Hindu scripture,

366
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:34,249
the Bhagavad-Gita:

367
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:40,231
Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince

368
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,033
that he should do his duty,

369
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,827
and to impress him

370
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:50,282
takes on his multi-armed form

371
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,963
and says, "Now I am become death,

372
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:56,228
the destroyer of worlds."

373
00:24:58,342 --> 00:25:01,484
I suppose we all thought that,
one way or another.

374
00:25:01,948 --> 00:25:08,156
(narrator) The plutonium bomb exploded
with a force of 20,000 tons of TNT.

375
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:13,837
The desert at the point of the explosion
was turned into glass.

376
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:18,128
By July 1945
Japan's economy was crumbling

377
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:21,694
and her cities were defenceless
against the B-29 raids.

378
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:24,312
Although her army
remained virtually intact,

379
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,259
Japan's war industries were smashed.

380
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:33,366
One million civilians had died.

381
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,464
Millions more were homeless.

382
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:42,491
The US Air Force had no doubts
that surrender was only weeks away.

383
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,833
(LeMay)
It was a hopeless situation for 'em.

384
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:52,043
The B-29s were flying over Japan at will
and they couldn't do anything about it.

385
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:58,109
We could destroy any target at will
without much opposition.

386
00:25:58,186 --> 00:26:01,744
So with this hopeless situation
they were facing,

387
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:06,042
they just didn't have the will
to continue.

388
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:08,582
In fact, they'd been trying
to get out of the war

389
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:12,833
for about three months
before they actually did.

390
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:16,550
They'd asked the Russians
to be an intermediary,

391
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:20,048
to try to negotiate them out of the war,

392
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:26,032
and the Russians had been stalling till
they'd got the European war finished

393
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:32,442
so they could get into the Pacific war
before it ended.

394
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,417
(narrator) Stalin and Molotov
refused to see the Japanese ambassador

395
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:43,371
before they left Moscow for the last
"big three" meeting for ten years.

396
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,591
Also at Potsdam
was Secretary of War Stimson.

397
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:51,502
He passed on detailed news of
the atomic test to Truman and Byrnes -

398
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:54,837
who, he noted in his diary,
were immensely pleased.

399
00:26:54,923 --> 00:26:57,913
"The president
was tremendously pepped up by it

400
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:01,396
and spoke to me of it again and again
when I saw him."

401
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:05,962
"He said it gave him
an entirely new feeling of confidence."

402
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:09,878
And when Stimson told Churchill
about the successful test the next day,

403
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,372
Churchill said he now understood

404
00:27:12,455 --> 00:27:15,750
how this pepping-up of Truman
had taken place

405
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,045
and that he felt the same way.

406
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:20,466
(narrator)
The British and Americans debated

407
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:23,080
whether to tell the Russians
about the bomb.

408
00:27:23,157 --> 00:27:26,147
Some argued that its full weight
as a diplomatic lever

409
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:30,634
would only become evident
after it had been dropped on Japan.

410
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:34,086
After one of our meetings,
just as we adjourned,

411
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:37,724
Truman went up
with his interpreter to Stalin

412
00:27:37,812 --> 00:27:41,336
and told him briefly

413
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:43,332
what we had discovered

414
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46,402
and what the effect
of the atomic bomb would be.

415
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,189
And all Stalin did was to nod his head
and say "Thank you" quite curtly,

416
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:54,872
and his expression changed in no way
and that was all there was to it.

417
00:27:57,491 --> 00:27:59,946
(McCloy)
It was a tremendous disappointment.

418
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:04,617
We thought he would be flabbergasted
at this thing but he just passed it off.

419
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:06,045
Whether he knew about it,

420
00:28:06,122 --> 00:28:11,905
whether he didn't want to show
any great emotion in regard to it,

421
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:13,595
I don't know.

422
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,432
All I know is that he took it
very much in his stride

423
00:28:17,516 --> 00:28:23,571
and, somewhat to our disappointment,
went on to the next item in the agenda.

424
00:28:23,654 --> 00:28:29,055
And this rather dismayed Stimson

425
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:30,596
because he thought that,

426
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:32,354
once having disclosed this,

427
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:36,726
there would be immediately
a great rush on the part of the Soviets

428
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:38,338
to sit down and talk to us

429
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:41,674
about the future implications
of this thing

430
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,822
and what the future uses of it would be.

431
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:46,123
But he got no encouragement at all.

432
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:51,081
(narrator) Stimson's tactics had
misfired - the "big three" had met

433
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:54,410
before the full power
of the atomic weapon was revealed.

434
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:57,633
Stimson feared that from now on,
Secretary of State Byrnes

435
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:01,974
would use the bomb to try to lever
direct concessions from the Russians.

436
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:06,153
I rather think that Mr Byrnes
had something of the thought

437
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:10,109
that this would be a sort of

438
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:13,983
point of leverage
in diplomatic exchanges,

439
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:17,661
whereas I think Mr Stimson -
or Colonel Stimson -

440
00:29:17,743 --> 00:29:21,693
had a different idea
of the use of the bomb.

441
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:23,419
(Bundy) He wrote to the president

442
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:26,831
to urge direct negotiation
on the nuclear issue,

443
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:34,233
and argued that relations with Russia
"may perhaps be irretrievably embittered

444
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:40,404
by the way in which we approach
the solution of the bomb with Russia."

445
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:43,558
"For if we fail to approach them now

446
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:45,552
and merely negotiate with them

447
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:49,806
having this weapon
rather ostentatiously on our hip,

448
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:57,332
their suspicions and their distrust of
our purposes and motives will increase."

449
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:00,737
(narrator) With the atomic weapons
now almost ready for use,

450
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:04,424
it was time for Truman to issue
a final ultimatum to the Japanese -

451
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:07,528
and again Stimson's advice was rejected.

452
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:12,054
Truman and Byrnes decided not to modify
the unconditional-surrender formula

453
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,544
by offering the Japanese
the chance to keep their emperor.

454
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:20,575
My hope is that
the people of Japan will now realise

455
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:24,530
that further resistance
to the forces of the nations

456
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:28,132
now united
in the enforcement of law and justice

457
00:30:28,214 --> 00:30:30,396
will be absolutely futile.

458
00:30:30,515 --> 00:30:34,040
There is still time -
but little time -

459
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,729
for the Japanese to save themselves

460
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:39,949
from the destruction
which threatens them.

461
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:47,276
The very purpose of it was to assure
them that they would have the decision,

462
00:30:47,356 --> 00:30:50,193
and at the same time

463
00:30:50,272 --> 00:30:55,716
not to start a controversy
among ourselves

464
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:58,818
about the position of the emperor.

465
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:03,348
When the Potsdam proclamation
was issued,

466
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:11,973
Foreign Minister Togo and I
worked together many sleepless nights,

467
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:17,156
and I took this proclamation
to the attention of the foreign minister

468
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,037
and explained the substance of it.

469
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:25,555
Togo at once said this was acceptable,

470
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:31,162
and he immediately went to the palace
and asked for an audience.

471
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:37,723
The emperor approved Togo's judgement
that this should be accepted

472
00:31:37,802 --> 00:31:40,824
and the war be terminated at once.

473
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:44,357
(Japanese man) Foreign Minister Togo
said in the cabinet meeting

474
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:48,769
that we can stop the war
without the question of the emperor.

475
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,381
We can keep the emperor all right.

476
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:53,788
But at that time we -

477
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,294
the Japanese government -

478
00:31:55,371 --> 00:32:00,161
asked some... intermediate...

479
00:32:00,243 --> 00:32:02,119
mediation... Mediation?

480
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,992
..mediation to the Russians,

481
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:07,914
so many cabinet ministers said,

482
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,593
"Well, let us see the situation
for a while."

483
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:14,238
(narrator) Prime Minister Suzuki
announced

484
00:32:14,322 --> 00:32:17,115
that Japan would ignore
the ultimatum.

485
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:20,188
Perhaps Russia
would save Japan's honour.

486
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:24,250
After all, the Potsdam Declaration
had not been signed by Stalin -

487
00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:26,134
he might still mediate.

488
00:32:26,214 --> 00:32:29,694
Stalin told Truman
about the Japanese approaches.

489
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:34,146
Truman knew all about them -
the Japanese codes had been broken.

490
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:37,559
Both leaders agreed to ignore
the peace feelers

491
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:41,049
and Truman sailed home on August 3.

492
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:44,349
With no response from the Japanese,
he authorised the Air Force

493
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:48,494
to drop the atom bomb
as soon as they were ready.

494
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,602
The Japanese foreign minister, Togo,

495
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:53,787
in desperation
cabled his ambassador in Moscow:

496
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:57,430
"Since the loss of one day
relative to this present matter

497
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,387
may result
in a thousand years of regret,

498
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:04,071
it is requested you immediately
have a talk with Molotov."

499
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:08,063
But Molotov
would still not meet the ambassador.

500
00:33:08,642 --> 00:33:09,984
On August 6,

501
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:13,542
two days before the Russians had said
they would attack the Japanese,

502
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:18,299
the Enola Gay set off
on its 1500-mile journey.

503
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:23,524
I noticed as I taxied out
that there were several hundred people

504
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:26,745
that were in the area
the aircraft were parked in,

505
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:30,044
there were some
in front of the control tower...

506
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:33,495
People were out there
to see what was going on

507
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:36,179
without really knowing
what they were looking at,

508
00:33:36,262 --> 00:33:37,943
but it was something different,

509
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:41,747
so they wanted to be part of it,
wanted to see what was taking place.

510
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:45,043
There's one bomb and one aeroplane
was going to carry that bomb,

511
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:49,641
and that's the group commander,
Colonel Tibbets, with his full crew.

512
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:51,751
My crew was assigned

513
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:53,899
to fly in formation on his right wing

514
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:55,130
during the bombing,

515
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:56,478
for a couple of reasons -

516
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:57,968
somebody had to fly there

517
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:01,532
and I was scheduled by him
to fly the second mission,

518
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:04,915
if there were to be a second mission.

519
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:08,061
We were to have a third aircraft
flying on the left wing

520
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:10,508
who would drop back
just before the bombing -

521
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:12,244
he was equipped with cameras.

522
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:16,916
We were to fly unseen by each other
for the first three hours

523
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:23,593
and to make rendezvous at 8,000 feet
over Iwo Jima at 6am.

524
00:34:23,677 --> 00:34:25,859
This was the plan.

525
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:30,152
We made the rendezvous successfully,
then we had about an hour and a half

526
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:35,027
to go along in a lazy formation on
a beautiful night out over the Pacific,

527
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:38,328
with moons and cloud puffs
that looked like powder puffs -

528
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:41,779
it was a quiet, peaceful evening,
believe me.

529
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:45,843
Nothing much went on -
a little bit of talk in the aeroplane,

530
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:48,644
but that's always normal on a mission -

531
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:50,942
but then you'd get a quiet period,

532
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:55,666
and I guess everybody was dreaming
or something, because it was quiet.

533
00:34:57,627 --> 00:35:01,031
(narrator)
At 8:15 on the morning of August 6,

534
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:07,370
the Enola Gay, flying at 32,000 feet,
released its bomb over Hiroshima.

535
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:10,470
(Tibbets) As soon as
the weight had left the aeroplane

536
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:12,694
I immediately went into this steep turn,

537
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:15,464
as did Sweeney and Marquart behind me,

538
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:18,412
and we tried then to place distance

539
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:20,907
between ourselves
and the point of impact.

540
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:24,516
In this particular case,
that bomb had 53 seconds

541
00:35:24,595 --> 00:35:27,508
from the time it left the aeroplane
until it exploded.

542
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:31,952
That's how long it took to fall
from the bombing altitude - 53 seconds.

543
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:35,944
And this gave us adequate time,
of course, to make the turn.

544
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:41,013
Now, we had just made the turn
and rolled out in level flight

545
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:45,155
when it seemed like somebody
had grabbed hold of my aeroplane

546
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:46,957
and gave it a real hard shaking,

547
00:35:47,037 --> 00:35:50,757
because this was the shock wave
that had come up.

548
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:00,383
This was something
that I was glad to feel

549
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:02,994
because it gave me a moment of relief -

550
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:07,327
after all, having worked on that bomb
for well over a year,

551
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:10,167
that 53 seconds
while I'm turning the aeroplane

552
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:13,268
I'm wondering
"Is it or is it not going to work?"

553
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:18,678
And, of course, the shock wave
hitting us was indication it had worked.

554
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:22,395
Therefore I felt that success
had been achieved.

555
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:26,280
When the bomb came
I saw a yellowish flash

556
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:29,118
and I was buried in the darkness.

557
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:34,598
The two-storeyed wooden building that
was my house, with eight rooms in it,

558
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:38,207
was blown down to pieces
and covered me up.

559
00:36:38,288 --> 00:36:40,971
(speaks Japanese)

560
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,341
(translator)
When I regained consciousness

561
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:46,418
everything was pitch dark all around me.

562
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:49,869
I tried to stand up,
but my leg was broken.

563
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:55,122
I tried to speak and I found
that six of my teeth had been broken.

564
00:36:55,244 --> 00:36:58,921
Then I realised that my face was burnt
and my back was burnt.

565
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:04,099
There was a slash right across
from one shoulder down to the waist.

566
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:07,859
I crawled to the river bank
and when I got there

567
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:12,197
I saw hundreds of bodies
come floating down the river.

568
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:18,867
And it was then that I realised with
a shock that all Hiroshima had been hit.

569
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:24,315
The day was clear

570
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:25,893
when we dropped that bomb -

571
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:29,146
it was a clear sunshiny day
and visibility was unrestricted -

572
00:37:29,232 --> 00:37:31,371
so as we came back around,

573
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:35,096
again facing the direction of Hiroshima,

574
00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:38,391
we saw this cloud coming up.

575
00:37:38,477 --> 00:37:42,885
The cloud by this time - now two minutes
- the cloud was up at our altitude.

576
00:37:42,966 --> 00:37:44,798
We were at 33,000 feet at this time,

577
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:46,226
and the cloud was up there

578
00:37:46,303 --> 00:37:50,209
and continuing to go
right on up in a boiling fashion -

579
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:52,627
it was rolling and boiling.

580
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:59,420
The surface was nothing but...
a black, boiling...

581
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,911
the only thing I can say,
like a barrel of tar -

582
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:04,098
probably
the best description I can give.

583
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,132
This was the way it looked down there.

584
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:08,013
Where before there had been a city -

585
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:10,078
distinctive houses, buildings

586
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,881
and everything that you could see
from our altitude -

587
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:18,103
now you couldn't see anything except
this black, boiling debris down below.

588
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,745
We took pictures as rapidly as we could.

589
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:25,852
My immediate concern after that
was "It's time to get out of here."

590
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:32,521
I encountered
long, ceaseless lines of escapees.

591
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:38,356
All of them had no clothes whatsoever
on their bodies.

592
00:38:39,894 --> 00:38:43,036
And the skin

593
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:48,746
from their faces, arms and breast

594
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:51,124
peeling off and hanging loose -

595
00:38:51,211 --> 00:38:56,033
and yet without any expression.

596
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:59,722
In deep silence they are escaping.

597
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:04,593
I thought it was a procession of ghosts.

598
00:39:05,558 --> 00:39:06,823
The words went back

599
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:11,418
basically to the effect
that the bombing conditions were clear,

600
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:15,760
the target had been hit, the results
were better than had been anticipated,

601
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,978
and that message was sent on back.

602
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,049
From there on it was just a proposition

603
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:22,356
of letting everybody talk
for a few minutes

604
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:24,313
and get it out of their system.

605
00:39:24,394 --> 00:39:26,270
The excitement was over -

606
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,027
pretty soon it became
a rather routine flight back home.

607
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,172
As a matter of fact,
it was routine enough

608
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:35,821
that I let Bob Lewis
and the autopilot fly that aeroplane

609
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:39,535
and went back and got some sleep
for about the first time in 30 hours -

610
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:41,424
and I was ready for it.

611
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:43,074
A long drawn-out war,

612
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:49,786
you begin to get casualties from the
side-effects of exhaustion, privation...

613
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:53,390
disease and things of that sort.

614
00:39:53,472 --> 00:39:56,690
So getting it over with
as quick as possible

615
00:39:56,771 --> 00:40:02,172
is a moral responsibility
of everyone concerned.

616
00:40:02,295 --> 00:40:05,895
Now, it's true that we knew
the war was over

617
00:40:06,016 --> 00:40:08,929
and if we just waited a little while
it would be over,

618
00:40:09,008 --> 00:40:11,649
because the Japanese were negotiating,

619
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:14,601
and we knew this
because we'd broken their code

620
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:17,249
and we were listening
to their communications.

621
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:23,891
But I believe that President Truman
made the proper decision to use it...

622
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,147
because it probably hastened
the negotiations

623
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:31,402
and even if we just saved one day,

624
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,019
to me it would be worthwhile,
you have to do it.

625
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:38,274
I thought it was absolutely unnecessary,

626
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:42,720
because by the time
the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima

627
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:48,479
we were conducting negotiations
with the Soviet government,

628
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:51,778
looking towards
an early end of hostilities.

629
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:56,337
And we were completely exhausted.

630
00:40:56,423 --> 00:41:00,329
And the navy and army, too,

631
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:03,359
were slowly becoming...

632
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:11,912
more amenable to the idea of peace.

633
00:41:11,998 --> 00:41:15,523
It's an appalling subject to talk about,

634
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:19,892
and the United States has,
consciously and unconsciously,

635
00:41:20,016 --> 00:41:23,190
a great deal of guilt complex
about its use.

636
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:29,256
But Truman made the decision on
the basis of the military necessities.

637
00:41:29,376 --> 00:41:33,282
And I think an impartial analysis,

638
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,158
particularly from
the Japanese themselves -

639
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,963
more evidence is coming out that
they would've fought on fanatically.

640
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,070
You know, they did fight on fanatically

641
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,645
in some of the islands,

642
00:41:43,723 --> 00:41:45,708
in spite of the surrender.

643
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:50,050
And the emperor
wouldn't have had the courage

644
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:53,457
to have called it off,
or the support to call it off.

645
00:41:54,004 --> 00:41:59,023
When I heard about the atomic bomb
I was so astonished,

646
00:41:59,912 --> 00:42:04,701
and I frankly said,
"The American people are brutal."

647
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:12,493
I wondered if the American people
were really civilised.

648
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:14,180
But at the same time

649
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:18,776
I thought this may become a key

650
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:23,270
for Japan to end the war.

651
00:42:26,535 --> 00:42:29,938
(narrator) It was two days before
the Japanese government realised

652
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:34,161
what the atomic bomb was
and what it had done.

653
00:42:34,245 --> 00:42:37,573
70,000 had died in Hiroshima.

654
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,377
Another 70,000 were injured.

655
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,599
97% of the city's buildings
were destroyed or severely damaged.

656
00:42:45,677 --> 00:42:48,852
President Truman, on hearing the news,

657
00:42:48,976 --> 00:42:52,457
called it
"the greatest thing in history".

658
00:42:52,544 --> 00:42:54,758
The peace group in the Japanese cabinet

659
00:42:54,846 --> 00:42:59,483
hoped that the bomb might persuade
the war faction to accept surrender.

660
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:02,510
As the cabinet met
on the morning of August 9,

661
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:05,541
it received further shattering news.

662
00:43:06,469 --> 00:43:08,498
The previous evening, in Moscow,

663
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,601
Molotov had finally received
the Japanese ambassador

664
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:15,789
and bluntly told him that Russia
was about to declare war on Japan.

665
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:20,278
Eight hours later - exactly three months
after the defeat of Germany,

666
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:22,265
just as Stalin had promised -

667
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:25,875
Russia attacked the Japanese army
in Manchuria.

668
00:43:26,686 --> 00:43:30,635
Japanese hopes of Russian mediation
were at an end.

669
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:34,391
American hopes of finishing the war
before Russia became involved

670
00:43:34,473 --> 00:43:36,840
were thwarted.

671
00:43:42,145 --> 00:43:44,131
Later that same morning,

672
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:48,085
the Americans dropped
a plutonium bomb on Nagasaki.

673
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:50,535
It killed 60,000 people.

674
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:53,078
But even now the Japanese militants

675
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:56,559
held out for a surrender
without an occupation.

676
00:43:57,682 --> 00:44:01,893
The peace party wanted only
to preserve the emperor's position.

677
00:44:02,477 --> 00:44:04,582
For the first time,
to break the deadlock,

678
00:44:04,664 --> 00:44:08,613
the emperor, Hirohito,
was called in to decide.

679
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,329
He chose peace.

680
00:44:12,413 --> 00:44:17,967
(Hisatsune Sakomizu) I shall never
forget the emotion of that time.

681
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:24,304
Everybody started to cry,
so I looked at the emperor's face.

682
00:44:24,382 --> 00:44:27,600
He just kept silent,

683
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:35,153
but he wore white gloves on his hands...

684
00:44:36,235 --> 00:44:43,131
He wiped his own face several times,

685
00:44:44,253 --> 00:44:50,079
so we could know the emperor himself,

686
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:53,379
His Majesty the emperor himself,
was crying.

687
00:44:54,227 --> 00:45:00,086
I shall never forget the emotion

688
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:02,278
in this room at that time.

689
00:45:04,508 --> 00:45:07,803
On August 10, the Japanese
made it known they would surrender

690
00:45:07,884 --> 00:45:11,058
if the emperor were allowed to stay.

691
00:45:11,144 --> 00:45:16,055
On August 12,
the Allies sent a noncommittal reply.

692
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:19,344
By this time,
Japan's army was near revolt.

693
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:22,181
(speaks Japanese)

694
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:25,946
(translator) Even if a thousand
atom bombs had been dropped,

695
00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:30,164
and even if Japan
had been completely devastated,

696
00:45:30,248 --> 00:45:34,078
you must remember
that Japan's honour was at stake,

697
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:36,692
the pride of the Japanese at that time

698
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,942
who felt that the only honourable way
out of the war was not to surrender,

699
00:45:42,025 --> 00:45:44,284
but to die to the last man.

700
00:45:45,094 --> 00:45:47,353
(narrator)
The Americans dropped leaflets

701
00:45:47,434 --> 00:45:49,387
urging the Japanese to surrender.

702
00:45:49,506 --> 00:45:54,569
These almost upset the delicate
manoeuvrings of the peace party.

703
00:45:54,646 --> 00:45:57,636
(speaks Japanese)

704
00:45:57,715 --> 00:46:00,705
(translator)
That could have caused a lot of trouble.

705
00:46:00,784 --> 00:46:03,468
Civilians and soldiers
all over the country

706
00:46:03,546 --> 00:46:07,343
were completely unaware
of what was going on.

707
00:46:07,421 --> 00:46:10,869
If they had found out that
the government was negotiating peace

708
00:46:10,988 --> 00:46:12,974
with the United States,

709
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,159
the situation
would have become impossible.

710
00:46:16,244 --> 00:46:19,539
It might even have led to a revolution.

711
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:25,523
So I felt we had to reach
a final decision as fast as possible.

712
00:46:30,514 --> 00:46:32,926
(narrator) Once again, on August 14,

713
00:46:33,008 --> 00:46:35,921
the emperor met
a divided Supreme War Council

714
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,982
and told them they must accept
the Allied ultimatum.

715
00:46:40,067 --> 00:46:44,278
He himself would broadcast the next day.

716
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:47,352
That night, a group of junior officers
invaded the palace

717
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:50,606
and tried to seize the recording
of the emperor's message.

718
00:46:50,693 --> 00:46:54,250
They couldn't find it. The coup failed.

719
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:55,717
At noon on August 15,

720
00:46:55,795 --> 00:47:02,428
the Japanese people heard their
emperor's voice for the first time.

721
00:47:02,508 --> 00:47:05,225
(Japanese over radio)

722
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:14,471
"The war", he told them, "has developed
not necessarily to Japan's advantage."

723
00:47:14,554 --> 00:47:20,412
"Moreover, the enemy has begun to use
a new and most cruel bomb."

724
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,758
"Should we continue to fight,

725
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,906
it will not only result
in an ultimate collapse

726
00:47:25,985 --> 00:47:29,051
and obliteration of the Japanese nation,

727
00:47:29,131 --> 00:47:34,346
but also the total destruction
of human civilisation."

728
00:47:34,425 --> 00:47:39,062
"We must, therefore,
endure the unendurable."

729
00:47:41,177 --> 00:47:47,461
When the emperor addressed the nation
through his broadcast,

730
00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:53,906
I know that 99 men out of 100

731
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:55,942
were taken aback.

732
00:47:56,022 --> 00:48:00,430
They expected the emperor
to urge them to fight on.

733
00:48:01,508 --> 00:48:06,800
So the shock was tremendous.

734
00:48:07,646 --> 00:48:12,665
And all the army officers,
particularly the younger ones,

735
00:48:12,748 --> 00:48:18,728
who said that
they had to fight to the bitter end,

736
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:21,755
were naturally disillusioned.

737
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:28,124
Some even tried to remonstrate

738
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:33,030
with the decision
taken by the cabinet for surrender.

739
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,682
(speaks Japanese)

740
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:41,400
(translator) In a way it could be said
that the atomic bombings

741
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:43,815
and Russia's sudden attack on Japan

742
00:48:43,936 --> 00:48:46,500
helped to bring about
the end of the war.

743
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,874
If those events had not happened,

744
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:53,598
Japan, at that stage, probably
could not have stopped fighting.

745
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:05,146
(narrator) The war had ended,
but not the dying.

746
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:10,593
And radiation sickness -
which the Americans had not foreseen -

747
00:49:10,674 --> 00:49:13,162
would kill thousands more
in the years to come.

748
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:24,368
The morning of September 2, 1945:

749
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:29,192
the United States battleship Missouri
is anchored in Tokyo Bay.

750
00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:32,769
The new Japanese foreign minister,
Shigemitsu,

751
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:37,102
limps on board
to sign the surrender document.

752
00:49:49,189 --> 00:49:52,670
The Allied commander, General MacArthur.

753
00:49:52,757 --> 00:50:00,001
I now invite the representatives
of the emperor of Japan

754
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:02,921
and the Japanese government

755
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:06,174
and the Japanese Imperial
General Headquarters

756
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:11,700
to sign the instrument of surrender
at the places indicated.

757
00:50:11,784 --> 00:50:16,847
(narrator) The foreign minister's aide,
Kase, watched the ceremony.

758
00:50:16,925 --> 00:50:23,974
(Kase) I saw many thousands of sailors
everywhere on this huge vessel,

759
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:29,919
and just in front of us
were delegates of the victorious powers,

760
00:50:30,006 --> 00:50:33,988
in military uniforms
glittering with gold.

761
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:36,366
And looking at them,

762
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:42,779
I wondered how Japan ever thought
she could defeat all those nations.

763
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:50,597
(newsreel) Let us pray that peace
be now restored to the world,

764
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:56,503
and that God will preserve it always.

765
00:50:57,396 --> 00:51:01,193
These proceedings are closed.
