00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:03,812
(fanfare)

3
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:10,104
(narrator) May 8 1945.

4
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:14,968
V-E Day.

5
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:17,041
Victory in Europe.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,749
After years of struggle,
an explosion of joy and of relief.

7
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:50,616
("Knees Up Mother Brown"
by Harris Weston and Bert Lee)

8
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:44,239
(crowd) Send him victorious

9
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:48,917
Happy and glorious

10
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:52,876
Long to reign over us...

11
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:59,740
(Churchill) We may allow ourselves
a brief period of rejoicing.

12
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:12,048
But let us not forget for a moment
the toils and efforts that lie ahead.

13
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:16,308
(narrator) There was still Japan.

14
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,311
(narrator) Tokyo, just before midday
on 7 December 1942.

15
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:19,843
(Japanese national anthem)

16
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:38,748
The Japanese people observed
the first anniversary

17
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:43,469
of their imperial navy's destruction
of the American fleet at Pearl Harbour.

18
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:47,108
It was one year since they learned
that their nation of 80 million

19
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,257
had engaged the combined might

20
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:52,791
of over 200 million
Americans and British.

21
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:56,430
Many had heard the news
of the Pearl Harbour attack soberly,

22
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,005
even apprehensively.

23
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:07,254
But then came victory after victory -
Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore.

24
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:09,549
Earlier fears were lost in exultation.

25
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:11,622
(shouts in Japanese)

26
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,272
(crowd cheers)

27
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:23,289
(speaks Japanese)

28
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,230
(narrator) Prime Minister
General Hideki Tojo,

29
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,299
representative of the militarists

30
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:35,527
who had made Japan
into an aggressive totalitarian state,

31
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,822
had led his countrymen into the war.

32
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:41,428
Now he promised them final victory.

33
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:46,880
(translator) The nation will complete
the final round of this conflict.

34
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:52,254
To overthrow America and Britain
we will fight until the last day.

35
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:57,317
Then in the Greater Asian area

36
00:04:57,435 --> 00:05:00,763
we shall accomplish
the destruction of our enemies.

37
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,064
Now, at the start of the second year,

38
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:06,555
both myself and the nation
think about the men in the front line,

39
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:11,388
and once again I express determination
for final victory.

40
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:15,840
War work must be pushed on
and the struggle carried forward.

41
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:23,974
(narrator) At this time,
Japan was not an industrial giant.

42
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,547
But in this first year of war,

43
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,537
they had seen the Japanese soldiers'
spiritual strength and discipline

44
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,797
prevail over the materially stronger

45
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:35,484
but morally inferior
Americans and British.

46
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:43,114
The same dedication on the home front

47
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,642
would make Japan's newly won empire
unassailable.

48
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,489
(fanfare)

49
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,815
For some well-informed Japanese,

50
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:00,299
the Pearl Harbour attack
had been an astonishing gamble.

51
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:04,827
I came to work as usual
about nine o'clock

52
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:07,597
and everybody was there.

53
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:10,283
There was martial music playing

54
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,616
and I almost fell over
when I saw the newspaper extra

55
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:19,561
saying that the emperor had declared war
on United States and Great Britain.

56
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:22,327
I think the man on the street
had the same feeling

57
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:24,811
of being taken by complete surprise.

58
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:32,181
(narrator) But now, propaganda film
could portray jubilant Japanese aviators

59
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:35,745
smashing the American fleet
at Pearl Harbour.

60
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:38,664
(shouts in Japanese)

61
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,951
(shouts in Japanese)

62
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:05,790
(narrator) Doubters were persuaded.

63
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:13,687
Newsreels emphasised
the humbling of the arrogant whites.

64
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:28,267
The Japanese believed that their own
soldiers always fought to the death.

65
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,219
The sight of white prisoners
dwarfing the Japanese

66
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:34,096
who herded them
into dishonourable captivity

67
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:37,547
helped convince them
of their own invincibility.

68
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,469
(woman) Japan was winning

69
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:58,375
and every day we heard over the radio
all the victories.

70
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,904
And the whole nation was very excited.

71
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,056
And the thought I had at the time

72
00:08:06,136 --> 00:08:10,620
when I heard the news about the war was,
"What's going to happen?"

73
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:14,989
But immediately all the victories
and big war songs

74
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:18,871
and marches over the radio
all day long...

75
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,701
So we are... quite excited

76
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:26,003
and it was almost like a festival.

77
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:29,150
(band plays march)

78
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:43,649
(narrator) War had been with
the Japanese people for ten years.

79
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,141
Since 1931, their armies
had been fighting

80
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,831
an endless, frustrating war in China.

81
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:52,283
Victory in the Pacific
had been quick and complete.

82
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:55,231
Here at last was something to celebrate.

83
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,996
(air-raid siren)

84
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,246
For years before Pearl Harbour,

85
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:22,588
there had been mock air-raid drills
in every Japanese city.

86
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:28,603
Not a precaution against
China's almost nonexistent air force,

87
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,327
but part of the process of keeping
war-like emotion at a high pitch.

88
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:46,525
(shouting in Japanese)

89
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,895
(narrator) All took part.

90
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:56,843
Neighbourhood Associations -
the Tonarigumi -

91
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:59,913
ensured that every one
of the emperor's subjects at home

92
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:02,327
was involved in the distant war.

93
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:08,387
The Neighbourhood Associations
controlled all our life at that time.

94
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:12,606
All the instructions from the government
were through the Tonarigumi,

95
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,713
so we had to obey it.

96
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:19,747
And we relied upon the Tonarigumi.

97
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:27,757
(narrator) In every neighbourhood,

98
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,604
in schools, in playing fields
and on the streets,

99
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:33,781
ordinary citizens patriotically
submitted themselves

100
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,201
to regimentation of thought and act.

101
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:39,533
(man shouts instructions in Japanese)

102
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:53,043
(narrator) The inculcation
of patriotic virtues began in infancy.

103
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:55,109
(piano plays)

104
00:10:58,686 --> 00:11:01,599
(children sing in Japanese)

105
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:13,378
(narrator) From their earliest days,
children prepared mind and body

106
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:16,445
to serve a cause
greater than themselves -

107
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:19,132
the family, the nation,

108
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,813
the emperor.

109
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:32,702
And if the nation was at war,
children had to be ready for that, too.

110
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,008
(children continue singing in Japanese)

111
00:11:56,305 --> 00:11:58,061
(narrator) When school was over,

112
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:01,704
it would be their duty and their
privilege to serve their country

113
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,737
in the imperial forces on land, on sea,

114
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,851
in the air.

115
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:17,432
High-school pupils
joined the air force for a day.

116
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,621
If they were lucky,

117
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:22,341
they would have the chance
to join as adults before too long.

118
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,141
(man) Of course,
the Japanese were brought up

119
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:33,087
in three or four cardinal truths
from cradle to grave -

120
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:36,804
that the emperor was divine,
the country was invincible,

121
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:41,681
and it consisted of... a chosen race.

122
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:43,215
Things like these,

123
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:46,708
which were drummed into the Japanese
mind from kindergarten up.

124
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:52,036
(narrator) Japanese boys were taught

125
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:54,413
to imitate the martial code
of the samurai -

126
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:58,444
archaic and ferocious,
devoid of pity for enemy or for self.

127
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:09,380
For the samurai, to die in battle
was to fall at the moment of perfection,

128
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:11,566
as the cherry blossom does.

129
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:24,527
The worship of Buddha
had coexisted in Japan for centuries

130
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:28,334
with the ancient Shinto worship
of spirits, of ancestors,

131
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:31,129
of the sun goddess, Amaterasu.

132
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,200
But in the 1920s and '30s,
the nationalists and militarists

133
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,991
had insisted that Shinto
be made the state religion.

134
00:13:57,566 --> 00:14:01,625
Shinto was pure.
It was strictly Japanese.

135
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,616
And it was from the Shinto sun goddess,
the Japanese devoutly believed,

136
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:09,567
that the nation's high priest
was directly descended -

137
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,636
the emperor.

138
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,271
The emperor was a god
and a warrior chief.

139
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,271
The mystic belief that, through him,
the Japanese race

140
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:24,646
was destined for conquest
was systematically propagated.

141
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,497
The military acted
in the emperor's name,

142
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,266
but they contrived that,
in spite of appearances,

143
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,679
he retained little real power on Earth.

144
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:47,892
The emperor
was deeply solicitous of peace,

145
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,504
which means that he was opposed

146
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:56,408
to starting hostilities with America.

147
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,327
But his position was such

148
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:04,348
that if the cabinet
recommended, unanimously,

149
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,453
a certain line of policy,

150
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:13,053
he could not disapprove of it,
although he might dislike it at heart.

151
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:16,239
(narrator) In a government
headed by a general,

152
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:18,352
this meant doing what the army wanted.

153
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:29,320
The ashes of Japan's war dead
were carried home, packed in boxes.

154
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:34,078
Relatives of the fallen,
widows and mothers,

155
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:36,419
had no more occasion for pride,

156
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:40,178
no more right to tears
than the day they had said goodbye.

157
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,119
To send sons or husband to die
for the emperor was the highest duty.

158
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,617
"We'll meet at the Yasukuni Shrine,"

159
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,105
where the ashes of the war dead
were consecrated,

160
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:54,106
was the traditional farewell
of the soldiers leaving,

161
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:58,746
wrapped in haramaki - the protective
belly band of a thousand stitches.

162
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:04,656
(man) A girl stands
on the corners of the streets,

163
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:06,797
say if in Tokyo, along the Ginza,

164
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,865
and asks each passer-by woman
to make a stitch.

165
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,361
She must collect a thousand stitches.

166
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:18,309
This is given to a soldier. I got one.
You wrapped this round your belly.

167
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:20,759
It's supposed to keep your stomach warm

168
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,530
so that you don't catch cold
or this or that,

169
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,485
but also to ward off bullets.

170
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:30,006
Now, we all know this cannot be done,
but this is like a charm, also.

171
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:35,078
And I used to think, now I don't know
whether I should say this,

172
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:37,490
but I felt this is very unfair,

173
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:40,028
especially when I got the order
to go overseas.

174
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:43,857
The Japanese girls
are giving me this thousand stitches.

175
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:48,119
I am going to die.
I have not experienced a woman.

176
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:53,185
Why cannot they give me
their body to enjoy, and let me live,

177
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,666
however short my life is,
to enjoy the fullness of it?

178
00:16:56,753 --> 00:17:00,234
Because sleeping with me
is not going to kill the girl, you know?

179
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:02,044
Maybe she likes it, I don't know.

180
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:07,034
But here I am about to die,
and all I get is a thousand stitches.

181
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:15,470
(narrator) Wartime farewells were
supposed to be a spiritual experience -

182
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:18,038
ceremonial, unsentimental.

183
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,106
(all sing in Japanese)

184
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,468
(narrator) Men recovered from wounds

185
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,767
left hospital to the singing
of the Umi Yukaba.

186
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:07,754
"I go to a lonely grave
far across the sea," they sang,

187
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,401
and went off to the war again.

188
00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:20,334
But suddenly, less than five months
after Pearl Harbour...

189
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,399
..the war was not so far away.

190
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,070
18 April 1942.

191
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:40,479
16 Mitchell medium bombers, commanded
by Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle,

192
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,015
set out from the US aircraft carrier,
Hornet,

193
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:46,495
for the first-ever air raid on Japan.

194
00:18:56,825 --> 00:19:00,306
The American aim was to make
a token, but early, demonstration

195
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:02,727
of Japan's vulnerability to air attack.

196
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,417
In this, they entirely succeeded.

197
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:11,506
When Doolittle's raid was conducted

198
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:15,075
over the sky of Tokyo,

199
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:20,334
that produced a...
produced a sort of consternation

200
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:23,630
because the military

201
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:28,703
repeatedly assured the public

202
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,883
that the Japanese sky was impenetrable.

203
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:36,833
(narrator) Doolittle's bombers
did penetrate Japan's skies

204
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:40,393
to drop a mere 16 tons
of bombs on her cities.

205
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:43,088
The actual damage was not great.

206
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:44,808
The shock was.

207
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,766
(man) The Japanese press
were told how to display the news.

208
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:52,979
The complexion
was put on as a cruel act -

209
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:57,089
indiscriminate bombing
of civilians and women and children.

210
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:03,679
(narrator)
Eight Doolittle flyers were captured.

211
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:14,843
For the Japanese, bombing was something
that happened to other people.

212
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:19,523
They were angry that this barbarity
had happened to them.

213
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,774
The prisoners were tried
by a military court.

214
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:29,386
Three were executed.

215
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:42,086
The main function of Japanese women
was to bear sons.

216
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,385
Skilled only in such feminine arts
as the tea ceremony,

217
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:47,418
they stayed in the background.

218
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,871
Now with the battle fronts
taking the men away,

219
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:51,863
they were directed to sterner things.

220
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,108
(man sings in Japanese)

221
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:18,338
Country women were used
to taking their place in the fields

222
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:20,136
alongside their men.

223
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:23,625
But for the women from the cities,
the war meant a complete change.

224
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,855
To stock the nation's depleted larder,

225
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:29,150
they too were conscripted
to labour long hours.

226
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:40,552
They mined coal to make the utmost use
of Japan's scanty resources

227
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:42,964
and keep the war machine moving.

228
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,910
City girls were brought up
to be wives and mothers,

229
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:06,594
to be known
as the "honourable hidden one".

230
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:10,315
Now they came out of their seclusion
and learned new skills.

231
00:22:15,922 --> 00:22:19,370
The women of Japan must take over
men's work, they were told,

232
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:22,441
as their enemies had done,
to ensure victory.

233
00:22:23,364 --> 00:22:25,349
(man sings in Japanese)

234
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:03,447
(woman) When we worked at the factory,

235
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:05,361
every other week we had to work

236
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:08,775
from three o'clock in the afternoon
until 11 o'clock.

237
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:13,226
And at 11 o'clock
when we finish our work,

238
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:19,486
they would take us to a dining room
and they would give us one bowl of soup.

239
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:26,613
Actually, it was hot salt water
with maybe two or three soy beans.

240
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:29,193
And we are very hungry.

241
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:34,212
Or maybe just one noodle at the bottom.

242
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:37,546
Everything we got through rations.

243
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:42,378
Unless we have a card for rations,
we couldn't get anything.

244
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:48,827
We have to do some self-supply,
and we grew potatoes in our gardens.

245
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,580
We worked very hard
to grow our own vegetables.

246
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,806
Our everyday life,

247
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:59,417
that life was very, very hard.

248
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:02,988
(narrator) The empress herself
took on a new role,

249
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,674
urging the nation
to more effort, more sacrifice.

250
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:08,511
Sacrifice was necessary for victory,

251
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,427
and in final victory
their belief was still unshaken.

252
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:16,059
None knew that by June 1942,

253
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:19,366
the battle had already become
one simply for survival.

254
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,666
June 1942.

255
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:38,277
United States war planes take off
to intercept a Japanese armada

256
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,573
attacking the island of Midway.

257
00:24:56,542 --> 00:25:01,331
To this battle, Admiral Yamamoto,
the Japanese naval commander-in-chief,

258
00:25:01,414 --> 00:25:06,051
had committed the four largest
aircraft carriers in the Japanese fleet.

259
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:08,816
When the battle ended on 5 June 1942,

260
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:13,761
Yamamoto's four carriers
were blazing wrecks or sunk.

261
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:18,208
Midway was a defeat
from which Japan's navy never recovered.

262
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:23,039
But the Japanese people were told
that Midway was a victory.

263
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:26,804
The truth was concealed
even from members of the government.

264
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:28,910
(speaks Japanese)

265
00:25:30,837 --> 00:25:34,241
(translator) We were told
that one aircraft carrier was sunk

266
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:37,165
and one was severely damaged.

267
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,310
Since there were four carriers
involved in the battle,

268
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:42,680
the way we heard it,
three had come back,

269
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:45,637
although one was severely damaged.

270
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:50,358
But the Anglo-American side
was saying that all four had been sunk.

271
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,157
This left some doubts in our minds.

272
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,345
We pressed the navy
to give us more details,

273
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:59,599
but they stuck
to their original announcement.

274
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,670
(speaks Japanese)

275
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:07,544
(translator) I was a news cameraman
in the Midway battle.

276
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:10,877
When we got back to our base
in the Japan Sea,

277
00:26:10,963 --> 00:26:13,910
we were not even allowed
to write any letters.

278
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:17,551
The wounded were kept
in the isolation wards.

279
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:22,543
A top-secret order said that nothing
could be talked of the Midway battle,

280
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:25,615
not even within the navy itself.

281
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:27,953
I was virtually kept prisoner

282
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:31,754
for about a month and a half
after returning to Japan.

283
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:36,197
As a journalist, I was kept
under particularly strict surveillance

284
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:40,996
because we were reputedly great talkers
and loose with our tongues.

285
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:45,447
And I was kept from going back to Tokyo
while the rest of the war lasted.

286
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:52,622
The true situation was never broadcast
from the NHK, of course.

287
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:57,600
Every news... broadcast

288
00:26:57,726 --> 00:27:01,676
was strictly censored in those days.

289
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:10,230
The general public only knew
that the Japanese army and navy

290
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:13,789
kept winning every battle they fought.

291
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:22,885
(narrator) No news, just propaganda.

292
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,826
Only one outcome was imaginable

293
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,550
in the conflict ceaselessly portrayed
in the propaganda films.

294
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:38,346
The white oppressors of Oriental people
overcome by the brave Japanese soldier.

295
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:51,235
(shouts in Japanese)

296
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,599
(shouting in Japanese)

297
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:03,591
(narrator)
The spartan Japanese soldier, in turn,

298
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,423
overcome by contempt and rage
at his white enemy's soft living.

299
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:09,720
(shouts in Japanese)

300
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,009
(band plays dirge)

301
00:28:20,702 --> 00:28:25,416
(narrator) Tokyo, 5 June 1943.

302
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:29,448
The state funeral
for Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto,

303
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:30,977
the great commander

304
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,857
who had masterminded the victory
at Pearl Harbour.

305
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:38,306
Yamamoto died a hero,
the Japanese people were told,

306
00:28:38,387 --> 00:28:42,981
in the front line,
meeting death gallantly in a war plane.

307
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:46,667
His loss was greater
than many battleships.

308
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:57,675
But this first public admission
of a defeat,

309
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:00,711
although represented
as only symbolic of heroism,

310
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,384
hid grimmer truths of which
Yamamoto himself had been well aware.

311
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,381
He knew that the enemy's material
superiority, once fully mobilised,

312
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:12,563
would be overwhelming.

313
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:16,779
At Pearl Harbour, he had gambled
that the war would be a short one.

314
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:19,886
At Midway, the gamble was lost.

315
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:35,614
Yamamoto had been shot down in skies
now swarming with enemy planes,

316
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:38,912
over seas now dominated
by the enemy's navy.

317
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:48,929
By 1944, the scales had tipped
fully against Japan.

318
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:53,338
Metal had become
a precious war commodity

319
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:55,872
too valuable for ornament or ceremony.

320
00:29:58,371 --> 00:30:01,317
The war had been fought
to secure raw materials

321
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:04,805
for a land where they were scarce -
above all, for oil.

322
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:08,919
But now the resources General Tojo had
boasted would flow from their conquests

323
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:12,172
were getting no nearer to Japan
than the bottom of the ocean.

324
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:15,929
Not enough got through
to keep the war machine going.

325
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,963
And food was scarce.

326
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:22,801
The official daily ration
of 1500 calories, subsistence level,

327
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:24,335
was often not met.

328
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:27,675
The rice harvest
was the worst for 50 years.

329
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:29,970
Starvation hovered close.

330
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:37,988
The victories of 1941 had placed Japan
behind a vast protective ring,

331
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:40,060
defended in death.

332
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:43,633
By the middle of 1944,

333
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:47,773
General MacArthur's amphibious armies
had reduced this to an inner ring

334
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:50,579
hinging on the island of Saipan.

335
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:55,602
Saipan, within flying distance of Japan,

336
00:30:55,683 --> 00:31:00,594
was claimed by the Japanese military
to be a shield and an impregnable one.

337
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,354
It was vital that it should be.

338
00:31:03,432 --> 00:31:05,418
(speaks Japanese)

339
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,905
(translator) It was realised
that if Saipan was lost,

340
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,317
we would be
in a very difficult position.

341
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:17,732
The importance of Saipan
was that once it fell,

342
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:21,653
the war would be
right in front of Japan's eyes.

343
00:31:23,457 --> 00:31:27,822
Japan would come within bombing range
of US planes.

344
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:32,653
It was an absolutely vital
defence area for Japan.

345
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:45,588
(narrator) On 15 June 1944,

346
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:49,694
after five days of saturation
bombardment by sea and air,

347
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:52,992
American assault troops stormed ashore.

348
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:08,291
As always, the Japanese garrison
fought to the last.

349
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,223
Here, for the first time,
Japanese civilians -

350
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,099
women and children -
were caught up in the battle.

351
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:27,435
Some, dazed and docile, submitted.

352
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:41,478
Saipan had deep-water harbours,
it had two airfields.

353
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:43,623
Every rock was defended.

354
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:17,276
In three weeks, to take an island
only 85 square miles in area,

355
00:33:17,353 --> 00:33:20,877
the Americans
lost 15,000 dead and wounded.

356
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:31,468
25,000 Japanese defenders
died to a man.

357
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:54,324
And some civilians, like many soldiers,
chose suicide rather than surrender.

358
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:08,400
They died in vain. Saipan was taken.

359
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:15,776
Even before the last Japanese had died,

360
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:20,185
American bombers were ready
to take off for the mainland.

361
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:24,630
The truth was now too close even for
the Japanese high command to conceal it.

362
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:27,238
(speaks Japanese)

363
00:34:33,424 --> 00:34:38,017
(narrator) The situation, they told
the people, was grave but not hopeless.

364
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:42,773
But the sacred homeland itself
was now directly threatened.

365
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:48,727
The enemy, schoolchildren learned,
was within striking distance by air.

366
00:34:52,988 --> 00:34:56,665
The time had come for all,
young and old,

367
00:34:56,748 --> 00:35:01,265
to meet the threat with
the same defiance as their fighting men.

368
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:08,020
Only a handful of trained pilots
remained of Japan's once proud air army,

369
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:11,354
built for attack not defence.

370
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,888
When war began,
their Zero fighters had ruled the skies.

371
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:17,806
Now they were outdated and outgunned.

372
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:21,834
These men pitted their machines
against giant American Superfortresses

373
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:24,520
which now attacked the homeland.

374
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:31,035
They were young and brave,
but they were very few.

375
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,105
(shouting in Japanese)

376
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,419
(man speaks Japanese)

377
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:49,647
(translator) I felt that a Zero fighter

378
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:52,518
was to me what a sword
was to the samurai,

379
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:55,821
and I felt that I must
manipulate the plane

380
00:35:55,901 --> 00:35:58,356
just as if it were my own body.

381
00:35:58,433 --> 00:36:02,382
And I also believed that the cockpit
was a secret place

382
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:04,681
which would be my death place.

383
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:14,195
When we went on an attack,
we never took parachutes.

384
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:16,267
This was because we believed

385
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:22,677
we should never become prisoners
when shot down over enemy positions.

386
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,004
From ancient days, it was the belief
of the Japanese warrior

387
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:33,180
that to be taken prisoner alive
is sinful.

388
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:37,750
We, too, were always taught
that the modern Japanese soldier

389
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,500
should never become prisoner
because it is the greatest disgrace.

390
00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:45,344
(narrator)
With the imperial navy shattered,

391
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:48,677
the Saipan shield pierced,
the Philippines conquered,

392
00:36:48,763 --> 00:36:51,753
only the islands of Iwo Jima
and, finally, Okinawa,

393
00:36:51,832 --> 00:36:56,011
were left to bar the Allied advance
on Japan proper.

394
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,920
By April 1945, Iwo Jima had been taken.

395
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:05,289
Now an American army, protected by
massed warships, threatened Okinawa,

396
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:07,741
the last island before Japan.

397
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,737
In a desperate throw
to stave off the ultimate assault,

398
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,036
Japan once more
summoned its young men

399
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:18,838
to fight and die
as their ancestors had done.

400
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:21,898
Special squadrons were formed.

401
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:25,388
The kamikaze - men of the divine wind -

402
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:27,002
named for the typhoon

403
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:30,839
which had destroyed the invasion force
of Kublai Khan centuries before.

404
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:34,905
They drank a last cup of rice wine
and set off to die.

405
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,137
Their aircraft had been converted
into flying bombs.

406
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:52,899
Their mission was to crash them

407
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:56,079
onto the decks of enemy warships
round Okinawa.

408
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:19,134
(speaks Japanese)

409
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:23,735
(translator) As a commander,
I'm often asked

410
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:27,424
whether I went through hell
in sending out these pilots.

411
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:30,190
But, actually, the opposite is the case.

412
00:38:30,268 --> 00:38:33,105
We had a lot of pilots who volunteered,

413
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:36,904
but it was only a very few
who could leave on one attack.

414
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,277
And so it was more difficult
to choose a selected few.

415
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:43,958
All the other volunteers said,
"Send me! Send me!"

416
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,291
So it's difficult
to ask these people not selected

417
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:50,023
if they'll wait until another day.

418
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:56,119
On the other hand, those taking part
in the day's attack

419
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,077
were in very high spirits,

420
00:38:58,157 --> 00:39:02,183
and so there's no difficulty
in sending these men out.

421
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,405
But unlike an ordinary attack,

422
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:09,430
these kamikaze pilots, once they
took off, they never come back.

423
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:11,617
And so there was this sadness
in knowing

424
00:39:11,737 --> 00:39:16,025
that the people you were sending out
you'd never see again.

425
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:32,136
(narrator) The kamikaze
were shot out of the air.

426
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:36,018
They did severe damage, but failed.

427
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,259
The Americans invaded Okinawa.

428
00:39:55,661 --> 00:40:00,757
Okinawa was only 350 miles
from metropolitan Japan.

429
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:05,243
The nearer to the mainland,
the more fanatical the fighting.

430
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:48,324
On Okinawa,
only 7,000 Japanese soldiers survived.

431
00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:52,315
Over 100,000 died,
many by their own hand,

432
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:55,235
and 75,000 civilians.

433
00:41:14,187 --> 00:41:16,718
Mrs Yonaha, a student,

434
00:41:16,796 --> 00:41:19,207
was ready to die, too.

435
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:21,275
(speaks Japanese)

436
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:25,960
(translator) All around us,
the soldiers and the inhabitants

437
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:29,107
were running helter-skelter,
obviously confused.

438
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:33,781
For some reason, I followed the soldiers
and we got into a small shelter.

439
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,965
It was more to get out of the rain
than anything.

440
00:41:37,051 --> 00:41:40,924
We found several other soldiers
already in the hideout.

441
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:45,596
We could hear the US army calling us
through loudspeakers to come out.

442
00:41:45,682 --> 00:41:48,824
Whoever it was
spoke a very beautiful Japanese,

443
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:51,239
but we had been taught from a long time

444
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:55,303
that we should never surrender
and become prisoners of war.

445
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:59,217
So we let these broadcasts continue
all day long without any let-up.

446
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:03,327
The shouts came from the sea -
"Come out. Come out."

447
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:10,038
They were saying,
"We will not inflict any harm

448
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,410
on women and children and old people,

449
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:14,521
so please come out."

450
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:20,236
I had already decided to die
and felt that I should commit suicide.

451
00:42:20,323 --> 00:42:25,233
One of the soldiers had a hand grenade
and said, "Let's all commit suicide."

452
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,415
And we agreed.

453
00:42:27,535 --> 00:42:29,640
Once we had made that decision,

454
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:33,977
I felt a great relief
and a calmness come over me.

455
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:37,891
At first, of course,
I did not want to kill myself.

456
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:41,526
I wanted to escape somehow
and keep on living.

457
00:42:42,534 --> 00:42:47,051
But the loudspeakers began to increase
in intensity and in volume.

458
00:42:47,176 --> 00:42:50,973
We felt that the Americans
were coming in closer and closer,

459
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,000
so I asked the soldier to kill me,
together with himself.

460
00:42:55,078 --> 00:42:58,526
Just when I was waiting for the soldier
to pull the pin,

461
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:01,019
one of the other soldiers
took out a sword

462
00:43:01,101 --> 00:43:03,086
and started waving it around saying,

463
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:07,384
"You women and children get out.
You shouldn't die here."

464
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:10,644
We were quite startled
by the sudden shouting,

465
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,483
and so we stood up
and took a step backwards.

466
00:43:14,566 --> 00:43:17,708
The place in which we were hiding
was very small,

467
00:43:17,788 --> 00:43:21,269
so one step back
and we were outside the shelter.

468
00:43:21,356 --> 00:43:26,145
We looked up and saw two American
soldiers pointing pistols at us.

469
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:30,363
They didn't say anything,
but kept gesturing with their pistols.

470
00:43:30,448 --> 00:43:32,510
"Come out. Come out."

471
00:44:07,121 --> 00:44:09,577
The soldiers we had left inside

472
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:13,330
asked us not to tell the US soldiers
they were hiding

473
00:44:13,413 --> 00:44:16,511
because all of them
were going to commit suicide.

474
00:44:21,277 --> 00:44:25,641
(narrator)
On 2 July 1945, Okinawa fell.

475
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:31,553
In the home islands, the Japanese people
braced themselves for the storm to come.

476
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:35,006
The first Superfortresses over Tokyo
a few months earlier

477
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:39,113
were only the harbingers
of hundreds of others.

478
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:44,938
These were now to spew out
fire and high explosive

479
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:47,090
in a sustained aerial assault,

480
00:44:47,171 --> 00:44:51,306
systematically razing the cities
of Japan one after the other.

481
00:45:07,656 --> 00:45:10,525
There it is, the end of the line.

482
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:26,062
(narrator) In formations
of up to 2,000 at a time,

483
00:45:26,146 --> 00:45:30,968
round the clock, virtually unopposed,
they laid Japan's cities waste.

484
00:45:59,444 --> 00:46:03,929
Beneath them, the rush
to air-raid shelters as the sirens blew

485
00:46:04,009 --> 00:46:06,114
became a dreaded daily routine.

486
00:46:07,385 --> 00:46:10,407
(woman) I first ran into the shelter,

487
00:46:10,492 --> 00:46:17,584
but I didn't rely upon it
because it was very small and weak.

488
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:21,572
All people in the shelter were so tired

489
00:46:21,694 --> 00:46:26,986
and always pale and silent and...

490
00:46:27,065 --> 00:46:28,591
What I say?

491
00:46:28,676 --> 00:46:33,083
The children... not so crying

492
00:46:33,164 --> 00:46:37,375
because they were too tired
and too terrible to cry, I think.

493
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,024
So they were all silent.

494
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:54,332
(narrator) Japan's wooden cities
burned easily,

495
00:46:54,455 --> 00:46:56,713
and their citizens in them.

496
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:59,626
This man-made inferno in Tokyo

497
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:04,118
was worse even than that following
the great earthquake of 1923,

498
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,916
the capital's worst natural disaster.

499
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:15,012
(woman) Some distance from my house,

500
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:18,541
there was a lot of men died.

501
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:23,565
And my best friend lost her father

502
00:47:23,648 --> 00:47:26,790
and brother and sister at that night.

503
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:33,232
And her mother, suicide after that.

504
00:47:56,716 --> 00:47:59,050
The next morning,

505
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:04,839
I thought I want to see my house.

506
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:09,595
So I crossed the bridge
and went to my house.

507
00:48:09,682 --> 00:48:13,708
And whole houses were destroyed.

508
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:15,968
I was so tired...

509
00:48:18,045 --> 00:48:22,562
..to think anything bad,
but I hated the war.

510
00:48:22,648 --> 00:48:24,862
And I hated the war.

511
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:28,702
I was standing in pain

512
00:48:28,786 --> 00:48:31,469
and in silence, too.

513
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:35,723
(narrator)
Tokyo was a charred wasteland.

514
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:38,643
Only steel and concrete survived.

515
00:48:38,722 --> 00:48:42,017
16 square miles of the capital
were flattened.

516
00:48:42,136 --> 00:48:45,202
The stench of death
hung heavy over the ruins.

517
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:47,540
In one raid, in one night,

518
00:48:47,621 --> 00:48:49,651
over 70,000 perished.

519
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:55,710
In air raids on Japan, nearly
a quarter of a million civilians died.

520
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,351
Eight million were made homeless.

521
00:49:18,464 --> 00:49:21,453
Man and woman, boy and girl,

522
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:24,555
the survivors prepared
to defend their homeland,

523
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,514
to drive the invaders back into the sea
with wooden rifles,

524
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:32,388
bows and arrows, bamboo spears.

525
00:49:32,466 --> 00:49:37,409
But the end, when it came,
was to be from the sky -

526
00:49:37,492 --> 00:49:39,172
irresistible,

527
00:49:39,295 --> 00:49:41,553
unimaginable,

528
00:49:41,635 --> 00:49:43,620
mushroom-shaped.
