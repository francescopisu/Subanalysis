== Ripped & corrected by Kaitian ==

2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:08,724
(narrator) The bombing has stopped.
The fires are out.

3
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:11,290
Europe lies in ruin.

4
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:13,860
The dead are gone forever.

5
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:15,972
The living carry on.

6
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:27,669
Everywhere the same:

7
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:31,856
no gas, no water,
no telephones, no trams.

8
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,714
Time to count the cost.

9
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,279
Time to start again.

10
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,954
Springtime 1945.

11
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:53,829
The end of the war in Central Europe.

12
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,902
The end of the thousand-year Reich.

13
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:13,472
Untidy. Messy.

14
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:16,077
A time without pity.

15
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:22,410
A time of brutality,

16
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:24,216
rape.

17
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:25,899
revenge.

18
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,696
The Germans come back from the eastern
lands they'd tried to conquer,

19
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,991
where some had lived for generations.

20
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:51,482
They'd been bad masters.

21
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,363
Now they pay the price.

22
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:57,240
At least they are alive.

23
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:24,674
The last hours of the Wehrmacht,
an army in dissolution.

24
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:26,859
It has made war on the world.

25
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:29,695
Now it saves what it can.

26
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:33,920
(man #1) The mood of the German troops
who were surrendering was one of relief.

27
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:37,981
They were happy, for the most part,
to surrender.

28
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:41,164
They were interested in
getting to the American lines,

29
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:46,038
in preference to surrendering
to the advancing Russian line.

30
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,316
(narrator) A defeated army - but even
at the end, not always a broken one.

31
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,518
The habits of a lifetime die hard.

32
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:28,237
But at last, the blood-letting
is nearly over.

33
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:44,734
(man #2) You had a European civil war
that began in 1914.

34
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:47,302
There was a long armistice in that war.

35
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:51,410
It finally comes to an end in 1945.
In the process of coming to the end,

36
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:55,668
what happens is that
sweeping into Europe from the outside

37
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,732
are the Russians and the Americans.

38
00:04:57,857 --> 00:05:03,105
And they meet at Torgau
on the Elbe River in May of 1945 -

39
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:08,591
with the result that no European nation
wins the European civil war.

40
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,621
The winners in the European Civil War
are outsiders:

41
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:15,001
the Russians and the Americans -
most of all the Americans.

42
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:20,144
So that you have
the physical control of the Continent

43
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:24,662
in the hands of three outsiders -
because the British were a part of it,

44
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:26,505
although they only contributed 25%

45
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,459
of the whole total
to Eisenhower's Anglo-American force.

46
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:32,839
Britain, the United States and Russia
now control the Continent,

47
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,872
and they will decide what happens to it.

48
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,081
(narrator) Neither Russians
nor Americans had wanted this war.

49
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:45,957
Now comrades in arms,
they have won a great victory.

50
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,533
When their generals meet,

51
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:51,245
they can speak the language
of combat, of tanks and guns.

52
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,813
But have they anything in common
except soldiers' talk?

53
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:12,079
(man #1) The Russians were overjoyed -
but we also -

54
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,764
and there was handshaking
and back-slapping

55
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:18,377
and the exchange of souvenirs.

56
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:21,553
I have a Russian watch

57
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,202
and somebody's gold wedding band.

58
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:27,428
And I lost my watch.

59
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:31,490
I lost all sorts of insignia
from the uniform.

60
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:35,099
All the Russians were very friendly.
A lot of them didn't speak English.

61
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:38,165
Yet there were a few
that spoke beautiful English -

62
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,235
educated at Oxford and Cambridge.

63
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:41,815
I remember speaking to one,

64
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:45,222
and I thought, "I'll never forget
your face as long as I live."

65
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:47,522
"I'll never forget you."

66
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,127
He was rather young. He was quite
young. And he was very pleasant.

67
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,464
But you always kept feeling
that they really hated us,

68
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,892
which I'm sure they did.

69
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:13,262
(Ambrose)
The United States during the war

70
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,950
had been propagandised
into seeing Russia as a democracy,

71
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,451
a land of freedom lovers,

72
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:22,478
with essentially broad social aims
about the same as those of the West -

73
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:24,128
which seemed to make sense,

74
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:27,305
since they were clearly an enemy
of the Nazis, as we were.

75
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:29,878
Thus, it appeared
we had a great deal in common.

76
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:37,049
Fellow delegates, the President
of the United States of America.

77
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,664
(applause)

78
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:44,651
(narrator) San Francisco, April 1945,

79
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,792
a month before V-E Day:

80
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:49,715
the United Nations Organization is born.

81
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:54,201
The Charter of the United Nations,
which you are now signing,

82
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:58,690
is a solid structure upon which
we can build for a better world.

83
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,137
There was great hope in the world
that this would happen -

84
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:04,099
that this was the last war.

85
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,240
That the victors would now be able
to cooperate in peace,

86
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:11,002
as they had in war,
to see to it that "the four policemen",

87
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,725
Britain, France, the USSR
and the United States,

88
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:16,907
sometimes "the five policemen"
with China thrown in,

89
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:18,868
would be able to see to it

90
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:23,280
that there would be
no more aggression in the world.

91
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:26,267
That the war had meant something,

92
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:30,334
that it had been fought for something,
rather than simply against Nazism.

93
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,640
There is a time for making plans,

94
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:35,976
and there is a time for action.

95
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:39,315
The time for action is here, now!

96
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,918
(newsreel) Nation by nation,
the delegates stand up

97
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:47,135
for the great new charter
they hammered out.

98
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:50,854
50 nations standing side by side,
unanimous for peace.

99
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:53,579
Now final signing of the charter.

100
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,615
China signing first, as the first nation
attacked in this war -

101
00:08:57,694 --> 00:09:01,643
Dr Wellington Koo's signature
topping the long list to come.

102
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:07,701
For Russia, Ambassador Gromyko
commits his country also

103
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:09,922
to the agreements and objectives decided

104
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:13,374
after days and nights
of compromise and cooperation -

105
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,870
four main agencies upon which
the world now puts its hope.

106
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:20,552
(Ambrose) A better world
was going to emerge -

107
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:25,151
a non-colonial world,
a world of self-determination.

108
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:28,227
And this was felt very deeply in 1945,

109
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:31,602
even by the most cynical
of the world's leaders.

110
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:33,635
I suspect even Stalin felt it.

111
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:36,082
I'm sure that Harry Truman felt it.

112
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,771
And Winston Churchill felt it.
The common people everywhere felt it.

113
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,974
(narrator) Germany remains,
even in defeat,

114
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,392
the key to the problems of Europe.

115
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:54,199
She started the war,
so her leaders have to be punished.

116
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,732
The Germans themselves
have to be made to pay

117
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,871
for the suffering they have caused.

118
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:02,328
But they cannot pay
if Germany remains a heap of rubble,

119
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,738
or if the country is dismembered,
as some wish.

120
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:08,541
No one wants Germany to be strong again,

121
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:12,841
yet no one can face the consequences
of keeping her a ruin forever.

122
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:18,284
The answer: military control.

123
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,350
Four armies of occupation
will supervise Germany's recovery.

124
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:25,271
The watchful Allied generals
will build her up,

125
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,224
but only in order to make good again
what she has destroyed.

126
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:33,513
Germany can remain whole, united,

127
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:38,082
but must never be able
to threaten the peace again.

128
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:44,222
July 1945.

129
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:48,631
The military administration
gets under way.

130
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:51,162
American troops have occupied Leipzig,

131
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:54,037
a city well within
the Russian zone of occupation.

132
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:58,638
Now the Americans pull back -
west, across the River Elbe.

133
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:17,594
The Russians move in.

134
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:46,905
The Germans -
wary, watchful, nervously smiling -

135
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:50,235
see their Russian conquerors
for the first time.

136
00:11:58,262 --> 00:12:01,480
When the fighting stopped,
the armies ended up here.

137
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,244
But the occupation zones
had been decided earlier,

138
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,537
at the Big Three conference at Yalta.

139
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,501
There were to be four zones.

140
00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:11,298
The Russian zone
had the food and raw materials.

141
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:15,942
The Western zones - American,
British, French - had the industry.

142
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:18,314
For the occupation to work as intended,

143
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:20,813
there would have to be trade
between them.

144
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:24,648
Berlin, the capital, became the home
of the Allied Control Council -

145
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,830
a testing ground
for the plan to work together.

146
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:32,705
There's been some question as to
whether we weren't a little premature

147
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:37,152
in fixing these zones until we saw
how the armies were going to come out.

148
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:41,797
And there's some evidence to indicate
that our leaders underestimated

149
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,676
the striking force of the Anglo-American
armies that invaded Europe,

150
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:49,889
because when we adopted
the zonal positions

151
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:53,192
we gave up Saxony and Thuringia.

152
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,757
But on the other hand, we got back
good pieces of Western Austria,

153
00:12:57,837 --> 00:13:00,204
which had been occupied by the Soviets.

154
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:01,819
The thing that stands out here

155
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:05,155
is that the Russians
do let the West come into Berlin

156
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:07,226
which is 80 miles within their zone.

157
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:09,265
They didn't have to do it.

158
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:12,368
They could have acted in Berlin
as they acted in Poland.

159
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:16,010
They could have just said, "To hell
with you. We're not letting you in."

160
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:19,431
"We're not going to live up to
the agreements we signed at Yalta."

161
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,268
"We're going to hold on to Berlin -

162
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:25,030
after all, we captured it, we paid
the cost. 100,000 Russians died."

163
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,863
(narrator) Berlin, July 1945.

164
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,632
The Big Three meet
for the Potsdam Conference.

165
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:35,657
A crowded agenda
for this first meeting of victors.

166
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:42,828
But for the West,
one question dominates:

167
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:45,443
what does Stalin want?

168
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:49,503
(man) At our first meetings,
Stalin put forward at once

169
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:52,686
the demands
which the Russians maintained

170
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:55,913
right through until the meeting
at Potsdam.

171
00:13:56,032 --> 00:14:03,233
What he wanted was basically to ensure
the security of his own country,

172
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:06,081
regardless of the interests
of his neighbours.

173
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,690
I'd seen a good deal of him
during the war.

174
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:12,674
I went up to him and said, "This must be
a great satisfaction to you,

175
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:16,625
after all the trials
that you've been through

176
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:20,075
and the tragedy that you've
been through, to be here in Berlin."

177
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:24,449
He looked at me and said,
"Tsar Alexander got to Paris."

178
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:30,747
(narrator) The conference
takes no new decisions.

179
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:34,197
It simply confirms what was decided
at Yalta six months before.

180
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:37,461
What is new is the mood.

181
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,909
Despite smiles for the newsreels,

182
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:45,170
the Western leaders
and Stalin do not get on.

183
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,890
(Ambrose) The feeling -
especially in the States,

184
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,500
and most especially
with President Truman -

185
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:52,873
was that Stalin was another Hitler.

186
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:56,408
They didn't think,
"We made a great mistake in the war

187
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,366
and backed the wrong side."

188
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:01,927
They were perfectly clear that Hitler
was much the greater menace.

189
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:04,043
Hitler had to be crushed,

190
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:07,724
and the crushing of Hitler absolutely
depended upon the Red Army.

191
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,025
(narrator) The Red Army
has 300 divisions in Europe.

192
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:13,287
They are Stalin's trump card,

193
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:17,281
the source of his strength
at the conference table.

194
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:25,068
(K Ambrose) Suddenly you were faced
with the fact

195
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:27,404
that the Americans were demobilising -

196
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:30,552
or rather, at the time of Potsdam,
they were redeploying,

197
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:33,621
pulling the army out of Europe,
taking it back to the States

198
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,533
and getting it ready to send to Japan,

199
00:15:35,657 --> 00:15:38,188
as they expected
to have to invade the home islands

200
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,836
for the final defeat of Japan.

201
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:42,752
I was invited to see President Truman.

202
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:46,355
And he shut all the doors
and told me in great secrecy

203
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:48,618
the greatest secret of the war:

204
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,269
the fact that the Americans
had an atomic bomb,

205
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:54,216
which they were going to drop
very soon,

206
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,984
and which he thought
would bring the war to an end.

207
00:15:57,063 --> 00:15:59,354
The reason for his decision

208
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:03,500
was this would save thousands
upon thousands of Allied lives,

209
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,843
which would otherwise be lost

210
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:10,060
in a frightful massacre
on the shores of Japan itself.

211
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:13,934
He warned me I might find myself
suddenly in the position

212
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,308
with the Japanese having surrendered.

213
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:23,487
Then I saw Churchill,
and Churchill told me the same thing.

214
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:28,088
He said, "They will surrender.
What are you going to do about it?"

215
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:31,196
I said, "You've only just told me.
I haven't thought."

216
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:44,468
(narrator) August 1945.
The bomb is dropped.

217
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:47,271
The Japanese do surrender.

218
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:53,607
Their cities, too, have been laid waste,
their dreams of conquest shattered.

219
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:56,783
They, too, are at the mercy
of their conqueror.

220
00:16:56,907 --> 00:17:00,006
They do not know what lies in store.

221
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,954
(Ambrose) The Americans wanted Japan
rebuilt as quickly as possible,

222
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:11,327
and a highly industrialised Japan
to emerge from the war -

223
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:13,895
well within the American orbit.

224
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:17,616
Truman decided at Potsdam
that no one would be allowed into Japan

225
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,722
except for American troops.

226
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:23,104
The Aussies weren't let in,
the British were not let in,

227
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:27,822
and of course, most of all,
the Russians were not let in.

228
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:31,232
(narrator) The conqueror comes -

229
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,848
General MacArthur
with his American advisers,

230
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:36,298
his American court.

231
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:41,210
He will try and remake Japan
in America's image.

232
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:45,962
(cheering)

233
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,333
The prisoners are freed -

234
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:55,745
US airmen who burnt
Japan's cities to the ground.

235
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,892
They are the masters now.

236
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:13,318
In Europe it is still summer.

237
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:18,537
There are 700,000
concentration camp survivors.

238
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:21,111
It may be enough to be alive,

239
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:23,063
to be reunited,

240
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,053
to have survived,

241
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,781
to go home.

242
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:11,277
Six million former slave labourers -

243
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:17,115
Poles, Russians, Yugoslavs,
Estonians, Czechs, French -

244
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:19,562
free to pick up
the threads of their lives,

245
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,902
now that their German masters have gone.

246
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:40,857
Prisoners of war
with no country to go to -

247
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:45,152
deportees, Germans, soldiers, deserters.

248
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,188
(man) It was very difficult
to tell the difference

249
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:51,753
between a German refugee
and a Polish refugee

250
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:54,748
in the part of Germany
that I was located in -

251
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:56,781
I wouldn't know which were which.

252
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,509
You could be pretty well sure,

253
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,877
if they were humping things
on their back and carrying bags

254
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:05,716
but hadn't got a truck,
they were almost certainly refugees.

255
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:11,399
(narrator) Or perhaps SS guards
in stolen prison clothes.

256
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:25,700
Some choose death.

257
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:29,081
Himmler, lord of the SS, takes poison.

258
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,649
Some surrender or are caught.

259
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:36,521
Von Rundstedt, Hitler's general,
in full dress uniform.

260
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:41,658
Admiral Dönitz,
last leader of the Third Reich.

261
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:43,348
Albert Speer.

262
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:45,691
What to do with these broken monsters?

263
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:48,718
Stalin, at the Yalta Conference

264
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:52,021
that was attended
by President Roosevelt and Mr Churchill,

265
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:55,702
said that he thought 50,000

266
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:59,342
of the German general staff and officers

267
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,458
should be gathered together

268
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:04,294
and summarily executed.

269
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,521
He wasn't joking.

270
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:12,931
President Roosevelt thought he was,
and said, "Well, perhaps 49,000."

271
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,882
But Churchill said that he'd rather be
taken out into the garden

272
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,750
and shot at once
than be a party to such an iniquity.

273
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:25,357
But the Russians persisted
almost until the end

274
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:28,269
in saying that
there should be no trial -

275
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:32,565
these men were criminals
and should be immediately executed

276
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,101
the moment they were caught.

277
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:40,468
(narrator) There is a war crimes trial
at Nuremberg, Hitler's city.

278
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:45,648
The charges: crimes against peace,
crimes against humanity,

279
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:47,913
waging aggressive war.

280
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:50,444
The defendants are all German.

281
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:55,321
Göring is called
to plead guilty or not guilty.

282
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,823
(speaks German)

283
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,065
(judge bangs gavel)

284
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,517
(judge) I informed the court

285
00:22:22,597 --> 00:22:25,771
that defendants were not entitled

286
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:28,769
to make a statement.

287
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,676
You must plead guilty or not guilty.

288
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,551
(speaks German)

289
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,786
Rudolf Hess.

290
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,076
Nein!

291
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:07,207
(judge) That will be entered
as a plea of not guilty.

292
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:10,659
(Shawcross) I think you'd say
the purpose was a twofold one.

293
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:15,258
The first was retribution -
the punishment of people

294
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:18,486
who had launched this war
against the world.

295
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:21,818
And not only the war, but who,

296
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:25,352
prior to the commencement
of the war and during it,

297
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:29,415
had committed the most terrible crimes
against humanity -

298
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:35,327
as, for instance, by exterminating
certainly seven million Jews.

299
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:38,091
The second purpose of the trial

300
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,272
was, as we hoped,

301
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,684
to lay down the rules
of international law for the future -

302
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:51,362
not only making
the waging of aggressive war unlawful,

303
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:55,545
but, for the first time,
making the statesmen

304
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:58,570
who led their countries
into an aggressive war

305
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:01,753
personally responsible
for what they'd done.

306
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,781
1 2 million men, women and children
have died thus -

307
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:10,152
murdered in cold blood.

308
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,070
Millions upon millions more today
mourn their fathers and their mothers,

309
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:18,984
their husbands, their wives
and their children.

310
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:22,161
I was rather surprised
at the appearance of the defendants.

311
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:27,539
I thought, "Well, if I'd seen
these people in the Clapham omnibus,

312
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:29,761
I wouldn't have looked at them twice."

313
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:32,679
I think that was true of all of them,

314
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:36,861
except perhaps Hess and Ribbentrop,

315
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:39,809
who both looked
pretty miserable creatures,

316
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:45,261
and Göring, who looked
a very remarkable personality.

317
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,370
He did dominate the court.

318
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,854
He was the outstanding personality
in the court.

319
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:58,612
And sometimes, in the course of a long
trial like that, lasting over 200 days,

320
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,675
something would go wrong.

321
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,747
You would ask a witness a question,

322
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,932
and the answer you expected
would be "yes",

323
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:08,925
and the witness would answer "no".

324
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:13,679
At that point you had to be very careful
not to catch Göring's eye.

325
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:17,519
He was sitting at the corner
of the front row.

326
00:25:17,602 --> 00:25:20,319
If you glanced across at him
or caught his eye

327
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:22,432
when there was an incident like that,

328
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:27,335
he would raise his eyebrow and shake
his head in a rather smiling way,

329
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:30,063
and it would be very difficult
not to smile back.

330
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,149
(narrator) Göring cheats the gallows
with a cyanide pill.

331
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:47,860
The rest are hanged,
or imprisoned, or set free.

332
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:51,549
They have brought
their revolution to Germany,

333
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:54,193
and death to Europe.

334
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:56,643
Their mad adventure over,

335
00:25:56,731 --> 00:26:00,757
now they pay their reckoning
for Hitler's Reich.

336
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:13,293
The British come back to Asia
in triumph.

337
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,028
An empty victory -

338
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:17,747
India's no longer docile.

339
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,463
Two million of her troops
fought for Britain in Britain's war.

340
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:24,802
Now they want their own country
to be free.

341
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:28,718
His Majesty's African troops,
they want freedom, too.

342
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:31,594
Malaya, Burma.

343
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:36,464
Britain is too weak to hold them,
even if she wants to.

344
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:43,028
The main effect of the war against Japan
in the Far East

345
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:48,358
was the nourishing
of the spirit of nationalism in Asia.

346
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:51,160
A large part of Asia
had been under British rule,

347
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,654
and most of that
that was not under British rule

348
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:56,339
was under Dutch rule
or some European rule,

349
00:26:56,422 --> 00:26:58,953
and the people were beginning to aspire

350
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:03,242
to the creation
of their own political institutions.

351
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:06,349
The demonstration by the Japanese

352
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:10,154
that the British could be beaten,
and beaten very severely,

353
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:14,335
naturally encouraged in the eyes
of the people of Southeast Asia

354
00:27:14,414 --> 00:27:17,283
the belief that they, too,
might be able to secure

355
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,659
a much stronger position
against the British

356
00:27:19,746 --> 00:27:21,469
than they'd dreamt possible.

357
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:25,727
This had a great effect on opinion
in India and all over Southeast Asia.

358
00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:30,553
Suddenly I found myself responsible,
as the supreme commander,

359
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:34,740
for an enormous area of the globe,

360
00:27:34,822 --> 00:27:36,349
with a distance

361
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:38,156
of 6,000 miles across it -

362
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:41,106
as far as from London to Bombay,

363
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,362
with 128 million starving
and rather rebellious people

364
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,169
who'd just been liberated,

365
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:52,613
with 123,000 prisoners of war
and internees,

366
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:56,610
many of whom were dying and whom
I had to try and recover quickly.

367
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:58,411
And at the very beginning,

368
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:03,161
I had some 700,000
Japanese soldiers, sailors and airmen

369
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:07,001
to take the surrender, disarm,
put into prison camps,

370
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:10,226
awaiting transportation back.

371
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:14,256
It sounds a big problem, but I had
no idea what I really was in for.

372
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:18,928
What in really was in for
was trying to re-establish civilisation

373
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:21,076
and the rule of law and order

374
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:24,458
through this vast part of the world.

375
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:27,452
We didn't even know
what the conditions were going to be.

376
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:32,244
I had no staff
really trained or qualified

377
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:33,815
to help me in this task -

378
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:36,577
except some professional
civil affairs officers

379
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:40,261
from various countries concerned,
whose one idea was to go back

380
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:44,250
and carry on where they left off
three or four years before.

381
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:49,505
(narrator)
The police are not ideal either.

382
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:52,884
Indonesians do not want the Dutch back.

383
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,412
If order must be maintained
in the East Indies,

384
00:28:56,494 --> 00:28:59,712
there is only one force to do it:

385
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:01,822
the Japanese army.

386
00:29:01,903 --> 00:29:06,463
Mountbatten uses them there,
and in Singapore as well.

387
00:29:09,422 --> 00:29:12,214
(Mountbatten)
It may sound odd now, after the war,

388
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:17,400
but at the time - and it still didn't
make sense - what was I to do?

389
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:20,424
If I was to order them
to lay down their arms

390
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,799
and concentrate themselves
in prison camps,

391
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:27,098
and leave the outside world
without policemen or anything at all,

392
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,365
that would have been very odd.

393
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:32,163
No, I think they had to carry on
as they were

394
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:35,924
until they were effectively relieved -
that's the only order I gave.

395
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:37,959
I didn't consciously employ them.

396
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,254
They carried on until
I could relieve them

397
00:29:40,341 --> 00:29:44,018
with Allied soldiers
as soon as possible.

398
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:50,084
(narrator)
Americans are in Japan to stay.

399
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:54,068
Almost everywhere else in Asia,
white men prepare to leave.

400
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:58,516
Reluctantly, uncomprehendingly,
the Dutch go.

401
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:00,249
The French are different -

402
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:02,433
they will not give up Indochina.

403
00:30:06,197 --> 00:30:09,645
They send troops to take it back,
commanded by General Leclerc,

404
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,482
a hero of the European war.

405
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:15,015
(Mountbatten) When I spoke to Leclerc
when I was about to turn over

406
00:30:15,135 --> 00:30:18,660
the military responsible for
the south of French Indochina to him,

407
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:24,797
I urged him to try and make friends with
local inhabitants, local insurgents.

408
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:27,442
I said, "That's the way
for France to come back -

409
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,249
with a friendly relationship."

410
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:33,737
"I don't think you can impose by
military means your old colonial rule."

411
00:30:33,856 --> 00:30:36,877
He said, "I see the point.
I'm sorry, I'm a soldier."

412
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:39,756
"My instructions are to take over
the military way."

413
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,709
And that, of course, is what he did.

414
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:51,339
(machine-gun fire)

415
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:57,479
(narrator) So the killing goes on.

416
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,168
It goes on there to this day.

417
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:11,287
Berlin in the first months
of occupation.

418
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:16,043
Cheery K Fräuleins, once the handmaidens
of Hitler's new order.

419
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:36,456
Some of the victors
have the time of their lives.

420
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:51,956
(man #1) Germany was on
a cigarette and chocolate-bar economy

421
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:55,440
right after the war, right after combat.

422
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:58,478
As a consequence,
there was little an American soldier

423
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:00,587
couldn't buy if he wanted to buy it -

424
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,501
including services of all sorts.

425
00:32:08,532 --> 00:32:10,288
(man #2) It's the same old story -

426
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:12,512
if a boy and a girl
want to get together,

427
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:16,395
there isn't any law that says you can't
or you're not going to do it.

428
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:21,113
The black market was blooming.

429
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,526
We had nothing. A piece of soap

430
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,822
was a most valuable possession.

431
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,168
So...

432
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,617
you practically prostituted yourself,

433
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:34,153
just to get a piece of soap,
maybe a can of coffee,

434
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:39,144
or maybe even some cigarettes -
people who smoked. I didn't.

435
00:32:39,221 --> 00:32:41,676
But you just did everything.

436
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:50,723
I know people - very, very fine people -
who just would have done anything.

437
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:54,948
And you lose some of your human dignity
when you are so hungry,

438
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:58,861
when you are so without food,

439
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:01,350
without clothing, without everything.

440
00:33:02,507 --> 00:33:05,114
(man) How could you blame
a starving girl?

441
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:08,443
She might not want stockings,
she might not want cigarettes,

442
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:09,871
or a bicycle, or butter,

443
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:12,666
but she did want badly something,

444
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:14,429
which could be provided

445
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:19,380
by the appropriate,
typically, British or American GI.

446
00:33:22,953 --> 00:33:24,863
I had to give up
smoking in the streets.

447
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:27,163
In those days I was a cigarette smoker.

448
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,584
Carelessly, you'd throw your cigarette

449
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:30,844
on the floor.

450
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:32,002
Before you knew it,

451
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:33,845
a fellow had almost caught it.

452
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:37,645
He'd been trailing you
because he saw you were smoking.

453
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:43,931
I remember that in one of the cinemas
in one of the big towns

454
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:47,843
there was going to be a performance
for the American GIs.

455
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:50,644
They had queued up before it started.

456
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:56,243
The Americans don't allow smoking,
but they were all smoking in the queues.

457
00:33:56,328 --> 00:34:02,460
Practically opposite every smoker,
there was a line of hungry-looking men -

458
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:05,794
hungry for tobacco -
waiting until the doors opened.

459
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,754
And then as the cigarettes fell
into the street, there was a rush.

460
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,584
The key place in that queue
was just at the entrance to the cinema,

461
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:17,225
because that's where
most of the cigarettes came down.

462
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:30,658
(man) In retrospect, being a conqueror
seems very dubious to me,

463
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:33,346
but at the time it seemed quite right.

464
00:34:33,424 --> 00:34:37,406
We were convinced of our virtue
and the German vice,

465
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:42,433
and it was very pleasing
to be able to tell them what to do.

466
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:52,404
(narrator) Time to rebuild.

467
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:56,897
Time for Germany to recover,
so it can start to pay.

468
00:35:00,584 --> 00:35:03,726
The Russians want
20 billion dollars in reparations.

469
00:35:03,806 --> 00:35:07,101
Americans think that's more
than Germany itself is worth.

470
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:11,429
The West won't help the Russians
collect that much.

471
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:15,805
They stop sending
goods and hardware to the East.

472
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,064
The Russians send little food
and raw materials to the West.

473
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:24,942
The Allies are starting to fall out
with each other.

474
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:47,689
The Germans, caught in the middle,
get on with rebuilding themselves.

475
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:51,488
There are no slave labourers now.

476
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,535
(Spencer) They had cleared the street,
and trams went by.

477
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:17,413
I'd have hated to ride on one.

478
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,413
They were packed to the roof -

479
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:22,974
there were people hanging
on the outside, though it was cold,

480
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,466
there were people standing
on the buffers.

481
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:28,347
And there were patient queues
to get on these trams,

482
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:31,378
but nobody ever seemed to me to get off.

483
00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:45,080
(translation)
Horst Gerlach, born 4 May...

484
00:36:47,804 --> 00:36:52,551
(narrator) The Suchdienst -
the missing persons register.

485
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:59,732
1 2 million Germans,
driven from the eastern lands,

486
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:01,568
trying to find each other.

487
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,288
They're not alone.

488
00:37:05,297 --> 00:37:08,668
60 million Europeans have been uprooted.

489
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,313
Some never find their way home again.

490
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:26,156
November 1945.

491
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:30,191
The Germans live
on 1500 calories a day -

492
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:32,376
a third of what the American troops get.

493
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:38,164
(woman) It was a very hard time,
because we suffered from hunger.

494
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,850
The Americans had much food.

495
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:45,959
My mother decided to work for them.

496
00:37:46,037 --> 00:37:52,017
And I decided to work for them, too.

497
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,428
My mother was in the kitchen,

498
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,850
and I was a waitress.

499
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:03,213
Well, it was rather hard for me,

500
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:10,665
because the Americans ordered
that I had to smile always.

501
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:15,805
And I couldn't smile, because I...

502
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:23,510
The American officers were so proud,
and they treated us as Nazis.

503
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:28,348
(narrator) No peace conference
ever takes place.

504
00:38:28,427 --> 00:38:31,067
There is no new Versailles.

505
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:33,371
Germany is divided.

506
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:36,365
The occupation zones become frontiers -

507
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:40,547
unintended, unwelcome and permanent.

508
00:38:41,508 --> 00:38:45,338
(Ambrose) If you have a unified Germany
that belongs to the Russians,

509
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:48,901
you have Russian domination
of the whole of the Continent.

510
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:54,127
If you have a unified Germany that is
in the hands of the Anglo-Americans,

511
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,883
then you have
a Western domination of the Continent

512
00:38:57,965 --> 00:38:59,798
that would cheat Russia

513
00:38:59,883 --> 00:39:03,058
out of her just claims to the security

514
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:06,472
that was Stalin's number-one concern

515
00:39:06,558 --> 00:39:08,697
all through the war and afterwards.

516
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:12,187
So dividing Germany along the Elbe

517
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:15,187
was probably the best solution.

518
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:17,830
One's tempted to use words
like "fair" and "just",

519
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:20,248
but I don't think they apply here -

520
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,392
it's the workable solution.

521
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:26,652
Wherever the Red Army was
in a contiguous territory,

522
00:39:26,813 --> 00:39:29,180
they would install a Sovietised system -

523
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:31,178
and there was no argument about it.

524
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,794
We did the very best we could on Poland.

525
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,895
The tragedy of Poland is that she's got
Germany for a neighbour on one side

526
00:39:38,015 --> 00:39:41,768
and Russia for a neighbour on the other
side. It's a terrible position.

527
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:44,917
It's always been the Polish dilemma
and the Polish tragedy -

528
00:39:44,997 --> 00:39:47,680
Poland has to fall into the orbit
of one or the other.

529
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:50,933
Given those choices, and given
the natures of Hitler and Stalin,

530
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:52,394
I suppose if I were a Pole,

531
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:55,957
I'd say, "We're better off under
Stalin's heel than under Hitler's."

532
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,883
Soldiers of Poland,

533
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:04,902
I wish you all a speedy and safe return
to your home country.

534
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:07,582
(band plays)

535
00:40:19,944 --> 00:40:24,003
(narrator) Poland's tragedy.
Russia's triumph.

536
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:26,192
Victory Day in Moscow.

537
00:40:27,463 --> 00:40:30,485
(Ambrose) The Russians paid
an enormous price for victory,

538
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,294
but they did gain from the war -

539
00:40:32,373 --> 00:40:35,243
security for themselves,
control of East Europe,

540
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:38,164
and the opportunity,
which they took advantage of,

541
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:40,534
to exploit East Europe economically.

542
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:45,642
(narrator) A nation bled white by war
has somehow to rebuild.

543
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:48,254
The Soviet Union has survived.

544
00:40:48,332 --> 00:40:52,128
It is one of the world's great powers,

545
00:40:52,206 --> 00:40:54,159
and now everyone knows it.

546
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:10,388
London, 1945.

547
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:12,725
Eros comes home.

548
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:24,659
Britain has survived, too.
But a curious victory.

549
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:32,054
You can picnic again,

550
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:35,053
but look out for unexploded mines.

551
00:41:57,574 --> 00:41:59,833
No invasion, no occupation,

552
00:41:59,914 --> 00:42:02,598
yet the nation's treasure is exhausted.

553
00:42:02,676 --> 00:42:07,193
For six years it has fought
and been a workshop for war.

554
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:11,719
The bullets have been bought
with Britain's wealth.

555
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:13,263
They won't be needed now.

556
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:15,480
Britain has won the war,

557
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,359
and has nearly gone bankrupt doing it.

558
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:23,576
The British had as many problems,
if not more, in recovering from victory

559
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,994
as the Germans did
in recovering from defeat.

560
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:29,983
The British... What did Britain
get out of the war?

561
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:34,977
Not very much. Not very much.
She lost a very great deal.

562
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:37,617
I suppose, if you want
to look at it positively,

563
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:40,996
she got a moral claim on the world

564
00:42:41,076 --> 00:42:44,709
as the nation that had
stood against Hitler alone for a year,

565
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:47,896
and had provided the moral leadership
against the Nazis

566
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:51,734
at a time when everyone else
was willing to cave in to the Nazis.

567
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,227
(narrator) America, 1945.

568
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:58,946
The boys come home - again.

569
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:22,727
(Ambrose) The big winner
in World War II

570
00:43:22,814 --> 00:43:25,269
is the United States
of America - by far.

571
00:43:25,346 --> 00:43:28,641
We get much more out of the war
than anyone else.

572
00:43:28,721 --> 00:43:32,703
There's a paradox here -
very quickly after the war was over,

573
00:43:32,788 --> 00:43:36,999
Americans began to take the attitude:
"Aha! Here it is again."

574
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:40,183
"We got fooled once more,
as we did in World War I."

575
00:43:40,268 --> 00:43:42,101
"We made this enormous effort,

576
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,478
we beat the Germans,
we beat the Japanese."

577
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:48,089
"And who wins? The Russians.
The Russians get East Europe out of it."

578
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:50,309
"We were suckers."

579
00:43:50,396 --> 00:43:53,113
This was very widely felt
in the United States.

580
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:56,600
It was a strange attitude to hold
when you look,

581
00:43:56,687 --> 00:43:59,404
with whatever objectivity
that one can muster,

582
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:01,669
at what the real results
of the war were.

583
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:07,926
(narrator) Americans come home
to a country untouched by bombs,

584
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:11,642
a country twice as rich
as when the war began -

585
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:13,710
more food than it can eat,

586
00:44:13,796 --> 00:44:15,749
more clothes than it can wear,

587
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,928
more steel than it can use.

588
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:22,690
The only country in the world
with money to spare.

589
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:25,336
The country with the atom bomb.

590
00:44:54,613 --> 00:44:58,595
The Germans, too, are victors -
though they do not know it yet.

591
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:01,090
The soldiers come home
from internment camps,

592
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:04,544
put on ordinary clothes,
go back to work.

593
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:09,072
Feudal, Prussian, peasant Germany
is no more.

594
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:12,174
In its place,
the structure of a modern state.

595
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:16,818
Ironically enough,
that was Hitler's work.

596
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:19,312
Now, in the West,
a new Germany will emerge:

597
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:23,382
rich and free and democratic -
and strong.

598
00:45:24,804 --> 00:45:28,601
England, too, changes -
though some voices stay the same.

599
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:31,738
You will be taken
to the civilian clothing depot

600
00:45:31,824 --> 00:45:33,624
to get your civilian suit.

601
00:45:33,704 --> 00:45:36,878
After that, a bus
will take you down to the station.

602
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:40,680
You're free then
to push off home as fast as you can.

603
00:45:41,107 --> 00:45:44,054
(newsreel)
The procedure is comprehensive -

604
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:46,281
there are a lot of things
to be thought of

605
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:48,348
when a man or a woman
leaves the army.

606
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:51,075
Civilian life nowadays
is fairly full of snags,

607
00:45:51,158 --> 00:45:53,569
and the ex-soldier
must be armed against them

608
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:55,408
when he marches into civvy street.

609
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:58,215
Information pamphlet.
1 4-day ration card.

610
00:45:58,293 --> 00:46:01,240
- Good luck. Thanks for all you've done.
- Thank you, sir.

611
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:04,924
- AC Clott?
- Sir! 252.

612
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,834
(narrator)
Britain's soldiers come home,

613
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:12,557
to a land without much cheer,

614
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:17,736
to a land of ration cards, queues,
black markets and austerity.

615
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:21,223
But to a land of National Health

616
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,525
and the welfare state.

617
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:26,754
To a land of free men and women.

618
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:30,130
To a world no longer at war.

619
00:46:57,102 --> 00:47:01,924
In the first place,
if we hadn't won the war,

620
00:47:02,012 --> 00:47:05,034
it would have meant
that the Japanese and the Germans

621
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,417
would have won it.

622
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,985
I think you can imagine what kind
of a world that would have been.

623
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:17,699
It's true that the problem of Russia -
the Soviet Union, rather -

624
00:47:17,779 --> 00:47:20,877
emerged sharply after the war.

625
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,643
But I would say on the whole

626
00:47:22,727 --> 00:47:27,321
that that was the lesser of
the two evils that could have happened.

627
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:34,576
And the more or less principles
on which democracies operate,

628
00:47:34,696 --> 00:47:37,227
on which societies are based,

629
00:47:37,305 --> 00:47:41,974
certainly didn't get much satisfaction
out of the results of the war -

630
00:47:42,061 --> 00:47:45,619
but I think this was inevitable,
given the Soviet system.

631
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:48,880
On the other hand, there's still
a large portion of the world

632
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:53,254
that still is able to exercise
a certain degree of freedom,

633
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,828
particularly in their internal affairs.

634
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,895
Not that by any means

635
00:47:57,982 --> 00:48:01,353
that everything that isn't communist
is perfect - far from it.

636
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:05,034
But I think the world
would have been quite intolerable

637
00:48:05,117 --> 00:48:07,757
under Nazi and Japanese rule.

638
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,899
The principal effects of the war
on people and political systems

639
00:48:11,984 --> 00:48:14,776
bore upon the countries
in Eastern Europe -

640
00:48:14,861 --> 00:48:21,647
Poland most of all, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Romania and those countries.

641
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:25,055
These peoples were hoping,
or some of them were hoping,

642
00:48:25,142 --> 00:48:29,123
that the war would liberate them
from the threat of Nazi tyranny,

643
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:34,194
and in fact at the end of it they found
themselves in the communist bloc -

644
00:48:34,272 --> 00:48:37,829
which I must say was far less sinister
than the Nazi bloc.

645
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:41,287
This was a very solid achievement
of the Second World War -

646
00:48:41,368 --> 00:48:44,543
a very much less sinister
type of tyranny

647
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:46,920
replaced a highly sinister tyranny.

648
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:50,106
But this was not the freedom
for which they had hoped,

649
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:53,061
and for which, to a large extent,
we had fought.

650
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:55,829
The most important single result
of World War II

651
00:48:55,908 --> 00:48:58,395
is that the Nazis were crushed,

652
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:02,733
the militarists in Japan were crushed,
the Fascists in Italy were crushed.

653
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:05,376
Surely justice
has never been better served.

654
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:05,872
(narrator) For 30 years now,
there has been peace in Europe.
