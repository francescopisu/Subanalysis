2
00:00:03,739 --> 00:00:06,837
(narrator) August 25, 1944.

3
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:10,368
Paris was liberated.

4
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:26,563
That same day, to the east,
Romania changed sides,

5
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:30,514
and with her defection
went Hitler's only natural oil supply.

6
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:32,774
Bulgaria had already quit the Axis,

7
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:38,714
and Finland, too, began negotiating
with the Russians for an armistice.

8
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,121
General de Gaulle, the Free French
leader, enters his capital,

9
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:51,682
a capital four years before he had left
a comparatively unknown soldier.

10
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:55,903
Now he was being greeted
as the very soul of France.

11
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:04,961
For Parisians, the dark years
of German occupation were over.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,710
Could it be long
before the rest of Europe was freed too?

13
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,762
August 15, 1944.

14
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:24,210
Operation Anvil,
the Allied invasion of southern France.

15
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:37,063
With the break-out from the Normandy
beachhead under way to the north,

16
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:39,481
Anvil was meant to begin
the pincer movement

17
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:41,549
on Hitler's Germany from all sides -

18
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:46,621
the pincer movement
that was to squeeze the Third Reich dry.

19
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:53,181
We leapt out near St Tropez and
I thought, "They'll open up any minute,"

20
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,173
and suddenly out of the mists

21
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:58,090
on our particular beach
there came a Frenchman.

22
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:01,006
He carried a tray of champagne glasses.

23
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:02,688
And we all stopped.

24
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:05,139
Clearly, this was utterly unexpected,

25
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,784
and he smiled and said,
"Soyez les bienvenus, Monsieur. "

26
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:13,509
"Welcome. But if I may venture a little
criticism, you are somewhat late."

27
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,071
From there on it was known to the troops
as the "Champagne Campaign".

28
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:25,129
(narrator) Everywhere, during
those mad, joyful weeks of August 1944,

29
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:27,090
the Germans were being driven back

30
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,810
towards the borders
of their own country.

31
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,482
(gunfire)

32
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:39,858
Those Frenchmen who had
collaborated with the hated Boche

33
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:42,203
became ever more desperate.

34
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:57,541
Those Frenchwomen who had
consorted with their conquerors

35
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:00,771
were now singled out
for special treatment.

36
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,385
Thousands upon thousands of sullen,
bewildered Germans were taken prisoner,

37
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:34,639
sometimes whole divisions at a time.

38
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:38,514
(newsreel) 20,000 German troops
are surrendered

39
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,392
by their commander,
Major General Erich Elster.

40
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:46,572
General Elster hands over his pistol
as a token of surrender.

41
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:50,102
General Elster
commanded the Biarritz area

42
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:52,367
from the Pyrenees to the Bay of Biscay.

43
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:09,206
(narrator) To many in the Allied camp,
the war seemed as good as over.

44
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:12,808
Indeed, there was talk
of being back home for Christmas.

45
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,262
But the top brass
didn't always see eye to eye

46
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,805
on just how the final victory
was to be won.

47
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:20,293
(man) Montgomery argued

48
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:24,783
that the Germans had had
a very heavy defeat in Normandy.

49
00:05:24,902 --> 00:05:29,005
They'd lost
approximately 500,000 troops.

50
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:33,994
43 divisions had been smashed,
and 2,000 tanks.

51
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,060
This was the moment to really hit them.

52
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:42,470
And what he advocated
was a strong drive up the coastal plain,

53
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:48,451
with the right on the Ardennes and the
left probably almost on the coastline.

54
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:52,744
Day and night, never letting up,
never giving them time to recover.

55
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:55,666
And, of course, he would be
in command of this.

56
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:58,919
And we'd go right through,
bounce the crossing of the Rhine,

57
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:01,220
come round behind the Ruhr,
cut them off,

58
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:03,947
and the war would be over in 1944.

59
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,057
Eisenhower said, "No. I don't
like this. It's a pincerlike thrust."

60
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,241
"You're not touching a lot of the troops

61
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:11,926
which are in France."

62
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,465
"I propose to advance on a broad front,

63
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,222
right up to the Rhine,

64
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:18,914
and then do a crossing of the Rhine

65
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:21,021
and finish the war there."

66
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:23,665
But... That was perhaps safer,

67
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,200
but it meant that the war

68
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:27,236
couldn't be finished in 1944.

69
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:30,761
I think the British were very slow

70
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:32,798
to realise that the main effort

71
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,908
for war in Europe

72
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,974
lay with the Americans.

73
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:40,623
I think the British press
was probably slow, as well.

74
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:43,846
I think people forgot

75
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:50,670
that the great weight of divisions
and supplies and so on were American.

76
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:53,976
After we broke out from the bridgehead,

77
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:57,229
supply for a very long time
had to come over the beaches

78
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:59,454
or be carried by air.

79
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:03,020
Army groups found often that
they couldn't do what they wanted to

80
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:06,708
for lack of supplies,
particularly petrol.

81
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:24,318
(narrator) Each tank used
a gallon of petrol a mile.

82
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:26,884
The trucks carrying the stuff

83
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:29,844
stretched back 250 miles
to the Normandy beaches.

84
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,218
Such had been the speed
of the Allied break-out

85
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:37,208
that pockets of German troops
had been left behind,

86
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:42,198
and so the road convoys had often to run
a gauntlet of enemy sniping on the way.

87
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:48,440
The lorry drivers
had nicknamed the area

88
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:52,434
between Paris and the front line
"Injun country".

89
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:08,051
The hardest fighting of all
was along the coast.

90
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:10,345
Every port had been garrisoned by Hitler

91
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:13,574
with orders to fight
to the proverbial last round.

92
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:20,747
Le Havre, Dieppe, Boulogne, Calais,
Dunkirk, had all to be assaulted in turn

93
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:22,933
by separate set-piece battle.

94
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:28,915
Hitler knew supply
would be the Allies' main headache,

95
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:32,981
hence his determination to hang on
to the Channel ports as long as possible

96
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:37,201
and, when finally yielded,
to see they were destroyed utterly.

97
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,059
One third of Montgomery's forces

98
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:51,240
were engaged in clearing Germans
from the Channel ports

99
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:53,857
while the rest pushed on into Belgium.

100
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,634
(Horrocks) My really big moment
was when we crossed the frontier,

101
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:08,048
because, you see,
I had commanded the rearguard

102
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:10,113
during the withdrawal to Dunkirk.

103
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,687
I was then a battalion commander.

104
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,829
And I'd been doing flank guard
and rear guard to the 3rd Division,

105
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:21,321
commanded by a certain Field Marshal
Montgomery, who was then a general.

106
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:23,812
And I was very ashamed of myself.

107
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:27,266
We'd advanced
to the cheers of the Belgian people,

108
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:32,595
and now a few days later, back we were
going through these ashen-faced crowds,

109
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,131
terribly despondent -

110
00:09:34,214 --> 00:09:37,542
they knew they were going
to be occupied again by the Germans.

111
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:42,069
And I kept on saying, "Don't worry.
We'll come back."

112
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:46,061
And as we crossed the frontier,
we had come back.

113
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:51,512
And a young man - I suppose
he saw the red round my hat, you know -

114
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,995
and he ran across to my tank.

115
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:59,829
There were tears pouring down his face.
And he held out his hand like this,

116
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,212
and he said, "I knew you'd come back!
I knew you'd come back!"

117
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,743
(cheering)

118
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:20,283
A friend of mine in Brussels told me
that he heard the sound of tanks,

119
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:22,502
but they were quite used to that.

120
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,196
He looked out of the window,
and he said to himself:

121
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:28,066
"Those are different.
They don't seem to be German."

122
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,176
Then he opened the window and leant out,
and somebody waved.

123
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:36,772
He said, "They're British!"
And he tore down into the street,

124
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:39,963
and so did everybody else in Brussels.

125
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:44,636
There has never been such a scene
as when we liberated Brussels, never.

126
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:47,864
And some of the really tough
old 30 Corps veterans

127
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:52,080
still blush to think
of the things that happened.

128
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,986
So far, so good.
Now we come to the mistakes.

129
00:11:16,064 --> 00:11:21,356
We were ordered to halt. The reason
was that we were outrunning our supply.

130
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:23,769
Now, this was wrong,

131
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:29,099
because we had 100 kilometres' worth
of petrol with our vehicles,

132
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:33,515
and another 100 kilometres'
within about 24 hours' reach,

133
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:36,541
and they should, in my opinion,
have taken a chance.

134
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:39,386
Because that day that we were halted,

135
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,217
the only thing between us and the Rhine

136
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:47,327
was one division of very old gentlemen.

137
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:51,126
We called them "stomach divisions",
because they were sort of my age,

138
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:53,570
and all had things wrong
with their tummies.

139
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:55,955
They'd been guarding
the coast of Holland,

140
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:57,760
never seen a shot fired in anger,

141
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,473
and they'd have been delighted
to move peacefully into our POW camps

142
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:05,620
without having to indulge in this horrid
war - that was the sort of mentality.

143
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:08,770
Plus one Dutch SS battalion - nothing.

144
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,181
We could have brushed straight through
them, bounced the crossing to the Rhine,

145
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:17,669
cut all the Germans in Holland
off from the Ruhr,

146
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,659
and then got round behind the Ruhr.

147
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:23,115
Unquestionably, it was, to my mind,
a very bad mistake.

148
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:24,920
We should have taken the risk.

149
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,103
When we were allowed to advance,
which was September 7,

150
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,323
we made ten miles in four days.

151
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:38,267
We had previously done
250 miles in seven days.

152
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,943
We were no longer pursuing.
We were now fighting again.

153
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:52,312
Then, on September 11,

154
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,649
I got my orders for Arnhem.

155
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,983
(narrator) The three main waterways
of the Rhine delta

156
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,860
lay between the Allied spearheads
and Germany proper:

157
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:04,622
the Maas, the Waal and the Neder Rijn.

158
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,071
Montgomery's plan was to lay an
airborne carpet across these waterways,

159
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:11,329
capture the bridges,

160
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,903
and rush a mobile force round
the left flank of the Siegfried line

161
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:20,768
to cut off the Ruhr, and so end
German resistance before Christmas 1944.

162
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:11,565
I've got it.

163
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:44,169
(Strong) Many people will tell you
that the plan was wrong -

164
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:46,816
there were too many objectives,

165
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:50,844
or the parachutists were not landed
in proper places and so on.

166
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:54,484
And the weather, of course,
was not good, and did interrupt it.

167
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:57,670
But I think that
if more attention had been paid

168
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:00,243
to what you might call
the enemy's dispositions,

169
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:03,468
then I think the plan
would have been alright.

170
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,870
(De Guingand) Airborne troops
who landed at Arnhem

171
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:31,052
suddenly found themselves
up against some German armoured units

172
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,193
that were refitting there, and
just happened to be there at the time.

173
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:38,376
(gunfire)

174
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:54,375
(Strong) Among the first officers
who were landed among the parachutists,

175
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,404
the Germans found
a complete copy of our plan.

176
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:03,155
And this was whisked off
to the German commander on the spot,

177
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:06,108
and, of course, from then on
he had all the information

178
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:08,800
of what we were trying to do.

179
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:34,996
(De Guingand)
It's anyone's guess whether,

180
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,108
having got that Rhine bridgehead,

181
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:40,026
at that time of year,
with the bad weather setting in,

182
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:42,439
whether we'd have been able
to maintain that

183
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,047
for several months during the winter.

184
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,112
Because one knew from experience
how magnificent the Germans were

185
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:52,295
at retrieving critical situations.

186
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:58,667
The battle went on
for three or four days,

187
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:01,967
and we couldn't really
make any progress.

188
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:07,567
Eventually Montgomery decided
that he couldn't go on,

189
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:11,979
and that the operation
was to be called off,

190
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:16,157
and get as many people back across
the Rhine as possible, which he did.

191
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:19,383
We lost quite a lot. But I think
one's got to be quite honest,

192
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:23,184
and say that it failed in its object.

193
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:25,869
It achieved partial success,

194
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:28,161
and I always hate using that expression

195
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,699
of "glorious failures".

196
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,997
I wouldn't call it that, but...

197
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,572
it was a failure, up to a point.

198
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,838
(narrator) The failure at Arnhem

199
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:42,515
meant the war would now definitely
not be over by Christmas 1944.

200
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:46,615
It meant, too, that the initiative,
for the moment,

201
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:50,339
had been lost by the Western Allies.

202
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:54,557
But on the Eastern Front,
it was a vastly different story.

203
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,167
There, the Red Army
was advancing everywhere.

204
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,697
In the centre, 100,000 Germans
had been surrounded at Minsk.

205
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:03,959
In the north, Finland had been
knocked out of the war,

206
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,709
Estonia recaptured, Latvia and Lithuania
cleared of German troops,

207
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,429
and the borders of East Prussia reached.

208
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:15,845
In the south,
the Ukraine had been freed.

209
00:18:15,932 --> 00:18:17,961
Romania had capitulated,

210
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:20,147
Bulgaria had been overrun,

211
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,104
Greece cut off,

212
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:26,473
and a link-up effected
with Tito's partisans in Yugoslavia.

213
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,351
It was a story of gigantic triumph,

214
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:31,235
of overwhelming success

215
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,224
everywhere in the east,

216
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,491
save in one near-forgotten city,

217
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,868
where the war had first begun
five years before:

218
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:41,240
Poland's capital, Warsaw.

219
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:47,347
By July 1944, the Red Army
occupied the eastern half of Poland,

220
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:53,477
that half allocated to them in
the Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939.

221
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:57,165
The exiled Polish government in London
was anxious to assert itself

222
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:59,429
before the Russians overran the country.

223
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:01,005
Otherwise, in their eyes,

224
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:06,260
it would merely be an exchange of
occupiers rather than true liberation.

225
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:08,908
As the Red Army approached Warsaw,

226
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:11,898
the German garrison
seemed ready to leave.

227
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:29,845
On July 29, a Russian broadcast
talked of Warsaw's impending liberation,

228
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:35,256
and urged the workers of the Resistance
to rise against the retreating Germans.

229
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,628
On August 1, the Polish underground
army inside Warsaw did rise,

230
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:43,041
though they did not all support
the London government.

231
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:44,851
However, the aim of those who did

232
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:48,149
was to fly in the government-in-exile
once they had control

233
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,445
and set up a legitimate regime
before the Russians arrived.

234
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:58,041
But the uprising coincided with the
Russian offensive running out of steam,

235
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:01,193
a coincidence that nevertheless
suited Stalin's book.

236
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:05,375
(man) Stalin was very suspicious
of the underground,

237
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,131
but it was utterly cruel that
he wouldn't even try to get supplies in.

238
00:20:09,214 --> 00:20:13,698
He refused to let our aeroplanes fly and
try to drop supplies for several weeks.

239
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:15,573
And that was a shock to all of us.

240
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,566
I think it played a role
in all of our minds

241
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,367
as to the heartlessness of the Russians.

242
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:28,040
(man) We had a very strong
underground organisation,

243
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:33,603
with a civilian government
and all the military commands,

244
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:39,395
and that was organised during
the four years of the German occupation,

245
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:42,393
and it just surfaced
and took its functions.

246
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:46,377
The postal service,
which was run by Scouts,

247
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:51,018
was the only means of communications
between the various districts of Warsaw,

248
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:53,865
which were completely cut off
by enemy fire.

249
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:57,085
The Scouts, to get
from one district to another,

250
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:03,254
had sometimes to go through sewers,
or under the enemy fire.

251
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:05,873
(gunfire)

252
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:10,205
At the very beginning of the uprising

253
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:13,122
we had ammunition for only,
I think, ten or 12 days.

254
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:18,678
And then we had to rely on
the ammunition taken from the Germans,

255
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:24,508
or there were factories of ammunition
and arms in Warsaw going on,

256
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:27,579
and they were producing
their own ammunition.

257
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:45,610
(woman) There is something in the
Polish character which is optimistic,

258
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,264
and we do not give up so easily.

259
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:49,143
I would have given half of my life

260
00:21:49,222 --> 00:21:52,670
for the privilege of participating
in the Warsaw insurrection.

261
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:55,282
There was a tremendous intensification

262
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,423
of moral life, intellectual life,
emotional life,

263
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:04,527
the best sides of people
coming to the foreground.

264
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:06,667
(stirring march)

265
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,133
We had lots of recitals
through all the Warsaw insurrection.

266
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:36,712
(man) There were people who took
single-handed actions against the tanks,

267
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:42,039
people who threw themselves
at enemy machine guns, things like that.

268
00:22:42,123 --> 00:22:44,763
There was plenty of individual heroism.

269
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:47,487
(narrator) The London Poles
almost pulled it off.

270
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:50,860
By the end of the first week,
they controlled most of the city,

271
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:55,311
and the RAF was set to fly in
the Polish government-in-exile.

272
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:59,613
But then Hitler, realising
Stalin was going to do nothing,

273
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,951
ordered the SS to crush the uprising,

274
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:05,710
which they proceeded to do
with great relish and ruthlessness.

275
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,187
(woman) The bombing was very bad -
without interruption, practically.

276
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:32,335
Not only bombing, we had artillery also.

277
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:34,826
We would cover our dead with newspapers.

278
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:39,316
This was the first thing always,
you see, before the funeral,

279
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:42,119
in order not to spoil the morale.

280
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,473
(man) During the last days
of the uprising,

281
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,549
only one district was left
unoccupied by the Germans.

282
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:56,575
There were three to four,
perhaps 5,000 people.

283
00:23:56,698 --> 00:24:00,451
There were sometimes 30 or 40 people
sleeping in one room.

284
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:05,597
Now, the Germans were bombarding us
with their dive bombers.

285
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,559
(woman) We had less and less food,
you know.

286
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:21,972
We had some starches,
we didn't have bread,

287
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:24,117
we had spaghetti, things of that sort.

288
00:24:24,203 --> 00:24:30,291
And at the end, you know, we would
kill horses, and eat horse meat.

289
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:33,364
And dogs were eaten also.

290
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:41,957
(narrator) The London Poles became
more frantic in their hopelessness,

291
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:44,572
and blamed the British for their plight.

292
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,053
But the RAF
couldn't fly in much supplies

293
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:52,701
as long as Stalin refused to let them
refuel in Soviet-held territory.

294
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,841
By the time he'd been persuaded
to relent, so little was left of Warsaw

295
00:24:56,926 --> 00:25:01,836
that the supplies dropped fell
more often than not into German hands.

296
00:25:01,913 --> 00:25:07,466
(man) We were terribly disappointed.
The whole world forgot about us.

297
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:11,883
(woman) I feel that
Poland was betrayed by Allies, you see?

298
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:15,444
(man) It was the end. We felt
there was absolutely no hope for us,

299
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:18,171
that we wouldn't get any help
from the Russians.

300
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:22,051
The Germans were
set on absolutely annihilating us,

301
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:26,919
and therefore I didn't bother to duck

302
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:31,060
when I was going under the fire,
anything like that.

303
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:37,080
I just had the feeling that I should die
sooner or later - sooner, better.

304
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,110
(narrator) The Germans brought
their biggest siege gun,

305
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,950
the dreaded giant mortar
nicknamed "Thor",

306
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:50,054
each of whose shells
weighed more than two tons.

307
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:57,262
It was a hopeless battle now that
had been going on for ten long weeks,

308
00:25:57,345 --> 00:26:01,710
and had already cost the lives
of more than 200,000 Poles.

309
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:04,435
The time had come to call a halt.

310
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:26,145
Surprisingly, the Germans allowed
the Poles to surrender honourably,

311
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,444
and treated them
not as partisans fit for execution,

312
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,520
but as enlisted combatants,
due the rights of POWs

313
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,814
under the Geneva Convention.

314
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:37,040
Clearly, some of the German generals

315
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:42,221
already had their eyes on possible
war-crimes trials after the war.

316
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:07,421
Once the remaining citizens
had been driven from the city,

317
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:10,912
Warsaw was systematically
razed to the ground.

318
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:40,844
Hitler was determined
it should never rise again.

319
00:27:57,148 --> 00:28:01,360
Thus ended one of the war's
most tragic episodes.

320
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,645
Despite the bombing
and the privations,

321
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:30,517
the morale of the German people that
autumn of 1944 was surprisingly high.

322
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,124
They responded well
to every propaganda call Hitler made.

323
00:28:34,244 --> 00:28:39,110
This one was for collecting
winter clothing for the Eastern Front.

324
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,590
Hitler reduced the call-up age
that autumn to 16 1/2,

325
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:53,338
and raked in those who so far had
escaped it on grounds of essential work.

326
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:56,720
Some 700,000 new recruits were raised,

327
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,713
partly for the Volkssturm,
a sort of Home Guard,

328
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:04,462
and partly to replace his terrible
losses in both east and west.

329
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,296
But he also had in mind
a more daring use for his new recruits.

330
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:14,712
Since his defeat in Normandy, Hitler had
been planning a major counterattack,

331
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:18,240
hoping not just to halt the Allies
before they reached the Rhine,

332
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:22,118
but to turn them back so decisively
that they would want to sue for peace -

333
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:25,829
a peace that would give him a breathing
space to stem the Russian advance

334
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:28,710
before it got too close to Berlin.

335
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:32,659
Such was his fantasy.

336
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:37,498
To that end, too,
he'd been conserving his panzers,

337
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:40,602
re-equipping them
after their mauling in Normandy.

338
00:29:40,686 --> 00:29:42,410
But where to strike?

339
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:47,205
That autumn of 1944,

340
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,121
the Allies in the west
had closed up to the German border

341
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,651
along a 1,000-mile front,

342
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:55,487
and had even penetrated
the Siegfried line in one or two places.

343
00:29:55,571 --> 00:30:00,360
But supply still remained a problem,
for Antwerp was not yet open.

344
00:30:00,443 --> 00:30:03,694
To the north of Antwerp
lay the bulk of the British forces.

345
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,959
If, by a daring blow, Hitler could
capture Antwerp and reach the sea,

346
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:11,137
he would not only eliminate
the Allies' main supply port,

347
00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:13,589
he would also have split
the Allies in two,

348
00:30:13,677 --> 00:30:17,888
and the British might once again
have to contemplate a Dunkirk.

349
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:21,040
Eisenhower,
in manning his 1,000-mile front,

350
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,575
had had to spread his forces
thinly in places.

351
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:28,943
One such place was just 125 miles
from Antwerp - the Ardennes,

352
00:30:29,022 --> 00:30:33,048
of 1940 magical, mystical memory
for Hitler.

353
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:36,804
If only history
could repeat itself for him.

354
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:46,585
(De Guingand) In war, one must remember
that you can't be strong everywhere.

355
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:51,993
12th Army Group, Bradley's army group,
were given certain tasks.

356
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:54,292
And therefore he had to decide

357
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,592
where he was going to be strong,
and where he would be weak.

358
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:00,166
And he assessed the situation

359
00:31:00,248 --> 00:31:04,351
and decided he'd thin out
on the Ardennes sector.

360
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:17,045
(American man)
We were told by some of the men

361
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:21,458
who were in the houses that we took over

362
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:25,713
that it was a very quiet sector,
nothing happened.

363
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:28,285
Once in a while a patrol was sent out.

364
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:32,852
They would hear sometimes
the crackling of a gun in the distance,

365
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,998
and... well, there was nothing to it.

366
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:52,917
I was... not exactly green,

367
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,756
but there weren't too many
in our particular unit

368
00:31:55,834 --> 00:32:00,242
that had had much
in the way of any combat experience.

369
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:13,937
(German man) On October 24,

370
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:16,739
I was ordered to come to Hitler,

371
00:32:16,856 --> 00:32:21,035
to his headquarters in East Prussia.

372
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:24,988
And he developed me and General Krebs,

373
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:30,161
the chief of the army group
in the centre, who accompanied me,

374
00:32:30,245 --> 00:32:31,848
that we would get,

375
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:38,020
end of November or beginning
of December, strong reinforcements.

376
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:42,364
He named... 20 infantry divisions,

377
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:47,462
ten armoured divisions,
and a lot of other special troops,

378
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:52,183
and he promised that
we would be supported by the air force,

379
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:54,948
with about 3,000 planes.

380
00:32:57,136 --> 00:33:00,431
But we were totally surprised.

381
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:06,033
He explained that the objectives,
Antwerp and Brussels,

382
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:08,600
were something of a risk,

383
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:13,320
and might seem beyond
the capacity of the forces available,

384
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:15,693
and their condition.

385
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,918
Nevertheless, he had decided
to stake everything on one card,

386
00:33:20,997 --> 00:33:22,677
because Germany needed

387
00:33:22,762 --> 00:33:24,900
a breathing space.

388
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:26,862
A defence struggle, he said,

389
00:33:26,943 --> 00:33:29,277
could only postpone the decision,

390
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,763
and not change
the general situation for Germany.

391
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:42,623
(narrator) For his attack,
Hitler, unknown to the Allies,

392
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,579
had assembled
more than half a million troops.

393
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:50,300
Opposing them were just 80,000
ill-equipped, inexperienced Americans.

394
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:53,939
It seemed like May 1940 all over again.

395
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:04,152
(Manteuffel) The morale
of the German attacking forces was high,

396
00:34:04,231 --> 00:34:07,067
and this compensated, in my opinion,

397
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:11,630
for our comparative weakness
in weapon and in manpower.

398
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:17,731
(German man) We saw this build-up
of forces - tanks in great number,

399
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:22,328
more tanks than we had seen
in the last two years.

400
00:34:22,414 --> 00:34:24,945
We even saw aircraft,

401
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:31,110
and then we saw that the preparations
were well kept in secrecy.

402
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:34,219
(narrator) "Null Day" - Zero Day -

403
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,368
December 16, arrived.

404
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:50,755
Feuer!

405
00:35:01,428 --> 00:35:03,959
The barrage lasted an hour,
and gave the Allies

406
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:07,669
a taste of what they had themselves
meted out at Cassino some months,

407
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:11,314
and at El Alamein some years, before.

408
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,266
The last great attack
of the Germans in the west had begun.

409
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,831
Hitler's most desperate gamble was on.

410
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,918
(German man) As a simple soldier,
everything is on the road,

411
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:34,109
and you think these are
more divisions than they are.

412
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:38,629
Therefore we had the feeling
that this build-up of force

413
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:44,269
might enable us to reach the final goal,
which was Antwerp.

414
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:47,335
The weather was foggy.

415
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:54,974
The American and British air superiority
didn't matter in that type of weather,

416
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:59,842
and therefore we believed
that we would be successful.

417
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,361
(narrator) Surprise was total.

418
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,386
It began a day
of monumental confusion for the Allies,

419
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:18,184
the worst they experienced
in the whole European war.

420
00:36:24,979 --> 00:36:27,772
Even as the first Wehrmacht waves
were overrunning

421
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,262
the American positions
along the Ardennes,

422
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,913
talk at Allied headquarters
back at Versailles

423
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:36,477
was focused more on the news
of band leader Glenn Miller's death

424
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:42,009
than of the possibility of the biggest
German offensive in the west since 1940.

425
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:46,191
It was the day Eisenhower
was promoted five-star general,

426
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,139
and the day Field Marshal Montgomery
applied for leave

427
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:51,941
to go home to England for Christmas.

428
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:55,472
Ike was attending
his chauffeur's wedding that morning,

429
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:58,314
while Monty was playing golf.

430
00:36:58,392 --> 00:37:03,214
As the day wore on,
the resemblances to May 1940 grew.

431
00:37:03,302 --> 00:37:06,444
The overwhelming German might,
their relentless speed,

432
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,816
above all the chaos in the Allied rear,

433
00:37:08,903 --> 00:37:12,078
as bewildered, untried troops
dashed for safety,

434
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:16,572
clogging the roads and preventing
reinforcements reaching the front.

435
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,674
(German man) A rumour was spread
that the Americans

436
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,480
would hand over part of
the prisoners of war to the Russians,

437
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:29,034
and that helped to build up morale
and the will to fight.

438
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,402
(narrator) 7,000 Americans
surrendered in one go,

439
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:42,388
the biggest mass surrender of
American arms in the European campaign.

440
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:51,250
German newsreel cameramen
had a field day.

441
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:13,804
(American man) The fog was lifting
a little bit in the area where we were,

442
00:38:13,888 --> 00:38:19,976
but by about 12 o'clock, we found
that we couldn't go any further,

443
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,664
that it was just a question
of surrendering.

444
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:29,800
(man #2) The lieutenant went
and made arrangements

445
00:38:29,885 --> 00:38:32,721
with the German officer in charge,

446
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,325
and came back up
and told us that we had one hour

447
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:42,189
to dismantle and destroy our weapons,

448
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:46,257
or dig holes and bury
whatever we wanted to bury,

449
00:38:46,342 --> 00:38:50,400
and be ready to come off that hill
within one hour.

450
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:59,605
(German man) The first American
prisoners didn't know what was going on.

451
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:02,681
They came to us, asked for bread,
and we had bread enough,

452
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,710
so we gave them bread
and they gave us chocolate.

453
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:52,735
(German man) After two or three days,

454
00:39:52,822 --> 00:39:57,230
we already saw that
the resistance of the American troops

455
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,758
was stronger than we had believed.

456
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,371
(gunfire)

457
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:09,156
(American man)
They had been able to break through

458
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,843
because we could get
no fighter-bomber support.

459
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:14,719
The weather was sitting
right on the treetops,

460
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:19,790
and we couldn't pick up
any of their moving troops from the air.

461
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:24,123
But on Christmas Eve, the clouds lifted,

462
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:29,256
and thereafter
the fighter-bombers came in,

463
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,823
and they simply
destroyed the German armour.

464
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:50,439
(narrator) Manteuffel's panzers
had run out of petrol,

465
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:53,584
still some 70 miles short of Antwerp.

466
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:58,650
Motionless, they were sitting ducks
for the Allied planes.

467
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,669
"It was a great slaughter",

468
00:41:05,748 --> 00:41:08,966
the American divisional commander
wrote in his report.

469
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:13,411
For Hitler, it was more
than the beginning of the end.

470
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,090
(Manteuffel) The failure
of this offensive affected morale,

471
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:24,809
and, therefore, the behaviour of
the soldiers and the civilians alike.

472
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:30,029
Thus we have contributed
to speeding the end of the war.

473
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,976
(narrator)
With the German offensive halted,

474
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:36,814
Americans from the south
and British from the north

475
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:40,536
pressed on the bulge that had been
formed within the Ardennes front -

476
00:41:40,657 --> 00:41:44,715
the bulge that gave
this particular battle its popular name.

477
00:41:45,644 --> 00:41:48,786
They met in mid-January 1945,

478
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:52,625
by which time the German army
was in total disarray,

479
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:56,183
for the Russian winter offensive
had begun four days before.

480
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,714
Now Hitler's gamble in the west
was seen to be supreme folly,

481
00:42:01,794 --> 00:42:05,743
for, to do it, he had denuded
his defences in the east.

482
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:16,827
With its carefully hoarded reserves
of fuel and equipment

483
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,855
and, of course, of men too, gone,

484
00:42:19,939 --> 00:42:23,572
the German war machine
began to disintegrate.

485
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:08,425
I would say that Hitler's attack
in the Bulge brought the war to an end

486
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:12,640
perhaps six months earlier
than it would otherwise have ended.

487
00:43:12,725 --> 00:43:15,332
The Germans
could have fallen back to the Rhine,

488
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,592
which was a real obstacle.

489
00:43:17,712 --> 00:43:21,464
But they had nothing with which
to hold the Rhine, because essentially,

490
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:26,142
the reserves of the German army,
the mobile troops and the reserves,

491
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,562
were destroyed
in the battle of the Bulge.

492
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:31,711
The German soldier was exhausted,

493
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:36,886
and he had only one desire:
to end the war.

494
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:42,141
But he was willing to fight on,

495
00:43:42,225 --> 00:43:46,480
to cover the rear of the Eastern Front.

496
00:43:48,363 --> 00:43:51,275
(narrator) On January 20, 1945,

497
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:54,529
Zhukov's tanks entered Germany proper
for the first time,

498
00:43:54,654 --> 00:43:57,523
a mere 100 miles from Berlin,

499
00:43:57,608 --> 00:43:59,517
the occasion being celebrated

500
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:03,814
by a particularly savage sacking
of every village in sight.

501
00:44:16,328 --> 00:44:19,121
Soon, thousands upon thousands
of German civilians

502
00:44:19,205 --> 00:44:22,806
took to the roads westwards,
away from the dreaded Russians,

503
00:44:22,888 --> 00:44:25,571
producing scenes reminiscent
of those long lines

504
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,283
of French and Belgian refugees
five years before.

505
00:44:46,672 --> 00:44:48,625
As the Allied bombing intensified,

506
00:44:48,705 --> 00:44:51,542
more and more German cities
were reduced to rubble.

507
00:44:51,621 --> 00:44:56,061
In Mein Kampf, Hitler had written,
"Even if we cannot conquer,

508
00:44:56,148 --> 00:44:59,780
we shall drag the world into destruction
with us."

509
00:45:12,451 --> 00:45:17,470
All during March, the Russian guns
could be heard in Berlin.

510
00:45:44,406 --> 00:45:48,280
(Horrocks) They came to me and said,
"Do you want Cleves taking out?"

511
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:52,842
By "taking out" they meant all
the heavy bombers putting on to Cleves.

512
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:58,095
Now, I knew that Cleves
was a fine old historical German town.

513
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:03,233
Anne of Cleves, one of
Henry VIII's wives, came from there.

514
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:06,002
I knew that there were
a lot of civilians in Cleves,

515
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:08,721
men, women and children.

516
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:12,361
If I said no, they would live.
If I said yes, they would die.

517
00:46:12,487 --> 00:46:17,964
A terrible decision you've got to take.
But everything depended

518
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,268
on getting a high piece of ground
at Materborn.

519
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:24,490
The German reserves
would have to come through Cleves,

520
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:27,866
and we would have to breach
the Siegfried line and get there.

521
00:46:27,947 --> 00:46:30,784
And your own lives, your own troops,
must come first,

522
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:34,888
so I said yes, I did want it taking out.

523
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:38,109
But when all those bombers went over
the night...

524
00:46:38,189 --> 00:46:41,517
just before zero hour,
to take out Cleves,

525
00:46:41,604 --> 00:46:43,895
I felt a murderer.

526
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:49,154
And after the war I had an awful lot
of nightmares. It was always Cleves.

527
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,153
(narrator) The cities west of the Rhine
were cleared of German troops -

528
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:23,950
Bonn, Koblenz, Mainz
and, of course, Cologne.

529
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:30,547
By March 22, no German soldier
fought west of the Rhine.

530
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:48,423
Only the Rhine now lay
between the Western Allies

531
00:48:48,504 --> 00:48:51,416
and the heartland of Hitler's Germany.

532
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:54,862
Preparations began straightaway
to cross it.

533
00:50:48,806 --> 00:50:53,475
(Horrocks) At nine o'clock
in the evening, I remember waiting,

534
00:50:53,563 --> 00:50:56,629
sitting in a command post.

535
00:50:56,708 --> 00:51:01,727
Then the news came through that
the Black Watch were over the Rhine.

536
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:05,640
Rather historic, you know, in a way.
They were over the Rhine.
