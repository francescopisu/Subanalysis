2
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:12,595
(narrator) This tiny island,
less than one square mile,

3
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:15,470
cost more than 4,000 lives.

4
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:19,503
This is Tarawa, typical of some of the
most concentrated fighting of the war

5
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:23,062
as the Americans drive the Japanese
back island by island

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,637
across the Pacific.

7
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:37,176
In February 1942, Japanese bombers
attacked the Australian mainland.

8
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:42,740
The raid temporarily knocked out
the naval base of Darwin.

9
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:45,282
With the Japanese
advancing across New Guinea,

10
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,305
some Australians thought
this was the prelude to invasion,

11
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:52,263
but the Japanese army and navy
were unable to agree.

12
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:55,591
Their invasion plans were shelved.

13
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:00,853
In fact, the Japanese found
they were overextended.

14
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,955
In the appalling conditions
of the New Guinea jungle,

15
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,452
the Australians, with American support,

16
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:10,899
turned back the Japanese advance
on the vital base of Port Moresby.

17
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:14,743
Along the Kokoda Trail
the Allies counterattacked.

18
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,482
Sickness and disease were obstacles
as formidable as Japanese bullets.

19
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:38,135
By the end of 1942, the threat
to Australia had been removed.

20
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:40,861
The stage was set
for the long and bitter struggle

21
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:44,894
to push the Japanese back
to their homeland.

22
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:49,337
The Allied offensive came under
the separate command of two rivals,

23
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:52,369
General Douglas MacArthur
in the southwest Pacific

24
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:56,708
and Admiral Chester Nimitz
in the central Pacific.

25
00:02:56,788 --> 00:03:00,191
American strategy was to mount
a two-pronged attack on an enemy

26
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,002
whose conquests extended

27
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:06,064
over thousands of square miles
of land and ocean.

28
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:10,817
MacArthur's task was to thrust upwards
from the Solomons and New Guinea

29
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:12,661
to the Philippines.

30
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,394
The forces under Nimitz

31
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:18,231
were to make a series of giant leaps
from island to island -

32
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:23,093
the Marshall Islands,
the Marianas, Iwo Jima, Okinawa.

33
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,238
They would start in the Gilberts
in November 1943 at Tarawa.

34
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:36,144
Each one of you
is much better than the Jap.

35
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:40,817
You're better physically. You're better
mentally. You have better weapons.

36
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:44,701
You'll have better support so that
you'll be able to lick him hands down

37
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:48,144
when it comes to individual fighting.

38
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:50,718
Let me repeat again
what the general said.

39
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:54,750
If you have to run any chances
whatsoever to get a prisoner,

40
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,094
then don't get him.

41
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,157
(laughter)

42
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:07,792
(narrator) The first objective

43
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,396
of Nimitz's island-hopping armada's
Tarawa atoll

44
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:13,507
had become a Japanese fortress

45
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:17,221
from whose airstrip planes
could strike at the US fleets.

46
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:19,414
Tarawa had to be taken.

47
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:23,519
This was the first time
a seaborne attack had been launched

48
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,619
against a heavily defended atoll
protected by a coral reef.

49
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:48,569
No one in the initial assault force
of 5,000 marines realised

50
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,207
just how strong
the defences of Tarawa were.

51
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:55,927
(man) They thought they would level
the island and demolish everything,

52
00:04:56,054 --> 00:05:00,080
that there wouldn't be
a living soul on the island.

53
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:03,875
(man #2) I remember him telling us,

54
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:07,709
"This is gonna be the easiest invasion
we ever had."

55
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:15,194
He says, "We'll only need two men -
one with a rifle and one with a slate."

56
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,066
"One to shoot 'em,
one to chalk 'em up."

57
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:22,633
"It's gonna be real easy."

58
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:27,884
(man #3) I turned to the major standing
next to me on the deck and said,

59
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:31,342
"Some of our people
aren't aiming very well today."

60
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:34,445
He said, "You don't think
those are our shells, do you?"

61
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:39,244
I realised then that we're being shot at
and there were Japanese on Tarawa.

62
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:48,255
(man #4) Everyone was confident that
you could kick hell out of the Japanese.

63
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:50,484
The marines would have no problem
with them

64
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:54,395
if we could get our feet on the beach.

65
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,493
(soldier) Let's go! Let's go!

66
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:11,855
(man #1) Remember that the island
was only 800 or 900 yards wide

67
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:17,607
and when you put 20,000 men on
an island like that, it's quite crowded.

68
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,195
There were Japs in front of the lines,
behind the lines, all over.

69
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:43,154
(man #5) We were told
that perhaps we could take this island

70
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,992
within a very short time

71
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:50,370
and it was quite evident within hours
of landing that this would not be so.

72
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:05,629
(man #4) The foxholes that had been
covered up with the naval gunfire,

73
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:09,087
the next morning,
within about 20 yards of where I was,

74
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,006
I watched the Japanese digging out.

75
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:16,601
They were digging the sand out of
the place so that they could see out.

76
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,312
(narrator) The battle raged
for three days

77
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:31,604
with the Japanese gradually pinned back
into one end of this tiny island.

78
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:21,670
The Japanese commander boasted that
Tarawa could not be taken in 100 years.

79
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:28,146
(man #3) If you can imagine the effect
of nearly 6,000 dead men

80
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,643
on an island this small,

81
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:34,094
and considering it's one degree
from the equator,

82
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:37,129
the amount of heat you have there,

83
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:41,115
you can imagine the smell you get
within a day or two

84
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:42,846
from all this rotting flesh.

85
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:47,060
It was a sort of sweet smell -

86
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:50,701
sickly sweet, I described it -

87
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:53,658
and I don't know anywhere
in World War II

88
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:56,809
where there was such a concentration
of death.

89
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:08,313
(narrator) When it was all over,
of 3,000 Japanese, only 17 surrendered.

90
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:12,881
The Americans lost over 1,000 dead
and 2,000 wounded.

91
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:17,833
Public opinion in the United States
was shocked

92
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:23,923
that such heavy losses had been incurred
in so short a period of fighting.

93
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:30,179
After Tarawa, American invasion forces
headed for the Mariana Islands

94
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:33,666
of Saipan, Tinian and Guam.

95
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:36,121
The naval task force
protecting the landings

96
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,886
was positioned to the west of Saipan.

97
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:44,071
Approaching from Okinawa in June 1944
was Japan's mobile fleet,

98
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,557
looking for a naval success that
would yet turn the war in their favour.

99
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,500
Suddenly, from their radar,
the Americans realised

100
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:59,257
that they had been spotted
by the Japanese.

101
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:13,072
Every available American fighter
was put into the air

102
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:17,668
to meet wave after wave
of Japanese carrier-borne planes.

103
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:56,151
Many Japanese pilots were comparative
novices with no battle experience.

104
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:01,560
Their aircraft were poorly armoured.

105
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,854
For the American flyers
swooping down on their opponents,

106
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,803
it was as easy as shooting turkeys.

107
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:33,854
After the first encounter, all but one
of the American planes returned.

108
00:11:59,221 --> 00:12:03,738
Rearmed and refuelled, the Americans
were ready for the next Japanese move.

109
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,464
There were two more onslaughts
to be faced.

110
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:10,225
However, the Americans had
nearly 900 carrier planes,

111
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:13,100
twice the number of the Japanese.

112
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:21,309
The Marianas turkey shoot
lasted just eight hours.

113
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:27,837
In one day, Japanese naval air power
was virtually destroyed.

114
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:32,705
The original force of 430 planes
was reduced to about 100.

115
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,290
American losses
were comparatively light.

116
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:49,466
Pilots mattered more than machines.

117
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:24,834
At the end of the day,
the Americans had won the air battle,

118
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:29,481
but had yet to locate
the Japanese fleet, now retiring.

119
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:38,995
The following day, the Americans
continued their search for the enemy.

120
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:01,592
It was not until late afternoon

121
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,113
that their aircraft sighted
the mobile fleet over 200 miles away,

122
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,451
at the extreme limit of the range
of the American bombers.

123
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:11,522
But the order was given - attack.

124
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:36,117
In the fading light,
the principle objective of the strike -

125
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:40,375
the Japanese carrier force -
was badly mauled.

126
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:56,678
One carrier was sunk
and two others damaged.

127
00:14:56,758 --> 00:15:01,199
This great naval battle, in which
neither fleet fired on the other,

128
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:04,504
ended with the Japanese
reduced to only 35 aircraft

129
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:07,224
retreating to their bases in Japan.

130
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:19,425
The American planes now faced the
problem of getting back to the carriers.

131
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:24,219
The decision to attack had meant
that they might easily run out of fuel

132
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,757
on the journey home.

133
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:34,579
First to return were the fighters which
had been protecting the task force.

134
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,456
Landing in the dusk
was difficult enough,

135
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,987
but later on
the torpedo planes and bombers

136
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,518
would have to find their carriers
in pitch darkness.

137
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,776
Some would never make it.

138
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,186
Then it turned into probably the
blackest night I've seen in my life.

139
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:11,897
And over the ocean... I guess we were
at about 7,000 feet flying home,

140
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:16,805
kind of our best altitude for fuel,
and it was black as the ace of spades.

141
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:21,378
And we could hear nothing,
just ourselves, except the cries of...

142
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:25,293
I won't say "cry",
but a very perfunctory call,

143
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:28,088
"I'll have to land in the water.
I'm out of fuel."

144
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,201
And this continued just constantly

145
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:34,417
until all the torpedo planes that had
survived the strike went into the water.

146
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:39,095
Then about 100 miles from the force, the
dive bombers began to run out of fuel

147
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:41,516
and they called out, "This is..."

148
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:44,773
whatever the call was.
I don't really remember.

149
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,428
"I'm going in. Out of fuel."

150
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:52,066
And then it became quite quiet
until we got within range of the force

151
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:58,274
and then you could start to make out
what was happening at the task force

152
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,653
and what the recovery course
would be -

153
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:03,228
we'd not yet seen it
as the ships were blacked out,

154
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:07,522
which was a normal operating procedure,
so it couldn't be detected from the air.

155
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:11,132
The admiral knew that we'd have
an awful problem getting aboard.

156
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:15,087
We didn't have time to really look
for the force. A decision was made.

157
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:18,612
The command was given to the carriers
to turn their lights on.

158
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:27,360
(narrator) The task force succeeded in
rescuing the majority of the air crews

159
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
who had been forced down in the ocean.

160
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:32,957
Victory in this,
the Battle of the Philippine Sea,

161
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:35,377
meant the Mariana landings
could go ahead

162
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:39,216
without interference
from the Japanese navy.

163
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:54,712
At a cost of 3,000 American dead,
Saipan fell.

164
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,647
Tinian was less heavily defended.

165
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,567
Guam held out for three weeks.

166
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:17,686
Get out of there! Move back quick!

167
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,481
(narrator)
Moving west from the Marianas,

168
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:25,289
a US amphibious force was switched
by Nimitz to MacArthur's command

169
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:28,236
as the two rival prongs
began to come together.

170
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,003
The objective was
the Palau group of islands.

171
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,802
These had to be taken
before the invasion of the Philippines.

172
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:49,877
On one island, Peleliu, the Americans
again ran into fanatical resistance

173
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:53,753
from a crack force
of 10,000 Japanese troops.

174
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:08,171
Instead of meeting the Americans
on the beaches,

175
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:12,236
the Japanese had withdrawn
into a labyrinth of caves and tunnels.

176
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:08,745
The Americans had to contest
every yard

177
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:12,002
against an enemy
determined to fight to the death.

178
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:19,221
In the bloody battle for Peleliu,

179
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,047
four out of every ten Americans
taking part were killed or wounded.

180
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:41,730
It was months before all the Japanese
had been winkled out.

181
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:54,819
There were no easy victories
on these Pacific islands.

182
00:21:54,938 --> 00:22:00,918
Some of the dead marines could only
be identified by their fingerprints.

183
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:10,244
On October 20, 1944,
MacArthur fulfilled his promise.

184
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:13,234
He returned to the Philippines.

185
00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:16,648
The landings were virtually unopposed.

186
00:22:16,728 --> 00:22:20,360
The Japanese had retired inland
to their main defences.

187
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:22,478
But the invasion
touched off the largest

188
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,122
and most complex naval battle
in history.

189
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:28,576
The Battle for Leyte Gulf
was to last for four days.

190
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:32,031
Four Japanese forces converged
on the Philippines

191
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:36,017
from Borneo, Formosa
and mainland Japan.

192
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,930
The Americans had two fleets -
the Seventh and the Third.

193
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:43,264
The Japanese aim was to destroy
the American invasion shipping

194
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,998
in Leyte Gulf.

195
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,563
After a series of confused engagements
hundreds of miles apart,

196
00:22:48,644 --> 00:22:52,364
the Imperial Japanese Navy
suffered heavy losses.

197
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:56,119
It ceased to be an effective
fighting force.

198
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:06,941
On land, torrential rain had delayed
the progress of MacArthur's men

199
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:12,121
fighting against a Japanese army
numbering nearly 400,000.

200
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:17,259
By February 1945, three months
after the Leyte landings,

201
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:22,817
the Americans were closing in
on the Philippines capital Manila.

202
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,357
For the first time in the Pacific war,

203
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:39,427
the Americans were fighting
their way into a big city.

204
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,217
The battle raged from street to street,
house to house.

205
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:16,257
Many civilians lost their lives,

206
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:19,934
some executed
by the retreating Japanese.

207
00:24:41,888 --> 00:24:47,867
MacArthur's second hour of triumph -
his return to the Philippines capital.

208
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:53,124
Americans taken prisoner
during the Japanese invasion

209
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:57,078
were released
after three years in captivity.

210
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:22,542
With the capture of the Philippines,

211
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:26,654
supply routes carrying war materials
for Japanese industry would be cut.

212
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,290
The Japanese command knew
that when they had lost the Philippines,

213
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:33,023
they had lost the war.

214
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:43,992
After liberation, revenge.
The settling of personal scores

215
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:46,406
against Filipinos
accused of collaborating

216
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:48,856
during the years
of Japanese occupation,

217
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,158
now at last at an end.

218
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:23,159
February, 1945.

219
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:26,338
Iwo Jima,
eight square miles of volcanic rock

220
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:29,107
only 600 miles from the coast of Japan,

221
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:33,702
was the target for the next leap
across the central Pacific.

222
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:35,086
From Iwo Jima,

223
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:40,036
American bombers could raid
Japanese cities almost at will.

224
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:42,911
From the dominating heights
of Mount Suribachi,

225
00:26:42,995 --> 00:26:46,977
the Japanese could see practically
everything that moved on Iwo Jima.

226
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:52,888
Once again, the main Japanese forces
were inland, away from the beaches.

227
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,451
For 76 days before the landing,
the Americans had bombarded Iwo Jima.

228
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:10,768
(man) The waste,
the barrenness of the place...

229
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:14,566
It was like a nightmare. It was
the closest thing you could see to hell.

230
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:19,396
If ever hell looked like anything,
it must look like Iwo Jima.

231
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:28,720
(man #2) The minute you got in
those boats you were scared.

232
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,247
You were scared
until you hit the beach.

233
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,968
(man #3) You realise that
you're going in to kill

234
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:39,649
and we were taught
that we had to kill or be killed.

235
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:43,257
It was either us or the Japanese,
one or the other.

236
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:47,894
And when you're faced
with this situation as a young man -

237
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,009
I was only 19 -

238
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,195
it's confusing.

239
00:27:52,276 --> 00:27:57,262
You're built, in the Marine Corps,
to take orders and obey orders,

240
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,825
but at the same token you're still
a human being and you're only 19 or 20.

241
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:05,386
Most of us were only 18, 19, 20,
during those days.

242
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,435
I think the public has the idea
that marines are supermen,

243
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:19,925
but I don't think there was a marine
in the amphibious landing craft

244
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:24,032
that wasn't afraid,
including the officers.

245
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:38,763
I was always taught to hate them
in the Marine Corps, to detest them,

246
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:43,365
and that they were animals.
We were the men, they were the animals.

247
00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:48,699
By the same token, we were taught
that they would die for the emperor.

248
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:51,238
We weren't taught to die
for our president.

249
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:55,609
And to fight or to come up against
an individual who wants to die,

250
00:28:55,688 --> 00:29:00,173
or who doesn't care about dying,
is a tough thing to combat in your mind.

251
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:05,501
We wanted to live. We wanted to kill him
and we wanted to survive.

252
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:15,556
(man #2) You keep your head down
because there's too much fire above you

253
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:21,616
and it's that constant wondering, is
somebody gonna drop a lucky one in there

254
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:26,296
and you're too far out to swim
with all that gear on?

255
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:29,400
And what are you gonna get into
when you get there?

256
00:29:29,485 --> 00:29:31,896
That's a hell of a place to be.

257
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:53,455
(man #1) And as you hit the island

258
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:57,296
and you saw the ash and nothing living,

259
00:29:57,374 --> 00:30:01,356
it was... if there's ever been hell,
this was it.

260
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:11,446
Well, we hit the beach itself.

261
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,475
Actually, there was a little incline

262
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,924
and everybody clung to the incline
because the fire was that heavy.

263
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,191
And everything that hit the beach

264
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:23,640
was blasted out of the water
as fast as it hit.

265
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:35,849
(man #4) I was young then.
This was my fourth operation. I was 18.

266
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:38,294
My first operation, I was 16.

267
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,429
(man #1) They lay and waited for us

268
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:51,845
and rhythmically just kept on tattooing
every man along the line.

269
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:57,019
And you just couldn't avoid it.
The slaughter was fantastic.

270
00:30:57,103 --> 00:31:01,543
We just walked into a web
and there was no way out.

271
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,691
You couldn't get off the beach.

272
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:10,711
(man #5) And getting in to the beach
was a depressing scene.

273
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:16,816
It knocked your morale when you started
to see people from your own team dead.

274
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:22,183
From the water's edge
to a sort of a rise,

275
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:27,483
there was a tremendous amount
of bodies just lying there.

276
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:47,002
(man #6) We moved about...

277
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:50,421
possibly 300 yards in,

278
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:55,445
just as far as they, meaning
the Japanese, decided for us to go.

279
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,035
(man #1) There was no way of getting
off the island, not that first night.

280
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,651
It was just too congested.

281
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:12,173
There was nothing that could
move off that island the first night.

282
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:19,762
(narrator) Dug in on Mount Suribachi,

283
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:24,638
the Japanese commander
had concentrated his artillery.

284
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:33,763
The preliminary bombardment again failed
to knock out the Japanese strong points.

285
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:38,799
They could only be taken one at a time
by the men on the ground.

286
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,905
It would take longer to capture Iwo Jima

287
00:32:40,986 --> 00:32:45,623
than the five days allowed for
by the American command.

288
00:32:53,645 --> 00:32:58,130
(man #6) The entire vegetation
was gone completely.

289
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,508
You woke in the morning

290
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:03,388
and you'd look out across
this expanse of no-man's-land

291
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:07,448
and it was bubbling and seething
with steam coming out of the ground.

292
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:10,096
In fact, we had to use cardboard
from C ration packs

293
00:33:10,217 --> 00:33:15,433
to put down in the foxhole
so that your ass wouldn't burn up.

294
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,454
If there is a hell,
I'm living through it now,

295
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:27,747
so I don't have to worry about going
to hell in the future. I've been there.

296
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,431
One of the guys came up to me.
He was a man with a family.

297
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:47,956
I never did even know him, just
meeting him at that particular day.

298
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,300
I said, "We're in the mortar outfit
back here."

299
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:52,444
"Fairly well safe, no problems."

300
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:57,516
Before the day was over,
he and half of my other squad was dead.

301
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:05,073
(man #7) I think the worst part was you
get callous to dead and bloated bodies,

302
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:08,904
but you never get callous
to your own friends in that way,

303
00:34:08,987 --> 00:34:12,707
and I think that perhaps was
the most terrible thing of Iwo Jima.

304
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:16,189
(man #8) If everybody remembered
all the tragic things that happened,

305
00:34:16,276 --> 00:34:18,840
you'd go crazy.
You wouldn't survive it.

306
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,989
(man #2) Oh, you always think
you're gonna make it.

307
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:26,662
You're scared, but you still think
you're gonna make it.

308
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:08,288
(man #1) It was just one of the biggest
messes I myself had ever seen.

309
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:10,553
I don't know who the beach master was,

310
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:16,079
but he probably had the roughest job
of any man I've ever heard of.

311
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:24,363
(narrator)
It may have looked confusing,

312
00:35:24,445 --> 00:35:28,656
but the supply organisation backing the
assault force was proof of the factor

313
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:31,305
that made America's victory
over Japan inevitable

314
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:35,567
from the day of Pearl Harbour -
her overwhelming industrial strength.

315
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,611
(man #1) Only one thing
seemed to permeate the men -

316
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:49,336
get that million-dollar wound
and get off this damn place.

317
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,702
(narrator) Inland from the beaches,

318
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:29,881
Iwo Jima
became another battle of attrition.

319
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:51,096
Day after day,
the Americans inched forward

320
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,705
against Japanese
who preferred death to surrender.

321
00:36:54,786 --> 00:37:00,263
Their leader still hoped the Americans
might tire of their losses and the war.

322
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:03,676
(man #7) Oh, my Lord.
On Iwo, it was hand-to-hand fighting.

323
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:07,592
You didn't know who was even
in the hole with you half of the time.

324
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:09,585
(man #6) You went into the caves.

325
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,577
We lost most of our people
in this particular fashion.

326
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,453
You went into the caves
and fought it out with the guy.

327
00:37:16,576 --> 00:37:19,674
One of you came out.

328
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:26,387
(man #4) I don't think anybody realised
they were underground so deeply.

329
00:37:26,473 --> 00:37:30,270
You know, it was so heavily defended,
really.

330
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:50,062
(narrator) After three days' fighting
on Mount Suribachi,

331
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,825
the Stars and Stripes
flew on the summit.

332
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:56,504
(man #1) One of the boys started
to holler, "There goes the flag,"

333
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:59,042
and I don't care where you were
on that island,

334
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,105
you could see right up to Suribachi
that the flag was raised.

335
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,746
And everybody started to howl,

336
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,315
because we figured,
well, the island was secure.

337
00:38:10,397 --> 00:38:12,764
It was far from secure.

338
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:14,837
We had a long way to go yet.

339
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:18,797
But it was nice to see
the flag up there anyway.

340
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:27,956
(man #4) They always told you
to take prisoners,

341
00:38:28,043 --> 00:38:31,142
but we had some bad experiences
on Saipan taking prisoners.

342
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:35,706
You'd take 'em and as soon as they'd get
behind the lines they'd drop grenades

343
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,777
and you'd lose a few more people.

344
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:40,002
You're a bit leery
about taking prisoners

345
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:43,880
when they're fighting to the death
and so are you.

346
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:48,788
OK, you can kick off right now!

347
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:53,783
(man #9) Very few of 'em came out
on their own. When they did,

348
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:56,348
one in the front would come out
with his hands up

349
00:38:56,431 --> 00:39:00,413
and one behind him,
he'd come out with a grenade.

350
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:11,154
(man #2) One of the West Virginia boys,
he was sitting against a stone wall

351
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:16,874
with his knees up under his helmet,
as we used to sit quite often,

352
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:21,471
when one of the enemy ran out
onto the top of the stone wall

353
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:26,347
and held a small explosive charge
to his abdomen.

354
00:39:27,504 --> 00:39:30,646
And a chunk of his torso,

355
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:32,482
the lower torso,

356
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:37,434
went spiraling into the air
and came down on John's knees

357
00:39:37,516 --> 00:39:41,346
with the absolute posterior
devoid of any clothes

358
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:44,189
staring him right in the face.

359
00:39:44,268 --> 00:39:47,825
And he looked at that and he says,
"God, am I hit that bad?"

360
00:39:47,912 --> 00:39:50,443
(laughs)

361
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:56,925
And that was the trigger that released
the tensions of the previous night.

362
00:39:57,004 --> 00:39:58,760
And there were several of us

363
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:03,100
that were perfectly useless
for as much as an hour.

364
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,239
We were just laying on the ground
in convulsions.

365
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:20,705
(narrator) Of 21,000 Japanese troops
on Iwo Jima when the attack began,

366
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:23,155
only 200 were taken alive.

367
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:32,555
(man #5) I was on the island
a total of six days

368
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:35,282
and it seemed like 6,000 years.

369
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,225
(narrator) Iwo Jima's airfields were
functioning before the island was taken

370
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:46,138
thanks to the American
construction battalions, the CBs.

371
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:53,231
They played a key role here
and indeed in the whole Pacific war.

372
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:58,689
Now the time had come to penetrate
the inner ring of Japan's defences.

373
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,290
350 miles from the mainland
was the last great barrier

374
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:06,817
between the Allies and the planned
invasion of Imperial Japan -

375
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:09,577
the Japanese island of Okinawa.

376
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:13,218
On April 1, 1945,
the Americans attacked.

377
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:55,726
Japan's young suicide pilots,
the kamikazes,

378
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:59,061
swarmed to the defence of Okinawa.

379
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:08,574
Many flew their fatal missions
in obsolete aircraft, even trainers.

380
00:42:26,192 --> 00:42:29,138
(man) So many things were happening
and so quickly,

381
00:42:29,223 --> 00:42:32,594
that it was a little bit
like a big boxer in a ring

382
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:36,156
when he's being hit to the chin, face,
body and everywhere else,

383
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:40,531
cos we were catching it
from so many different angles.

384
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:50,198
In a regular attack,
it's a sporting chance you've got.

385
00:42:50,283 --> 00:42:54,003
With regular bombs and bullets,
you think you've got a very good chance,

386
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:59,449
but war is not so much of a sport
when you're fighting human bombs.

387
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:08,194
(narrator) Over 2,000 kamikaze pilots
met their deaths.

388
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:13,185
But they destroyed 30 US warships
and damaged 200 more.

389
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:26,760
(man) You were praying
that you could survive

390
00:43:26,842 --> 00:43:29,634
whatever kind of explosion
would come about.

391
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,671
Your life flashed in front of you,

392
00:43:31,752 --> 00:43:34,240
as you didn't know
if it would be seconds or minutes

393
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:36,733
until your life would be snuffed out.

394
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:38,954
(narrator)
US casualties were so severe,

395
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:44,867
at one point it seemed the invasion of
Okinawa might be stopped in its tracks.

396
00:43:46,214 --> 00:43:47,938
(man) The gunners can't turn it off.

397
00:43:48,056 --> 00:43:52,158
Once they gear themselves up
to fight man against man bomb,

398
00:43:52,237 --> 00:43:57,485
even though the plane is down,
it's hard for the gunner to stop.

399
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:25,726
One man,
he was in a 40 millimetre mount,

400
00:44:25,804 --> 00:44:29,785
and he had been fighting against quite
a number of planes that had come in,

401
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,707
but we had been hit in his area
also two or three times,

402
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:36,310
and all of a sudden,
with nobody understanding why,

403
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:38,758
he yelled, "It's hot today,"
jumped over the side

404
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:41,061
and that's the last we ever saw of him.

405
00:44:41,148 --> 00:44:43,941
But had he stayed aboard,
he might have survived.

406
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:47,473
But of course, we couldn't find
his body or anything after that.

407
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:50,195
But it was an unusual type of reaction.

408
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:55,025
He stayed with it just as long
as he could, until he broke.

409
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:57,600
And then that was the end
of his fighting.

410
00:44:57,682 --> 00:45:01,086
But every man, I believe,
has a breaking point.

411
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:04,577
And the kamikaze, I would estimate,

412
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:10,147
probably tests that breaking point
more than any other form of combat.

413
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:17,933
(narrator) Initial landings on Okinawa
were unopposed,

414
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:19,661
but as they pushed inland,

415
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,729
they came up against
a Japanese army of 100,000 troops,

416
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:26,987
withdrawn into a heavily fortified
central area.

417
00:45:44,982 --> 00:45:47,273
The steep hills and narrow ravines
of Okinawa

418
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,310
formed a natural citadel
for Japanese defenders.

419
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:54,794
Outnumbered two to one,

420
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:59,015
they made the Americans pay in blood
for every foot of Japanese soil.

421
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:38,684
With Japan herself close to surrender,

422
00:46:38,765 --> 00:46:43,434
not every Japanese soldier
wanted to fight on to the end.

423
00:48:21,842 --> 00:48:25,290
(narrator) The civilians of Okinawa
suffered appalling losses.

424
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:30,009
24,000 were killed.
Many thousands more injured.

425
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,195
(man) Once they found out

426
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:35,451
we weren't going to do the things
that they had heard,

427
00:48:35,576 --> 00:48:39,100
they could understand,
"Hey, this is just another human being."

428
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,593
Possibly they felt the same as we did,

429
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:45,276
that we weren't there
because we wanted to be there,

430
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,417
we were told
that this is what we had to do.

431
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:51,072
(narrator) To many Americans,

432
00:48:51,151 --> 00:48:54,020
at the end of their great advance
across the Pacific,

433
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:56,248
it now seemed that the animals,

434
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:00,585
the faceless fanatics
eager to die for their emperor,

435
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:04,068
were human beings like themselves.

436
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:08,366
(man) They showed kindness to their own
people, which we didn't really think.

437
00:49:08,452 --> 00:49:12,740
We thought life was cheap to them,
but that's not true.

438
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:15,999
They showed a lot of kindness
to their own wounded

439
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,878
and would tote 'em on their back,

440
00:49:18,963 --> 00:49:25,521
and two or three would carry 'em,
although they were weak themselves.

441
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,240
So they were people just like us.
