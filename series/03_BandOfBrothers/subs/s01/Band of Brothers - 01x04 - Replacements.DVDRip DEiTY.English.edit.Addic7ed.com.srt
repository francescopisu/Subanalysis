00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:23,247
A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

3
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,886
THE TOCCOA MEN, THAT'S
THE ONES THAT WAS THERE

4
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,420
AT THE VERY BEGINNING,

5
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,888
THEY ARE VERY
CLOSE AND...

6
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,919
THEY ACCEPT PEOPLE
COMING IN LIKE MYSELF,

7
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,595
AS A REPLACEMENT.

8
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,331
BUT YOU ALSO HAD
TO PROVE YOURSELF.

9
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,068
MOST OF THEM WERE, WE KNOW
WERE QUALIFIED PARACHUTISTS,

10
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,603
THEY HAD TO BE.

11
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,006
A LOT OF THEM
WERE AWFULLY GREEN,

12
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,641
AND WE KNEW THAT.

13
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,310
WE JUST, WE HOPED
WE COULD KEEP 'EM ALIVE

14
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,779
OR THEY COULD KEEP ALIVE,
A LOT OF 'EM DIDN'T.

15
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,510
BUT, ER, WELL, ALRIGHT,
THEY EVENTUALLY...

16
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,545
BLEND RIGHT IN.

17
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,912
I THINK MAYBE
THEY WERE TRYING TO

18
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,688
IMPRESS THE OLDER GUYS,

19
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,395
PEOPLE LIKE ME
OR SHIFTY...

20
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,731
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT,
I GOT RIGHT THERE TO WHERE

21
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,466
I DIDN'T WANNA
BE FRIENDLY

22
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,469
WITH REPLACEMENTS
COMING IN BECAUSE,

23
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,272
GOD, I DIDN'T LIKE
SEEING 'EM GET KILLED.

24
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,708
I JUST, IT JUST
TORE ME UP.

25
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,642
'CAUSE WE WERE
IN AWE OF THEM.

26
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,779
THEY WERE, THEY WERE WEARING
INFANTRY BADGES, YOU KNOW,

27
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:33,513
THE UNIFORM.

28
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,748
THEY HAD A STAR ON
THEIR JUMP WINGS.

29
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,649
THEY, UH...

30
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,141
THEY WERE LIKE HEROES
TO US, YOU KNOW?

31
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,689
THAT'S HOW
WE LOOKED AT THEM.

32
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,890
AND THEY WERE GOOD.

33
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,658
FURTHERMORE,
THEY WERE GOOD.

34
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,694
WE HAD GOOD OFFICERS,
FOR THE MOST PART,

35
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,629
BUT WE HAD
EXCELLENT NCOs.

36
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,826
THEY LOOKED, THEY
LOOKED AFTER YOU.

37
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,140
( chattering )

38
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,892
LIEUTENANT, NICE AND EASY.
WE'VE STILL GOT A SHOT.

39
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:20,760
( groaning )

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,130
TOUGH BREAK,
YOU'RE HAVING
A TOUGH NIGHT.

41
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,865
PEOPLE HAVE
TOUGH NIGHTS.

42
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,066
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

43
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:27,634
IT'S ALRIGHT.

44
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,295
NICE SHOT, SIR.

45
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,337

00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,831
DOUBLE SEVEN.

50
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,046
( groaning )

51
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,182
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING
THE LIEUTENANT, HERE.

52
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,083
HAVE A DRINK.

53
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,485

WINNING MONEY SOON,

55
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,521
I THINK YOUR BUDDIES ARE

YEAH, THEY DO LOOK
KIND OF SAD, DON'T THEY?

57
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,226
THEY'RE JUST SERIOUS

00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,342
WE'RE GETTING READY

101
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,277
FOR THAT FIRST FROG TOWN

102
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,646
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HEFFRON STOPS
DEAD IN HIS TRACKS.

103
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,615
BING AND A BANG

104
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,916
EVERYBODY BANGING
INTO EACH OTHER,

105
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,085
HEFFRON'S JUST STARIN' UP
AT THE NOSE OF THE PLANE

106
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:30,089
BECAUSE ON IT IS PAINTED
THIS BEAUTIFUL PINUP.

107
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,458
AND WRITTEN UNDERNEATH
"DARLING DORIS".

108
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:37,130
DORIS, WHICH JUST HAPPENS

THE SKIRT WHO JUST,

109
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,299

THAT'S IT, A
"DEAR BABE" LETTER.

114
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,179
WELL, ANYWAY, LUCKY

115
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,748
MISSION CANCELLED.
ON OTHER WORDS,

116
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,585

121
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,764

HE GIVES OUT SOME
OF HIS FOLKSY WISDOM

123
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,002
FROM BACK DOWN

124
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,404
PROBABLY THINK HE'S
A FUCKING HAYSEED.

125
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,304
AIN'T THAT RIGHT?

126
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,742
WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT?

127
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,688

WHERE'D YOU
GET THAT?

131
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,941
IT'S A PRESIDENTIAL
DISTINGUISHED
UNIT CITATION.

132
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:55,942
FOR, UH...

133
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,977
FOR WHAT THE REGIMENT

134
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,481
THAT'S RIGHT,
FOR WHAT THE
REGIMENT DID.

135
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,115
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

136
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,879
HEY, HEY, EASE

SHIT, COBB.

139
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,693
YOU DIDN'T FIGHT
IN NORMANDY NEITHER.

140
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,895
I GOT HIT IN THE
PLANE BEFORE I GOT
A CHANCE TO JUMP.

141
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,507
HEY, Y'ALL,

146
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,718
THIS HERE lS
CARWOOD LIPTON.

148
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,823

149
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,659
AS BEFITTING

150
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,186
HE SAYS HE HAS TO

151
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,767
WELL, HATE TO BREAK
THE MOOD HERE, BOYS,

152
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,395
BUT, WE'RE MOVING
OUT AGAIN.

153
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,961
( Winters )
AS YOU CAN SEE,

154
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,017
THIS IS CALLED
OPERATION MARKET GARDEN.

155
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,433
IN TERMS OF AIRBORNE
DIVISIONS INVOLVED,

156
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,401
THIS ONE'S EVEN
BIGGER THAN NORMANDY.

157
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,605
WE'RE DROPPING DEEP
INTO OCCUPIED HOLLAND.

158
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,735
THE ALLIED OBJECTIVE IS
TO TAKE THIS ROAD HERE,

159
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,510
BETWEEN EINDHOVEN
AND ARNHEM,

160
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,214
SO, THAT TWO BRITISH
ARMORED DIVISIONS
CAN MOVE UP IT

161
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:15,715
TOWARD ARNHEM.

162
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,485
OUR JOB IS GONNA BE TO
LIBERATE EINDHOVEN.

163
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,352
STAY THERE,
WAIT FOR THE TANKS.

164
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,327
THE ENTIRE EUROPEAN
ADVANCE HAS BEEN PUT
ON HOLD TO ALLOCATE

165
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,162
RESOURCES FOR
THIS OPERATION.

166
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,331
IT'S MONTGOMERY'S
PERSONAL PLAN

167
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,400
AND WE'LL BE UNDER
BRITISH COMMAND.

168
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,769
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
IF THIS WORKS,

169
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,438
THESE TANKS WILL BE OVER
THE RHINE AND INTO GERMANY.

170
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:43,309
IT COULD END THE WAR
AND GET US HOME BY CHRISTMAS.

171
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,742
( mumbling )

172
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,045
IT'LL BE A
DAY-TIME JUMP.

173
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,480
INTELLIGENCE DOESN'T
EXPECT MUCH OPPOSITION.

174
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,750
THEY THINK THE KRAUTS
IN HOLLAND ARE MOSTLY
KIDS AND OLD MEN.

175
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,719
AND WE SHOULD
TAKE 'EM BY SURPRISE.

176
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,655
ON ANY CASE,
SAY GOODBYE TO ENGLAND.

177
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,682
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
GONNA CALL THIS ONE OFF.

178
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,416
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

179
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,316
LOOK AT COBB, MAN.

180
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,454
WATCH AND LEARN, KIDS.

181
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,722
YOU WANNA LIVE?

182
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,781
JUMP READY TO FIGHT

183
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,325
THEY LET YOU OUT OF
THE HOSPITAL LIKE THAT, BOY?

184
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,432
THEY DIDN'T LET ME
OUT, I BUSTED OUT.

185
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,269
I DIDN'T WANNA GET
RE-ASSIGNED TO
SOME OTHER UNIT.

186
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,770
YEAH?

187
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,837
CAN YOU MAKE
THE JUMP?

188
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:55,273
OH, SURE I CAN, LIP,
I JUST CAN'T SIT.

189
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,144
WELCOME BACK, POPEYE.

190
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:58,711
THANKS, BULL.

191
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,981
POPEYE WENT AWOL
JUST IN TIME TO JUMP.

192
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,211
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

193
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,317
WHO, SOBEL?

194
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,155
WELL, HE'S THE NEWLY
APPOINTED REGIMENTAL S-4.

195
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,756
SUPPLY OFFICER?

196
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,558
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

197
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,727
HE PICKED ME UP
IN AIRBOURNE,

198
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,128
TRYING TO
FIND YOU GUYS.

199
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,426
HE KNOW YOU WENT AWOL?

200
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,498
HE KNOWS.

201
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,033
HE JUST SAID
I WAS LUCKY,

202
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,602
I COULD SIT OUT
THIS JUMP IF I WANTED.

203
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,571
I SAID I
DIDN'T WANT TO.

204
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,606
SO, HE SAYS
"HOP IN".

205
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,107
"HOP IN"?

206
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,942
YEAH, I KNOW, I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IT EITHER.

207
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,912
HEY, MAYBE HE'S
GONNA COURT-MARTIAL
ME LATER, HUH?

208
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,210
LET'S GET YOU
SOME GEAR.

209
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,745
HEY, MAL.

210
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,018
OVER THERE.

211
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,023
SON OF A BITCH.

212
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,060
MALARKEY.

213
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,740
SERGEANT MALARKEY.

214
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,039
SIR?

215
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,776
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD
GET AWAY WITH IT?

216
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,182
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, SIR?

217
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,095
SERGEANT, THAT
MOTORCYCLE IS UNITED
STATES ARMY PROPERTY.

218
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,030
THAT MAY NOT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU,

219
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,333
BUT IT MEANS
SOMETHING TO ME.

220
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,494
WHERE'D YOU FIND IT?

221
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,170
THAT'S HIM
ALRIGHT.

222
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,506
WHO IS HE, SARGE?

223
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:35,908
HE WAS OUR FIRST CO.

224
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,276
WHAT HAPPENED?

225
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,110
HE GOT PROMOTED.

226
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,578
JUST TAP MY LEG,
SERGEANT.

227
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,582
LIEUTENANT, YOU'LL
BE IN THE DOORWAY.

228
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:44,350
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT...

229
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,184
LOOK, SERGEANT,
YOU'LL BE THE
MAN BEHIND ME.

230
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,189
WHEN THE GREEN
LIGHT COMES ON,

231
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,991
IF YOU COULD JUST
TAP ME, ALRIGHT?

232
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,693
THE GREEN LIGHT WILL
BE NEXT TO YOU, SIR.

233
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,562
JUST DO IT,
THAT'S AN ORDER.

234
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,631
COME HERE, COME HERE.

235
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,432
SLING IT UP AND DOWN,
AND WHEN YOU HIT GROUND,

236
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,301
YOUR KNEE'LL
HIT THE BUTT.

237
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,636
THE BUSINESS END'LL
BREAK YOUR JAW.

238
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,704
LOSE YOUR RESERVE,
YOU WON'T NEED IT,

239
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,405
WE'RE JUMPING LOW.

240
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,808
TAKE YOUR BELLY BAND
AND WRAP IT AROUND YOU, FINE.

241
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,199
I'M SORRY, SARGE.

242
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:40,933
DON'T BE SORRY.

243
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,401
GRAB YOUR RIFLE,
LET'S GO.

244
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,988
WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT FROM, HOOBLER?

245
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,503
I THINK I
LOVE HOLLAND.

246
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,733
WHERE'D YOU
GET THESE?

247
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,607
THAT FARMHOUSE
OVER THERE.

248
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,303
JUST SITTING
OUT IN THE OPEN.

249
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,241
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE THEY WERE
EXPECTING US.

250
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,713
( loud plane soaring )

251
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:34,951
BOYS?

252
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,115
WHOO, MADE IT.

253
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,024
I WONDER IF
THEY HIT ANYTHING.

254
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,529
GOODBYE AIR SUPPORT.

255
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,210
THERE'S SOME KIND
OF HOLDUP AHEAD.

256
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,702
WE'RE GOING IN THROUGH
THIS FIELD HERE.

257
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,441
MOVE OUT, LET'S GO!

258
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,679
LET'S GO,
MOVE IT, MOVE IT!

259
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:25,225
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO
SHOOT AS STRAIGHT WITH
THAT THING ON.

260
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,688
OKAY, HOLD YOUR FIRE.

261
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,847
HEY, KID.

262
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:18,190
BULL!

263
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,626
BULL, YOU SEEN
CAPTAIN WINTERS?

264
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,786
NO, WHY?

265
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,325
KEEP YOUR SQUAD MOVING.

266
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,469
WHERE ARE ALL
THE GERMANS?

267
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,699
THEY COULD
BE ANYWHERE.

268
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,229
KEEP MOVING!

269
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,097
KEEP MOVING!

270
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,141
PARDON ME.

271
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,184
C'MON, LADY.

272
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,916
DICK,
CLOCK'S TICKING.

273
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:53,926
YEAH.

274
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,188
THANK YOU.

275
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,189
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU...

276
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,026
VERY KIND.

277
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,735
WHAT'S UP,
WELSHY?

278
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,369
SNIPERS.

279
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,395
WE'VE GOTTA GET
TO THESE BRIDGES.

280
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,064
( chattering )

281
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,158
SERGEANT TALBERT.

282
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,150
LET'S MOVE, WE'VE
GOT WORK TO DO.

283
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,392
( crowd singing )

284
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,862
WHAT DID THEY DO?

285
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,164
THEY SLEPT WITH
THE GERMANS.

286
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,791
THEY ARE LUCKY.

287
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,402
THE MEN WHO COLLABORATED
ARE BEING SHOT.

288
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,470
MR. VAN KOOIJK
HERE IS WITH THE
DUTCH RESISTANCE.

289
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,508
WE'VE BEEN WAITING
AND HOPING FOR THIS DAY...

290
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,443
FOR ALMOST
FIVE YEARS.

291
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,179
SAYS HE CAN HELP
US SECURE THE
BRIDGES HERE.

292
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:54,880
YES.

293
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,682
TOGETHER WE CAN PUSH
THE REMAINING GERMANS

294
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,816
OUT OF EINDHOVEN.

295
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,284
AND THAT'S JUST
THE BEGINNING.

296
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,719
ANY IDEA WHERE
THEY MIGHT BE?

297
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,956
AH, WELL, WE'RE STILL
WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW.

298
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,026
PEERS AND HIS FRIENDS HERE
ARE GATHERING INFORMATION

299
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:08,493
AS WE SPEAK.

300
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,796
HIS CONTACTS,
A COUPLE OF
TOWNS DOWN,

301
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:11,863
SAID THEY SAW
THE BRITISH 2nd

302
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,465
AND GUARDS ARMORED
MOVE THROUGH,

303
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,700
HALF AN HOUR AGO.

304
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,400
THEY'RE KIDS.

305
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,601
THESE ARE
RELIABLE REPORTS.

306
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,838
ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO
HELP YOU, WE WILL DO.

307
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,032
ANYTHING.

308
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,839
( cheering )

309
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,134
RIGHT ON TIME.

310
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:45,831
CAPTAIN.

311
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,367
I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHOW YOU
THE QUICKEST ROUTE

312
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,028
TO THE BRIDGES.

313
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,876
I'D BE HAPPY TO
HAVE YOUR HELP.

314
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,478
GET SCOUTS TO
THE EDGE OF TOWN

315
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,504
IN CASE WE'RE HERE
FOR THE NIGHT.

316
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,560
HEY, VAN KLINKEN.

317
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,532
WEBSTER.

318
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,933
SLEEPING OUTSIDE
IS FOR SUCKERS, GUYS.

319
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,773
BETTER BE GOOD,
I WAS ALMOST ASLEEP.

320
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:38,984
HERAUS, HANDE HOCH.

321
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:39,951
MACH SCHNELL.

322
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:40,952
NIEDERLANDER.

323
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,087
NIEDERLANDER.

324
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,588
SPRECHEN SIE ENGLISH?

325
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,282
JA.

326
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,425
A LITTLE BIT.

327
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,692
WHAT WERE YOU
DOING DOWN THERE?

328
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,127
IT'S AN AIR-RAlD
SHELTER.

329
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,962
MY FAMILY
HAS BEEN IN THERE

330
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,295
EVER SINCE THE FIRST
PLANE FLEW OVER.

331
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,034
WE'RE AMERICANS.

332
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,558
PARATROOPERS.

333
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,760
THE GERMANS--

334
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,072
ARE GONE?

335
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,073
THINK SO.

336
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,642
YOU SEE ANY,
YOU LET US KNOW.

337
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,644
ARE YOU HERE
TO STAY?

338
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,044
HMM-MMM.

339
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,212
AS LONG AS
WE HAVE TO.

340
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,247
YEAH, THEY DON'T
TELL US VERY MUCH.

341
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,916
OR FEED US MUCH.

342
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,110
PLEASE...

343
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,046
WAIT HERE.

344
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,856
YOU SEE THAT?

345
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:18,590
I SAY SCREW PARIS.

346
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,559
HEY, DON'T TALK
ABOUT SCREWING,
ALRIGHT?

347
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,754
THEY ALL
SPEAK ENGLISH.

348
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:23,762
THEY ALL LOVE US.

349
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,730
WHAT A FANTASTIC COUNTRY.

350
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,132
HEY, TAKE A LOOK.

351
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,497

AWAY, AWAY, AWAY!

397
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,913
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

398
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,448
HE SAID, OH...

399
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:43,948
"AWAY, AWAY".

400
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,884
WHICH EITHER MEANS THAT
THE GERMANS HAVE GONE

401
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,943
OR HE WANTS
US TO GO.

402
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,542
I DON'T KNOW.

403
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,019

00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,176
100 YARDS

418
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,751
I DON'T SEE HIM.

419
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,719
PUT A COUPLE OF SHELLS

420
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,655
YOU GONNA SEE HIM

421
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,122
I CAN'T.

422
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,891
MY ORDERS ARE
NO UNNECESSARY
DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY.

423
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,985
I'M TELLING YOU,

00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,667
I CAN'T BLOODY WELL
SHOOT HIM, CAN I?

427
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,135
ARE YOU STAYING
OR GOING?

428
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,171
HE'S GONNA SEE

429
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,249
WHAT THE HELL'S

430
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,672

00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,619
THERE'S A DITCH

444
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,811
YOU HAD TO LEAVE HIM.

00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,679
HE'S STILL ALIVE!

446
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,981
WHO'S HURT?

00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,016
OTHER SIDE OF

00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,040

00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,797
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO,
LIEUTENANT?

460
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,274

465
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,197
WE ARE COVERED

466
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,099

CAP'N, WE GOT

512
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:48,853
11 INJURED.

00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,253
OKAY, LET'S

00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:55,092
OH, AND, SIR,

515
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,026
RANDLEMAN?

516
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,186
YES, SIR.

517
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,989
OKAY, LET'S GO.

518
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,398
WHERE'S THE BULL?

519
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,729
DON'T KNOW.

520
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:11,151
I NEVER FIRED A SHOT,
THE WHOLE TIME.

521
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,662
FIND ANYTHING OUT?

522
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,095
ABOUT WHAT?

523
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,558
ANYTHING.

524
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,993
WHAT WE'RE
DOING NEXT.

525
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:27,765
NO.

526
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,142
OH, I DID HEAR
ONE THING.

527
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,311
LIEUTENANT BREWER'S
GONNA MAKE IT.

528
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:34,945
WHAT?

529
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,015
LIEUTENANT BREWER'S
GONNA MAKE IT.

530
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:38,916
NAH, THERE'S NO WAY.

531
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,184
HE'S HEADED
BACK TO ENGLAND.

532
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,452
THEY'LL PROBABLY
SEND HIM HOME.

533
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,220
HOW IS
THAT POSSIBLE?

534
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,956
HE DID TURN HIS HEAD
AT THE LAST SECOND.

535
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,687
WHEN SERGEANT RANDLEMAN
