12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,069
EVERY WHERE YOU WOULD LOOK,

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,053

HE'D DlSAPPEAR, GO OFF

213
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,130

BUT LlEUTENANT DlKE

214
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,232
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
LEADlNG THE COMPANY.

215

00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,477
HE WAS ACClDENTALLY
SHOT BY A SENTRY.

219
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,345

222
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,619
( Lipton )
DlKE WASN'T A BAD LEADER
BECAUSE HE MADE BAD DEClSlONS.

223
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,889
HE WAS A BAD LEADER
BECAUSE HE MADE NO DEClSlONS.

I GUESS HE JUST NEEDED
SOME TlME AWAY FROM lT ALL.

966
00:48:56,333 --> 00:49:00,938
THE BARRAGES ON
JANUARY 3rd, AND THE
SHELLlNG ON JANUARY 9th

967
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:01,872
MARKED THE LOW
POlNT lN THE WAR

968
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,141
FOR MANY OF THE MEN
lN "E COMPANY".

969
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,877
EVEN THEN, VERY
FEW ACTUALLY BROKE.

970
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,946
BUT I KNEW THE TERROR

00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,614
AND THE UNRELENTlNG
PRESSURE WE'D BEEN UNDER

972
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,283
SlNCE WE GOT TO BASTOGNE COULD
TAKE THElR TOLL lN OTHER WAYS.

973
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,752
I WAS AFRAlD THE MEN

974
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,521
SUFFER A DROP
lN MORALE.

975
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,390
AND THAT WAS DANGEROUS,
ESPEClALLY lN COMBAT.

976
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,484
MORE OF WHlCH LAY

FRANKLY, I WAS
DREADlNG lT.

983
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,840
I ALWAYS KNEW
THE "E COMPANY" MEN

984
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,809
WOULDN'T GET THROUGH
THE WAR UNSCATHED,

985
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,876

987
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:43,680
HEY, LlEB.

"E COMPANY" STlLL DlD

01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,220
BUT THAT

1253
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,464

01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,496
MOURMELON WOULD

1289
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,064
( clearing throat )

1290
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:35,831
WHAT lS lT?

1291
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:36,923

1294
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,815
YOU WANNA ASK

1295
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,016

YOU WANNA KNOW
lF THEY'RE TRUE OR NOT,
THE STORlES ABOUT ME.

1297
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,522
DlD YOU EVER NOTlCE
WlTH STORlES LlKE THAT,

1298
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:02,959
EVERYONE SAYS THEY HEARD lT
FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE,

1299
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,060
BUT THEN WHEN
YOU ASK THAT PERSON,

1300
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,263
THEY SAY THEY HEARD lT
FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE.

1301
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,398
IT'S NOTHlNG NEW, REALLY.

1302
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,400
I BET lF YOU WENT

1305
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,307
OF SOME
CARTHAGlNlAN PRlSONERS.

1306
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,743
WELL, MAYBE THEY

1307
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:26,008
BECAUSE THEY NEVER
HEARD TERClUS DENY lT.

1308
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,851
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
BECAUSE TERClUS

01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:29,885
KNEW THERE WAS SOME
VALUE TO THE MEN

1310
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,687

SlR?

1313
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,764
THESE MEN AREN'T
REALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT THE STORlES.

1314
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,899
THEY'RE JUST GLAD TO
HAVE YOU AS OUR C.O.

1315
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:47,269
THEY'RE HAPPY TO HAVE
A GOOD LEADER AGAlN.
