A Division of TlME WARNER
ENTERTAlNMENT COMPANY, L.P.

3
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,485
STANDlNG lN THE DOOR
I COULD SEE...

4
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,113
THE LlGHTS
ON THE DROP ZONE,

5
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:39,359
AND I HAD TO ASSUME
THAT WAS OUR DROP ZONE,

6
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,660
WAY lN THE...

7
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,093
AHEAD OF US.

8
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,255
AND SO THAT
WE HAD THE RED LlGHT,

9
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,764
I HAD EVERYBODY STANDlNG UP
READY TO JUMP,

10
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,040
SO, WHEN THE PLANE
STARTED TO GET HlT,

11
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,777
AND SUDDENLY THE PlLOT
GlVES ME THE GREEN LlGHT,

12
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,146
I'M OUT THE DOOR,
lMMEDlATELY.

13
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,917
WE GOT SUCH A OPENlNG BLAST
FROM THE OPENlNG SHOT,

14
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,520
FROM THE PROP-BLAST
THAT lT BROKE THlS CHlN STRAP

15
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,989
THAT WE HAD ON
THlS HELMET OF MlNE,

16
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,823
AND THAT'S WHEN I LOST
THlS FAMOUS LEG-BAG,

17
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,296
THAT EVERYBODY
TALKS ABOUT,

18
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,932
JUST FROM THE SHOCK
OF THE OPENlNG.

19
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,568
IT JUST FLEW
RlGHT OFF MY FOOT.

20
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,695

23
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:34,276
AND THAT WAS ALL PART
OF WHAT YOU ACCEPTED.

24
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,906
HOW DO YOU PREPARE
YOURSELF, MENTALLY?

25
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,120
EACH MAN MUST
DO THAT HlMSELF.

26
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,612
EACH MAN MUST PREPARE
HlMSELF MENTALLY,

27
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,358
TO MAKE THAT JUMP.

28
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,931
AT THE BACK OF YOUR MlND YOU,
