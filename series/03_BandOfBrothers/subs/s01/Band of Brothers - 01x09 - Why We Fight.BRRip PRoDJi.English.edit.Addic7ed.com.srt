1
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:12,638
Everybody was happy to see the war
coming to an end.

2
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:17,893
The Germans didn't have a heart for it
and realized the end was there.

3
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:22,814
We used to say, "The only good Kraut
is a dead one". Well...

4
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,443
Most of them were kids.
We all were kids.

5
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,279
They had a job to do,
same as me.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,243
We went about and did the job
that we had to do.

7
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:41,625
We thought Germans were
the evilest people in the world.

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:47,297
As the war went along, we found that
it wasn't the Germans, per se.

9
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,259
I've thought about this often.

10
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,971
That man and I might've been
good friends.

11
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,349
He might've liked to fish,
or to hunt.

12
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,976
You never know.

13
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:04,189
Of course, we were both doing
what we were supposed to do...

14
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,529
...but under different circumstances,
we might've been friends.

15
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:40,155
That way. That way.

16
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,091
One thing about the Krauts.
They sure clean up good.

17
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,804
Yeah, all you need is a little Mozart.

18
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,723
Beethoven.

19
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,768
- Sorry, sir?
- That's not Mozart.

20
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,064
That's Beethoven.

21
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,374
Come on, chicken.

22
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,127
All right, this one's got some,
George.

23
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,088
You grab the chicken,
I grab the eggs.

24
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,673
Great. Fine.

25
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,092
Grab him by the foot. Come on.

26
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:30,057
If this thing bites me, Frank,
I swear I'll shoot it.

27
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,064
Hold on!

28
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:41,276
- Come on, George.
- Hold on a second. Hold on.

29
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:45,989
Hey, come on.
I just wanna talk to you.

30
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,120
I just want to talk.

31
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,706
Look what I got.

32
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,544
Chocolate bar. You like that?
You like chocolate?

33
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:02,840
- Luz, leave her alone.
- Frank, leave me alone, okay?

34
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,551
Don't like chocolate?
How's this?

35
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,178
Cigarettes. Camel.

36
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,973
- Yeah, you like that.
- Luz...

37
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,142
Frank, go make your omelet!

38
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,646
You ain't getting my eggs, blockhead.

39
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,482
My friend just keeps talking.

40
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,736
I got two packs here.
Give it to your friends.

41
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:29,449
Why don't you come sit?
Wanna sit down?

42
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:35,164
That's it.
We'll smoke cigarettes.

43
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,586
Hey, Frank. Hold on.

44
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,171
Perc.

45
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,674
Jesus, come on.

46
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,053
What?

47
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,355
- That Captain Nixon?
- I think so.

48
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,400
- Why's he in his harness?
- I don't know.

49
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,696
Maybe we jumped into Berlin,
the war's over.

50
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:12,201
- No dice with the "FrÃ¤ulein"?
- She smacked me in the mouth.

51
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:16,705
Germany's looking like pretty good
fraternizing territory.

52
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,041
Lose your cigarettes?

53
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,251
Oh, God! Yeah, yeah.

54
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,713
God!

55
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:34,598
- Janovec?
- Oh, shit!

56
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,184
Sir!

57
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,937
Where's my stuff?

58
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:44,858
I thought I'd leave it
over there, sir.

59
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,512
Here.

60
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:23,230
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, sir.

61
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,196
Sir.

62
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,581
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

63
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:46,378
- You got a box all this will fit into?
- Yes, sir. Same destination?

64
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,963
Yeah.

65
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,175
I'll make sure it goes out
first thing.

66
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,885
Thank you, private.

67
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:57,890
Your folks'll have quite a collection
when you get...

68
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,019
...home, sir.

69
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,230
Finders, keepers.

70
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,692
Yes, sir.

71
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,424
Nix?

72
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:37,095
- Nix?
- In here.

73
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,770
You dog.

74
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,733
Making combat jumps with the 17th while I'm
in supply briefings all morning.

75
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,443
Yeah, lucky me.

76
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:58,200
You're the only man in the 101st
with three stars over his jump wings.

77
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,371
Not bad for someone
who's never fired in combat.

78
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,206
Really?

79
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:08,043
- Really, you've never...?
- Nope.

80
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,879
Even with all the action we've seen?

81
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,883
Not a round.

82
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,721
So...

83
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,393
How'd it go this morning?
The jump?

84
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:29,481
It was great. Fantastic.

85
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:35,320
Took a direct hit over the drop zone.
I got out. Two others.

86
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,822
The rest?

87
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:41,785
They blew up over Germany somewhere.
Boom.

88
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:46,248
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
- About what?

89
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,502
- Tough situation for the...
- Yeah, the boys. Terrible.

90
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,756
Oh well, wasn't me.

91
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:59,970
You know, the real tragedy is,
they also lost their CO.

92
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,140
Guess who gets to write
the letters home?

93
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,144
Goddamn nightmare.

94
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,822
Got a visit from Colonel Sink
this morning.

95
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,287
- And how is the good colonel?
- Concerned.

96
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:29,708
Still drinking nothing but Vat 69?

97
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,963
Only the finest
for Mrs. Nixon's baby boy.

98
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:38,091
That a problem up at Regiment?

99
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:41,970
What, this? Is that what he said?

100
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,640
No, I just don't like it up there.

101
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,475
Good.

102
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:52,648
You'll be happy to hear that Sink is
transferring you to Battalion S3.

103
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:57,110
What do you think I should write
to these parents?

104
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:01,782
- Hear what I said? You've been demoted.
- Demoted, got you.

105
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,410
How do I tell them
their kids never made it out?

106
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:10,290
Tell them what you always tell them.
Their sons died as heroes.

107
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,336
You really still believe that?

108
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:18,674
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

109
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,302
Don't you?

110
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:30,060
The Cooperative for American
Remittance to Europe...

111
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:36,608
...is assembling food packs to assist
European families in dire need.

112
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,777
Presumably all of them.

113
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:45,033
Notes to your family reminding them
to donate are appreciated.

114
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:51,748
I'm sure you'll all be happy to know
"Oklahoma" is still playing.

115
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:07,139
O'Keefe, you sitting on your bayonet?
Leave the singing to Luz.

116
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,268
Unless you wanna do
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top".

117
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:15,105
- Rita Hayworth's getting married.
- Say it isn't true.

118
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:19,276
Abbott and Costello...

119
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:25,699
Resistance in Ruhr's crumbling.
Might be a breakout in Remagen.

120
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:30,287
The Krauts forgot to blow up
one of their bridges.

121
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,166
I guess the 17th Airborne
did okay, after all.

122
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:40,088
We'd be in Berlin by now,
if it was us instead of them.

123
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,468
Perconte! How you doing?

124
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:48,138
When will we jump into Berlin,
see some real action?

125
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,682
- You in a rush?
- No.

126
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,644
What, you want a Medal of Honor?

127
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:59,024
- I just thought I'd ask.
- Do us all a favor. Don't think.

128
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,778
Damn replacements.

129
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,996
- Hallelujah.
- About time.

130
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:17,501
You're lucky. Nixon was giving
a current-events lecture.

131
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,504
- Tell me nothing's happening.
- Nothing.

132
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:25,717
Couple of artillery rounds at dawn,
probably from across the river.

133
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:30,264
That's about it.
It spooked Hashey, though.

134
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,767
- Here, I just finished it.
- Any sex in it?

135
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,645
Ain't that kind of book.

136
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:41,358
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

137
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,544
Hey, O'Brien.
Relax, I'm trying to read.

138
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,754
It's O'Keefe.

139
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,298
Is that right?

140
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:09,720
Patrick O'Keefe.
My friends call me Paddy.

141
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:27,487
Hey, O'Brien. Shut up!

142
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:31,325
I told you, it's O'Keefe.

143
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:35,871
Know why no one remembers your name?
No one wants to.

144
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,875
There's too many Smiths, DiMattos
and O'Keefes...

145
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:45,214
...who replace Toccoa men that you
got killed in the first place.

146
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,217
They're all like you.
Piss and vinegar.

147
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:52,262
"Where are the Krauts?
When do we jump into Berlin?"

148
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:55,641
Two days later,
their guts are hanging out...

149
00:16:55,891 --> 00:17:00,354
...and they're screaming for a medic,
begging for their mother.

150
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,524
Dumb fucks don't even know
they're dead.

151
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,234
You listening to me?

152
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,320
This is the best part of war
I've seen.

153
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,115
I got hot chow, hot showers,
warm bed.

154
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:18,080
Germany is as good as being home.
I wiped my ass with real toilet paper.

155
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,415
Quit asking if you'll see action.

156
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:25,671
And stop with the fucking love songs.

157
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:52,573
- When you ship out? A few weeks ago?
- Yeah.

158
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:57,369
It's been two years since I seen home.

159
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,872
Two years.

160
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:04,126
This fucking war.

161
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,129
Neither patrol found one Kraut.

162
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,591
They're across the river now.
Send a night patrol.

163
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:15,179
Check the embankment
on the far side.

164
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:19,600
President's dead.

165
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,978
Pair of queens bets.

166
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:28,567
- All right, 2 bucks.
- Nix?

167
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,361
- No, I'm out.
- All right.

168
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:37,451
Well, I'll call your 2
and I'll raise you another 2.

169
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:42,039
- Can't believe we won't go to Berlin.
- No shit.

170
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:47,002
- Ike'll let the Russkies have it.
- Russkies.

171
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,046
Goddamn it.

172
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:53,175
This war's not about fighting,
it's about who gets what.

173
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:56,053
Deal me out of the next hand.

174
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,598
What about your money?

175
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:03,936
- Are we waiting on him again?
- Yeah.

176
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:58,782
Goddamn drugstore.

177
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,999
Sir.

178
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,961
Hey guys, wait up!

179
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,297
- Hey, Dexter.
- Good to see you.

180
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:18,051
- You know who that was?
- No.

181
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,148
Morning.

182
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:35,319
Captain Nixon, good to see you.
I have mail for you.

183
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:40,240
I was gonna drop it off this afternoon
with all the other mail...

184
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,369
...but since you're here...

185
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,332
Listen, I'm having some trouble
finding whiskey.

186
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:52,377
- Whiskey?
- A particular brand of whiskey.

187
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,838
- Vat 69.
- Exactly right.

188
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,217
That won't be easy to find
here in Germany.

189
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,677
- Pickings are slim.
- I know it.

190
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:05,140
And even if I do find some, sir,
it won't be cheap.

191
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,310
- Not a problem.
- Vest, you hear the news?

192
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,688
- Sir, I didn't know you were here.
- News?

193
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,233
300,000 Krauts just surrendered.

194
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:18,153
- Three hundred?
- We're moving out in an hour.

195
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:22,241
- One hour?
- Yeah.

196
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:26,954
Sir? Sir! Your mail.

197
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,124
Keep looking.

198
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:40,175
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Get a move on. Let's go.

199
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:43,387
Jesus Christ. The dog?

200
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,139
Lew?

201
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,853
- Cathy's divorcing me.
- I'm sorry.

202
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:54,064
She's taking everything.

203
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:59,194
She's taking the house, taking the kid,
she's taking the dog.

204
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:06,076
It's not even her dog. It's my dog!
She's taking my dog!

205
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:10,789
Let's go! Load it up!
Come on!

206
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,675
What do you have in here?
Germans?

207
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,760
Hey, Perconte.

208
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:27,139
- Got a lighter?
- No, sir. Where we headed?

209
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,808
The Alps.
Let me see that lighter.

210
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,977
- The Alps?
- Yeah.

211
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,979
- That near Berlin?
- No.

212
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:38,734
That's in Bavaria.
Birthplace of National Socialism.

213
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:41,695
So that means no drop into Berlin?

214
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:46,325
Hitler sent the Waffen SS into
the mountains to repel invaders.

215
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:51,622
- He wants to start a guerrilla war.
- Invaders. Damn, I like that.

216
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,666
They'll die the last man trying.

217
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:57,211
- Sir.
- What?

218
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,839
My lighter.

219
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,512
- All right, nice lighter.
- Thanks.

220
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,430
Waffen SS, huh?

221
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,144
You'll get your wish, O'Flannery.
Those guys are crazy.

222
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:18,023
It's O'Keefe.

223
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:06,864
- You okay, Nix?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

224
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:11,869
She hates that dog.

225
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:46,278
It's gonna be good times, Web.
When we get home.

226
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,657
I'm gonna get my job back
at the cab company in Frisco.

227
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:55,287
Make a killing off all those
fucking sailors coming home.

228
00:24:55,537 --> 00:25:00,751
Then I'm gonna find a nice Jewish girl
with great big soft titties...

229
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,212
...and a smile to die for.

230
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:04,922
Marry her.

231
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:09,009
Then I'm gonna buy a big house
with lots of bedrooms...

232
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,095
...for all the little Liebgotts.

233
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,764
She ought to like that.

234
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:17,559
Janovec, what you reading?

235
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:22,648
- An article.
- No shit. What's it about?

236
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:27,444
It's about why we're
fighting the war.

237
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,948
Why are we fighting the war, Janovec?

238
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:34,910
It seems that the Germans are bad.
Very bad.

239
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,539
You don't say?
The Germans are bad?

240
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:43,752
Frank, this guy's reading an article,
says the Germans are bad.

241
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,880
- And you, Web?
- Learn something every day.

242
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,467
I guess I'll finish school first,
and then...

243
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,971
Wait a minute. Finish school?

244
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:59,017
You're always talking about Harvard
and you haven't even finished?

245
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:02,020
I haven't told you anything.

246
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:05,649
Yes, I haven't finished.
So the fuck what?

247
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:10,946
All right, let it breathe a little.
Jesus. Fuck.

248
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:18,287
It's just the way you always talked.
We all figured that...

249
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:24,334
You know, you're right.
So the fuck what?

250
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:31,133
So, what did you study?

251
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,094
Literature.

252
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,930
Get out of here. You serious?

253
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,891
- I love to read.
- Do you?

254
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:44,396
Yeah. "Dick Tracy",
"Flash Gordon", mostly.

255
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:48,692
Yeah. Fuck.

256
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,993
- Keep moving.
- Up three.

257
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:06,043
Tell her she's got five minutes.

258
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:10,047
Go, go, go!

259
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:17,888
Sir, she says she's got
nowhere to go.

260
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,307
This guy says he's not a Nazi.

261
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,809
Why haven't I met one Nazi?

262
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,482
We'll only be here one night!
You have four minutes!

263
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:38,200
- Let's go! Move!
- All of you, out!

264
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:18,198
Look. Even in defeat, they still know
how to march with pride.

265
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:34,339
Hey, you! Hey, you!

266
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,926
That's right,
you stupid Kraut bastards!

267
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:39,636
That's right!

268
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,599
Say hello to Ford!
And General fucking Motors!

269
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,519
You stupid fascist pigs!
Look at you!

270
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,480
You have horses.
What were you thinking?

271
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:53,275
That's enough, Webster.

272
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,653
Give it a rest.

273
00:28:56,904 --> 00:29:00,532
Dragging our asses
halfway around the world.

274
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,202
Interrupting our lives. For what?

275
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:10,501
You ignorant, servile scum!
What the fuck are we doing here?

276
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:25,617
Everyone out! Move it!

277
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:32,749
1st Platoon, I want roadblocks to
shut off roads in and out of town.

278
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:38,130
Send out patrols. Dog in the village,
Easy and Fox in the woods.

279
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,427
Easy takes the northwest. Lipton?
Have 1st Platoon swing to the woods.

280
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:45,053
Yes, sir. Talbert!

281
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:48,307
You're not worried about an ambush,
are you?

282
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:54,730
No, just in case we have
to stay here for the night.

283
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:14,041
- O'Keefe.
- Sarge?

284
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:18,212
- Why the hell are you so jumpy?
- I'm not jumpy, I'm fine.

285
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:21,131
I can hear your heart pounding.

286
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:26,303
Jesus Christ, give the kid
a break, Bull.

287
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,972
- Hey, George.
- Yeah?

288
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:33,185
This kind of remind you of Bastogne?

289
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:36,188
Yeah, now that you mention it.

290
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:41,193
Except there's no snow,
we got warm grub in our bellies...

291
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:46,323
...and the trees aren't exploding
from Kraut artillery, but yeah.

292
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:49,910
- Besides that, it's a lot like Bastogne.
- Right?

293
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,579
Bull, smack him for me, please?

294
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,999
Thank you.

295
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:04,091
Sir, your men come with me.
Let's move it.

296
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:09,096
Hello?

297
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,688
Hello?

298
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:53,408
It sure is quiet.

299
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:57,955
He is right, fellas.

300
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,696
- You seen Foley?
- No.

301
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:17,326
- Any of you seen any officers?
- Speak to Popeye.

302
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:19,620
Seen any of the officers?

303
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,499
Speirs is right down the street.
What's the matter?

304
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:30,756
- More, have you seen any officers?
- Major Winters is right in there.

305
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:37,304
Major Winters, sir...

306
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:41,558
We found something out on patrol.
We came across this...

307
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:45,896
What? Frank, what is it?

308
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:51,819
I don't know, sir. I don't know.

309
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:23,619
- Open it up.
- Yes, sir.

310
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:31,877
Stand back. Give us some room here.

311
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:36,006
Back. Back.

312
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:16,380
- Any of your men speak German?
- No, sir.

313
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:20,467
I need Liebgott. Liebgott!
Lipton, find Liebgott.

314
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:24,137
Liebgott! Liebgott!

315
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:29,935
- Major needs you up front, right now.
- Sure.

316
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:33,897
They need care.
Give them water and rations.

317
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:35,691
Grab blankets.

318
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:39,570
Oh, my God.

319
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,740
Dick?

320
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,290
I'm sorry.

321
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,127
Here, take some water.

322
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:41,423
Jesus, Web, can you believe
this place?

323
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:45,052
- No.
- My God.

324
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:04,696
It's okay. It's better now.

325
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:15,499
He said the guards left this morning.

326
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:24,758
They burned some of the huts first.

327
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,928
With the prisoners still in them.
Alive.

328
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:31,974
Jesus Christ.

329
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:37,312
Some of the prisoners
tried to stop them.

330
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:41,942
Some of them were killed.

331
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:49,032
They didn't have enough ammo
for all the prisoners...

332
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:53,829
...so they killed as many
as they could...

333
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:58,375
...before they left the camp.

334
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:04,089
They locked the gates behind them
and headed south.

335
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:10,804
- Someone in town told them about us.
- Yeah, I think so.

336
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:19,021
Will you ask him what kind
of camp this is?

337
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:25,402
What, why are they here?

338
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:37,748
He says it's a work camp for...

339
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:42,169
I'm not sure what the word means.

340
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:46,340
- Unwanted, disliked, maybe?
- Criminals?

341
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:51,094
I don't think criminals, sir.

342
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:55,891
No.

343
00:41:55,974 --> 00:42:00,938
Doctors, musicians, tailors,
clerks, farmers, intellectuals.

344
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:04,441
I mean, normal people.

345
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,991
They're Jews.

346
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:18,121
Poles and Gypsies.

347
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:35,055
Liebgott?

348
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:40,727
The women's camp is
at the next railroad stop.

349
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:11,341
Hey, Babe, come here.

350
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:17,222
Look at their arms.

351
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:22,769
- Like cattle.
- Goddamn.

352
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:46,144
O'Keefe?

353
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:49,523
O'Keefe?

354
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:16,258
I'm gonna call Sink.

355
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:24,308
Find Speirs and figure out how
to get them some food and water.

356
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:37,279
Let's go. Let's pick up the pace here.

357
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:43,911
Get whatever we can
fit on the deuce and a half.

358
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,919
Take everything. Take it all.

359
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:54,213
Shut up!

360
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:59,635
Check the back.
Shut up!

361
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:07,309
I said shut up, you Nazi fuck!

362
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:10,604
You're not a Nazi?
My mistake, you prick.

363
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:12,314
Are you a human?

364
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:18,237
Or are you gonna tell me
you never smelled the stench?

365
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:25,661
He says he doesn't know
what you're talking about.

366
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:33,043
Bullshit.

367
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:52,104
Sergeant, this is chaos.
There's plenty to go around!

368
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:58,819
More water on the way.

369
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:03,323
- Dick? Major Winters.
- Yes, sir?

370
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:07,494
Sir.

371
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:12,583
This is Dr. Kent.
Doc, tell them what you just told me.

372
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:17,004
We need to stop giving these men food.
They're starving.

373
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:19,548
They'll eat themselves to death.

374
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:23,635
Keep them in the camp
until we find a place in town.

375
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,054
You want us to lock them up?

376
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:28,682
- We got no choice.
- They'll scatter.

377
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:33,270
We need them centralized
so we can supervise their treatment.

378
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,733
- Until we find some place better...
- Colonel Sink.

379
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,152
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:44,364
I don't like it any more
than you guys.

381
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:47,826
General Taylor?
Bob Sink, 506.

382
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:52,122
Sir, we're at Landsberg,
the other side of Buchloe.

383
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:55,876
We found something
you ought to see, sir.

384
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:59,046
I can't tell them that, sir.

385
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:03,258
You got to, Joe.

386
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:08,972
Yes, sir.

387
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:15,103
Grant, Christenson.

388
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:21,360
These prisoners have to be
put back in the camp immediately.

389
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:31,680
I'm staying in the only dry house
in Germany.

390
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,600
Thought you weren't drinking the local.

391
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:37,477
Yeah, well...

392
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,148
Heard from Division.

393
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:46,445
Been finding camps like this
all over the place.

394
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:50,741
Seems the Russians liberated one
a lot worse.

395
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:55,871
- Worse?
- Yeah. Apparently.

396
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:02,294
Ten times as big.
Execution chambers. Ovens.

397
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:06,423
For cremating all the bodies.

398
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:08,842
Jesus.

399
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:12,221
Locals claim they never knew
about the camp.

400
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:14,389
They say we exaggerate.

401
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,144
Well, they're gonna have
a hell of an education tomorrow.

402
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:22,439
General Taylor declared martial law.

403
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:28,445
Ordered every able-bodied German
14 to 80 to bury the bodies tomorrow.

404
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:32,574
- 10th Armored will supervise cleanup.
- What about us?

405
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:35,202
We head out for...

406
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:42,209
...Thalem tomorrow, 1200 hours.

407
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:11,822
- Kerchief, sir?
- What? No, thanks.

408
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:17,870
Move along. Over there.

409
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:15,135
Don't stop.

410
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:19,473
You too. Come on.

411
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:17,364
Hitler's dead.

412
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:21,660
- Holy shit.
- Shot himself in Berlin.

413
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:27,791
- Is the war over, sir?
- No.

414
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,170
We have orders to Berchtesgaden.

415
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,674
Why? The man's not home.

416
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:41,430
Should've killed himself 3 years ago.
Saved us a lot of trouble.

417
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,018
Yeah, he should've.

418
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:50,522
But he didn't.
