1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,340
You idiot!!!

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,440
You believed the enemy's words and lost the will to fight?!

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,520
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,450
Don't lose your composure!

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,680
Do not simply accept death.

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,030
If you are truly my aide, then keep your head.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,030
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,490
I'm going to continue to rely on you to watch my back. Be prepared.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,620
You have no right to talk, Colonel.

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,200
What kind of commander wanders out in a mission like that?

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,920
Shut up!

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,050
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow...

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,180
Besides, why am I in the same room as you?!

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,050
Aren't hospital rooms supposed to be singles with beautiful nurses?

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,950
You'll have to deal with it.

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,040
It's much easier for me to guard you two if you're recovering in the same room.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,060
That's what's worrying me.

18
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,440
Why haven't they come to kill us?

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,440
Why?!

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,730
Why did you let the flame guy leave alive?!

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,860
He burned Lust to death!

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,740
Lust... died...

23
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,660
It's not too late! Go kill him!

24
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,040
Roy Mustang. We can use him.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,730
Use? Don't tell me you're going to make him open the...

26
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,490
Worry not.

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,290
Father put me in charge of him.

28
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,110
What if it's decomposed?

29
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,150
What?

30
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,570
My body on the other side of the gate hasn't taken in any nutrition!

31
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,410
Even if I was able to return to a body like that...

32
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,580
Brother! Winry!

33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,230
Really, Ed?!

34
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,600
This is only hypothetical, but when we tried to transmute Mom,

35
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,630
we used our blood in the formula as information for her soul, right?

36
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,680
Yeah.

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,930
Then, we were both taken to
the other side and were decomposed.

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,440
I wonder if there's a possibility our minds were entangled during that process?

39
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,200
What do you mean?

40
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm wondering if it's possible your body and I are connected in some way.

41
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,780
You know, for my age, I'm sh-

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,920
Sh...

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,960
Short...

44
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,280
He said it.

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,210
He was able to face reality.

46
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,660
So you're saying your growth is connected to how Al would have grown?

47
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,470
Sounds crazy to me.

48
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,970
It's not crazy!

49
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,500
You're short because you never drink milk.

50
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,200
This again?!

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,380
Of course!

52
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,510
Now that I think about it, Brother is always sleeping.

53
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,480
Could it be he's making up for my sleep, too?

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,120
Drink it!

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,330
I said, no!

56
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,370
Do it!

57
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,210
No!

58
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,970
It would be nice if that's the case.

59
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,780
Drink it!

60
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,240
No!

61
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,780
Paying the Colonel a visit?

62
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,790
Mr. Havoc is injured, too,
so we wanted to pay them a proper visit.

63
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,080
I'm not sure I would be here today
if the Colonel hadn't come to our rescue.

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,000
Is that why you're here, too, Sergeant Fuery?

65
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,840
Running some errands for the Lieutenant.

66
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,550
I've calculated the approximate distance to that large door...

67
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,230
...by counting the steps I took since entering Research Laboratory 3's basement.

68
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,530
The exact direction is unclear, so I drew a circle with the laboratory at the center, and...

69
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,060
Central headquarters?

70
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,070
And to top it off, this building is...

71
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,420
The FÃ¼hrer President's residence.

72
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,730
The Homunculi reside under there?

73
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,960
So there's a chance the FÃ¼hrer President has connections to them... eh?

74
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,510
If he does, then I wonder why he killed Greed and his crew?

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,300
He's still suspicious, even if he doesn't have ties to them.

76
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,010
He killed them all without even trying to extract information from them.

77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,010
FÃ¼hrer President... He's mysterious.

78
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,570
Either way, the enemy has infiltrated pretty high up in the military command.

79
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,390
We ought to approach him with caution from now on.

80
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,070
Fullmetal. Take care of yourself.

81
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,780
Homunculus and the FÃ¼hrer President...

82
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,830
We were able to fish out something larger than expected.

83
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,860
I also have a feeling it's a bit too large...

84
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,670
It wouldn't be worthwhile otherwise.

85
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,450
Well, I have a lot of work for all of you.

86
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,500
Oh yeah, about that.

87
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,920
I won't be able to participate.

88
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,390
I can't... feel my legs.

89
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,090
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,600
Looks like an early retirement for me.

91
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:27,740
Yo.

92
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,790
Hey. Are you not feeling well?

93
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,200
Backache.

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,280
Coroners are always standing,
so it's a tough job for old guys like me.

95
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,200
I knew right away when I heard you were the one who killed her.

96
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,210
What are you up to?

97
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,870
So you declared that thing was Second Lieutenant Ross when you knew I was up to something?

98
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,050
War buddies are wonderful to have.

99
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,930
We're not war buddies; more like accomplices in crime.

100
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,320
You burned them up; I dissected them.

101
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,450
Ishbal was a giant experimental site.

102
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,670
If you keep taking risks like that, you'll get tit for tat.

103
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,020
Already done.

104
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,470
Did something happen?

105
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,430
My comrade...

106
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,800
...is paralyzed from the waist down due to a spinal injury.

107
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,930
And I just got permission to have one smoke a day, too...

108
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,850
Geez, isn't that just hilarious?
Getting stabbed by a woman and having to retire.

109
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,940
What are you going to do after you retire?

110
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,260
My family runs a general store.

111
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,860
I can at least help out by answering the phone.

112
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,620
Can't you get an automail?

113
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,470
They said it's not possible since the neural network for the entire lower half of my body is disconnected.

114
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,790
Retirement doesn't suit you one bit.

115
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,940
Colonel.

116
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,050
About Havoc's legs...

117
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,760
...here's some information I got from the Fullmetal boss.

118
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,190
Dr. Marcoh.

119
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,980
An alchemist well-versed in medicine.

120
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,700
The Philosopher's Stone?!

121
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,360
Would it be possible to have my vacation extended?

122
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,990
I permit it.

123
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,170
Go.

124
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,580
Ah, Major!

125
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,200
Are you back from your vacation, sir?

126
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,500
How was your trip to the east?

127
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,000
You can't tell anyone.

128
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,270
It was a nice place with lots of beauties.

129
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,490
I see...

130
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,110
Oh, right, Major.

131
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,260
This is from military police headquarters.

132
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,700
They want all the State Alchemists to know first.

133
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,810
This is...

134
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,710
How was it?

135
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,530
They let me in without objection when I told them I was a State Alchemist.

136
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,810
What about the entrance to the basement?

137
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,180
Wasn't there.

138
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,200
But there were traces of it being covered up with alchemy.

139
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,680
They're not so stupid as to leaving the entrance wide open.

140
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,230
I see.

141
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,260
I guess it's not possible for us to go
and meet the Homunculi from here.

142
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,020
They said something about not wanting me killed because I'm an important sacrifice.

143
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,470
They said that to me, too.

144
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,750
That I could become a sacrifice because I'd opened the gate.

145
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,430
My guess is that these sacrifices...

146
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,480
...are alchemists who are capable of opening the gate and returning.

147
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,170
What are they planning on doing by making us sacrifices?

148
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,490
I'll beat it out of them!

149
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,980
Edward!

150
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,280
Huh? Sergeant Brosh?

151
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,720
Good thing I found you!

152
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,260
Hey, what happened?

153
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,950
You ought to go back to the hotel immediately!

154
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,360
If you wish, I'll call for escorts!

155
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,800
A notification to the entire city from military police headquarters.

156
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,720
It seems Scar has appeared in Central once again.

157
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,640
Three casualties, all of whom are State Alchemists.

158
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,470
Several others wounded.

159
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,710
According to witnesses, he has a large cross-shaped scar on his forehead.

160
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,940
An Ishbalan with tattoos all over his right arm.

161
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,600
Tattoos... on his right arm!

162
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,370
Scar killed the Rockbells?!

163
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,800
It's not certain yet.

164
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,910
No way...

165
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,630
Brother, you can't tell Winry about this.

166
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,880
Like I could even if I wanted to.

167
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,170
I don't ever want to see her cry again.

168
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,320
Me neither.

169
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,510
I guess we'll have to face Scar again.

170
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,580
You're going to try to find out the truth?

171
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,440
That, too, but I have something else in mind.

172
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,060
We'll use him to lure out the Homunculi.

173
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,090
Huh?

174
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,050
They want to keep me alive.

175
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,960
So if I'm attacked by Scar and in danger...

176
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,870
They'll show themselves?

177
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,080
I don't think that's very likely...

178
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,450
But it's better than sitting around and doing nothing.

179
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,480
But we were defeated by him in an instant last time!

180
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,250
I'm sure we've... gotten a bit stronger-

181
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,200
And even if the Homunculi do show themselves, how do we catch them?!

182
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,590
Not only are they strong,
but they're pretty much invincible!

183
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,570
Invincible?!

184
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,030
Which means...

185
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,850
Immortality, correct?!

186
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,100
From the window again...

187
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,020
We'll lend you a hand with that mission.

188
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,500
What?

189
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,820
We're not interested in all the military troubles,

190
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,400
but if it's about Homunculi or immortality, we can talk.

191
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,200
Huh? Are you doubting us?

192
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,690
We're grateful you rescued Second Lieutenant Ross, but-

193
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,830
The more people by your side, the better, right?

194
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,370
We're serious, too.

195
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,130
The fate of an entire clan rests on me.

196
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,890
Fine.

197
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,600
You'd better not run off with the Homunculi.

198
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,140
We'll keep our promise! We owe you for a meal, after all.

199
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,360
A meal?

200
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,780
Room service?

201
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,490
This place has great food!

202
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,030
"A meal" my ass!

203
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,950
Shut up!!!

204
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,080
I need to get up early tomorrow,
but I can't sleep with all this noise!

205
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,250
Oh, that's right. So you're going back to Rush Valley tomo-

206
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,930
Wait, cancel the trip and stay in Central for a little longer.

207
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,670
What?

208
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,480
Well, you know. How should I put this?

209
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,680
My arm may break again, or more accurately... it's definitely going to break again...

210
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,490
You're planning to break it now?!

211
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,970
Oh no! Brother's soul!

212
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,190
Geez...

213
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,110
Don't do anything too dangerous, okay?

214
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,930
Doctor! Doctor!

215
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,290
Are you not in?

216
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,490
Dammit!

217
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,120
I see... Nice try, nonetheless.

218
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,260
A deadlock, huh...

219
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,320
Well, if you'll excuse me.

220
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,380
Who were they?

221
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,260
My mother and someone from the Department of Veteran Affairs.

222
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,480
I've completed the retirement procedures.

223
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,650
It hasn't been determined if you'll be able to recover, yet...

224
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,380
I'm not so stupid as to not understand I'm useless now.

225
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,170
But...

226
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,760
You don't need a chess piece that can't move, right?

227
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,270
You have no idea how pathetic of a look you have right now...

228
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,730
Leave me behind! Throw me away!

229
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,380
Do you have time to be worrying about an underling like me?!

230
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,250
Don't you have a promise to keep with Brigadier General Hughes?!

231
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,070
I don't need your sympathy!

232
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,070
Second Lieutenant Havoc!

233
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,910
Let me give it up.

234
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,930
I'm begging you...

235
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,410
All right.

236
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,360
I'll leave you behind.

237
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,140
I'll leave you behind, so you'd better catch up to me.

238
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,870
I'm going on ahead.

239
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,740
I'll be waiting for you at the top.

240
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,240
He didn't even abandon me;
someone who tried to accept death.

241
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,290
He told me he'd rely on me to watch his back.

242
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,190
He can't throw his men away.

243
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,080
He's an idiot...

244
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,090
There's no way he can reach the top of this country with a soft attitude like that...

245
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,970
I think it's better for everyone
if an idiot like that exists among us.

246
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,910
Bring my uniform.

247
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,490
You're in no condition to be discharged from the hospital...

248
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,980
Don't make me repeat myself.

249
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,800
Yes, sir.

250
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,320
Look at what you've done!

251
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,400
I-I'm sorry!

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,970
I guess we have to close down for today!

253
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,410
Looks like you guys are in trouble!

254
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,250
State Alchemist, Edward Elric, to the rescue!

255
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,730
That was amazing, kid!

256
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,260
Thank you so much! How much should I pay you?

257
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,470
Pay?

258
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,810
There's absolutely no need for that!

259
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,000
I broke a precious jar. Could I ask you to fix it?

260
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,650
No problem at all!

261
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,790
Edward Elric!

262
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:07,330
I'm Edward Elric, your city's State Alchemist!

263
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,150
This, too!

264
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,290
Please fix it!

265
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,790
The whole city is talking about me.

266
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,990
With that flashiness, it's no surprise.

267
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,680
I wouldn't have expected things like this from you, Fullmetal.

268
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,960
Colonel?!

269
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,130
You're well enough to leave the hospital already?

270
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,270
I guess.

271
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,000
I heard about Second Lieutenant Havoc.

272
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,610
If you ask Dr. Marcoh, he can probably...

273
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,230
Hold that thought.

274
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,520
We're in public.

275
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,360
Get in.

276
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,120
On second thought, get out...

277
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,770
Dr. Marcoh is missing?!

278
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,460
He was probably abducted by them.

279
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,430
By the way, Fullmetal.

280
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,880
You've heard about Scar, right?

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,130
Why are you doing things that will just catch his eye?

282
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,890
I want him to find me.

283
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,550
I need to fight him again.

284
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't be stupid!

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,730
Did you forget what happened to you in East City?!

286
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,110
Oh my! Afraid of Scar now, are we?

287
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,800
You were pretty much useless
last time, if I remember correctly!

288
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,700
Don't underestimate me! The weather's fine today!

289
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,860
On top of that, you're exhausted!

290
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,350
You really are useless, aren't you?!

291
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,250
Shut up!

292
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,500
Now look! He's here!

293
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,500
What's wrong? It's not even raining, but you look pretty drenched.

294
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,560
Hang on, Lieutenant!

295
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,630
Don't shoot.

296
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,800
What are you saying?!

297
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,890
I just thought I'd try fishing like the Colonel likes to.

298
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,240
We're going to drag out the Homunculi, using Brother as bait!

299
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,440
Since Brother is an important sacrifice and they want him alive!

300
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,050
This is reckless...

301
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,370
We don't want any more casualties!

302
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,870
So either me or Brother have to be the bait!

303
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,540
What if Scar gets shot to death by the
military police before the Homunculi come out?

304
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,170
You can take care of that, right, Colonel?

305
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,540
Ordering me about now, are we?

306
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,960
You've got some guts.

307
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,120
If you do capture the Homunculi, give me a crack at them!

308
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,930
Roger!

309
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,990
Sergeant Fuery's second home is nearby.

310
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:31,980
Let's go!

311
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,160
Roger.

312
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,980
It's begun.

313
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,530
You two! Please back away!

314
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,060
Don't shoot! You'll hit Brother!

315
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,490
Dammit... if Scar gets shot, it's all over!

316
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,570
Not being too close or too far is a pain!

317
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,710
When are you going to get here, Homunculus?!

318
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,710
The channel for the military police headquarters is...

319
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,360
Got it.

320
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,130
Nothing less to be expected from Fuery.

321
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,120
3rd District Military police unit reporting.

322
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,970
We are currently fighting Scar.

323
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,500
Requesting reinforcements immediately!

324
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,230
Y-You! What... are you doing?!

325
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,350
All right, the 17th district next.

326
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,600
This is getting kind of fun.

327
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,230
This is-

328
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,190
What the hell is going on?!

329
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,950
Scar is in the 17th district, too?!

330
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,640
Then what was with the 3rd district?!

331
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,480
Colonel Douglas! He's shown himself in 8th district, as well!

332
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,160
What?!

333
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,640
This is the Central military police headquarters, reporting to the 8th district.

334
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,250
Scar and a boy are engaged in combat!

335
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,210
The boy is a State Alchemist.

336
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,250
Do not shoot.

337
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,060
There are false reports all over the place!

338
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,760
A fourth Scar?! What the hell?!

339
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,060
This is the 3rd district! Everything is in order!

340
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,340
This is the 8th district! We've found Scar! Requesting reinforcements immediately!

341
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,210
Gluttony.

342
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,350
I can smell it. I can smell him!

343
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,360
The scent of that Ishbalan!

344
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,780
I sense something... Did you, Ran Fan?

345
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,620
Yes.

346
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,860
All right, let's go!

347
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,700
Which is he after?!

348
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,160
Human destruction or my automail?!

349
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,330
Brother!

350
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,170
I got lucky...

351
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,010
He canceled out the decomposition energy?!

352
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,600
So reckless...

353
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,140
Tattoos on his right arm!

354
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,260
Bastard...

355
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,910
So it was you!

356
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,940
I can smell it. I can smell him!

357
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,140
Hey, how's it going?

358
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,360
You have a strange interior.

359
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,870
How many people do you have inside you?

360
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,160
Who?

361
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,470
There's no point in trying to run.

362
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,830
I can sense your distinct aura from a mile away!

363
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,720
Enemy? Enemy?

364
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,010
Can I eat you?

365
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,130
As I thought!

366
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,840
A Homunculus!

367
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,340
Oh? You can sense us?

368
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,330
A troublesome ability.

369
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,480
I'll eliminate you!

370
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,480
Ran Fan!

371
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,980
Run!

372
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,970
Ran Fan!!!

373
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,450
The shriek of the hurt girl echoes throughout Central.

374
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,300
When the trampling force meets his past again,

375
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,670
memories of violence are awakened.

376
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,470
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

377
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,220
Episode 22, The Distant Backside.

378
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,390
"I want to protect her."

379
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,730
That was the thought in the boy's mind.
