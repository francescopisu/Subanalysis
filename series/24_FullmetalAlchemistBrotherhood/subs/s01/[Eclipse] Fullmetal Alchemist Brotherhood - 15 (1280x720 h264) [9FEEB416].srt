1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:15,110
You've got quite the nerve to pick a quarrel with me, Giolio Comanche, the Silver Alchemist.

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,070
However...

3
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,610
You're pretty good to get out of that with only a scratch.

4
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,950
Only a scratch?

5
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,270
Who the hell is that?

6
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,230
Master, you're back!

7
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,990
I'm asking who the hell is that?!

8
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,700
Nice to meet you! I'm May Chang!

9
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,990
When I was unconscious on the roadside, I was saved by Sir Yoki, your master.

10
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,250
My master?

11
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,630
You're feeling better now, right? Then get out of here.

12
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,950
What do you want?

13
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,680
Allow me to seal your wound.

14
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,700
What?! It healed?!

15
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,700
It's called Eastern Alchemy, from the nation of Xing.

16
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,500
Xing?

17
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,300
Yeah! According to her, she crossed
the great desert of the east all by herself.

18
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,800
How stupid can you get?

19
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,680
I didn't cross it by myself!

20
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,220
I had a companion with me!

21
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,070
Companion? Oh, you mean that little thing?

22
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,310
Yes! Her name is Shao May!

23
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,770
This is... Eastern Alchemy, is it not?

24
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,360
A technique comprised of understanding and utilizing the veins of the dragon, power that runs through the earth...

25
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,030
This tattoo is used to draw power from our Eastern Alchemy.

26
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,270
My older brother studied both
Eastern Alchemy and Western Alchemy.

27
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,730
This tattoo is the outcome of his research.

28
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,420
Oh my! Your brother must be a really talented individual!

29
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,240
I have no idea what you two are talking about,

30
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,240
but since your wounds are all healed up, we can go back to Central now, right?

31
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,810
If that's the case, I'll get ready right away!

32
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,430
Hey! We told you to get out of here!

33
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,510
We're not going on a trip, you know!

34
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm serious, too!

35
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,720
That immortal crap you were talking about earlier?

36
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,570
There's no way something like that could exist.

37
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,940
But it does! That's the reason why I-

38
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,500
Shut up! Brats like you should be on the playgr-

39
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,130
Immortality couldn't be achieved through Eastern Alchemy.

40
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,660
But maybe with its Western counterpart...

41
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,680
That's why I must meet that man I keep hearing stories about!

42
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,010
Blonde hair, golden eyes, wearing a red coat so elegantly...

43
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,940
A genius alchemist that saves people in a splendid manner...

44
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,320
Sir Edward Elric!

45
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,820
What should we do, Master?

46
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,600
I couldn't care less.

47
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,630
What's wrong, Black Hayate?

48
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,390
You don't want to be walking alone at this hour...

49
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,740
It's quite dangerous because...

50
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,730
...you could be attacked by me, Barry the Chopper!

51
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,910
What the hell was that for?!

52
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,870
Dammit! In that case...

53
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,790
...what do you think of this?!

54
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,970
W-Why aren't you shocked at all?

55
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,720
I know someone who's sort of like you.

56
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,930
Like me? Alphonse what's-his-name?

57
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,930
You know Alphonse?

58
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,940
So you're a friend of his, eh?

59
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,350
But I must say, lady...

60
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,490
...you're really strong!

61
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,200
The Philosopher's Stone.

62
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,180
I wouldn't have guessed
Research Laboratory 5 was involved in its refining.

63
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,370
There's a possibility the upper echelon of the military also has something to do with it.

64
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,710
And ones by the name of Lust and Envy...

65
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,130
Are they the ones who turned you into that?

66
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,820
No, this was done by the scientists.

67
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,890
They pulled my soul out of my body.

68
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,180
We might be able to find out who instructed
the experiments if we interrogate the scientists...

69
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,470
That can't be done.

70
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,360
None of them are left. They were also used as ingredients for the stone.

71
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,690
That way none of the information gets leaked. Two birds with one stone.

72
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,690
I wonder if this means they don't need to create any more stones?

73
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,370
Last question for you.

74
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:09,130
Are you the one who murdered the military officer about a month ago in a phone booth at Central?

75
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,880
I don't even know what you're talking about!

76
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,090
Was he cut up?

77
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,140
No...

78
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,090
I'll take your word for it.

79
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,350
Yo, Miss Winry!

80
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,270
How are you doing on this fine day?

81
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,190
Ed! Al!

82
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,990
What brings you here all of a sudden?

83
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,180
Geez...

84
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,420
Even Paninya has picked up a job and is working seriously...

85
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,920
Paninya?

86
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,580
Yup.

87
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,790
She stopped pickpocketing, and now she fixes roofs and does all sorts of high-altitude constructions.

88
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,190
Wow...

89
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,110
And what about you two?

90
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,680
Any progress at all?

91
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,520
Well, we're taking the long way, but...

92
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,940
We're slowly making our way... I guess.

93
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,070
Well, that's good to hear.

94
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,030
There! Temporary repairs complete.

95
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,400
Thanks, Winry!

96
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,040
I don't have enough parts right now to fix it up completely, so bear with that for now.

97
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,440
All right...

98
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,880
I'll go buy them right away, so could you go kill some time?

99
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,790
But what's there to do?

100
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,320
There are only automail shops here...

101
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,950
Al.

102
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,310
Brother...

103
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,980
What, did you find a cat or something?

104
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,240
Yeah.

105
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,750
I'm alive!

106
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,110
You guys saved my life! Thanks!

107
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,490
Oh, and thanks for the food!

108
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,940
Never said I'd pay for it.

109
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,990
Don't mind such a small thing!

110
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,990
Don't say small!

111
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,200
To be cared for in a foreign land... I'm so thankful.

112
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,750
"Foreign land"? Are you not from this country?

113
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,090
Yep! I came from Xing!

114
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,830
Xing...

115
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,860
That great nation to the east?

116
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,720
That's right! Crossing that desert felt like walking through hell...

117
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,080
But why did you take that route?

118
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,020
I wanted to see the Xerxes ruins.

119
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,020
Xerxes?

120
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,130
I heard there's nothing there.

121
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,870
Just a bit of research.

122
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,480
I came to this country for
Eastern Alchemy-related research, too.

123
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,780
Eastern Alchemy?

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,530
Oh right, you just call it alchemy in this country, don't you?

125
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,370
The alchemy in our country is a skill that is used predominantly for medical purposes.

126
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,040
Different customs, I guess.

127
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,800
It's mostly used for war in our country.

128
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:03,300
Skirmishes are still ongoing on the border with Aerugo to the south and Creta to the west.

129
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,060
And there's still the great nation of Drachma up north, too.

130
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,760
There is a non-aggression pact, but the only reason they don't bother to attack us is because Mt. Briggs is in the way.

131
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,570
Our relations aren't looking too good.

132
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,570
Such a scary country to be in...

133
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,320
This country's been so military-focused ever since King Bradley became the FÃ¼hrer President.

134
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,410
But I'm really curious.

135
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,140
About this Eastern Alchemy that's used for healing.

136
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,080
Me, too.

137
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,290
Oh, could you guys be alchemists?

138
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,270
Yeah.

139
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,810
I'm Edward Elric, a State Alchemist.

140
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,920
I'm his younger brother, Alphonse Elric.

141
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,090
Nice to meet you.

142
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,560
I'm Ling Yao!

143
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,810
The pleasure is mine.

144
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,600
Hey Ling, could you explain your Eastern Alchemy to us in detail?

145
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,780
Can't!

146
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,480
I'm not an alchemist.

147
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,890
What the hell did you come to research if you're not an alchemist?!

148
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,120
Just a little something.

149
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,240
You guys might know something about it...

150
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,910
The Philosopher's Stone.

151
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,370
I really want it...

152
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,980
Do you know anything about it?

153
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,800
Nope.

154
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,510
Can't say I do.

155
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,680
Seems like you do.

156
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,600
Care to tell me?

157
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,480
What do you plan to use it for?

158
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,470
To find the way to gain immortality.

159
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,470
Care to tell me?

160
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,770
Immortality? How stupid.

161
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,260
I'm totally serious.

162
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,650
Besides...

163
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,920
This doesn't seem like the right attitude to have...

164
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,460
...when asking for a favor!

165
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,040
Brother!

166
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,260
You're going to retaliate, too?!

167
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,510
H-Hey!

168
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,650
What are they, acrobats?

169
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,780
Martial arts from Xing, maybe?

170
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,770
This might be tough...

171
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,340
But still...

172
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,060
Yeah...

173
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,570
They're nothing...

174
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,820
...when compared to our Master!

175
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,910
What's that?

176
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,840
And there they go.

177
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,480
Old man, can I get some dessert?

178
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,830
Sure!

179
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,280
Shit!

180
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,830
Dammit...

181
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,800
All of a sudden demanding information on philosopher's stones and immortality...

182
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,080
...and then picking a fight with us...

183
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,800
What the hell are you guys up to?!

184
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,180
You, and that thin-eyed bastard!

185
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,510
I hit him?

186
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,100
Oww...

187
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,260
This guy went nuts right after I called Ling a thin-eyed bastard...

188
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,420
I get it...

189
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,710
Oh! Long time no see, Paninya!

190
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,340
What the heck are you doing?

191
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,200
Well, I guess I can kind of see the situation...

192
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,580
Oh, Paninya, can I ask you for a favor?

193
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,580
How strange... I can't seem to sense a flow of energy from that armored man...

194
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,880
What's going on...

195
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,090
You thought you'd stand a chance if you added allies?!

196
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,430
You fool!

197
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,060
What's wrong? What's wrong?

198
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,430
I can read your moves now!

199
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,770
If his subordinate is like this, then I guess that
thin-eyed bastard isn't that big of a deal himself!

200
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,530
Just as I thought... This guy gets
all worked up when his master is insulted.

201
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,740
And when that happens...

202
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,040
Your attacks become simple and easy to read!

203
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:49,090
Well then, I guess it's about time you revealed your face!

204
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,250
A woman?!

205
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,890
To have an internally mounted cannon...

206
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,440
I can't take this country lightly.

207
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,990
Well, I guess that wasn't bad for my first try.

208
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,630
Alchemy...

209
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,910
You did this without a transmutation circle?!

210
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,980
Well, then...

211
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,900
I wonder if Brother is doing okay?

212
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,680
I went a little overboard...

213
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,310
What should I do...

214
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,100
Master Ling is going to scold me...

215
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,320
Come on, missy.

216
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,240
What the hell are you using in a town?

217
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,860
If it hadn't been me, you would have killed someone!

218
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,150
Bastard... You broke your arm?!

219
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,380
I chased rabbits all the time when I was a kid.

220
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,600
Traps are my specialty.

221
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,290
Brother!

222
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,850
Yo, Al.

223
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,920
Good work, everyone!

224
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,380
You... coming out like that!

225
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,110
Man, you guys are really strong.

226
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,740
How about it? Become my underlings and let's rule a country?

227
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,020
Quit daydreaming!

228
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,040
How about you go back-

229
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,470
There they are!

230
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,470
You guys sure destroyed a lot of our city.

231
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,020
I hope you plan to pay for it.

232
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,020
Don't forget to pay for all that food, too.

233
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,090
H-Hang on a sec!

234
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,860
All the repair and the meal costs should be for these guys...

235
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,280
I no really understand this country language!

236
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,620
Bye-bye!

237
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,250
Get back here!!!

238
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,950
Huh?

239
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,910
They got away!

240
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,200
That one, too?!

241
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,320
What should we do...

242
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,660
I'd like to fix it all, but I'm kind of...

243
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,460
It's all right, Brother... I'll do it.

244
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,040
Huh? You can do it without a transmutation circle now?

245
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,390
Yeah. I think it's because my memories of the truth returned to me.

246
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Which means...

247
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,430
Just leave the rest to me.

248
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,770
What's wrong, Brother?

249
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,910
We're back!

250
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,910
Hey, we meet again!

251
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,110
What are you sitting there drinking tea for?!

252
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,960
That's horrible! I thought we were friends...

253
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,150
Who are you calling a friend?

254
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,970
Do you know what we went through because of your two subordinates?!

255
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,630
I'll scold them later, so forgive us, yeah?

256
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,490
The girl is Ran Fan,

257
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,410
and the old man is Fu.

258
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,850
They're from a clan that's served my family for generations.

259
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,600
Don't be too angry at them.

260
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,740
You leech off of me for food and you have
two companions with you? You seem like a rich guy.

261
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,410
Well, I'm a prince, after all.

262
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,860
Huh?

263
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,360
Prince?

264
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,800
You?

265
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,160
A prince?!

266
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,360
Isn't this the part where you're supposed to be astonished?

267
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,150
Sorry, it was just too unexpected...

268
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,300
A guy who passes out from hunger and then leeches off of people for food... a prince?!

269
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,240
I won't allow you to speak ill of Master Ling...

270
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,470
You were here all along?

271
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,720
Well, I guess "prince" doesn't really mean much.

272
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,480
Since there are so many of us princes.

273
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,980
Xing is a nation made up of more than fifty different clans,

274
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,070
and the emperor reigns at the top of that.

275
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:44,160
And a daughter of the chief of each clan marries the emperor and bears a child.

276
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,850
The current emperor has
twenty-four sons and nineteen daughters.

277
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,580
And I'm twelfth in line for succession.

278
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,400
Forty-three kids?

279
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,950
Aren't there ever disputes over who becomes heir?

280
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,970
We're right in the middle of that.

281
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,800
The Emperor is in very poor health right now...

282
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,360
Each clan is getting worked up to curry favor with him, since this is the best time to do so...

283
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,100
Which is why I'm also...

284
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,890
Going to offer up immortality to gain his favor...

285
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,980
Correct!

286
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,570
So please, won't you tell me?

287
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,110
Information about the Philosopher's Stone.

288
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,760
Nope!

289
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,280
Philosopher's stones aren't tools to be used for promotion!

290
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,410
If you won't tell me, I'll follow you forever!

291
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,800
Don't!!!

292
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,990
I'm back!

293
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,840
There seemed to be a huge commotion on the main street, so I got kinda held up-

294
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,250
Why is it torn off?!

295
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,590
Seriously!

296
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,670
Every! Single! Time!!!

297
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,110
Young master!

298
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,370
You don't need to bow down to those lowlifes...

299
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,400
If one bow from me would do the job,
that'd be really cheap.

300
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,980
The fate of 500,000 people in the Yao clan is in my hands.

301
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,970
My image is the least of my concerns.

302
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,990
So, where are you planning on going next to break your automail?

303
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,080
Why do you assume I'm going to break it?

304
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,980
We're thinking of going to Central to look something up.

305
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,120
Huh? You're going to Central?!

306
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,210
I want to go, too!

307
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,630
What for?

308
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,500
To give my regards to Mr. Hughes!

309
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,380
But don't you have work to do, Winry?

310
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,180
Not a problem at all, Winry.

311
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,010
You need to take a breather every now and then.

312
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,890
Really?! Thank you so much, Mr. Garfield!

313
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,810
Well then, I guess...

314
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,390
We're all headed for Central!

315
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,160
Yep!

316
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,440
It'll be quite a trip! I'm so excited!

317
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,940
You're not coming!!!

318
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,620
She came along anyway, didn't she?

319
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,750
Oh yeah, I still don't know your name, Master.

320
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,040
Won't you tell me already?

321
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,920
Ishbalans consider their names gifts from God and speak of them with honor.

322
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,180
My my... You must have a grand name...

323
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,430
Therefore, I got rid of my name.

324
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,180
Go! Keep moving!

325
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
Y-Yes sir!

326
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,690
If I'm on a path of no return...

327
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,100
...I'll get rid of everything I've ever received from God.

328
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:06,420
A sad truth greets Ed, Al, and Winry, who returned to Central with the hopes of a warm reunion.

329
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,970
And the darkness chooses another, new sacrifice.

330
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,220
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

331
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,720
Episode 16, A Comrade in Arms' Footsteps.

332
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,950
Is it light or darkness...

333
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,650
...within the heart of the man who began to move forward?
