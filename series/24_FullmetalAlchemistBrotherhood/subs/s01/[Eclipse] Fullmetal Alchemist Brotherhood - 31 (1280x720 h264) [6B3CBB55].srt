1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,030
Vengeance...

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,770
Dammit!

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,000
It was Scar!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,990
He knew that Marcoh was involved in the extermination?!

5
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,580
I'll let you know when I get more information.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,460
Isn't being an assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President the same thing as being taken hostage?

7
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,880
You sure you'll be okay?

8
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,840
To look at it in a positive light, it means I have the chance to assassinate him in his sleep.

9
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,740
That's scary.

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,270
Oh, right.

11
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,350
Do me a favor and let the Colonel know that Scar is still lurking around.

12
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,360
Got it.

13
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,290
Lieutenant.

14
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,030
Yes?

15
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,370
Thanks for telling me about Ishbal.

16
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,710
Al!

17
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,410
Brother! What's up?

18
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,730
Wow... So that's how things were in Ishbal...

19
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,060
She was willing to tell me everything, despite me being a kid.

20
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,080
Alchemists are people who pursue the truth...

21
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,270
...and yet...

22
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,500
...we didn't even know about things so close to us.

23
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,230
So the Colonel is looking at the future that'll take place after he accomplishes his goal.

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,610
The future that'll take place after he accomplishes his goal, huh...

25
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,620
Al, what do you plan to do after you get your body back?

26
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,060
Let's see...

27
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,920
For starters, I want to taste Winry's apple pie.

28
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,590
What about you, Brother?

29
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,010
I haven't really thought about it, since I've always been so intent on getting my limbs back.

30
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,860
I guess I'll start off by going around to Granny and Master and letting them know first.

31
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,650
Yeah, they've really done a lot for us.

32
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,620
They'll all greet us with smiles, right?

33
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,660
Yeah.

34
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,470
We'll be able to see their smiles, right?

35
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,490
Yeah.

36
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,750
We're in a tight spot, but that sort of cheered me up.

37
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,620
I've got something good to tell you, too.

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,740
We couldn't use alchemy at that time.

39
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,470
And it turns out others couldn't, either.

40
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,010
Then what about that girl and Scar...

41
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,020
That's right. They were the only ones who could.

42
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,520
There's something different about their alchemy...

43
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,520
Something we're not aware of...

44
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,830
Yeah.

45
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,280
We're not at a dead end yet.

46
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,780
Left?!

47
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,910
That midget left?!

48
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,580
Yeah. Early this morning.

49
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,690
Did she say where she was headed?!

50
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,870
Nope.

51
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,910
We've got to look for her!

52
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,990
All of Central? Without a single lead?

53
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,580
We do have a lead.

54
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,900
What's this?

55
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,200
A gift.

56
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,380
In that case...

57
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,880
...couldn't you have brought me magazines with a lot of cute girls in 'em?

58
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,640
Don't be slacking off while we're gone, all right?

59
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,650
You're heading off already?

60
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,860
Yeah.

61
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,530
I'm off to taste some western specialty dishes.

62
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,410
You'd better take care of this place while we're gone!

63
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,990
I will.

64
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,950
Later.

65
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,500
Make sure you eat a lot and grow bigger and stronger.

66
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,220
Protect everyone while I'm away.

67
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,680
Sergeant Fuery.

68
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,530
Hey.

69
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,450
Warrant Officer Falman!

70
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,170
You still haven't left yet?

71
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,970
I came to return something to the Colonel.

72
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,470
It sure was a short stay in Central...

73
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,120
Were you transferred to Southern Headquarters, Sergeant?

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,520
Yes, sir. Opposite from you.

75
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,550
I bet it's cold over in Northern Headquarters...

76
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,040
Well then, so long, Sergeant Fuery.

77
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,280
Farewell. May we meet again.

78
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,730
Sorry to bother you, Colonel.

79
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,720
Lieutenant.

80
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,170
I came to pick up something I left here.

81
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,570
I see.

82
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,150
Apparently, Scar is still lurking about.

83
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,950
Then I have to be extra careful.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,330
Since I no longer have a skilled bodyguard.

85
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,280
Please don't die.

86
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,010
Of course.

87
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,330
Sorry to put you through so much trouble.

88
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,000
Perhaps I chose the wrong person to follow.

89
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,970
"If I ever stray away from my path, shoot me right away."

90
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,580
That was the deal.

91
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,570
Your actions are still within the permissible range.

92
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,630
You're too kind, Lieutenant.

93
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,760
So long, Colonel.

94
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,060
So long.

95
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,560
Please don't slack off, okay?

96
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,790
Sure...

97
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,450
My pawn...

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,950
I guess my hobbies got the best of me...

99
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,370
My bishop...

100
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,040
Yes, sir! It is an honor!

101
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,250
My rook...

102
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,630
Thanks.

103
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,170
My knight...

104
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,860
I'm stupid, so I had a rough time at the military academy.

105
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,640
And...

106
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,970
If you wish, I'll follow you to the depths of Hell.

107
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,390
...even my queen was taken from me.

108
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,360
But, it's too early...

109
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,070
...for checkmate.

110
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,800
Like this! This is what the cat looks like.

111
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,300
I'm looking for a little girl carrying this thing around.

112
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,210
Sorry, please ignore that alien he's holding up.

113
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,580
No one knows anything about that black and white cat...

114
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,250
I wonder if she left Central already?

115
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,470
Fullmetal.

116
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,380
Colonel!

117
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,560
I see. Eastern Alchemy from Xing, huh?

118
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,230
Got it.

119
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,570
I'll ask around about it, too.

120
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,290
To be honest, I didn't really want to ask you for any favors...

121
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,580
Oh, yeah. Speaking of being in debt...

122
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,070
...give me my money back.

123
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,980
Watch where you're going!

124
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,710
So you remembered...

125
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,380
How much do I owe you again? 500 cenz?

126
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,330
520 Cenz!

127
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,420
Don't try to play it off!

128
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,310
What the hell! You're so stingy!

129
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,300
At this rate, you'll never make it big!

130
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,510
Sorry...

131
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,820
Actually, I'm going to hold on to this.

132
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,190
I'll return it when you become the FÃ¼hrer President.

133
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,980
Who told you?

134
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,420
Lieutenant Hawkeye.

135
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,320
She told me about Ishbal, too.

136
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,010
Fullmetal.

137
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,710
You can keep the change for now,

138
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,750
but I'll be getting it back for sure.

139
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,510
When that time comes, I'll borrow money from you again.

140
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,930
With the promise "I'll give this back to you when you turn this country into a democracy".

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,330
And when you get that back, I'll borrow from you again and make you agree to something else.

142
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,900
Which means I have a long life ahead of me, huh?

143
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,210
That's right.

144
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,800
Quit worrying the Lieutenant!

145
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,520
Thanks for the ride!

146
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,410
Later.

147
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,210
You sure took a while.

148
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,250
I thought I'd be waiting here until I went bald.

149
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,630
Yo.

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,230
Oh, my! Roy!

151
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,650
It's been so long!

152
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,210
You look well, Vanessa.

153
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,740
Long time no see, Roy.

154
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,300
Good evening, Madam Christmas.

155
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,690
How have you been?

156
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,080
Not very well at all.

157
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,840
I came here to liven up.

158
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,860
What can I start you out with?

159
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,780
I'm actually recovering right now, so alcohol is a no-no.

160
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,680
I'll be asking for the specialty, Madam.

161
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,670
You got it.

162
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,730
Lieutenant General Grumman, you have a call from Central from a lady by the name of Madam Christmas.

163
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,760
Oh?

164
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,470
Seriously... Please don't tell civilians about our secret line.

165
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,430
It just means that I'm not completely useless.

166
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,020
Someone has a task for this old geezer.

167
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,490
You lost your arm, failed to protect the young master,
and are now reduced to such a state...

168
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,260
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

169
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,840
You still call yourself a chosen member of the Yao Clan?!

170
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,710
Have some honor!

171
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,680
Cut it out, old man!

172
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,840
She's injured!

173
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,970
I said stop!

174
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,820
Did you really lose it...

175
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,600
Did you really lose your arm...

176
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,650
I'm sorry, Grandfather.

177
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,360
I'm sorry...

178
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,870
Fool...

179
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,970
Fool...

180
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,420
As we promised, we'll set you up with an automail mechanic right away.

181
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,000
No.

182
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,980
Thank you for your consideration.

183
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,110
We shouldn't ask you to help us any further.

184
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,010
We'll somehow find an automail mechanic on our own.

185
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,220
But we can't just leave you like this!

186
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,890
Now that the enemy knows what Lan Fan looks like, we can't take any actions that may involve your friend in this.

187
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,310
Okay.

188
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,780
Thanks for the consideration.

189
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,080
You saved my granddaughter's life.

190
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,560
I thank you.

191
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,380
I ain't a doctor that should be receiving gratitude-

192
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,750
Dr. Nox, thank you so much.

193
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,930
G-Get the hell out of here!

194
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,760
I'm not kind enough to let you weirdos stay forever!

195
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,920
Seriously!

196
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,560
It seems the Emperor's condition is worsening by the day.

197
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,550
We must get the young master back and return to our country with the stone as soon as possible.

198
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,240
Let's go.

199
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,490
Yes, sir.

200
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,400
Just wait, you fiends.

201
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,780
We shall be back soon.

202
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,850
I'll never forget my gratitude to you for saving me.

203
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,700
Dr. Nox, thank you so much.

204
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,880
And now  I'm starting to act like a doctor after all this?

205
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,260
One sec.

206
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,300
Who is it?

207
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,630
Oh.

208
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,720
Hey, Dad.

209
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,170
It's been so long.

210
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,640
Are you doing okay?

211
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,900
Of course.

212
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,690
We had some business around here, so...

213
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
You've gotten taller.

214
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,870
Don't you think you've lost some weight?

215
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,460
You're one to talk.

216
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,210
Is your work keeping you busy?

217
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,640
Yeah, I've been performing on corpses as always-

218
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,390
Well, wait.

219
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,000
I treated two live patients this week.

220
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,440
Isn't that funny?

221
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,720
Me, saving people's lives?

222
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,960
Dad, I'm studying to become a doctor.

223
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,950
I know that you've been going through a rough time ever since you returned from Ishbal.

224
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,020
Yet, you didn't quit your job.

225
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,520
I love you, Dad! As the doctor you are and have always been.

226
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,400
Idiot...

227
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,000
Why don't you come in?

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,360
The coffee's not too tasty, but have a cup or two.

229
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,080
Wow, it's such a mess in here!

230
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,460
Come, let's get this place cleaned up while Dad makes us coffee.

231
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,380
God, if you really do exist, please overlook this.

232
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,330
Even someone like me can enjoy a cup of coffee with his family, right?

233
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,310
And with this, Ishbal has completely fallen under the control of the army.

234
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,270
Well done, Major Kimblee.

235
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,490
How do you like the philosopher's stone?

236
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,520
It's wonderful.

237
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,120
I was able to perform transmutations beyond my dreams while ignoring the concept of equivalent exchange.

238
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,730
Good.

239
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,450
Make a record of the details and submit it.

240
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,540
Now give us the stone back.

241
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,850
What have you done, Kimblee?!

242
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,140
Now, it's only you all who know where the stone is.

243
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,600
You bastard!

244
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:48,930
What the hell?!

245
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,710
What happened?!

246
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,450
What was that?!

247
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,880
Whoops.

248
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,210
Come out, Kimblee. You're being released.

249
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,690
What's this about?

250
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,930
You don't need to know.

251
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,350
Is it an order from the higher-ups?

252
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,990
Shut up.

253
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,450
Besides, why weren't you put on
death row after killing five officers?

254
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,230
What trick did you use?

255
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,420
Nothing in particular.

256
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,860
Maybe it's because of my natural virtues?

257
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,950
Don't make me laugh, you bomberman!

258
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,050
What the hell are the higher-ups thinking, releasing a freak like you?

259
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,540
Mr. Jailer, thanks for taking care of me for all this time.

260
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,800
Don't come back again.

261
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,600
Just a token of my gratitude.

262
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,040
Don't tell me...

263
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,540
Wait!

264
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,980
Stop! Please, take it off!

265
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,270
Kimblee!!!

266
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,790
It's a boring old toy.

267
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,310
Please give it to your kid or something.

268
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,460
Well then, farewell.

269
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,300
Now...

270
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,350
It's been a while, Kimblee.

271
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,540
Congratulations on your release.

272
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,060
So it was you all who let me out.

273
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,880
Yup.

274
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,600
We've run into a labor shortage.

275
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,270
Which means, you have a job for me?

276
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,420
Do you happen to remember Doctor Marcoh?

277
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,590
The scientist who helped create the philosopher's stone, right?

278
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,020
I remember him very clearly.

279
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,580
He may...

280
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,200
...have escaped.

281
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,260
"May have"?

282
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,830
It's still not clear yet.

283
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,250
One of the chimeras we placed as a watchdog was gone.

284
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,530
Marcoh is an alchemist especially skilled in organic transmutation.

285
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,180
The corpse may have been a substitute.

286
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,100
And to make matters worse,

287
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,650
there's a possibility he's on the run with Scar, an Ishbalan.

288
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,120
So, how does that sound to you...

289
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,230
...as someone who was ordered to annihilate Ishbal, the Crimson Alchemist?

290
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,190
Let's see...

291
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,490
If it's an Ishbalan that I forgot to kill, then it's hard to let this one pass.

292
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,090
You're allowed to kill Scar on sight.

293
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,660
But bring Marcoh back alive.

294
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,040
You released me from jail for something like that?

295
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,800
Once we capture Marcoh, we're going to wipe a town off the map just to show him who he's messing with.

296
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,090
Isn't that a pleasant job?

297
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,350
You're really a nasty person, aren't you?

298
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,470
I can finally use this, after all this time.

299
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,770
That may not be enough if we're
planning to destroy an entire town.

300
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,800
Wow...

301
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,370
Did you make this out of Ishbalans, too?

302
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,830
It's made out of the guys who were researching the stone under Doctor Marcoh.

303
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,090
You truly are nasty.

304
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,920
Why did you help me escape?

305
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,460
I...

306
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
There are still things I need to ask you.

307
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,720
About the alchemist named Kimblee, and...

308
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,230
...there were parts I couldn't understand in the research documents my brother left me.

309
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,020
Research documents?

310
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,460
"There's something strange about this country's alchemy" are the words he left me before he died.

311
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,530
Something about that should be written in the documents.

312
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,710
You're a skilled alchemist.

313
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,450
You'll be able to comprehend it, won't you?

314
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,790
Something strange about this country's alchemy?

315
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,000
Master. The little girl came back.

316
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,420
Mister Scar! You were okay!

317
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,050
Huh? We have another friend with us?

318
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,670
He's not a friend.

319
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,180
His name is Marcoh.

320
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,260
He's a man who created a philosopher's stone and assisted in the Ishbalan Extermination.

321
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,220
A philosopher's stone! For immortality?!

322
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,500
Mister Marcoh, do you know how to make the stone?!

323
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,370
How?! Please, tell me!

324
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,430
Well, that's...

325
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,650
Stop.

326
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,740
You shouldn't wish for such a thing.

327
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,550
I only destroyed the exterior of his face.

328
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,250
Please stop his bleeding.

329
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,470
Okay!

330
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,100
It's better to destroy his face so others won't be able to tell who he really is.

331
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,100
Are you okay, Mister Marcoh?

332
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's go.

333
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,980
Huh? To where?

334
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,460
To the place I hid the documents.

335
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,510
North.

336
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,360
The figure hidden all this time reveals himself with a smile.

337
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,470
With that, a new threat endangers the tangled web Central is.

338
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,180
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

339
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,560
Episode 32, The FÃ¼hrer President's Son.

340
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,230
Would it be better to not know?

341
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,300
Or perhaps...
