1
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,610
Scar appears in Central once again.

2
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,370
In order to lure out the Homunculi, Ed and Al work with Ling in order to purposely attract Scar's attention.

3
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,340
The plan works, and Gluttony and Wrath make their appearances.

4
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,140
However...

5
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,680
Ran Fan!!!

6
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,100
You deflected the slash with your kunai, eh?

7
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,990
Can I eat her?

8
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,390
Make it quick.

9
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,580
Ran Fan! Pull yourself together!

10
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,380
You think you can escape my eye?

11
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,220
Seems you're quite experienced.

12
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,630
He's constantly trying to bring his attack toward my left side, my blind side.

13
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,460
Gluttony!

14
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,610
Roger!

15
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,680
Now, no one can see us here.

16
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,830
I've got a lot to ask you.

17
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,720
Just what are you folks?

18
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,230
How can you tell what's inside Gluttony?

19
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,470
You're still trying to escape in this situation?

20
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,220
If you throw that extra baggage away,
I bet you'll be able to save your own tail.

21
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,220
Baggage, you say?

22
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,070
You're the highest ranking man in this country, right?

23
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,980
If I remember correctly, your name is FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley.

24
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,230
The king exists for his people.

25
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,490
Without his people, there is no king.

26
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,740
King Bradley, you'll never be able to become a true king!

27
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,510
You're far too inexperienced.

28
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,460
There is no such thing as a true king!

29
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,590
You rely on your eye too much!

30
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,760
From the draft, the exit should be...

31
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,430
What's wrong?

32
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,940
I still have this eye, you know!

33
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,740
Winry.

34
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,330
We'll be back soon.

35
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,120
So be good now, you hear?

36
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,100
Winry.

37
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,370
We're here.

38
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,840
Maybe I was thinking of Mr. Hughes as my dad...

39
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,510
Come see him every now and then, okay?

40
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,600
He always hated being alone.

41
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,330
Miss Gracia...

42
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,480
I heard the Elric Brothers are fighting!

43
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,050
What? Again?!

44
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,890
Military police are running all over the place!

45
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,520
What are they fighting over this  time?

46
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,770
Geez...

47
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,400
Apparently, they're fighting against that guy who only goes after State Alchemists.

48
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,410
They still haven't caught him yet?

49
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,350
What the heck is the army doing?

50
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,550
No... What am I thinking?

51
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,590
A dead end!

52
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,110
Dammit!

53
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,350
Nice, my little brother!

54
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,780
Shut up and run!

55
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,620
Have we been given permission to engage yet?!

56
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,280
Not yet, sir!

57
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,090
Dammit! What's going on?!

58
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,670
We haven't gotten the signal from Lin yet.

59
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,160
Brother is starting to get tired, too.

60
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,550
I should buy some time.

61
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,280
Scar! You use alchemy, too.

62
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,990
Why are you so against alchemists
with the mindset they oppose God?!

63
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,160
I told you in East City.

64
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,310
There are ones like you, who create, and ones like me, who destroy.

65
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,610
You...

66
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,110
You just want to justify murder by using God's name!

67
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,450
Didn't you kill Shou Tucker and Nina by acting as God's hand?!

68
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,630
I see. So you guys saw that chimera, too.

69
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,240
Techniques that give birth to such tragedy...

70
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,130
Is that the alchemy you fools so worship?!

71
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,590
You turned your brother into that form...

72
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,640
...with your own hands.

73
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,650
Techniques that bring about the creation of matter...

74
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,500
Isn't that the vanity which gave birth to that chimera?!

75
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,560
Even so...

76
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,570
Why did you have to kill her?!

77
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,070
Why did you take her life?!

78
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm sure you fools understood it, too.

79
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,950
That chimera would never have been able to return to her original state.

80
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,800
If I had let her be, she would have received
the same treatment as other experimental animals,

81
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,600
and she would never have been treated as a human again.

82
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:03,020
That's right. Back then, we knew in our hearts
there was a possibility Nina would be experimented upon.

83
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,020
We were just postponing a problem we didn't know how to solve.

84
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,520
We didn't do anything...

85
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,570
Nothing...

86
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,310
As you say, we, alchemists, have done wrong.

87
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,010
But still, we can't approve of what you're doing either!

88
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,350
Do you recognize...

89
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,310
...the name of an Amestrian doctor, Rockbell?

90
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:52,730
They went to Ishbal during the civil war and continued to treat Ishbalans even after orders were given to destroy the country.

91
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,780
Wait, Brother!

92
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,510
Do you remember the couple who saved you,
which you killed shortly after?!

93
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,450
Brother!

94
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,590
What do you mean?

95
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,300
Winry...

96
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,950
This man...

97
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,640
...killed Dad... and Mom?

98
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,220
No way...

99
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,980
They were killed... by one of their patients?

100
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,980
Why?

101
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,590
What did Dad and Mom do?

102
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,870
They didn't do anything to deserve to die... did they?

103
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,660
Give them back...

104
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,790
Give back Dad and Mom!!!

105
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,470
Wait, Winry.

106
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,660
Don't...

107
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,600
You can't do that!

108
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,150
Winry!

109
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,770
Please, stop!

110
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,890
I understand your resentment.

111
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,430
But all revenge does is give birth to more revenge.

112
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,030
You must persevere.

113
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,800
You're those doctors' daughter, huh?

114
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,810
You have every right to shoot me.

115
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,750
Brother!

116
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,480
Brother!

117
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,950
Brother! The army is already nearby!

118
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,310
Forget about your research and-

119
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,180
Hang on. I'm almost done.

120
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,670
What is that tattoo?

121
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,120
Oh, this?

122
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,630
The basics of alchemy are understanding, decomposing, and reconstructing.

123
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,880
My right arm is for decomposing,
and my left arm is for reconstructing.

124
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,150
I researched Eastern Alchemy and arranged it myself.

125
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,390
What I realized from that...

126
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,580
...is that this country's alchemy is a bit strange.

127
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,600
Who cares?!

128
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,180
More importantly, the army's-

129
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,830
Hey.

130
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,290
Why are you stopping me?!

131
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,070
We need to get out of here immediately!

132
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,710
Please, restrain yourself.

133
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,330
Your brother's research may save Ishbal.

134
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,030
What?

135
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,810
Did you hear about the State Alchemists?

136
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,260
They're using their horrifying powers as
weapons of war and are laying waste to Ishbal.

137
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,560
Even though we're citizens of Amestris, too...

138
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,570
I know that, but...

139
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,680
What does that have anything to do with my brother?

140
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,900
Your brother may discover a way to gain power enough to face those State Alchemists...

141
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,600
...and perhaps even enough to destroy their army!

142
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,010
With power that far surpasses theirs...

143
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,910
To retaliate against them with alchemy!

144
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,200
Make them pay for their sins with blood!

145
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,600
Look, Brother.

146
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,460
This is the alchemy that you've been devoting yourself to.

147
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,400
Even if you wish for your efforts to benefit the people and for happiness...

148
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,960
No one views it the same way!

149
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,380
So this is alchemy...

150
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,060
You think something like this will save Ishbal?

151
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,930
Something like this, which creates an endless cycle of destruction and slaughter?!

152
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,540
Oh no!

153
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,250
Father! Mother!

154
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,810
You were safe!

155
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,290
Yes, we're fine.

156
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,100
It's a good thing we were out getting ready to escape.

157
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,370
I made it in time!

158
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,360
I was compiling all my critical papers, so I was a bit late.

159
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,870
Critical papers?

160
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,250
You hold on to this.

161
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,400
What is this?

162
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,610
My research.

163
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,330
This was all I could bring.

164
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,910
Take it and run.

165
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,120
Hang on-

166
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,260
If something were to happen to me,
all my research would go to waste.

167
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,790
Why don't you hold on to it yourself and run?!

168
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,670
You're a powerful monk and have gone through rigorous training.

169
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,270
You have a better chance of surviving than I do.

170
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,440
Look.

171
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,410
My legs won't stop trembling.

172
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,570
I'm a pathetic older brother.

173
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,230
Brother...

174
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,360
A soldier?!

175
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,320
Transmutation circles?!

176
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,160
A State Alchemist!

177
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,380
Get down!

178
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,150
Hang in there...

179
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,450
Don't die!

180
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,190
D-Dammit... It won't stop bleeding...

181
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,380
His arm...

182
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,370
Where is his arm...

183
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,880
Dad...

184
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,350
Mom...

185
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,320
Everyone... Someone...

186
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,740
Live...

187
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,460
You can't die.

188
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,710
I'll show them the honor of an Ishbalan!

189
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,700
If you really feel that way, then run!

190
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,950
That's right! I didn't treat you to let you die!

191
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,190
You, too, Doctor! You have to flee with your wife...

192
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,400
You're a patient! Don't be worrying about us!

193
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,290
Brother...

194
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,920
Get down!

195
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,550
No way...

196
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,510
He... shielded me?

197
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,340
Brother...

198
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,600
If you have the strength to escape, do so!

199
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,720
He woke up!

200
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,150
Don't move! Your wounds will re-open!

201
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,650
Dear, come!

202
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,440
Dear!

203
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,490
You have to rest!

204
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,640
Someone! Get that cart!

205
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,270
Please, take him with you!

206
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,370
Brother, is that you?

207
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,120
Thank goodness... Brother was safe-

208
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,170
What the hell is this?!

209
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,810
Sedatives!

210
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,550
We're out! We used them up on that other boy!

211
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,020
State Alchemists...

212
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,650
Amestrians...

213
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,880
I won't forgive them...

214
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,660
You... You guys...

215
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,150
Dr. Rockbell!

216
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,860
Shoot me.

217
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,340
Don't shoot, Winry!

218
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,510
Put the gun down!

219
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,440
You shouldn't hold something like that!

220
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,240
Winry!

221
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,960
Shoot me.

222
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,670
But if you do, I'll take you for an enemy that very instant.

223
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Scar!!!

224
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,380
If you lay a finger on Winry, I'll-

225
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,650
Kill me?

226
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,090
That's fine, too.

227
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,090
The chain of hatred will not end unless one of us dies.

228
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,350
But don't forget this!

229
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,600
The ones who first pulled the trigger in that civil war were you...

230
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,970
...the Amestrians!

231
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,760
No! Don't shoot!

232
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,400
Put the gun down and leave this place!

233
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,070
Winry!

234
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,410
If you can't shoot, then get out of here.

235
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,020
You're in the way!

236
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,960
Don't shoot!

237
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,950
Get down!

238
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,370
Brother...

239
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,090
You stupid brother! What are you doing?!

240
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,110
Are you trying to get both of you killed?!

241
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,590
Hurry and get Winry to a safe place!

242
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,020
Winry, let go of the gun.

243
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,140
I couldn't shoot...

244
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,970
Please don't shoot. I'm begging you.

245
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,600
But... he killed Dad and Mom!

246
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,980
He tried to kill you and Al, too...

247
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,950
But why?!

248
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:50,260
You helped a woman give birth in
Rush Valley, and saved her and her baby.

249
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,750
You gave me an arm and leg so I could stand again.

250
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,680
Your hands aren't meant for killing people.

251
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,990
They're for helping them live.

252
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,060
So...

253
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,660
Must one throw something away to protect someone?

254
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,410
And those not prepared to do so will lose both and fall?

255
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:07,960
No.

256
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,760
The resolve to protect will spread to all and outshine the disaster.

257
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,180
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

258
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,560
Episode 23, The Girl on the Battlefield.

259
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,790
I won't show tears of sadness...

260
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,940
...because I promised not to.
