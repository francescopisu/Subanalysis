1
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,140
Resembool! We're in Resembool!

2
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,300
So what exactly are the Colonel's orders?

3
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,250
Can't you tell me already, Major?

4
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,760
I don't know many of the details, either.

5
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,270
I was simply told to bring you along to Resembool to meet up with the others.

6
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,090
Meet up with who?

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,220
Good day, Major Armstrong.

8
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,910
And...

9
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,470
Yo, Boss.

10
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,130
Second Lieutenant Breda?!

11
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,480
Brother should have arrived in Resembool a while ago...

12
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,640
...but he still hasn't called...

13
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,990
And besides, I'm here if he needs to have his arm repaired.

14
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,190
There's so much we don't know,
including Second Lieutenant Ross' case...

15
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,180
Which is why I'm here to explain.

16
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,960
S-Since when?!

17
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,790
Where did you even come in from?!

18
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,740
The window.

19
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,510
I'm technically a criminal, after all.

20
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,770
Well, you guys don't need to worry about Edward.

21
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,310
Right now, he's probably...

22
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,270
So hot...

23
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,990
That damn Colonel... he didn't mention a word about us having to leave the country...

24
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,200
Mr. Han, are we almost there?

25
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,000
We've been here for a while now.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,290
See? The Xerxes ruins.

27
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,850
Whew~

28
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,270
I almost burned myself with my automail...

29
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,840
Why is the brat with you?

30
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,520
For certain reasons.

31
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,260
Xerxes, huh...

32
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,890
I remember reading about it in
the tale about the Sage of the East.

33
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,670
Sage of the East?

34
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,690
Yeah.

35
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,780
A fairy tale about the alchemist who introduced alchemy to our country.

36
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,820
It's a legend about the sole survivor of the
Xerxes Kingdom, which was destroyed in one night,

37
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,380
and how he arrived in Amestris, just recently founded
at that time, and spread alchemy throughout the country.

38
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,040
In our country, there's a legend stating he arrived from the west.

39
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:11,930
Eastern alchemy as we know it today is a combination of the skills he brought us and Xing's technology.

40
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,560
Oh, the one developed as a method of healing?

41
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,810
That's right.

42
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,450
We refer to him with respect,

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,570
as the "Sage of the West".

44
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,270
And this is where that sage was from?

45
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,110
That's what's been told.

46
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,660
Wow...

47
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,330
I wanted to see the Xerxes ruins.

48
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,840
Now I see why...

49
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,880
But I wonder if it's truly possible for them to be destroyed in one night despite having advanced technology like this.

50
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,390
It could just be a legend.

51
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,720
What are you doing?

52
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,740
This way.

53
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,160
We're going in pretty deep, aren't we...

54
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,610
Edward!

55
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,430
Eastern Headquarters, where I used to be stationed, was great.

56
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,630
It lacks the bustle of large cities,
and most of all, there are so many beauties.

57
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,360
That stupid colonel!

58
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,740
Second Lieutenant Ross!!!

59
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,620
Now, for the embrace of reunion!!!

60
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,740
I'll pass!

61
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,640
Second Lieutenant Ross!

62
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,570
There's no telling when we'd get caught if a dead person was walking around the country, so we had her flee.

63
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,130
So the Colonel knew all along
Second Lieutenant Ross was innocent?

64
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,480
Don't you think you're being a bit too flashy?

65
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,310
You think so, too?

66
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,140
Yes.

67
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,900
Hauling her down to the police station in front of a crowd...

68
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,530
Murdering a colleague is an embarrassment to the military, and yet, to have it make headlines...

69
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,900
It's me.

70
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,810
A call from Warrant Officer Falman on a general line, sir.

71
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,530
Put it through.

72
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,010
Colonel! About the murder of Brigadier General Hughes...

73
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,640
Hey Falman! Let me talk to him for a bit.

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,540
Barry?!

75
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,880
Yo, Mr. Mustang! Did you see the paper?

76
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,380
I've got something interesting to tell you.

77
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,040
Hey, Barney! You shouldn't use this line for private use!

78
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,770
I'll call you back from outside my office, so hang tight!

79
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,600
What? Is that true?

80
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,180
Yeah, the bullet the lieutenant used was the one she shot me with.

81
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,440
I still have the hole in my right hand.

82
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,070
I think we can set something up...

83
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,480
Huh?

84
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,440
Barry, don't you miss going on rampages?

85
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,250
Roger. I won't kill.

86
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,450
The second passage to the warehouse district, right?

87
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,670
Breda, go find these ingredients right away.

88
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,820
Pork bones and meat, carbon, ammonia.

89
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,380
What's all this for?

90
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,650
I'm going to whip up a burnt corpse.

91
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,350
H-Human transmutation?!

92
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,390
Don't be stupid.

93
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,240
It's going to be something that resembles a burnt corpse.

94
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,850
But if the medical examiner looks closely...

95
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,100
I'm going to burn it up so badly they won't even be able to have it appraised.

96
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,820
But what will you do if they decide to check the treatment marks on her teeth?

97
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,990
It's all under control.

98
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,120
Will you be able to do it?

99
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,460
I'm no expert, but I do know enough to make it happen.

100
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,560
I'm also good at transmuting burnt corpses.

101
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,040
Hurry!

102
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,970
You're Maria Ross, right?

103
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,430
It's a dummy.

104
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,980
You're going to die here tonight.

105
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,360
Don't just sit there.

106
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,830
Oww...

107
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,060
Yo, Fullmetal.

108
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,690
What's the meaning of this, Colonel?!

109
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,770
Huh? Was that the fullmetal boss?

110
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,530
That's not good... this was unexpected.

111
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,320
Edward...

112
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,210
Well, the Colonel will take care of it.

113
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,200
Let's go.

114
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,890
Roger.

115
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,250
While Barry was helping Ms. Ross break out of jail,
he made a deal with the Young Master.

116
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,970
And the Young Master commanded me to escort her to the east.

117
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,840
And we promised him we'd meet here to set Second Lieutenant Ross free.

118
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,580
I see.

119
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,720
I still don't like it...

120
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,130
It means the bastard colonel pulled a fast one on us, right?

121
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,470
It's more convincing to actually have you see her than to explain it in words, right?

122
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,840
I know, I know.

123
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,620
The Colonel is totally right this time.

124
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,980
Speaking of the Colonel...

125
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:06,000
I also recall him saying, "Having a pissed-off brat around the place would just be a total nuisance to the mission!"

126
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,580
That damned colonel!!!

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,440
What is this mission you speak of?

128
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,500
Is there something else to do aside from rescuing Second Lieutenant Ross?

129
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,760
Yes.

130
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,050
We decided to fish out the mastermind hiding within the military.

131
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,590
Next time I see him...

132
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,340
Fish out?

133
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,350
Barry, who knows the secret behind
Research Laboratory 5, went out and made a mess.

134
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,570
They'll definitely come to shut him up for good.

135
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,240
So that's how it was.

136
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,750
So the only reason they took Ed was because he'd be a nuisance?

137
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,500
I guess you could say that.

138
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,610
And I lent them a hand in exchange for Barry telling me the secret to his body.

139
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,260
But it turns out...

140
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,890
The scientist who turned me into this is long dead, so I don't really know.

141
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,050
What?! That's not fair!

142
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,610
Oh yeah, that Alphonse guy is kind of in the same boat as me, so why don't you try asking him?

143
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,570
So I decided to come to you instead.

144
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,710
It's a promise, so I'm counting on you!

145
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,180
Umm... I really don't have anything to do with that promise...

146
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,430
I really have nothing to do with this, do I...

147
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,530
Philosopher's stones... Homunculus...

148
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,830
I wonder why I was dragged into all this.

149
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,840
Now we have quite a bit of information.

150
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,130
If we discover the truth behind the murder of the Brigadier General, the situation will change, too.

151
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,640
We'll definitely prove you were falsely accused.

152
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,300
Lieute- Brigadier General Hughes...

153
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,650
He's really gone, isn't he...

154
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,650
What do you plan to do now?

155
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,290
Move forward on the path you're content with.

156
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,750
We have someone who's willing to collaborate with us, even though we committed taboo...

157
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,980
We also have someone who'll scold and support us...

158
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,130
I have a younger brother who I made a promise with... to return to our bodies...

159
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,270
I also don't have anywhere to return...

160
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,540
With that said, I have no choice but to move forward...

161
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,900
In a way that won't cause a single death of anyone important to me.

162
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,900
If it seems someone is going to be victimized, I'll protect them.

163
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,580
It may be difficult.

164
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,830
It's hard enough keeping my own head, but protecting others, too...

165
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,840
It may be arrogant of me,

166
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,310
but this is the only thing I can think of,

167
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,790
so I'm going to move forward.

168
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,100
Second Lieutenant Ross, what do you plan to do now?

169
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,110
I plan to go to the country of Xing.

170
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,870
Should I at least let your parents know?

171
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,630
No.

172
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,580
If it happens that information about me being alive is leaked from my parents, it'd be irreparable.

173
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,850
I see.

174
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,390
Major Armstrong. Second Lieutenant Breda.

175
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,250
Hm?

176
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,550
Please pass a message to Colonel Mustang for me.

177
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,550
"I greatly appreciate you saving me."

178
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,100
Ask him to order me back in the case of emergency.

179
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,790
I will gladly risk my life to assist him if that ever happens!

180
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,290
I will.

181
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,160
Stay well, Edward.

182
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,660
I never got you back for that slap.

183
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,680
Maybe next time.

184
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,050
Yeah. Maybe next time.

185
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,550
You have good friends.

186
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,680
Mr. Fu, what is Xing like?

187
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,320
It's a pleasant country, with great food and nice people.

188
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,060
There's no need to worry.

189
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,070
So I can expect a paradise after crossing this desert, right?

190
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,010
You sure can.

191
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,240
However, crossing this desert is a cruel task in itself.

192
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,830
Careful.

193
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,420
You should conserve your fluids.

194
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,930
I'll drop by your store tomorrow.

195
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,260
What do you want as your gift, Elizabeth?

196
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,980
Pardon me, Roy.

197
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,390
Kate, we have customers.

198
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,710
Could you go get Jacquelyn?

199
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,240
Jacquelyn, we have customers.

200
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,090
Roger.

201
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,190
Whoa!

202
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,070
Barry!

203
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,730
Calm down, Falman.

204
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,830
You can't kill this one!

205
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,900
This smell of cigarettes...

206
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,090
Second Lieutenant Havoc?!

207
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,180
Hey! What do you think I'm disguised for?!

208
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,100
This is why I can't stand guys who aren't used to battles!

209
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,730
I-I'm sorry, sir!

210
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,520
You were only "dragged in".

211
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,290
So don't attack him.

212
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,240
Someone from the army could be watching us at any moment.

213
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,910
You...

214
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,670
We're heading outside!

215
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,230
But there may be enemies outside!

216
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,880
We don't have to worry about that.

217
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,480
Shit!

218
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,400
Second Lieutenant!

219
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,950
Don't worry, we have the hawkeye on our side.

220
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,500
I just heard a loud noise. Is something wrong?

221
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,750
Nothing at all.

222
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,090
The customer played a prank on Jacquelyn, so I hit him a little.

223
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,420
Oh my.

224
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,920
You're harsh, Elizabeth.

225
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,930
All right, don't move.

226
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,700
We have a lot to ask you... er...

227
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,810
Does he understand what we're saying?

228
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,350
You've gotta be kidding me...

229
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,450
This is...

230
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,810
That's my body!!!

231
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,820
What?! How could this be?!

232
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:37,020
They threw in some kind of experimental animal or a soul inside my body!

233
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,830
And now, he's here to get his soul back!

234
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,000
This brings back so many memories!

235
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
I haven't seen it since I had my soul pulled out of me!

236
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,030
A transmutation circle.

237
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,300
It's similar to the one I saw in Research Laboratory 5.

238
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,810
A two-headed dragon... A sun...

239
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,770
Agh, dammit! The top part's gone, so I can't tell anything!

240
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,720
Need something from me?

241
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,500
If it's money, I don't-

242
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,390
An Ishbalan?

243
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,130
Young lad, would you become a hostage in order for us to get our holy land back from the army?

244
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,380
There's no way the army would give in for one kid like me.

245
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,860
The civil war began with the death of a child, as well.

246
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,240
We don't know what could be
the beginning of a change in history.

247
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,660
Cut it out; this is disgraceful.

248
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,370
Lady Shan!

249
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,920
You idiots...

250
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,400
Are you trying to bring shame to the Ishbalan name?

251
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,950
Could you let that man go?
He won't try to harm you anymore.

252
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,880
Why did you save me?

253
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,330
Don't you all hate Amestrians?

254
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:18,340
I know that not all Amestrians are evil.

255
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:27,160
Both Lady Shan and I were saved by Amestrian doctors when we were badly injured during the civil war.

256
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:34,480
In all honesty, we despise your kind, but I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for that couple.

257
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,700
Couple?

258
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,820
Could you be talking about the Rockbells?!

259
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,230
You know Doctor Rockbell?

260
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,740
Y-Yeah...

261
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,760
The doctor saved so many of us Ishbalans.

262
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,750
I see...

263
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,170
So Uncle and Aunt Rockbell...

264
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,350
They stayed with us, despite the war getting worse and worse.

265
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,270
How were their last moments?

266
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,770
They were killed by an Ishbalan...

267
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,280
...an Ishbalan patient they saved.

268
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,030
No way...

269
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,240
We're so sorry...

270
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,820
We couldn't stop him.

271
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,920
Who was it?!

272
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,420
I couldn't see his face.

273
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,670
But he was an Ishbalan with a tattoo on his right arm.

274
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:55,540
When you get the chance, please convey our feelings to their gravestones.

275
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,010
Both our gratitude... and our apologies...

276
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,240
This is just grand!

277
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,720
This is like the once-in-a-lifetime chance for me to cut up my own body as much as I want!

278
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,240
You told me earlier not to kill him!

279
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,720
To hell with this mission!

280
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,230
My soul keeps shaking... It wants to cut him up!

281
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,570
You can't do that.

282
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,900
Besides, wouldn't the normal approach to this be wishing to go back inside your old body?

283
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,190
That body won't last much longer.

284
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,490
Oh, so it's rotten...

285
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,870
I can't stand it anymore!!!

286
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,240
I'm going to cut him up!

287
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,000
I get to decide what to do with my own body!

288
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,570
I said, no!

289
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,730
What's wrong?

290
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,070
I wonder if it's a fight?

291
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,710
Seems like there's some trouble between her and the customer.

292
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,750
Oops, I'm going to have to call you back.

293
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,470
I've got a customer, too.

294
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,970
She's a strong, proud woman.

295
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,630
A beautiful woman, loved by her comrades.

296
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:10,880
But her weapon which shoots down enemies has lost its power, and her flame of life fleetingly went out.

297
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,890
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

298
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,650
Episode 19, Death of the Undying.

299
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,190
She becomes anguished.
Her memories bring about her suffering.
