1
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,990
So in the end, you became a soldier.

2
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,370
As I thought, it's far too early to teach you the art of flame alchemy.

3
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,570
Still, sir?

4
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,750
You've only taught me the basics of alchemy so far.

5
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,870
Of course.

6
00:01:52,870 --> 00:02:00,540
Someone who would sink to becoming a dog of the military is unworthy of being taught even the basics of alchemy.

7
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,560
Alchemy should be used for the benefit of the masses. Isn't that correct?

8
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,300
Master, we're currently under threat from neighboring countries. We're in an urgent need to strengthen our forces.

9
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,160
Alchemy is essential for protecting the people-

10
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,110
I'm tired of hearing that same excuse.

11
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,120
I just can't sit here and watch this.

12
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,910
Someone as talented as you suffering crushing poverty.

13
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,170
Please become a State Alchemist.

14
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,410
If you do, you'll be able to conduct other experiments-

15
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,420
I've already completed my experiments long in the past.

16
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,640
What did you...

17
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,410
The most powerful alchemy.

18
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,820
Though depending on how it's used, it could be the most deadly.

19
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,520
I perfected it...

20
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,650
...and became satisfied.

21
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,430
Alchemists are creatures who must continually strive toward the truth as long as they are alive.

22
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,200
They die as soon as they stop the process of thinking.

23
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,270
I had already died long in the past-

24
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Master!

25
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,250
Master!

26
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,170
Master Hawkeye!

27
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,390
Take care... of my daughter...

28
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,180
Every detail of my experiment... is with her...

29
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,370
I'm sorry for having to rely on you for everything.

30
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,040
Don't worry about it.

31
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,790
It's my duty as a former student.

32
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,560
Don't hesitate to visit me at the military if anything happens.

33
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,800
Are you also going to judge me for becoming a soldier?

34
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,280
As everyone may say, there is a chance I'll end up dying like a piece of trash out on the street.

35
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,410
But even then, if it means I'll be able to protect this country, I don't mind at all.

36
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,770
Sorry if I'm boring you. It's a childish dream of mine.

37
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,970
No.

38
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,390
I think it's quite admirable.

39
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,650
A future where everyone will be able to live in happiness.

40
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,920
Can I trust you?

41
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,770
Can I entrust you with Father's dreams?

42
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,050
Hayate. No.

43
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,990
I'm sorry about that.

44
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,640
It's fine... It happens a lot.

45
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,850
I heard about it.

46
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,390
Assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President?

47
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,600
Yeah.

48
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,980
Looks like you had a rough time out there.

49
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,530
I didn't shoot anybody.

50
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,320
Didn't have to.

51
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,700
No... I couldn't bring myself to.

52
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,350
I'm worthless.

53
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,970
Because I'm not prepared, I end up troubling others.

54
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,970
Did something happen?

55
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,640
Scar was the one who killed Winry's parents.

56
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,290
I had a horrible feeling in my gut at that time.

57
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,660
In my mind, the gun suddenly turned into something horrifying.

58
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,690
And when I realized it...

59
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,620
I think she despised Scar enough to kill him.

60
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,770
I'd never seen her cry as much as she did after he left.

61
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,420
I'm so worthless.

62
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,500
I didn't understand her feelings at all.

63
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,910
You can only worry about something like that because you came back alive.

64
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,250
But you have to survive...

65
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,870
...for the sake of the people important to you.

66
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,520
You have to protect her, okay?

67
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,390
You love Winry, don't you?

68
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,530
N-No! I-I-

69
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,870
S-She's just a childhood friend of mine!

70
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,060
J-Just like family!

71
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,930
P-Protecting her is nothing out of the ordinary!

72
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,300
Umm...

73
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,400
Sorry.

74
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,240
Looks like this was a burden on you.

75
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,500
Have you ever thought of it as a burden?

76
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,330
I don't even have the right to complain about its weight anymore.

77
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,760
I've taken the lives of many people in the past,

78
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,020
and I'm also the one who chose this path.

79
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,930
Are you referring to Ishbal?

80
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,650
Do you mind if I ask you about it?

81
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,030
Let me hear it.

82
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,030
What did you wretches do in Ishbal?!

83
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,530
Ishbal was a rough place to live, full of rocks and sand.

84
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:28,720
So it's only fitting that a strict religion and
a tenacious race of people reside there.

85
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:36,050
But some people were unhappy
that they were annexed to Amestris.

86
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,480
And just then...

87
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:49,360
Because of one bullet, the unhappiness evolved into anger and spread throughout Ishbal.

88
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,470
The riot turned into a civil war and continued on for seven years.

89
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,790
Then, one document decided everything.

90
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,460
Executive Order No. 3066.

91
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,090
It began the Ishbal Extermination.

92
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,930
Just that one sheet of paper.

93
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,360
It was a living hell.

94
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,640
The air was choked with the stench of rotting corpses and gunpowder,

95
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,800
and the sand was soaked with blood.

96
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,840
An infantryman could fire at random, and if lucky, he might hit someone.

97
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,140
But sniping is different.

98
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,470
When you pull the trigger, someone dies for sure.

99
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,490
The two groups who were the most closely related in terms of that...

100
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,870
...would be snipers...

101
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,820
...and State Alchemists.

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,950
My name is Basque Gran, the Iron Blood Alchemist!

103
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,950
Iron and Blood.

104
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,370
In other words, Weapons and Soldiers.

105
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,540
Who else would be more fitting to stand at the forefront?

106
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,650
Damn you!

107
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,250
Ishbalan brats!

108
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,600
How... How dare you!

109
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,050
Roy!

110
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,770
Roy Mustang!

111
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,480
So you were here, too.

112
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,990
It's been a while.

113
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,310
But man,

114
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,680
your eyes look different.

115
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,310
Same with you.

116
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,630
We all have the eyes of murderers.

117
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,820
Yeah.

118
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,140
Didn't we all talk about the future of this country at the military academy?

119
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,080
Yeah.

120
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,830
A beautiful future.

121
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,380
Captain, a letter for you.

122
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,330
Thanks.

123
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,060
Whoa!

124
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,840
W-What?

125
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,960
My beautiful future!

126
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,020
Her name's Gracia!

127
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,900
She's waiting for my return in Central!

128
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,850
Alone...

129
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,270
What if other guys hit on her?!

130
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,190
No, there's no way Gracia would cheat on a handsome guy like me.

131
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,840
No, no, but still...

132
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,550
Hughes, let me warn you.

133
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,630
This happens a lot in both movies and novels.

134
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,780
The guy who talks about his lover on a battlefield...

135
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,890
...ends up dying right away.

136
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,170
Hey!

137
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,900
This is what keeps me alive.

138
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,480
This letter, and this letter only, lets me dream of tomorrow.

139
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,390
In this war that may never end.

140
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,010
You're right. There's no telling when this war will end.

141
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,650
No matter how many troops the country deploys, the desert just absorbs them like water.

142
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,970
We suffer, conquer, and what's left?

143
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,400
Nothing but sand.

144
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,980
Yeah. It's far too big of an operation for it to merely be suppression.

145
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,830
It's been a while, Major Mustang.

146
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,340
Do you remember me?

147
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,390
How terrible.

148
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,840
This woman...

149
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,560
...now also bears the eyes of murderers.

150
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,100
Please tell me, Major.

151
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,320
Soldiers are supposed to protect the people. Why are we killing them instead?

152
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,840
Alchemy is supposed to bring people happiness. Why is it being used for murder?

153
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,700
Because that's the State Alchemists' job.

154
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,450
Why are soldiers killing the people?

155
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,590
Because that's what we were ordered to do.

156
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,670
Am I wrong?

157
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,320
Are you telling us to look at this horrible scene rationally?!

158
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,760
Let's see... for example...

159
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,450
Girl, your face has the expression of "I'm doing this against my will".

160
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,520
Can you say for certain that there hasn't been a time...

161
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:27,270
...when you successfully sniped your enemy and felt good about your skill?

162
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,930
Miss Sniper.

163
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,150
That's enough!

164
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,960
From my point of view, it's you all who can't be understood.

165
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,830
A battlefield is a place for murder.

166
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,340
Did you put on that uniform
without being prepared to kill?

167
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,090
Don't look away from death. Look forward to it.

168
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,850
When you kill, face them directly.

169
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,350
And don't forget them.

170
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,190
Your enemies will never forget you either.

171
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,380
Oh, it's time.

172
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,640
I need to head off to work.

173
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,330
I have to go, too.

174
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,190
Later, Roy.

175
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,220
Hughes.

176
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,700
Why do you fight?

177
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,170
Easy.

178
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,420
I don't want to die. That's it.

179
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,210
Reasons are always simple.

180
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,310
Then what is the reason behind this war?!

181
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,810
There...

182
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,960
...was a reason. A horrible reason.

183
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,810
You created a philosopher's stone using our blood?!

184
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,850
What did you do with that stone?!

185
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,680
It went to the hands of Major Zolf J. Kimblee...

186
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,400
...the Crimson Alchemist...

187
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,330
The man with cold eyes...
who has his long black hair tied back?

188
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,400
Yeah.

189
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,980
Brother...

190
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,650
What else?!

191
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:45,290
Th-The war situation changed with just one intention.

192
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,550
Ah... Such beautiful sounds.

193
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,170
Such wondrous sounds ringing throughout my body...

194
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,680
My spinal cord dances with sadness. My eardrum shivers with joy.

195
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,190
This feeling can only be achieved here, where we lay so close to death.

196
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,070
What a wonderful career!

197
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,170
A beautiful sound!!!

198
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,050
Amazing! The philosopher's stone!

199
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,470
It was only a matter of time before the extermination was complete.

200
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:42,320
And then, the Ishbalan priest of highest rank, Roug Roa, stood before the FÃ¼hrer President to save his people.

201
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,480
Oh?

202
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,190
So you want me to trade the lives of the tens of thousands of Ishbalans in exchange for your life?

203
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,340
Correct. I'm-

204
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,490
Don't be conceited.

205
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,930
Are you trying to say that your life is worth just as much as the lives of the ones who are left?

206
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,870
Don't get ahead of yourself, human.

207
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,460
A person's life is worth as much as anyone else's.

208
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,130
No more, no less.

209
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,980
I won't accept the deal.

210
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,450
Nor will I call off the extermination.

211
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,090
You monster!

212
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,510
God will smite you!

213
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,470
"God"?

214
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,550
How strange.

215
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,770
After all this, I've yet to be smote.

216
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,520
How many more Ishbalans must I kill for that to happen?

217
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,220
You bastard...

218
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,530
God is only a figure created by humans;
that's all there is to it.

219
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:46,790
If you want to bring an iron hammer down on me,
do it yourself without having to rely on God, human!

220
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,550
And eventually, the war ended,

221
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,440
and we were allowed to go home.

222
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,180
In the end, we soldiers are nothing but trash.

223
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,590
Yeah.

224
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,730
One human only has the power to do so much.

225
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,510
That's why I'm going to protect...

226
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,040
...even if it's just a handful of them...

227
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,790
...the ones most important to me.

228
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,230
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth.

229
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,160
That should be possible, even for us puny humans.

230
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,600
So you decided to take this path,
even after what you experienced in Ishbal?

231
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,950
Yes.

232
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,490
If this world is based on the concept of
equivalent exchange, as stated in alchemy,

233
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:05,290
then we must carry corpses and cross the river of blood in exchange for the new generation to live in happiness.

234
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,610
I'm appointing you as my assistant.

235
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,670
I want you to protect my back.

236
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,130
Do you understand?

237
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,890
If I'm leaving you in charge of defending my back,
it means you can shoot me from behind at any time.

238
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,250
If I ever stray from my path,
shoot me right away with those hands.

239
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,930
You have that right.

240
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,100
Will you follow me?

241
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,810
Understood.

242
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,580
If you wish, I will follow you to the depths of Hell.

243
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,770
But even if the Colonel becomes the FÃ¼hrer, it wouldn't change the militaristic element of this country!

244
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,530
You're right.

245
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,750
Congress pretty much exists as the army's puppet right now.

246
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,340
Someone would need to change that and turn this country into a democracy.

247
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,630
For this country to be reborn, all the faults that existed from the militaristic regime will have to be brushed away.

248
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,590
Faults?

249
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:11,600
For example, the government may have to pass judgment on those who committed atrocities during the Ishbal Extermination.

250
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,410
That's right.

251
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,300
The heroes during the troubled times are nothing but mass murderers during times of peace.

252
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,180
So the Colonel is reaching for the top while knowing about all this?

253
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,600
He's only on a path of self-destruction!

254
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,870
The Homunculi are the ones who were pulling the strings.

255
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,370
Even if the Homunculi were the ones who triggered it,
we're the ones who committed the atrocities.

256
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,170
We mustn't turn away from death.

257
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,360
We mustn't forget the ones we killed.

258
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,260
Because...

259
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,180
...they'll never forget us, the ones who killed them.

260
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,470
But...

261
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,110
Don't you have something to do before you start worrying about us?

262
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,950
Both you and Alphonse need to return to your bodies.

263
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,730
I'm sure a lot of people are waiting for the day you reach your goal.

264
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,190
Yeah.

265
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,960
I'll definitely get my body back. Together with Al.

266
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,250
Thanks for letting us stay, Dr. Nox.

267
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,630
Umm... Mister Armor?

268
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,380
Really, thank you for everything.

269
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,020
I have a name, you know. It's Alphonse Elric.

270
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,520
Elric?

271
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,470
You remember Edward Elric, right?

272
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,350
That small alchemist.

273
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,310
I'm his younger brother.

274
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,710
I lost my body due to certain circumstances, though...

275
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,430
If you're that guy's younger brother...

276
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,480
...does this mean you look just like him?

277
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,240
How rude!

278
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,010
I'm much taller than him!

279
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,830
My face isn't that stern, and I'm much stronger than him!

280
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,600
But I'm not short-tempered, either.

281
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,830
I'm a gentleman!

282
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,710
Sir Alphonse!!

283
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,460
I hope you get your body back soon!

284
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,810
Yeah. I hope so, too.

285
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,480
Dr. Marcoh, I've brought your meal.

286
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,810
Huh? It's awfully quiet in here.

287
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,590
Could it be you're crying again, reminiscing about Ishbal?

288
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,900
The White Devil has been released into the wild.

289
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,040
The new fight begins now.

290
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,340
But the boy will not flinch.

291
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,200
He gets up and walks again, with hope as his landmark.

292
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,180
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

293
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,930
Episode 31, The Promise Made For 520 Cenz.

294
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,000
The world which can only be understood by the ones who fought together is right in front of us.
