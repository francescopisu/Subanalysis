1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,901
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,703
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,805
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,241
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,476
<i>Long ago...</i>

6
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,611
<i>The four natio lived
together in harmony.</i>

7
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:17,516
<i>Then everything change
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

8
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:21,720
<i>Only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stophem.</i>

9
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,571
<i>But when the world
needed him most</i>

10
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,524
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,294
<i>100 years passed, and myrother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

12
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,130
<i>an airbender named aang.</i>

13
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,565
<i>And although his airbending
skills were great</i>

14
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,702
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:41,006
<i>But I believe aang
can save the world.</i>

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,517
Blending in is better
than hiding out.

17
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:55,888
If we get fire nation disguises, we'll be
just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,756
You have no right
to judge me, uncle.

19
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:02,294
I did what I had to do in ba sing se,
and you wer a fool for not joining me.

20
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,367
I see you favor
the white lotus gambit.

21
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,803
Not many still cling
to the ancient ways.

22
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,740
Those who do can always
find a friend.

23
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,820
Wow, this is amazing to watch.

24
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,723
Kind of makes you realize
how insignificant we are.

25
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,793
Eh, u've seen nothing once,
you've seen it 1,000 times.

26
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:37,863
Oh, man.

27
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,974
You've never not seen
anything like this.

28
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:57,816
The fire is gonna
destroy that town.

29
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,218
Aangnot if we can stop it.

30
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,722
There's a creek over here.

31
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,624
I'll bend the water
on to the fire.

32
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,975
Toph, let's make a trench to keep
the fire from coming any closer.

33
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,380
What should I do?

34
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,166
Keep an eye on momo.

35
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,770
So what, I'm just
a ler-sitter?

36
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,921
There, there.

37
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,988
Feel better?

38
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:59,044
Sokka, stand clear.

39
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,146
Right, stand clear.

40
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,297
Got it.

41
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,958
Good work, everybody.

42
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:34,313
Look at you.

43
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,082
You're just a fat,
disgusting old man.

44
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,518
You do nothing, you say nothing.

45
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:43,222
You just eat and roll around
in your own filth like a pig.

46
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,656
You're a disgrace.

47
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:04,109
These people have no idea how close
they were to getting toasted last night.

48
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,560
Yeah, the worst thing
about being in disguise

49
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,081
is we don't get
the hero worship anymore.

50
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,783
I miss the love.

51
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,686
Boo-hoo, poor heroes.

52
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,287
What's your oblem?

53
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,656
You haven't even touched
your smoked sea slug.

54
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,592
It's just, all you guys can do
this awesome bending stuff

55
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:25,097
like putting out forest fires, and flying
around, and making other stuff fly around.

56
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,900
I can't fly around, ok?

57
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,302
I can't do anything.

58
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,104
That's not true.

59
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,239
No one can read a map ke you.

60
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,874
I can't read at all.

61
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,811
Yeah, and who keeps us laughing
with sarcastic comments all the time?

62
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,680
I mean,
lo at katara's hair, right?

63
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,848
What's up with that?

64
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,816
What?

65
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,250
What's wrong with my hair?

66
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,052
Nothing, I was just trying to...

67
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,089
Look, I appreciat
the effort, but the fact is

68
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,160
each of you is so amazing
and so special, and I'm not.

69
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,797
I'm just the guy
in the group who's regular.

70
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:06,638
I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I
hope yoknow none of us see you that way.

71
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,043
I know something that's gonna
make you feel better.

72
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,711
You do?

73
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,014
Shopping.

74
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,951
Maybe a little something
to rnvigorate my battling.

75
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,986
Hey, how about these?

76
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,222
Hi-ya!

77
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,757
"Smack-a-dacka-doo!"

78
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,195
What do you think?

79
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:34,299
Pretty slick, huh?

80
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,835
All I need to complete
the outfit is a wind sword.

81
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,137
What's a wind sword?

82
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,638
It's where I get a sword handle

83
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,975
and then I just swing this around
and bend air out like a blade.

84
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,414
Yeah, nice.

85
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,818
I'll jt ick to what I got.

86
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,411
Ooh.

87
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,047
That's what sokka's
talking about.

88
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,288
You have a good eye.

89
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,284
That's an original from piandao

90
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:28,420
the greate sword master and
sword mar in fire nation history.

91
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,290
He lives in the big castle
up the road from here.

92
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,292
That's it.

93
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,443
That's what you needed
all along, sokka.

94
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:36,195
A sword?

95
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,262
Not the sword.

96
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,131
A master.

97
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,367
We've all had masters
to help us get better.

98
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,302
You should see if you
can study with piandao.

99
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,803
That's a great idea.

100
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,673
I could've never gotten to where
I am without master pakku.

101
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,274
Everyone needs a teacher.

102
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,477
I learned from badger moles.

103
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,946
They don't talk,
but they're still od teachers.

104
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,116
It would be nice to be
a master swordfighter.

105
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,352
All right, I'll talk to him.

106
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,681
Can I help you?

107
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,532
I've come to train
with the master.

108
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,886
You should know the master
turns almost everyone away.

109
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,588
What did you bring him
to prove your worth?

110
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,792
Well, uh...

111
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:40,993
Right.

112
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,728
Let's get this over with.

113
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:58,377
Master, my name is sokka, and I wish to
be instructed in the way of the sword.

114
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,045
Sokka.

115
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,847
That's an unusual name.

116
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,349
Oh, uh, really?

117
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,784
Uh, where I come from,
the fire nation colonies

118
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,488
it's a pretty normal name,
for fire nation colonials.

119
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,256
Let me guess.

120
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,059
You've come hundreds of miles
from your little village

121
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,628
where you're the best
swordsman in town

122
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,065
and you think you deserve
to learn from the master.

123
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,534
Well, actually, I've been
all over the world.

124
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,937
Yep, here we go.

125
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,008
I have a lot to learn.

126
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:33,078
You're not doing a very good job
of selling yourself.

127
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,680
I know.

128
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,616
Your butler told me that when I
met you, I would have to prove worth

129
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,452
but the truth is,
I don't know if I am worthy.

130
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,255
Hm, I see.

131
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:48,761
Wellthen, let's find out
together how worthy you are.

132
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,664
I will train you.

133
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,402
Rself.

134
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,243
You must think of it as
another part of your own body.

135
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,813
Like a second head.

136
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:12,951
Well, more like
an extra-long, really sharp arm.

137
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,789
The sword is a simple tool,
but in the hands of a master

138
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,661
it becomes the most versatile of weapons,
and just as the imagination is limitless

139
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,764
so too are the possibilities
of the sword.

140
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,169
What should we do today?

141
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,437
I'm tapped out.

142
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,539
I already picked my toes, twice.

143
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,374
Twice?

144
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:40,646
The first time was for cleaning, but the second
time's just for the sweet picking sensation.

145
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,514
Sokka's been in charge
of the schedule.

146
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,183
I'm not sure
what we should be doing.

147
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,286
Plus, it's so hot today.

148
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,987
How hot is it?

149
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,922
I don't know.

150
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,090
Real hot?

151
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:56,995
It's so hot, it's so hot,
momo is shedding like appa.

152
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,233
Huh, huh?

153
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,969
I guess the jokes
don't run in the family.

154
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,438
Oh, everyone's a critic.

155
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:23,355
The warrior practices a variety of
arts to keep his mind sharp and fluid.

156
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,657
The first you will learn
is calligraphy.

157
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,327
Write your name.

158
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,163
Writing my name will make me
a better swordsman?

159
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:35,634
When you write your name, you
stamp the paper with your identity

160
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,972
you must learn to use your sword to
stamp your identity on a battlefield.

161
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:48,580
Remember, you cannot take back a stroke
of the brush, or a stroke of the sword.

162
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,854
You are getting ink
on your face.

163
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,523
I am?

164
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,791
I am.

165
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,655
So this is about putting
my identity on the page, right?

166
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:31,357
Landscape painting teaches a warrior
to hold the lay of the land in his mind.

167
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,364
In battle, you only have an
instant to take everything in.

168
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,139
Now, paint it.

169
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,043
And no peeking.

170
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,762
I'm finished.

171
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,064
You added a rainbow.

172
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,967
Is that ok?

173
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,176
Sokka.

174
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,682
Concentrate on
what you're doing.

175
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:33,652
Rock gardening teaches the warrior
to manipulate his surroundings

176
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,155
and use them to his advantage.

177
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:40,359
Hm, manipulate them
to my advantage.

178
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,829
Oh.

179
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,844
Ah.

180
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,250
Hey, would you mind grabbing
a cold drink for m

181
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,563
I'll take a slice of lemon
in mine, please.

182
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,594
What's going on in there?

183
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,501
Crazy old man.

184
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,109
So where are we going next?

185
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,445
We're starting from here.

186
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,747
No, we're over on this island.

187
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,650
You noodle-brains don't know
what you're doing.

188
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,951
I miss sokka.

189
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,254
Ooh, I got one.

190
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,791
If you miss him so much,
why don't you marry him?

191
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:28,534
You've had a good
first day of training.

192
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,235
I have?

193
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,671
But I thought I messed up
every single thing we worked on.

194
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:36,108
You messed things up
in a very special way.

195
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,711
You are ready for a real sword.

196
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,213
Are you giving me one of yours?

197
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,264
No.

198
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,752
Your sword must be
an extension of yourself

199
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,689
so tomorw, you will make
your own sword.

200
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,834
Choosing the correct material the most
important step in crafting a sword.

201
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,636
You must trust your steel
with your life.

202
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,788
Choose carefully.

203
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:15,814
Master, would it be possible for me to leave and
bring back a special material for my sword?

204
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,284
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

205
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,173
Sokka's coming.

206
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,891
Hey, guys.

207
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:26,792
What are you doing?

208
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,326
Sokka?

209
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,060
You're back.

210
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,962
We missed you so much.

211
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,597
Say something funny.

212
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,065
Funny how?

213
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,403
What's the deal?

214
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,871
I don't know.

215
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,472
They missed you or something.

216
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,940
I didn't care.

217
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,941
Thanks.

218
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,576
That warms my heart.

219
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,045
Anyway, I need some help.

220
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,349
Who's this?

221
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,217
Oh, these are my friends.

222
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,854
Just other good
fire nation folks.

223
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,690
Do you think we can make
a sword out of a meteorite?

224
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,327
We'll make a sword unlike
any other in the world.

225
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,090
Sokka, when you first arrived,
you were so unsure.

226
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,392
You even seemed
down on yourself.

227
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,128
But I saw something
in you right away.

228
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:47,866
I saw a heart as strong as
a lion turtle, and twice as g

229
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:52,271
and as we trained, it wasn't
your skills that impressed me.

230
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:56,075
No, it certainly
wasn't your skills.

231
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,779
You showed something
beyond that.

232
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,085
Creativity, versatility,
intelligence.

233
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,776
These are the traits
that define a great swordsman

234
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:12,725
and these are the traits
that define you.

235
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:17,029
You told me you didn't know
if you were rthy

236
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:23,102
but I believe that you are more worthy
than any man I have ever trained.

237
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,906
I'm sorry, master.

238
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,058
You're wrong.

239
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,110
I am not worthy.

240
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,178
I'm not who you think I am.

241
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,446
I'm not from the fire nation.

242
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,548
I'm from the Southern
water tribe.

243
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,385
I lied so that I could
learn swordsmanship from you.

244
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:41,387
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:44,623
I'm sorry, too.

246
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,897
No, this is my fight, alone.

247
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,038
You used to be
the pride of the fire nation.

248
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,141
Our top general,
the dragon of the west.

249
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:06,011
Now, look at you.

250
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,067
Excellent.

251
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:05,204
Using your superior agility
against an older opponent.

252
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,472
Smart.

253
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,490
Good use of train.

254
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,091
Fighting from the high ground.

255
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:53,952
Yes, use your surrouings.

256
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,721
Make them fight for you.

257
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:14,907
Very resourceful.

258
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,571
Excellent work, sokka.

259
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:57,449
I think I'm a little old
to be fighting the avatar.

260
00:21:57,769 --> 00:21:59,718
How did you know?

261
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,221
Oh, I've been around a while.

262
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,655
You pick things up.

263
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,191
Of course, I knew from the
beginning that sokka was water tribe.

264
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:10,396
You might want to think of
a better fire nation cover name.

265
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:12,398
Try "Lee."

266
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,999
There's a million lees.

267
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:20,439
The way of the sword doesn't
belong to any one nation.

268
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,142
Knowledge of the arts
belongs to us all.

269
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,151
Soa, you must continue
your training on your own.

270
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:35,888
If you stay on this path,
I know that one day

271
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:39,191
you will becoman even
greater master than I am.

272
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,702
Wait.

273
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:54,506
The master wanted you to have this,
as something to remember him by.

274
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:03,148
It's a pal sho tile.

275
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,817
The white lotus.

276
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:05,818
Hm.

277
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:06,852
What does it mean?

278
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:07,903
I have no idea.

279
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,158
Ooh, that reminds me.

280
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,727
Toph, I thought
you might like this

281
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:18,030
since you've probably never had a
chance to bend space earth before.

282
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,832
Sweet.

283
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,968
Check this out.

284
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:28,474
You know, I don't think there's
such a thing as "space earth."

285
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,343
If it's from space,
then it's not really earth.

286
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:32,878
Must you ruin everything?

287
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,562
I can't believe I missed you.
