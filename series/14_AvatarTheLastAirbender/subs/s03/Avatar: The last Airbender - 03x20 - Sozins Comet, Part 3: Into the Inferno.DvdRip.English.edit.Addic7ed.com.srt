1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,850
Water,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,120
Earth,

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,250
Fire,

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,510
Air.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,940
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,490
Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,310
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,510
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,580
100 years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,550
an Airbender named Aang

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,970
And although his airbending skills are great

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,140
He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,820
But I believe Aang can save the world.

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,821
<i>Previously on Avatar</i>

15
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:53,100
Sozin's Comet is arriving and our destinies are upon us.

16
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,080
There's one technique that you need to know before facing my father.

17
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:58,381
How to redirect lightning.

18
00:00:58,382 --> 00:01:02,882
Even though we don't know where Aang is, we
need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet.

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,983
It's time for this world to end in fire,

20
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:11,384
and for a new world to be born from the ashes.

21
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:17,385
I guess we don't have a choice, Momo.
I have to kill the Fire Lord.

22
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,973
Zuko, don't worry. We can take Azula.

23
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:44,986
I'm not worried about her. I'm worried about Aang.

24
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,907
What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my father?

25
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,286
What if he loses?

26
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:53,392
Aang won't lose. He's gonna come back.

27
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:56,696
He has to.

28
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,300
What am I holding?

29
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,823
A cherry pit, princess...

30
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:23,096
Correct. And what day it this?

31
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,461
It is the day of your coronation...

32
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:30,561
Yes it is. So please, tell me why on the most important day of my life,

33
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:32,973
you decided to leave a pit in my cherry?

34
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:37,144
It wasn't a decision. I was just a small mistake.

35
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:41,642
Small? Do you realize what could've happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?

36
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:44,842
I suppose... you could've choked?

37
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:48,369
Yes. Then you understand the severity of your crime?

38
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:52,548
I understand princess. Please, forgive me.

39
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:57,294
Oh, very well. Because it is a special day, I will show mercy.

40
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,375
You are banished! Leave this palace immediately!

41
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:07,303
What are you all looking at? I have two feet that need scrubbing

44
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:22,197
It's weird to say, but the comet actually looks beautiful.

45
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:25,625
Too bad the Fire Lord is about to use it to destroy the world.

46
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:54,038
We're too late! The fleet army's taking off!

47
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:56,217
And we're taking off too

48
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,978
Where's the closest airship?

49
00:03:58,444 --> 00:03:59,788
It's right... urgh

50
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:06,924
Ugh!

51
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,872
You sent for us, Princess? Is everything alright?

52
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,931
Actually, everything is not alright.

53
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,202
Do you know how long it took you to get here?

54
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:47,353
Uhhh, a few minutes I guess?

55
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:49,082
Five to be precise.

56
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:53,894
In which time, an assassin could've snuck in,
done away with me and been on his merry way.

57
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,617
My apologies Princess.

58
00:04:55,652 --> 00:05:00,334
Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord?
Retardiness in disloyalty?

59
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:01,940
The Dai-Li would never betray you!

60
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:07,472
And I'm sure this is what just you told Long Feng
before you turned against him and joined me.

61
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,976
You're all banished!

62
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:12,447
But...
Good Bye!

63
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:20,065
Please send in the next group on your way out.

64
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,216
Shh!

65
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:16,585
That's how it's done!

66
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,196
Good work Toph. It's time to take control of this ship.
Take the wheel.

67
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:24,165
That's a great idea. Let the blind girl steal the giant airship!

68
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,325
I was talking to Sukki.

69
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,577
That would make a lot more sense.

70
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:30,806
What are we gonna do about the rest of the crew?

71
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,280
Take us out close to the water.
I've got an idea.

72
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,553
Attention crew. This is your captain speaking.

73
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:48,197
Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and sweet cream!

74
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:50,980
We have a very special birthday to celebrate.

75
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:05,040
Hey, I'm Kwen lee. I work up in communications.

76
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,801
Oh hi. I work down in the engine room.

77
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:12,066
It's far a long minutes before. Big action, you know?

78
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:15,785
Yup. So, do you know whose birthday it is?

79
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:21,724
I can't believe the captain remembered my birthday.
He really does care!

80
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,929
Happy Birthday!

81
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:39,492
Fire Lord Ozai, Here we come!

82
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:01,835
Azula, we heard what happened.
Why have you banished all of your servants?

83
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,778
Or your Dai-Li agent? And the imperial's firebenders?

84
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:10,446
None of them could be trusted.
Sooner or later, they all would've betrayed me.

85
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:12,790
Just like Mai and Ty Lee did.

86
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,525
Azula, we are concerned for you and your well-being.

87
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,045
My father asked you to come here and talk to me, didn't he?

88
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,593
He doesn't think I can handle the responsibility of being Fire Lord.

89
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:27,976
And I will be the greatest leader in Fire Nation history.

90
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:32,554
I'm sure you will, but considering everything that happened today,

91
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:35,360
perhaps it's best to postpone your coronation.

92
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,350
What? Which one of you just said that?

93
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,931
What a shame, there's only one way to resolve this.

94
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:45,832
You two must duel each other.

95
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:48,474
I order you to fight in Agni Kai!

96
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:51,629
But, we're not firebenders...

97
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,680
Alright, fine. Lou, you're banished. Lee, you can stay.

98
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:59,905
But, I'm Lee. So who is banished?

99
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:17,669
Ba Sing Se, The Order of the White Lotus is here.

100
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:20,082
Here to set you free.

101
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:26,737
Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind of power.

102
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,875
Alright hair. It's time to face your doom.

103
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:10,449
What a shame. You always had such beautiful hair.

104
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:13,154
What are you doing here?

105
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:16,145
I didn't wanna miss my own daughter's coronation.

106
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,996
Don't pretend to act proud. I know what you really think of me.

107
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:21,781
'She's some kind of monster'

108
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:26,769
I think you're confused. All your life you used fear to control people.

109
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:29,393
Like your friends, Mai and Ty Lee.

110
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:32,515
But what choice do I have? Trust is for fools.

111
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,919
Fear is the only reliable way. Even you fear me.

112
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:41,840
No, I love you, Azula. I do.

113
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,649
Urgh.

114
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,644
We're not gonna catch up to him in time.

115
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:14,273
No...

116
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:49,055
Momo, time for you to go.

117
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:50,436
What just happened?

118
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:53,104
It's Aang. He's back!

119
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:10,443
After generations of Fire Lords failed to find you...

120
00:14:10,878 --> 00:14:17,797
Now the universe delivers you to me as an act of providence.

121
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:21,546
Please listen to me. We don't have to fight.

122
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,572
You have the power to end it here and stop what you are doing.

123
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:34,894
You are right. I do have the power, I have all the power in the world!

124
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:55,661
Whoo-hoo! Airbending slice!

125
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,671
Shouldn't we be helping him?

126
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:00,075
The Fire Lord is Aang's fight.

127
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:03,798
We need to stay focused on stopping that fleet
from burning down the Earth kingdom.

128
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,010
And how did we do that captain boomerang?

129
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:09,664
I can't see outside of this floating hunk of metal.

130
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,251
Airship slice!

131
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:50,628
Wow! That's a lot of fire, isn't it?

132
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:15,766
It's gonna be a rough ride. We gotta get to the top of this thing, fast.

133
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:19,966
Then what?

134
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:23,770
Watch each other's back. And if we make it that far, I'll let you know.

135
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:57,125
Sukkiiii!

136
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,197
I'm OK. Just finish the mission.

137
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,765
No..

138
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,934
Sokka, I think we got it.

139
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:24,407
By decree of Phoenix King Ozai, I now crown you Fire Lord..

140
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,283
What are you waiting for? Do it!

141
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,183
Sorry, but you're not gonna become Fire Lord today.

142
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:39,291
I am.

143
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:42,306
Hahaha. You're hillarious.

144
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,481
And you're going down.

145
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:50,367
Wait. You want to be Fire Lord. Fine. Let's settle this.

146
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:56,153
Just you and me, brother. The showdown that always mean to be. Agni Kai!

147
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:58,076
You're on.

148
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:03,363
What are you doing? She's playing you.

149
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:06,323
She knows she can't take us both, so she's trying to separate us.

150
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,228
I know, but I can take her this time.

151
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:12,701
But even you admitted to your uncle that you'd need help facing Azula.

152
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:16,460
There's something off about her.
I can't explain it, but she's slipping.

153
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,317
And this way, no one else has to get hurt.

154
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:34,577
I'm sorry it has to end this way, brother.

155
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:36,024
No, you're not.

156
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:38,786
Urgh!

157
00:22:07,147 --> 00:22:11,500
No Lighting today? What's the matter?
Afraid I'll redirect it?

158
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:14,217
Oh, I'll show you lightning!

159
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,994
No!

160
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:53,672
Zuko!

161
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:15,407
Hahaha, You're weak. Just like the rest of your people!

162
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:19,533
They did not deserve to exist in this world, in MY world!

163
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:24,538
Prepare to join them! Prepare to Die!
