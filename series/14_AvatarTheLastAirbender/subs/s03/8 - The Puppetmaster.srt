1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,249
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,930
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,970
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,330
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,450
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,210
<i>Then everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,290
<i>Only the avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,129
<i>But when the world
needed him most</i>

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,930
<i>he vanished.</i>

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,530
<i>100 years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,290
<i>an airbender named aang.</i>

12
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,649
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great</i>

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,650
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,810
<i>But I believe aang
can save the world.</i>

15
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:50,324
You're looking at the only
waterbender in the whole South pole.

16
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:54,364
This ship has haunted
my tribe since gran-gran was a little girl.

17
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:57,444
It was part of
the fire nation's first attack.

18
00:00:57,445 --> 00:01:00,083
The legends say the moon
was the first waterbender.

19
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:03,004
Our ancestors saw how it
pushed and pulled the tides

20
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:05,204
and learned how to
do it themselves.

21
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:08,364
I've always noticed my
waterbending is stronger at night.

22
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:11,964
What are you doing?

23
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:14,164
I'm making my own water.

24
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:35,643
Suddenly, they heard something
down the hall, in the dark.

25
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:39,844
? Ooh...?

26
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:42,404
It came into the torchlight.

27
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:46,724
And they knew the blade
of wing-fun was haunted!

28
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:50,844
? Ah-ah...?

29
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:55,564
I think I liked "the man
with a sword for a hand" better.

30
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:58,284
Water tribe slumber parties
must stink.

31
00:01:58,404 --> 00:02:00,004
No, wait, I've got one.

32
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:02,403
And this is a true Southern
water tribe story.

33
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:04,764
Is this one of those
"a friend of my cousin

34
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:06,803
knew some guy that
this happened to" story?

35
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:09,484
No, it happened to mom.

36
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:14,604
One winter, when mom was a girl

37
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:17,444
a snowstorm buried
the whole village for weeks.

38
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:21,524
A month later, mom realized she hadn't
seen her friend nini since the storm.

39
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:24,644
So mom and some others
went to check on nini's family.

40
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:26,644
When they got there,
no one was home.

41
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:29,244
Just a fire
flickering in the fireplace.

42
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:30,994
While the men
went out to search

43
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:32,724
mom stayed in the house.

44
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:35,644
When she was alone,
she heard a voice.

45
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:40,124
"It's so cold,
and I can't get warm."

46
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,124
Mom turned and saw
nini standing by the fire.

47
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:45,604
She was blue,
like she was frozen.

48
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:49,364
Mom ran outside for help,
but when every one came back

49
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:51,324
nini was gone.

50
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:52,564
Where'd she go?

51
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:54,564
No one knows.

52
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:57,204
Nini's house stands empty
to this day.

53
00:02:57,205 --> 00:03:00,283
But sometimes, people see smoke
coming up from the chimney

54
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:03,604
like little nini is still
trying to get warm.

55
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,524
Wait.

56
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:10,444
Guys, did you hear that?

57
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:13,804
I hear people
under the mountain, and they're screaming.

58
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:16,644
Pft, nice try.

59
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:20,044
No, I'm serious,
I hear something.

60
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:23,044
You're probably just
jumpy from the ghost stories.

61
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:24,924
It just stopped.

62
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:27,644
All right, now
I'm getting scared.

63
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:28,964
Hello, children.

64
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:36,724
Sorry to frighten you,
my name is hama.

65
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:40,804
You children shouldn't be out in
the forest by yourselves at night.

66
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:46,404
I have an inn nearby, why don't you come back
there for some spiced tea and warm beds?

67
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:49,164
Yes, please.

68
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:58,844
Thanks for letting us
stay here tonight, you have a lovely inn.

69
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:00,804
Aren't you sweet?

70
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:02,443
You know, you should be careful.

71
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:05,924
People have been disappearing in
those woods you were camping in.

72
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,643
What do you mean, disappearing?

73
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:12,124
When the moon turns full,
people walk in

74
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:15,484
and they don't come out.

75
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:17,764
Who wants more tea?

76
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:24,684
Don't worry, you'll all be
completely safe here.

77
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:29,444
Why don't I show you to your rooms,
and you can get a good night's rest?

78
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:41,484
I know, momo,
this place is creepy.

79
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:44,284
I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to fall asleep.

80
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:55,404
Wakey-wakey.

81
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:58,524
Time to go shopping.

82
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:10,404
That Mr. yao seems to
have a thing for you.

83
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:13,683
Maybe we should go back and see if
he'll give us some free komodo sausages.

84
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:17,364
You would have me use
my feminine charms

85
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,684
to take advantage
of that poor man?

86
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:23,444
I think you and I are
going to get along swimmingly.

87
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:26,724
You won't have any
ash bananas till next week?

88
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:31,364
Well, I have to send the boy to hing-wa
island to get them, and it's a two-day trip.

89
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:34,604
Oh, right, tomorrow's
the full moon.

90
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:37,884
Exactly, I can't lose another
delivery boy in the woods.

91
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,564
People disappearing
in the woods

92
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:42,244
weird stuff during full moons

93
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:44,804
this just reeks of
spirit world shenanigans.

94
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,044
I bet if we take
a little walk around town

95
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:50,483
we'll find out what these people did to
the environment to make the spirits mad.

96
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:54,324
And then you can sew up this little
mystery, lickety-split, avatar-style.

97
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:57,324
Helping people,
that's what I do.

98
00:05:57,444 --> 00:06:00,764
Why don't you all take
those things back to the inn?

99
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:03,084
I just have to run
a couple more errands.

100
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:05,084
I'll be back in a little while.

101
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:07,563
This is a mysterious,
little town you have here.

102
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:11,644
Mysterious town
for mysterious children.

103
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,404
That hama seems
a little strange.

104
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:23,203
Like she knows something,
or she's hiding something.

105
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:24,604
That's ridiculous.

106
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:27,614
She's a nice woman who took us
in and gave us a place to stay.

107
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:29,283
She kind of reminds me
of gran-gran.

108
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:32,414
But what did she
mean by that comment "mysterious children"?

109
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:34,324
Gee, I don't know.

110
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:38,043
Maybe because she found four strange
kids camping in the woods at night?

111
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:40,684
Isn't that a little mysterious?

112
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,324
I'm gonna take a look around.

113
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:48,124
Sokka, sokka,
what are you doing?

114
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,443
You can't just snoop around
someone's house.

115
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,524
It'll be fine.

116
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:55,084
She could be home any minute.

117
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:57,644
Sokka, you're gonna get us
all in trouble.

118
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:59,364
And this is just plain rude.

119
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:00,884
I'm not finished yet.

120
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,524
Come on...

121
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,884
Ok, that's pretty creepy.

122
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:10,484
So she's got a hobby.

123
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,323
There's nothing
weird about that.

124
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:14,044
Sokka, you've looked enough.

125
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:15,724
Hama will be back soon.

126
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:19,323
Just an ordinary, puppet-loving
innkeeper, huh?

127
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:21,163
Then why does she have
a locked door up here?

128
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:24,524
Probably to keep people like you
from snooping through her stuff.

129
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,604
We'll see.

130
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:28,523
It's empty except for
a little chest.

131
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:31,844
Maybe it's treasure.

132
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:33,764
Sokka, what are you doing?

133
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:35,643
You're breaking into
a private room.

134
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:37,884
I have to see what's in there.

135
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:43,804
We shouldn't be doing this.

136
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,924
Maybe there's a key
here somewhere.

137
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:47,764
Oh, hand it over.

138
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:53,604
Come on, come on.

139
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,884
This isn't as easy it looks.

140
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:57,884
Guys, I don't know about this.

141
00:07:58,004 --> 00:08:00,004
This is crazy, I'm leaving.

142
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:02,484
Suit yourself, do it, toph.

143
00:08:05,324 --> 00:08:07,684
I'll tell you
what's in the box.

144
00:08:22,164 --> 00:08:23,644
An old comb?

145
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:26,524
It's my greatest treasure.

146
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:31,844
It's the last thing I owned from
growing up in the Southern water tribe.

147
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,274
You're from the Southern
water tribe?

148
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,934
Just like you.

149
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:40,214
How did you know?

150
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:42,574
I heard you talking
around your campfire.

151
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:44,214
But why didn't you tell us?

152
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:46,694
I wanted to surprise you.

153
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:51,294
I bought all this food today so I could
fix you a big, water tribe dinner.

154
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:54,734
Of course, I can't get all
the ingredients I need here, but

155
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:58,374
ocean kumquats are a lot like sea
prunes, if you stew them long enough.

156
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,213
Great.

157
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:03,254
I knew I felt a bond
with you right away.

158
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:05,133
And I knew you were
keeping a secret

159
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:06,774
so I guess we're both right.

160
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:09,654
But I'm sorry we were
sneaking around.

161
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:12,374
Apology accepted.

162
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:14,814
Now let's get cooking.

163
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:25,614
[Omo chirps]

164
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:35,014
I'd steer clear
of the sea prunes.

165
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,254
I thought they were
ocean kumquats.

166
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:38,373
Close enough.

167
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:41,374
Who wants five-flavor soup?

168
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:46,934
You're a waterbender.

169
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:49,573
I've never met another
waterbender from our tribe.

170
00:09:49,574 --> 00:09:53,454
That's because the fire nation
wiped them all out.

171
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,174
I was the last one.

172
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,134
So how did you end up out here?

173
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:01,774
I was stolen from my home.

174
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:05,814
It was over 60 years ago
when the raids started.

175
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:33,014
They came again and again.

176
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:38,214
Each time, rounding up more of out
waterbenders and taking them captive.

177
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:43,814
We did our best to hold them off

178
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,734
but our numbers dwindled
as the raids continued.

179
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:59,734
Finally, I, too, was captured.

180
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,694
I was led away in chains.

181
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:07,494
The last waterbender of
the Southern water tribe.

182
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:18,014
They put us in terrible prisons
here in the fire nation.

183
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:21,174
I was the only one
who managed to escape.

184
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:22,934
How did you get away?

185
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:25,294
And why did you stay
in the fire nation?

186
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:26,814
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:29,934
It's too painful to
talk about anymore.

188
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:31,774
We completely understand.

189
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:33,974
We lost our mother in a raid.

190
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,254
Oh, you poor things.

191
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:41,134
I can't tell you
what it means to meet you.

192
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:43,334
It's an honor, you're a hero.

193
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:47,014
I never thought I'd meet
another Southern waterbender.

194
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:49,214
I'd like to teach you
what I know

195
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,174
so you can carry on
the Southern tradition when I'm gone.

196
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,454
Yes, yes, of course.

197
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:59,574
To learn about my heritage,
it would mean everything to me.

198
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:05,454
Growing up at the South pole

199
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:10,294
waterbenders are totally at home
surrounded by snow and ice and seas.

200
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:12,694
But as you probably
noticed on your travels

201
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:15,374
that isn't the case
wherever you go.

202
00:12:15,494 --> 00:12:17,664
I know, when we were
stranded in the desert

203
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:20,214
I felt like there was
almost nothing I could do.

204
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:24,534
That's why you have to
learn to control water wherever it exists.

205
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:26,944
I've even used my own
sweat for waterbending.

206
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:29,414
That's very resourceful, katara.

207
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,694
You're thinking like
a true master.

208
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:35,334
But did you know you can even
pull water out of thin air?

209
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:42,894
You've got to
keep an open mind, katara.

210
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:46,454
There's water in places
you never think about.

211
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:53,453
This has gotta be the nicest,
natural setting in the fire nation.

212
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:55,893
I don't see anything that would
make a spirit mad around here.

213
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:59,814
Maybe the moon spirit
just turned mean.

214
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:02,534
The moon spirit is
a gentle, loving lady.

215
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:04,454
She rules the sky
with compassion.

216
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,734
And... lunar goodness.

217
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,094
Excuse me, sir.

218
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:13,293
Can you tell us anything about the
spirit that's been stealing people?

219
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:17,174
Only one man ever saw it and
lived, and that's old man ding.

220
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:19,534
Where does old man ding live?

221
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:22,774
Wow, these flowers
are beautiful.

222
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:24,654
They're called fire lilies.

223
00:13:24,774 --> 00:13:27,894
They only bloom
a few weeks a year

224
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:31,374
but they're one of my favorite
things about living here.

225
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:35,214
And like all plants, and all living
things, they're filled with water.

226
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:37,774
I met a waterbender
who lived in a swamp

227
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,493
and could control the vines
by bending the water inside.

228
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:43,654
You can take it even further.

229
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:52,694
That was incredible.

230
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:55,254
It's a shame about
the lilies, though.

231
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:56,894
They're just flowers.

232
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:59,244
When you're a waterbender
in a strange land

233
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:01,974
you do what you must to survive.

234
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:05,454
Tonight, I'll teach you
the ultimate technique of waterbending.

235
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:08,374
It can only be done
during the full moon

236
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:10,374
when your bending
is at its peak.

237
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:12,614
But isn't that dangerous?

238
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:15,813
I thought people have been disappearing
around here during the full moon.

239
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,614
Oh, katara.

240
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:21,134
Two master waterbenders
beneath a full moon?

241
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:23,854
I don't think we have
anything to worry about.

242
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:34,824
Old man ding?

243
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:36,654
Eh, ow...

244
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:37,773
Aw, dad blame it.

245
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:38,824
What?

246
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:40,454
Can't you see I'm busy?

247
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:42,894
Got a full moon rising.

248
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:46,654
And why does everyone
call me that, I'm not that old.

249
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:50,414
Aww...

250
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:52,334
Well, I'm young at heart.

251
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:59,894
Not ready to get snapped up by
some moon monster, yet, at least.

252
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:02,054
We wanted to
ask you about that.

253
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:04,253
Did you get a good look
at the spirit that took you?

254
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:05,974
Didn't see no spirit.

255
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:08,134
Just felt something
come over me.

256
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:10,454
Like I was possessed.

257
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:14,334
Forced me to start
walking toward the mountain.

258
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:17,854
I tried to fight it, but
I couldn't control my own limbs.

259
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:21,374
It just about had me
into a cave up there.

260
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:27,694
And I looked up at the moon for what I
thought would be my last glimpse of light.

261
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:30,894
But then the sun
started to rise.

262
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,094
And I got control of
myself again.

263
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:36,494
I just high-tailed it away from
that mountain as quick as I could.

264
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:39,614
Why would a spirit want to
take people to a mountain?

265
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:40,934
Oh, no!

266
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:43,293
I did hear people screaming
under the mountain.

267
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:45,894
The missing villagers
must still be there.

268
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,259
I can hear them,
they're this way.

269
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:04,699
Can you feel the power
the full moon brings?

270
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,379
For generations, it has blessed
waterbenders with its glow.

271
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:16,499
Allowing us to do
incredible things.

272
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:20,099
I've never felt more alive.

273
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:25,099
This is the place.

274
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,059
I can't see
anything down there.

275
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:29,819
That's why you have me,
let's go.

276
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,819
We're saved.

277
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:48,339
I didn't know that spirits made prisons
like this, who brought you here?

278
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,019
It was no spirit.

279
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,379
It was a witch.

280
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:53,339
A witch, what do you mean?

281
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,419
She seems like
a normal old woman.

282
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:59,859
But she controls people
like some dark puppetmaster.

283
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:01,459
Hama.

284
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:03,379
Yes, the innkeeper.

285
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:06,019
I knew there was something
creepy about here.

286
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:07,459
We have to stop hama.

287
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,899
I'll get these people
out of here, you go.

288
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,419
What I'm about to show you

289
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:22,339
I discovered in that
wretched, fire nation prison.

290
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,899
The guards were always careful
to keep any water away from us.

291
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:29,859
They piped in dry air,
and had us suspended away from the ground.

292
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:35,379
Before giving us any water, they would bind
our hands and feet so we couldn't bend.

293
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:40,019
Any sign of trouble
was met with cruel retribution.

294
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:44,579
And yet, each month, I felt the
full moon enriching me with its energy.

295
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,819
There had to be something
I could do to escape.

296
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:52,339
Then I realized that where
there is life, there is water.

297
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:55,699
The rats that scurried across
the floor of my cage

298
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:59,299
were nothing more than
skins filled with liquid.

299
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:05,179
And I passed years developing the
skills that would lead to my escape.

300
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:07,659
Bloodbending.

301
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:10,379
Controlling the water
in another body.

302
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:13,659
Enforcing your own will
over theirs.

303
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:18,619
Once I had mastered the rats,
I was ready for the men.

304
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,019
And during the next full moon

305
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,139
I walked free for
the first time in decades.

306
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:35,899
My cell unlocked by the very
guards assigned to keep me in.

307
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:40,339
Once you perfect this technique,
you can control anything.

308
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,619
Or anyone.

309
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,339
But to reach inside someone
and control them?

310
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,099
I don't know if I want
that kind of power.

311
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:51,579
The choice is not yours.

312
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:54,139
The power exists.

313
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,739
And it's your duty to use the gifts
you've been given to win this war.

314
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:03,059
Katara, they tried to wipe us out,
our entire culture, your mother.

315
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,339
I know.

316
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:07,819
Then you should understand
what I'm talking about.

317
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,339
We're the last waterbenders
of the Southern tribe.

318
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:14,419
We have to fight these people
whenever we can.

319
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:17,819
Wherever they are,
with any means necessary.

320
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,659
It's you.

321
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:23,259
You're the one who's making people
disappear during the full moons.

322
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:26,579
They threw me in prison to rot

323
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,739
along with
my brothers and sisters.

324
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:30,499
They deserve the same.

325
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,419
You must carry on my work.

326
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,939
I won't, I won't
use bloodbending

327
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:37,659
and I won't allow you
to keep terrorizing this town.

328
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,419
You should have learned
the technique before you turned against me.

329
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,619
It's impossible to fight
your way out of my grip.

330
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:53,139
I control every muscle,
every vein in your body.

331
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,299
Stop, please.

332
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,619
You're not the only one
who draws power from the moon.

333
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:30,459
My bending is more powerful
than yours, hama.

334
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,539
Your technique is useless on me.

335
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,178
We know what you've
been doing, hama.

336
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:00,779
Give up, you're outnumbered.

337
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:03,459
No.

338
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:06,219
You've outnumbered yourselves.

339
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,859
Katara, look out!

340
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:21,379
It's like my brain
has a mind of its own.

341
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:24,139
Stop it, arm, stop it!

342
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,099
This feels weird.

343
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:32,499
I'm sorry, aang.

344
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:34,139
It's ok.

345
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:43,979
Don't hurt your friends, katara.

346
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,219
And don't let them
hurt each other.

347
00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:49,779
No!

348
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:13,739
You're going to be
locked away forever.

349
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:16,179
My work is done.

350
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,739
Congratulations, katara.

351
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:23,059
You're a bloodbender.
