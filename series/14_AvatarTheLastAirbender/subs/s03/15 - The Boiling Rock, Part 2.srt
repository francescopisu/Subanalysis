1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,370
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,540
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,710
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,860
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,450
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,780
<i>Then, everything changed when
the fire nation attacked</i>

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,890
<i>only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,490
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,190
<i>A hundred years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar.</i>

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,860
<i>An airbender named aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,070
<i>And although his airbending skills are great, he has
a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,130
<i>But I believe, aang
can save the world.</i>

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,940
It's my dad.

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,300
He was captured too.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,620
My guess is...

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,610
They were taken to the boiling rock.

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,670
It's on the island in thew
middle of the boiling lake.

18
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,060
It's inescapable.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,640
We just need to lay low, and
find my dad as fast as possible.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,060
Stop right there, chit sang.

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,830
I've had it with your unruly behavior.

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,290
You're going in a cooler.

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,060
It's suki!

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,840
I am so glad to see you, sokka.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,200
I knew you'd come!

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,610
I heard you're hatching an
escape plan and I want in.

27
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,830
Well, well, well.

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,150
I never thought I would find you in here,

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,200
prince zuko.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,310
How did you know who I am?

31
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,460
You broke my niece's heart.

32
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,260
You're mai's uncle?

33
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,320
Yeah, new arrivals coming in a dawn.

34
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,810
Anybody interesting?

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,700
Nah, just the ususal.

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,180
Some robber, couple of
traitors, some war prisoners.

37
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,530
War prisoners.

38
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,270
It could be your father.

39
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,390
Dad.

40
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,590
Line them up for the warden!

41
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,390
Dad.

42
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,400
Excuse me, coming through, the
warden wants me over there.

43
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,640
Welcome to the boiling rock.

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,030
I am sure you've all heard a horrible
rumours about our little island.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,250
Well I just want to tell you,

46
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,210
that they don't have to true,

47
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,490
as long as you do everything I say.

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,630
Look me in a eyes, when
I am talking to you.

49
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,370
No.

50
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,540
Oh, you'd rather look at my shoes.

51
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,560
Then take a look!

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,200
I know exactly who you are,
hakoda of the water tribe...

53
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,110
So strong will,

54
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,590
but don't worry we will
get rid of that in time.

55
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,350
Now look me in the eye!

56
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,960
See? Isn't that better?

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,030
You all do as I say or... pay the price.

58
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,470
I am fine!

59
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,820
Get this prisoners out of my sight!

60
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,720
Thank goodness you're ok.

61
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,250
If you take one step closer,

62
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,940
you'll see just how 'ok' I am...

63
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,810
Dad, it's me.

64
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,230
Sokka!

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,530
My son.

66
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,520
Huh, you know sokka.

67
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,150
You should be more careful
with that guard outfit on.

68
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,040
I almost punched you in the gut.

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,010
Yeah, I've run into that problem earlier.

70
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,340
Are you comfortable chit sang?

71
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,980
If you're trying to make me talk,

72
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,080
forget it! I am not a squealer.

73
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,470
Chit sang, I only asked
if you are comfortable.

74
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,520
Well, yeah.
Actually I am pretty comfortable.

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,750
Are you still comfortable?

76
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,910
No.

77
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,830
I know you and your cronies are not smart
enough to come up with that little escape plan.

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,700
So you're gonna tell me,

79
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,330
who is?

80
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,690
So, where's bato?

81
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,750
Where's everyone else from the invasion?

82
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,230
The others are being held in a
prison near the fire nation palace.

83
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,220
She singled me as their
leader and sent me here.

84
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,080
But before I left I met some young
women who said they knew you/

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,230
the oshinama fighters?..

86
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,200
You mean the kyoshi warriors?

87
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,550
That's right.

88
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,430
Their leader suki is here.
And she's gonna escape with us.

89
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,750
Good. We will need all the help we can get.

90
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,690
And you know prince zuko.

91
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,250
The son of the fire lord?

92
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,440
I don't know him but I know of him.

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,780
Well, he's here, too.

94
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,790
Sounds like a major problem.

95
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,380
Actually, he's on our side now.

96
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,080
I know, I had the same reaction.

97
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,560
After all he's done, it
was hard to trust him.

98
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,580
But he's really proving himself, and I
would never found him without his help.

99
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,140
So,

100
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,910
do you have a plan?

101
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,620
We had one, but some other prisoners
got involved and ruined it.

102
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,300
I don't if there's another
way out of this island.

103
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,410
Sokka,

104
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,720
there's no prison in the world that
can hold two water tribe geniuses.

105
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,680
Then, we better find two.

106
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,640
Zuko, are you there?

107
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,550
I'm here.

108
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,070
I just got talking to my dad.

109
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,090
We came up with an escape plan together.

110
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,460
What are you doing here?

111
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,480
I was just telling this dirty
low-life what I think of him!

112
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,740
Well, you have to do this
later... he's coming with us.

113
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,190
Why?

114
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,450
Because we have order straight
from the warden, that's why.

115
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,480
Can I get just ten more seconds
to rough him up a bit?

116
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,140
Fine, ten seconds.

117
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,600
Take that!

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,280
And this!

119
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,450
Newbie.

120
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,010
We have a new plan, but

121
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,510
we're gonna need a big distraction.

122
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,100
Be in the yard in one hour.

123
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,880
All right, that's enough.

124
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,030
What are you doing?

125
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,930
Where are you taking me?

126
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,900
I didn't do anything wrong!

127
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,540
Come on, zuko. We all know that's a lie.

128
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,780
Mai.

129
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,450
How is he?

130
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,700
I think he's ready to talk.

131
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,670
Have you had enough time to
think about what I asked?

132
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,170
Yes.

133
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,020
And?..

134
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,310
You're right.

135
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,030
There was another person
involved in the escape plan.

136
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,800
Who?

137
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,300
It's guy who disguised like a prison guard

138
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,950
only he's not a prison guard.

139
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,720
He's mastermind, he came up with the plan.

140
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,410
How did you know I was here?

141
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,620
Because I know you so well?

142
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,470
But...

143
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,250
How?

144
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,170
The warden is mine uncle you idiot.

145
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,230
The truth is

146
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,560
I guess I don't know you.

147
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,720
All I get is a letter

148
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,960
you could at least look me in the
eyes when you ripped out my heart.

149
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,470
I didn't mean to.

150
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,810
You didn't mean to?

151
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,190
Dear mai,

152
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,870
"I am sorry that you have
to find out this way,

153
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,980
but I am leaving, .."

154
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,780
Stop!

155
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,900
This isn't about you!
This is about the fire nation!

156
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,480
Thanks, zuko.
That makes me feel all better.

157
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,610
Mai, I never wanted to hurt you.

158
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,690
But I have to do this to save my country.

159
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,590
Save it? You're betraying your country/

160
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,490
that's not how I see it.

161
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,970
Sokka! What's going on?

162
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,330
I don't have much time.

163
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,170
If I am seen with you by the guards,
they might think something is up.

164
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,220
I just talked to my dad.

165
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,540
That's great.

166
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,240
Yeah, and we're escaping
today, on the gondola.

167
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,950
What?

168
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,240
Mine dad and I came up with plan together.

169
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,650
We're come into the gondola

170
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,480
and we're gonna take the hostage
so that they won't cut the lines.

171
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
We'll never make it on the gondola.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,680
There's too many guards.

173
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,310
Mine dad already thought of that.

174
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,970
He said we will need a distraction.

175
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,050
That's why we're gonna start a prison riot!

176
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,000
Ok

177
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,830
let's say by some miracle this all
works and we make it on the gondola.

178
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,860
The warden will still just cut the lines.

179
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,440
Even if we have a captive.

180
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,010
Not if the warden is the captive.

181
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,500
I have to go.

182
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,950
I'll find you before we will start a riot.

183
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,180
Hey, you!

184
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,880
The warden wants to see you.

185
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,880
Why?

186
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,720
I don't know, I didn't asked.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,100
Maye I can schedule another time with him?

188
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,030
How's tomorrow?

189
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,190
He wants to see you, now!

190
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,620
Put the in a line-up.

191
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,450
One of you is an imposter who thought he

192
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,710
could fool me.

193
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,070
But now

194
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,240
that person is going to
be in a lot of trouble.

195
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,580
Who is it?

196
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,670
That's him, warden! He's the imposter.

197
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,900
What?!

198
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,920
I am not! He's lying!

199
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,570
He's a liar.

200
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,120
I m telling you.

201
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,760
It wasn't me.

202
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,630
Save your breath.
I know you've been working together

203
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,590
you threw chit sang in the
very cooler he used to escape!

204
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,560
It was all part of your plan.

205
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,960
That was just the coincidence.

206
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,500
Sir, there is someone to see you.

207
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,700
Who told you to interrupt me?

208
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,990
I did.

209
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,990
Princess azula.

210
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,490
It is a honor to welcome you to the
fire nation's most exemplary prison.

211
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,480
I didn't realize you were coming.

212
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,850
Who is this?

213
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,230
He's guard who was involved in a
recent and feeble escape attempt.

214
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,950
It wasn't me!

215
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,390
Quiet, you!

216
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,050
You're wasting your time
... that's not one ot them.

217
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,330
How would you know?

218
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,400
Because I am people person.

219
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,250
Hey, I just got orders.
Let the prisoners out in the yard.

220
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,370
But in the middle of lockdown.

221
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,500
O-oh, ok. I'll just go tell
the warden you said that.

222
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,920
I am sure he will be glad to hear
about you underminig his authority.

223
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,960
What's your name, again?

224
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,450
Wait!

225
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,330
Ehm, don't tell the warden.
I am just a little confused.

226
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,210
Hey, I am confused too.

227
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,450
But the warden in the bad mood and...
Irrational.

228
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,000
So if you ask me. It's best up to question.

229
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
And just do what he says.

230
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,020
Yeah, you're right.

231
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,570
We're letting them out!

232
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:29,890
This is it.

233
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,480
We have to start a riot.

234
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,520
Ok, but how we would do that?

235
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,750
I will show you.

236
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,620
Why did you do that for?
You're hurting my feelings.

237
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,930
Aren't you mad at me?

238
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,580
Ah, normally I would be but I was
ordered to control my anger.

239
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,980
This is not working.

240
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,200
Hey you!

241
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,280
You're lucky, I didn't racked you out.

242
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,040
But mine generousity comes with the price.

243
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,609
I know you're planning another
escape attempt and I want in

244
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,029
actually we're trying to escape
right now, but we need a riot

245
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,530
you wouldn't happen to know
how to start one would you?

246
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,990
A prison riot? Please.

247
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,250
Hey! Riot!

248
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,220
Impressive

249
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,250
forget about controlling my anger,
let's riot, ugh!..

250
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,180
Who let these prisoners in the yard?
This is supposed to be a lockdown

251
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,909
mam, there's a riot going on
I'm here to protect you

252
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,280
I don't need me protection

253
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,889
believe me, she doesn't.

254
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm sorry but I'm under direct
order from your uncle to make
sure that nothing happens

255
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,700
get off of me!

256
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,250
Zuko, good.

257
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,290
We're all here.

258
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,679
Now all we need to do is grab
warden and get to the gondolas

259
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,050
and how do we do that?

260
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,739
I'm not sure

261
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,940
I thought you thought this
through.

262
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,180
I thought you told me not
to think everything through

263
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,849
maybe not everything, but
ths is kinda important

264
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,890
hey fellas, I think your
girlfriend is taking care of it.

265
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,810
You wouldn't dare

266
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,930
sorry warden, you're my prisoner now.

267
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,170
We've got the warden

268
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,930
now let's get out of here!

269
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,180
That's some girl!..

270
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,670
Tell me about it

271
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,740
we're almost there

272
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,980
back off, we've got the warden

273
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,560
let's go

274
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,990
everyone in

275
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,800
what are you doing?

276
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,329
I'm making it so they can't stop us.

277
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,380
Way to think ahead.

278
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,970
We're on our way.

279
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,970
Wait, who's that?

280
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,620
That's a problem
it's my sister and her friend

281
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,209
this is a rematch I've been
waiting for

282
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,650
me too

283
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,380
there's the warden I see him

284
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,360
cut the line

285
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,440
he wants us to cut the line

286
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:34,619
but if we cut the line
there's no way he'll survive

287
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,670
he knows that

288
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,620
they're about to cut the line!

289
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,779
Then it's time to leave

290
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,430
good bye zuko

291
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,869
they're cutting the line
the gondola's about to go

292
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,890
I hope this thing floats

293
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,489
what are you doing?

294
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,030
Saving the jerk who dumped me

295
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,270
who's that?

296
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,140
It's may what is she doing?

297
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,100
Sorry warden
your record is officially broken

298
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,660
well, we made it out now what?

299
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,250
Zuko what are you doing?

300
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,409
My sister was on that island

301
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,819
yeah and she's probably right behing us
so let's don't stop

302
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,619
what I mean, she must've
come here somehow

303
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,040
there,
that's our way out of here

304
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,550
leave us alone

305
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,360
I never expected this from you

306
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,929
the thing I don't understand is why?

307
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,099
Why would you do it
you knew the consequences

308
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,179
I guess you just don't know
people as well as you think you do

309
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,359
you miscalculated!

310
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,299
I love zuko more than
I fear you

311
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,010
no you miscalculated
you shoud've feared me more!

312
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,770
Come on, let's get out of here

313
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,110
you're both fools

314
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,799
what shall we do with them princess?

315
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,850
Put them somewhere I'll never see
their faces again and let them rot!

316
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,959
What are you doing in this thing?
What happened to the war-balloon?

317
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,210
It kinda get destroyed

318
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,419
sounds like a crazy fishing trip.

319
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,450
Did you at least get some good meat?

320
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,360
I did.

321
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:46,120
The best meat of all

322
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,280
the meat of friendship and fatherhood

323
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,470
I'm new. What's up everybody?

324
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,470
Dad...

325
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,030
Hi, katara.

326
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,089
How are here?
What is going on?
Where did you go?

327
