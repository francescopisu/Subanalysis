1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,719
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,440
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,440
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,800
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,960
<i>Long ago...</i>

6
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:12,039
<i>The four nations lived
together in harmony.</i>

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,720
<i>Then everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,760
<i>Only the avatar,
master of all four elements could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,630
<i>But when the world
needed him most</i>

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,040
<i>100 years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>an airbender named aang.</i>

13
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:32,159
<i>And although his airbending
skills were great</i>

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,120
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,240
<i>But I believe aang
can save the world.</i>

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,960
Ever since you joined us,
you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful.

17
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:50,839
What?

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,520
Look here, sugar queen.

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,280
I gave up everything I had
so that I could teach aang earthbending

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,520
so don't you talk to me
about being selfish.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
The avatar is alive.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,240
I want you to find him,
and end him.

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,280
This is crazy.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,080
How can I beat a guy who
blows things up with his mind?

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,210
You can't.

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,600
How could you do this to me?

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,160
You betrayed me.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,760
You brought this on yourself.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,890
I had no choice.

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,920
Ok, I'm ready for some training.

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,600
Good job, twinkle-toes.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,280
Visualize, then attack.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,320
Maybe you should take
your own advice, toph.

34
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,439
What's the matter?

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,910
Can't handle some dirt,
madame fussy britches?

36
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,880
Oh, sorry, did I splash you,
mud slug?

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,600
Are we taking a break?

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,200
Sneak attack!

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,730
Sokka, sneak attacks don't work
if you yell it out loud.

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,370
Hungry for a mud pie?

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,320
I'll give you a mud pie.

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,360
Uh, guys, I thought we were
supposed to be training me.

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,280
Very well, pupil.

44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,920
I believe we've had
enough training for today.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,720
While katara cleans up,
let's go have some fun.

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,200
Yes!
Yeah!

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,360
Look at all
those messenger hawks.

48
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:40,159
You know, I've been thinking
about getting one for myself.

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,199
That way, I wouldn't
have to talk to anyone.

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,760
I could just send them messages.

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,600
I got to say, I like the idea
of not talking to you.

52
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,680
So, guys, what are we gonna get
with our last silver piece?

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,960
We can get more money.

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,130
Right there.

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,120
This is where you seeing people
are at a disadvantage.

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,090
Everyone guesses wrong because
the dealer moves the rock at the last minute

57
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,320
but I can feel it
with my earthbending.

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,200
You there.

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,200
Want to play a friendly game?

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,840
How could I possibly play?

61
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm blind.

62
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,350
You don't have to see
to be lucky.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,760
"Flamey-o," toph.

64
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,760
Wow, fancy guessing.

65
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,080
You are amazing at this.

66
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:07,119
Would you like to make the game
a little more interesting?

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,480
More interesting?

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,799
How?

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,080
Well, let's say you toss in
your friend's fine sword there.

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,040
Then I'll put up 20 silver pieces
against it, and that's more interesting.

71
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,400
I'll do it for 40 silver pieces.

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,280
Forty silver pieces it is.

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Sorry, little lady, but...

74
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,600
Huh?

75
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,730
I won!

76
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,080
Where did you guys get the money
to buy all this stuff?

77
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,280
Toph got us money.

78
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,490
She scammed one of those guys in town
who moves the shells around all sneaky-like.

79
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,040
She used earthbending
to win the game.

80
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,079
Classic.

81
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,039
Ah, so she cheated.

82
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,520
Hey, I only cheated
because he was cheating.

83
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,840
I cheated a cheater.

84
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,280
What's wrong with that?

85
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:22,399
I'm just saying, this isn't something
we should make a habit of doing.

86
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,239
Why?

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,800
Because it's fun,
and you hate fun?

88
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,200
I don't hate fun.

89
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:29,159
See?

90
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,520
Fun.

91
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,810
Katara, I'll personally make you
an avatar promise

92
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,190
that we won't make a habit
of doing these scams.

93
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,680
Guys, I think these scams
have gone far enough.

94
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:07,159
If you keep doing them,
something bad is gonna happen.

95
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,600
Could you for once
stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up?

96
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,130
Oh, I'm sorry.

97
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,200
You think I should
be more like you?

98
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,720
Like some wild child?

99
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah, maybe.

100
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,630
Maybe then, you'd see
how great we have it.

101
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,639
I mean, look at us.

102
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,959
We're traveling around
the world, making easy money

103
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,720
having fun, with no parents
to tell us what to do.

104
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,440
Ah, I see.

105
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,359
You're acting like this
because of your parents.

106
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,160
Whatever.

107
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:36,199
They were controlling over you, so you ran away,
and now you act like your parents don't exist.

108
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,960
You act like you hate them,
but you don't.

109
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
You just feel guilty.

110
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,680
I do hate them.

111
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,850
I don't think so.

112
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,600
I think you miss them.

113
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,850
But you just don't want to deal with that,
so instead, you act like this crazy person.

114
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,480
Look, I ran away to help aang.

115
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:52,279
You know what?

116
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,400
It doesn't matter.

117
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:56,039
These scams put us all at risk,
and we don't need that.

118
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,159
We've already got
some third-eyed freak after us.

119
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Speaking of
that third-eyed freak

120
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I think I've come up
with a name for him.

121
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,520
What do you think of
"sparky-sparky boom man"?

122
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,800
Just think about it.

123
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,970
We have enough money.

124
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,240
You need to stop this.

125
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,720
I'll stop when I want to stop,
and not when you tell me.

126
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,850
Speaking of money,
I'm off to spend some.

127
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,970
See you guys later.

128
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,240
Hawky, welcome to team avatar.

129
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,350
My name's sokka,
and I'm your new owner

130
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:39,519
and as such I should warn you
that there's already a lemur in our group

131
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,880
so I don't want
to see any fighting.

132
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,679
Good "wittle" messenger hawky.

133
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,360
Who's got pretty feathers?

134
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,159
You're right, hawky.

135
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,210
This is bad.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,320
Toph, when I was in town,
I found something that you're not gonna like.

137
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,400
Well, it sounds like
a sheet of paper

138
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:17,199
but I guess you're referring
to what's on the sheet of paper.

139
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,680
It's a wanted poster, of you.

140
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,000
They've nicknamed you
"the runaway."

141
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,200
A wanted poster.

142
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,160
That's so great.

143
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,290
The runaway.

144
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,560
I love my new nickname.

145
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:28,799
Is there a picture of me?

146
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,850
Does it look good?

147
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:35,119
Well, yeah, actually,
it does look pretty good.

148
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,960
But toph,
you're missing the point.

149
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,400
Maybe katara was right.

150
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,719
These scams are drawing
too much attention to us.

151
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
Don't be such a worrywart
like your sister.

152
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,399
Think of it this way.

153
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,680
Now you have plenty of money
to help with the invasion plan.

154
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Well, that is true.

155
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,440
I had this idea
of making armor for appa.

156
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,920
Here's a little extra so you can get
yourself a nice map of the fire nation.

157
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,439
You know what?

158
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,920
Make it an atlas.

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,440
I do like expensive atlases.

160
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,960
Of course you do, and that's why this wanted
poster is going to stay our little secret.

161
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,920
Sokka, tell me
you didn't buy a bird.

162
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,440
Not just a bird.

163
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,800
A messenger bird.

164
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:21,959
Now we can send messages
all over the world, even to gran-gran.

165
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,080
Wow, how does it work?

166
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,360
Hm, uh, I never actually
thought about that.

167
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,400
Hawky, gran-gran, South pole.

168
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,810
I think he gets it.

169
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,920
Hawky, make nice.

170
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,090
Bad hawky.

171
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,640
Well, look who decided
to join us.

172
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,000
Where have you two been?

173
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:50,799
Off scamming again?

174
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
Yes, we were.

175
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,110
And I suppose you don't think
what you're doing is dangerous at all?

176
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,170
No, I don't.

177
00:11:58,171 --> 00:11:59,159
Really?

178
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Yes, really.

179
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Well then, what's this?

180
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,600
I don't know.

181
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,910
I mean, seriously,
what's with you people?

182
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,970
I'm blind.

183
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,680
It's a wanted poster of you.

184
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,920
The runaway.

185
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,359
Is that what you're called now?

186
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,560
Are you proud of this?

187
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:14,759
Where did you get that?

188
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,999
It doesn't matter
where I got it.

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,679
The fact is...

190
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,679
You went through my stuff.

191
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,240
You had no right.

192
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,839
Your stuff was messy,
and I was just straightening up

193
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,519
and I happened
to stumble across it.

194
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,960
That's a lie.

195
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,520
You're lying, katara.

196
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Fine, it's a lie,
but you've been so out of control lately

197
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,280
I knew something was up.

198
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,800
I knew you were
hiding something, and you were.

199
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Don't you walk away from me
while I'm talking to you.

200
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,120
Oh, really, mom?

201
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:40,439
Or what are you going to do?

202
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,490
Send me to my room?

203
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,880
I wish I could.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,370
Well, you can't, because you're
not my mom and you're not their mom.

205
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,560
I never said I was.

206
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,720
No, but you certainly
act like it.

207
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:53,839
You think it's your job
to boss everyone around, but it's not.

208
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,520
You're just a regular kid like the rest of
us, so stop acting like you can tell me what to do.

209
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,640
I can do whatever I want.

210
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,200
I don't act that way.

211
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,240
Sokka, do I act motherly?

212
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,120
Hey, I'm staying
out of this one.

213
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,199
What do you think, aang?

214
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,560
Do I act like a mom?

215
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,730
Well, I...

216
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:13,919
Stop rubbing your eye
and speak clearly when you talk.

217
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,919
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,120
I can't be around you right now.

219
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,280
Well, I can't be around you.

220
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:23,159
I know, hawky.

221
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,660
Why can't they just get along?

222
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,290
Hey, aang, you want to test out
my messenger hawk with me?

223
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,399
I've got an idea.

224
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Sure.

225
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,800
I'm gonna send a note to katara
and say it's from toph, who wants to apologize.

226
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,800
Then everyone
will be friends again.

227
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,400
I got to say, sokka,
you continue to impress me with your ideas.

228
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,120
Eh, it's a gift.

229
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,320
Dear katara.

230
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,240
Sorry for everything.

231
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,370
Your friend, toph.

232
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,440
I know this is from you, sokka.

233
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,200
Toph can't write.

234
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,960
Ugh, you're all
driving me crazy.

235
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,039
I can't believe we forgot
toph can't write.

236
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,440
Yep, we're idiots.

237
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,280
I guess plan b is, we send a note
to toph pretending it's from katara.

238
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,710
I think we're gonna run into
a similar problem.

239
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,400
Sorry, hawky.

240
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:27,759
Looks like I'm gonna have to
do this without your help.

241
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,320
Come on, we need to talk.

242
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,840
So let me guess.

243
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,719
You brought me out here
to tell me your sister's

244
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,040
not as annoying as
I make her out to be.

245
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,720
Nah, she's pretty much a pain.

246
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,879
She's always got
to be right about everything

247
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,120
and she gets all bossy,
and involved, and in your business.

248
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,760
Yeah, I don't know how
you can deal with it.

249
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,320
Actually, in a way,
I rely on it.

250
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,520
I don't understand.

251
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,440
When our mom died, that was
the hardest time in my life.

252
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,320
Our family was a mess,
but katara, she had so much strength.

253
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,480
She stepped up and took on
so much responsibility.

254
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,120
She helped fill the void
that was left by our mom.

255
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,520
I guess I never
thought about that.

256
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,800
I'm gonna tell you
something crazy.

257
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
I never told anyone this before

258
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,880
but honestly, I'm not sure I can
remember what my mother looked like.

259
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,000
It really seems like, my whole life,
katara's been the one looking out for me.

260
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,840
She's always been the one
that's there, and now

261
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,080
when I try to remember
my mom, katara's is the only face I can picture.

262
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,320
The truth is, sometimes katara does act
motherly, but that's not always a bad thing.

263
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,040
She's compassionate and kind,
and she actually cares about me.

264
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,160
You know, the real me.

265
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,640
That's more than my own mom.

266
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Don't ever tell her
I said any of this.

267
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,160
Hey, my lips are sealed.

268
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,800
Hi, toph.

269
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,799
Um, I want to...

270
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,839
Katara, stop.

271
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,280
You don't need to apologize.

272
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
I was the one being stupid.

273
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,960
These scams are out of control,
and I'm done with them.

274
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,520
Actually, I wasn't going
to apologize.

275
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,360
I was gonna say,
I want to pull a scam with you.

276
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,639
What?

277
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,080
You want to pull a scam?

278
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,560
Not just any scam.

279
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,760
The ultimate scam.

280
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,000
What do you say, toph?

281
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,130
Just me and you.

282
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,600
One last go.

283
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:33,679
You in?

284
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,080
You know I'm in.

285
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,240
Now what's this idea of yours?

286
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,320
This wanted poster says
you're worth a lot of money

287
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,040
10 times more than
you've made in all your scams

288
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,280
so I'm gonna turn you in
and collect the reward.

289
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,430
Then you metalbend yourself
out of jail, and we're on our way.

290
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,840
How could you do this to me?

291
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,010
You betrayed me.

292
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,800
You brought this on yourself.

293
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,930
I had no choice.

294
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,520
You did the right thing
by turning in the runaway.

295
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,160
The right thing
is its own reward.

296
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,720
Well, I'm happy
to hear you say that.

297
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,960
But I still want
the actual reward.

298
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:21,999
Of course.

299
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,050
Right this way.

300
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,040
Hey, what kind of cell is this?

301
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,170
A wooden one.

302
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,920
That's her.

303
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,910
That's the girl
you were looking for.

304
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,520
Do you think this scam of theirs
should be taking this long?

305
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,410
I was just wondering
the same thing.

306
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,680
We'd better check it out.

307
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:08,239
You two behave.

308
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,320
Appa's in charge.

309
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,040
Wait, it's a trap.

310
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,519
Really?

311
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,680
No kidding.

312
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,600
Is that why we're sitting
in a wooden cage right now?

313
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,040
Gee, how'd you figure out
it was a trap?

314
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,520
Not for us, katara.

315
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,840
We're the bait.

316
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,680
He wants aang.

317
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,680
I can't believe I was so stupid.

318
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,520
See, this is exactly why
I'm against these scams.

319
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,040
I knew this would happen.

320
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
But this was your idea.

321
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,370
I know.

322
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,360
I wanted to show you
that I'm not so motherly.

323
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,440
I wanted to show you
that I can have fun too.

324
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,600
Katara, you are fun.

325
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,760
If nothing else, you're at least
fun to argue with.

326
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,960
I know your relationship with
your parents is complicated

327
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,400
and I shouldn't have said
what I said.

328
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,999
It's ok.

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I was really mad when you said that
because, well, because maybe it's true.

330
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,680
I try not to think about it,
but when I left, I probably really hurt them.

331
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,960
Where do you think
they might be?

332
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,480
Where do you think anyone is?

333
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,160
Sokka, watch out.

334
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,960
It's sparky-sparky boom man.

335
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,050
You know, I'm starting to think
that name doesn't quite fit.

336
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:51,199
What are we gonna do?

337
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,999
I don't know.

338
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,519
I wish we had
some earth or water.

339
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,279
We need bendables.

340
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,960
What about your meteor bracelet?

341
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,400
You could make a saw.

342
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,960
I left it back at camp.

343
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,080
I was worried
they would take it.

344
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,800
Um, katara?

345
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,960
Are you ok?

346
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,079
Just fine.

347
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,360
Well, what are you doing?

348
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,280
I'm making my own water.

349
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,360
Katara, you're a genius.

350
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,080
A sweaty, stinky genius.

351
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,440
This guy is too good.

352
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,520
He shoots fire from his brain.

353
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,720
We should split up.

354
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,960
He can't chase us both.

355
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,680
Aang, get up.

356
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,880
Let's get out of here.

357
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,200
Hey, I got it.

358
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,840
The perfect name for that guy.

359
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:49,999
Combustion man.

360
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,160
Good job, sokka.

361
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:54,079
Now let's get out of here before
combustion man catches us.

362
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,799
See?

363
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,850
It fits so well.

364
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,840
Well, I'm exhausted.

365
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,880
Hawky, how about you, buddy?

366
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,920
Yeah, you're such
a lazy little bird.

367
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,960
Katara, I need your help.

368
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,480
What is it, toph?

369
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,710
I need you to write
some things down for me.

370
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,800
I want to send
a letter to my parents.

371
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,800
I'll be happy to help.

372
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,160
