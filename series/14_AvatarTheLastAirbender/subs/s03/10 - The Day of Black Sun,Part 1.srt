<i>Earth</i>

00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:06,739
<i>Fire</i>

00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:08,207
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,044
<i>Long ago the four nations lived
together in harmony</i>

6
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:17,532
<i>Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:21,749
<i>Only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,056
<i>But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:28,824
<i>100 years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar,</i>

10
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:31,066
<i>an airbender named Aang</i>

11
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,474
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great</i>

12
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,135
<i>He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:40,127
<i>But I believe Aang
can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,567
We won't be able
to mount a massive invasion

15
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:51,912
without the earth king's armies.

16
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:55,574
But the solar eclipse will still leave
the Firenation vulnerable.

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,686
So we're planning a smaller invasion.

18
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:01,086
Just a rack-tack team of our friends
and allies from around the Earth Kingdom.

19
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:03,755
It's better for now
that no one knows that I'm alive.

20
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,364
You used to be the pride of the Firenation.

21
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:09,488
Now look at you.

22
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,491
Look what you've become.

23
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:14,918
Look, you guys keep telling me
I need to sleep.

24
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:17,708
But I can't.
The invasion is tomorrow.

25
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:20,272
You've been training for this
since the day we met.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,511
You can do this.
You're ready.

27
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,797
During the meeting
I was the perfect prince.

28
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,655
The son my father wanted.

29
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:28,135
But I wasn't me.

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,014
Evil and good are always
at war inside you, Zuko.

31
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:33,660
It is your nature.

32
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:38,613
Your legacy. Born in you
along with all the strive

33
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:43,013
is the power to restore balance
to the world.

34

37
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:05,157
Top of the morning, Momo.
- Sounds like you slept well.

38
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,491
Like a baby moose line
I'm ready to face the Firelord.

39
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:11,061
So what's your strategy
for taking him down?

40
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:14,473
Gonna get your glow on and hit him
with a little avatar state action?

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,219
I can't. When Azula shot me
with lightening

42
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,199
my seventh chakra was locked.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,682
Cutting off my connection
to all the cosmic energy in the universe.

44
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,378
You know what I just heard?

45
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,293
Blabla... spiritual... mombo jumbo
blabla... something about space.

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,343
Oh no, Sokka, do you think
the fog will delay the invasion?

47
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,667
No, that is the invasion.

48
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:49,630
You made it, dad.

49
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:52,246
Were you able to locate everybody
I told you to find?

50
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:55,279
I did. But I'm a little worried, Sokka.

51
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,157
Some of these man aren't
exactly the warrior type.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,370
This place ain't nothing like a swamp.

53
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:04,362
What you recon that is?

54
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:07,444
Some sort of Firenation exploding trap
would eat you.

55
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,572
It's just a rock, dude.

56
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:11,562
Well, I'll be.

57
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:15,422
Is it just me or are those fellows
a little lose in the leafhead.

58
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:17,819
I just wish they would wear pants.

59
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:22,905
Pants are an illusion
and so is death.

60
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,110
Hi, Katara.

61
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:30,232
Haru, it's so good to see you.

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,369
Toph, this is Haru. When we met him
his town was controlled by the Firenation.

63
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,960
So, he had to hide his earthbending.

64
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:39,326
Katara inspired me and my father
to take back our village.

65
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,708
You helped us found our courage, Katara.
No we're here to help you.

66
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:48,621
No way, is that...

67
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,123
Hypo happy to see blind bandit.
- You guys here for a rematch?

68
00:03:54,124 --> 00:04:00,786
Negatory, the boulder and the hypo
no longer fight for others entertainment.

69
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:03,969
Now we fight for our kingdom.

70
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:05,860
Sweet.

71
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,893
Was that a new invention?

72
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:25,651
Yes, but unfortunately
the incendiary capabilities

73
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:28,559
of peanut sauce
proof to be a failure.

74
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:30,588
You're making peanut sauce bombs?

75
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:33,806
They are destructive
- And delicious.

76
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:38,631
Were you able to complete work
on the plans I send you?

77
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:43,533
Yes, I was and I think the Firenation
will be quite surprised.

78
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,254
Aang, my dad and I made this for you.

79
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,414
A new glider.
This is amazing.

80
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:56,778
And as a special feature
I added a snack compartment.

81
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm sure that will come in handy.

82
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:06,689
I bed you tired of being
in this cell, old man.

83
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:12,074
Well, too bad. You're never
stepping outside this walls again.

84
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:13,599
Breakfast.

85
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:18,925
Careful, Ming. Don't get too close.
His stantial will knock you right out.

86
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:25,468
I snuck in some yj tea.
I know you like rare teas.

87
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:33,044
Thank you, Ming. Ever since I was put
in here, you've very kind to me.

88
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:41,934
Don't worry.
You'll do great.

89
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:46,003
Good morning everyone.

90
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:54,958
As you know
today we're invading the Firenation.

91
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,739
I mean I know you know that because
otherwise why else would you be here?

92
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:00,425
Anyway...

93
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,426
The Firelord palace is here.

94
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:07,625
Uh, no, uh wait, uh wait,
uh wait, it's here.

95
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:10,887
There's an eclipse today
and Aang is gonna fight the Firelord.

96
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:13,480
And the firebenders
won't have any fire to use.

97
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:15,116
That's good for us.

98
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm sorry, let me start
at the beginning.

99
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,660
Katara and I discovered Aang
frozen in an Iceberg.

100
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,742
Now I didn't like Aang at first
but I grew to love him over time.

101
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:25,824
Then we went to the southern air temple
where Aang used to live.

102
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:27,752
And then we met Suki as an Kaoshi warrior.

103
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:31,536
When he says the beginning
he means the beginning beginning.

104
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:33,828
Got Haru arrested
and now he's wearing a moustache

105
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,470
which you feel looking
at the front row, you can see it.

106
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:38,481
Thank you, Sokka. It's okay,
why don't you take a break?

107
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:42,465
Let me just clarify
a few points for everyone.

108
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:45,100
Today is the day of black sun.

109
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:49,323
And I want to thank you all
for your self sacrifice and your courage.

110
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:54,253
There are two steps to the invasion.
A naval stage and then a land stage.

111
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:57,370
To gain access to the Firenation capital

112
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:00,898
we have to get past
our first major obstacle here

113
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,405
The great gates of Azula.

114
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,181
Next, we hit the land and we hit hard.

115
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:09,815
We must fight past their battlements
and secure the plaza tower.

116
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,811
Once we do that,
it's up to the royal palace.

117
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:19,775
At that point the eclipse will begin.
- Excuse me, the boulder is confused.

118
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:23,391
Isn't the point
to invade during the eclipse,

119
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:26,183
when the firebenders are powerless?

120
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:30,058
The eclipse will only last eight minutes,
not enough time for the whole invasion.

121
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:33,100
And the royal palace
is heavily guarded by firebenders.

122
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:36,209
So, that's where we'll need
the eclipse advantage the most.

123
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,047
When this is finished,
the avatar will have defeated the Firelord.

124
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:47,509
We'll have control over the Firenation
capital and this war will be over.

125
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:53,419
We've been looking everywhere for you.
The boats are ready to leave.

126
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,259
I messed up Aang.
- What?

127
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,996
The invasionplan was my moment of truth.
And I completely flopped it.

128
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:03,604
I just fell apart.

129
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:08,272
That speech wasn't your moment of truth.
That was just public speaking.

130
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,260
And nobody is really good at that.

131
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:14,523
My dad is, he explained the perfectly
and inspired everyone.

132
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:16,279
Like a real leader should.

133
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:20,027
Your moment of truth isn't going to be
in front some map.

134
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,673
It is going to be out there,
on the battlefield.

135
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:26,516
You seem so confident about everything,
how do you know we're gonna to win?

136
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:29,515
Because I already failed the world
once at BaSing se.

137
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,051
I won't let myself fail again.

138
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:42,765
There they are, the great gates of Azula.
- I don't see any gates.

139
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:46,511
Katara, you and the swamp benders
whip up a fog cover.

140
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:51,525
We'll sneak by them statues just like
we sneaked by that fire navy blockade.

141
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,520
Keep it up, we’re almost through.

142
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,912
Everyone to low deck.

143
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:41,639
Let's hope your invention works.

144
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:10,001
No one is onboard, sir.
- Where did they go?

145
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,380
You really had done yourself
this time, son.

146
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,286
Yeah, congratulations, Sokka.
You managed to invent...

147
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,988
a worse way of traveling than flying.

148
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,437
Helmet?

149
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,135
I just came up with the idea.
The mechanist did all the work.

150
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:37,310
Don't sell yourself short, my boy.

151
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:42,980
It was your idea to use waterbending
to make the subs sink and float.

152
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:49,237
Brilliant, Though your original designs
were a bit difficult to decipher.

153
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,852
Unfortunately, there's one problem
I couldn't fix.

154
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:55,660
The subs have a limited air supply.

155
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:59,622
Before we land on the beaches
we'll need to resurface.

156
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,056
Lunch time, general Iroh.

157
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:07,645
And this time I brought you
an extra bowl of rice.

158
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:08,684
Thank you, Ming.

159
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:15,625
Your little gestures of kindness
have made my days in prison bearable.

160
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:19,501
I think you should take
the rest of the day off.

161
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:22,733
What?
- You don't look well.

162
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:25,975
Maybe you should go home and rest.

163
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,896
No, I feel fine.

164
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:33,865
Trust me, it is better
that you are not here this afternoon.

165
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,972
So, this is it.

166
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:55,707
Are you ready for the Firenation
to know the avatar is alive?

167
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,552
I'm ready.

168
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,772
I hope you kick
some serious Firelord but, twinkletoes.

169
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,569
Everyone, listen up. The next time
we resurface it will be on the beaches.

170
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:11,349
So stay alert and fight smart.

171
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:14,761
Now break time is over,
back in the subs.

172
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:22,437
Aang...
- Katara, I...

173
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:24,637
You go first.

174
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:27,795
We've been through
so many things together

175
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:30,414
and I've seen you grow up so much.

176
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:34,174
You're not that little goofy kid
I found in the iceberg anymore.

177
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:38,191
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
I'm really proud of you.

178
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,074
Everything is going to be different
after today, isn't it?

179
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:51,545
What if I don't come back.
- Aang, don't say that. Of course you...

180
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:06,125
Katara, what are you doing?
It's time to submerge.

181
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,976
What? Right, I'm on it.

182
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:30,549
I'm sorry, Mai.

183
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:48,269
What do you know?
It did come in handy.

184
00:14:59,149 --> 00:14:59,953
Everyone in position.

185
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,671
Earthbenders, in your tanks.
This is going to be a rough ride.

186
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,303
Ready, the torpedo.

187
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,797
Launch!

188
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:57,426
We're a man dale.
Where a tornation is you!

189
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:17,382
Hey, you.
Where have you been?

190
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:23,964
Communing with nature.
It takes while to collect this much seaweed.

191
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:42,292
Dad, look out!

192
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,759
Sokka, we've got to take out
those battlements. It's our only chance.

193
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,923
I've got an idea.

194
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:41,729
You two take out that battlement.
I got this one. Watch each other’s backs.

195
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,130
Dad?
- Dad!

196
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:20,610
I know I've made some bad choices.

197
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:24,491
But today I'm gonna set things right.

198
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,581
How does that feel, Dad?

199
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:52,559
A little better,
I need to get back to the troops.

200
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,842
You're hurt, badly.
You can't fight anymore.

201
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:59,926
Everyone is counting on me
to lead this mission, Katara.

202
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:03,316
I won't let them down.

203
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:10,090
Can't you heal him any faster?
- I'm doing everything I can.

204
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:13,691
I'll do it.

205
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:17,723
No offence, Sokka. But you're not
exactly Mr. healing hands.

206
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:22,101
No, I'll lead the invasion force.
- Don't be crazy, Sokka.

207
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,327
Maybe I'm a little crazy,
but the eclipse is about to start...

208
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,099
and we need to be up the volcano
by the time it does.

209
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,326
You can do this.

210
00:21:30,594 --> 00:21:32,721
I'm proud of you, Son.

211
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:37,548
I still think you crazy.
But I'm proud of you too.

212
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:03,491
Listen up everyone,
I want the tanks in wedge formation.

213
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:05,389
Warriors and benders in the middle.

214
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:09,941
We're taking that tower
and heading for the royal palace.

215
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:19,871
CHARGE!

216
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,254
That's strange.

217
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:47,918
The avatar is back!

218
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:54,651
Hello?

219
00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:57,308
Anyone home?
