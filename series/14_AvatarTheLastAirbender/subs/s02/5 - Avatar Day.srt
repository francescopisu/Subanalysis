00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:03,021
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:04,895
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:07,004
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:08,296
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of
all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang
can save the world.</i>

14
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:13,106
What are you doing in my mouth?!

15
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:18,596
Momo, you need to be a little
more sensitive to my boundaries.

16
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:28,016
Give up! You're completely surrounded!

17
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:31,511
Come on, come on, come on!

18
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:34,369
My scrolls!

19
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:37,821
My staff!

20
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,948
Yip, yip!

21
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:08,975
Wait, my boomerang!

22
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:10,171
There's no time!

23
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:13,602
Oh, I see. There's time to get your
scrolls and time to get your staff, ...

24
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,304
but no time for my boomerang?

25
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,427
That's correct!

26
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:18,860
Oh.

27
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,424
Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.

28
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,021
I feel like I've lost part of my identity.

29
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:33,845
Imagine if you lost your arrow,
or if Katara lost her... hair loopies.

30
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,884
Here's your produce, ponytail guy.

31
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:41,326
I used to be boomerang guy...

32
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,429
Hey, Water Tribe money.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,909
I hope that's okay.

34
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:49,338
So long as it's money.

35
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:52,782
Have a nice Avatar Day!

36
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:54,180
Avatar Day?

37
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:57,941
You guys are going to the festival, right?

38
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:07,277
There's a holiday for the Avatar. Who knew?

39
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:11,443
Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float.

40
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,023
And here comes Avatar Roku.

41
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,620
Having a huge festival in
your honor is great, ...

42
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:21,505
but frankly, it's just
nice to be appreciated.

43
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:25,110
And it's nice to appreciate
their deep-fried festival food.

44
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,522
Aang, look!

45
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:29,787
That's the biggest me I've ever seen.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,326
Now a torch, that's a nice prop.
It's bright, dangerous... smells manly.

47
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:44,837
But I'm not sure I could carry it off.

48
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,926
Hey, what's that guy doing?

49
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:57,727
Down with the Avatar! Down with
the Avatar! Down with the Avatar!

50
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:27,167
Where did you get these?

51
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:30,728
What does it matter where they came from?

52
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:39,329
Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar!

53
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:56,172
Hey! That party-pooper's
ruining Avatar Day!

54
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:59,604
That party-pooper's my friend!

55
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,374
It's the Avatar himself!

56
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,596
It's going to kill us
with its awesome Avatar powers!

57
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,891
No, I'm not, I...

58
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:13,912
I suggest you leave. You're
not welcome here, Avatar.

59
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:16,525
Why not? Aang helps people.

60
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,285
It's true. I'm on your side.

61
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:24,875
I find that hard to swallow considering
what you did to us in your past life.

62
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:30,352
It was Avatar Kyoshi, she murdered
our glorious leader, Chin the Great.

63
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:33,460
You think that I... murdered someone?

64
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:38,351
We used to be a great society before
you killed our leader. Now look at us!

65
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:39,210
Huh!

66
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:41,443
Aang would never do something like that.

67
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:45,800
No Avatar would. And it's not
fair for you all to question his honor!

68
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:50,766
Let's tell her what we
think of the Avatar's "honor."

69
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:55,950
Give me a chance to clear my name.

70
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:00,607
The only way to prove your
innocence is to stand trial.

71
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,822
I'll gladly stand trial.

72
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:08,179
You'll have to follow all our rules.
That includes paying bail.

73
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:10,821
No problem!

74
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:15,351
How was I supposed to know they
wouldn't take Water Tribe money?

75
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,560
So some people don't like you. Big deal!

76
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:23,132
There's a whole nation
of firebenders who hate you.

77
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,088
Now let's bust you out of here.

78
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,151
I can't.

79
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:29,948
Sure you can! A little...
swish, swish, swish!

80
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:33,347
Airbending slice! ... and we're on our way.

81
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:36,142
I think what "Master
Swish" is trying to say...

82
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:38,600
is that you're supposed
to be out saving the world.

83
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:40,702
You can't do that locked up in here.

84
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,869
I can't do that with people
thinking I'm a murderer, either.

85
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:46,283
I need you guys to help prove my innocence.

86
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:50,242
How're we gonna do that? The crime
happened over three hundred years ago.

87
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:55,352
That's okay, Sokka. For some reason,
I thought you were an expert detective.

88
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:59,412
Well, I guess I could
be classified as such.

89
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:05,363
Yeah! Back home he was famous for solving
the mystery of the missing seal jerky.

90
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,724
Everyone wanted to blame
it on a polar leopard...

91
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,431
but I figured out that it was Old
Man Jarco wearing polar leopard boots.

92
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:15,279
See, a real eight hundred pound polar
leopard would have left much deeper tracks.

93
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,633
Okay, I guess I am pretty good.

94
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:20,434
So you'll help me with my case?

95
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:24,772
Fine. But I'm gonna need some new props.

96
00:07:24,783 --> 00:07:27,731
I'm ready.

97
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:29,565
What?

98
00:07:58,557 --> 00:08:02,194
This is the crime scene.

99
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:10,078
This is the footprint
of the killer, Kyoshi.

100
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:15,691
It was at sunset three hundred
and seventy years ago today...

101
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:20,570
that she emerged from the temple
and struck down Chin the Great.

102
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:26,918
After that tragic day, we built this
statue to immortalize our great leader.

103
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,339
Feel free to appreciate it.

104
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:41,386
This temple and this statue
were cut from the same stone.

105
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:45,121
And we know that the statue
was built after Chin died.

106
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,735
So if they were built
at the same time, that means...

107
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:54,302
Shhh! I wanna solve it! That means
Kyoshi never set foot in this temple.

108
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,716
That's a big hole in the
mayor's story, but...

109
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:59,499
it's not enough to
prove Aang's innocence.

110
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,985
You're right.

111
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:06,844
We need to go to Kyoshi Island.

112
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:10,248
Where'd you get that?

113
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:16,728
You got a bald head...

114
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:19,610
some nice tattoos...

115
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:26,171
You're going to fit in
real well around here.

116
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,651
Where's Aangy?

117
00:09:56,658 --> 00:09:59,573
He couldn't be here, Koko.

118
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:02,255
I wanted to see Aangy...

119
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:15,316
Oyagi! Aang is in jail.

120
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:19,051
The town of Chin says he murdered
their leader in a past life.

121
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:21,071
They say it was Kyoshi.

122
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:25,262
Kyoshi? That's crazy talk!
I'll take you to her shrine.

123
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:29,882
Maybe something there
will help you clear her name.

124
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:35,071
So, uh... what's Suki up to? Is she around?

125
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,874
Actually, she and the other
warriors left to fight in the war.

126
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:41,393
You kids had a big impact on Suki.

127
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:45,717
She said you inspired her and
she wanted to help change the world.

128
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:49,937
Oh, well... that's great.

129
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,578
This temple was converted
into a shrine to Kyoshi.

130
00:10:54,585 --> 00:11:00,923
The clerics tell us these relics are still
connected to her spirit. That's her kimono.

131
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:02,675
She had exquisite taste.

132
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:03,833
Please don't touch.

133
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:07,451
These fans... they were her weapons, no?

134
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,629
Also refrain from touching the fans.

135
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:14,919
These were her boots? Her
feet must have been enormous!

136
00:11:14,932 --> 00:11:18,201
The biggest of any Avatar.

137
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,994
Wait a minute... big feet?

138
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:23,348
Little footprints? There's no way...

139
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:29,678
Ahem. Special outfit? Hat and pipe?
These things mean anything to you?

140
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:32,913
You're right. I'm sorry. Please.

141
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:37,389
Aha! There's no way Kyoshi
could have made that footprint...

142
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:41,329
and therefore there is nothing
linking her to the crime scene!

143
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,291
Brilliant, Sokka.

144
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:51,629
This girl you're talking about? She'll come around.
You just gotta hang in there.

145
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:52,740
You think so?

146
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:53,355
Sure!

147
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:53,895
Yeah.

148
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,084
You're a catch.

149
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:56,461
I don't know...

150
00:11:56,467 --> 00:12:02,835
Hey! You're smart, handsome, funny,
not to mention you're the Avatar.

151
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:04,397
You guys are great.

152
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:09,126
Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel.

153
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:14,368
This piece is called "The Birth of Kyoshi."

154
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:18,270
It was painted at sunrise
on the day this island was founded.

155
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,777
Why, it was today, in fact,
three hundred and seventy years ago.

156
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:27,410
Three hundred and seventy years.
.. wait, are you sure it was today?

157
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:32,111
Oh, seeing how it's Kyoshi
Day, yes, I'm sure.

158
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:34,752
This ceremony didn't take
place at sunrise, ...

159
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:38,635
it took place at sunset.
Look at the shadows.

160
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:42,257
They point east. So the
sun must have been in the west.

161
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:43,778
So what?

162
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:46,044
If Kyoshi was in the
ceremony at sunset, ...

163
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:53,507
she couldn't have been in Chin
committing the crime. She has an alibi!

164
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:57,248
Honorable mayor, we've prepared
a solid defense for the Avatar.

165
00:12:57,257 --> 00:13:00,862
We did an investigation and
found some very strong evidence.

166
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:05,041
Evidence? Hmph! That's
not how our court system works.

167
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,563
Then how can I prove my innocence?

168
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,847
Simple. I say what happened
and then you say what happened...

169
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:15,350
and then I decide the who's right.

170
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:21,416
That's why we call it justice.
Because it's "just us."

171
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:29,524
Everyone loved Chin the
Great because he was so great.

172
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:35,112
Then the Avatar showed up and
killed him! And that's how it happened.

173
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:40,629
The accused will now present its argument.

174
00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:43,506
You can do it, Aang.
Just remember the evidence.

175
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:48,508
Right... evidence.
Ladies and gentlemen, ...

176
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:51,052
I'm about to tell you
what really happened.

177
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:58,174
And I will prove it with facts.
Fact number one... Uh...

178
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,974
The footprints!

179
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:06,381
Oh, yeah...
You see, I have very large feet.

180
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:13,181
Furthermore, your...
temple matches your statue.

181
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:18,315
But... I was in a painting at sunset.

182
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:22,133
So there you have it! I'm not guilty!

183
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:25,954
He's dead.

184
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:31,836
Looks like you did some serious shopping.
But where did you get the money?

185
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:33,784
Do you like your new teapot?

186
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:37,485
To be honest with you, the
best tea tastes delicious...

187
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:42,503
whether it comes in
a porcelain pot or a tin cup.

188
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:45,969
I know we've had some
difficult times lately.

189
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:49,344
We've had to struggle just to get by.

190
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:55,439
But it's nothing to be ashamed of.
There is a simple honor in poverty.

191
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:58,038
There's no honor for me without the Avatar.

192
00:14:58,051 --> 00:15:03,502
Zuko... Even if you did
capture the Avatar, ...

193
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:08,775
I'm not so sure it would
solve our problems. Not now.

194
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:10,549
Then there is no hope at all.

195
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:14,628
No, Zuko!
You must never give in to despair.

196
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:21,259
Allow yourself to slip down that road
and you surrender to your lowest instincts.

197
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:27,060
In the darkest times, hope
is something you give yourself.

198
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:31,911
That is the meaning of inner strength.

199
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:44,564
Mayor Tong, I'd like for the
court to hear one last testimony.

200
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:50,994
I've already told you! It's just me and the accused.
You can't call any witnesses.

201
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:58,975
This isn't just any witness.
I'm going to call. .. Avatar Kyoshi herself!

202
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:08,029
What are you doing?

203
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:13,474
Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe
wearing her stuff will trigger something.

204
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:16,868
I do believe in the power of stuff.

205
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:19,311
This is a mockery of Chin law!

206
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,099
Please! If you could just wait one
more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here.

207
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:29,868
Hey, everybody. Avatar Kyoshi here.

208
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:39,940
This is ridiculous. For the murder of Chin
the Great, this court finds the Avatar...

209
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:51,446
I killed Chin the Conqueror.

210
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:58,907
A horrible tyrant, Chin was expanding
his army to all corners of the continent.

211
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:01,847
When they came to the neck
of the peninsula where we lived, ...

212
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,693
he demanded our immediate surrender.

213
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:09,397
I warned him that I would not sit
passively and while he took our home, ...

214
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,618
but he did not back down.

215
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:24,170
On that day, we split from the mainland.

216
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:11,479
I created Kyoshi Island so my
people could be safe from invaders.

217
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:23,205
So... what just happened?

218
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:27,549
Uhh... you kind of confessed. Sorry.

219
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:35,737
And I find you guilty! Bring
out the wheel of punishment!

220
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:44,584
Uncle, I thought a lot about what you said.

221
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:47,010
You did? Good, good.

222
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,668
It's helped me realize something.

223
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,990
We no longer have anything
to gain by traveling together.

224
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:56,361
I need to find my own way.

225
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,269
Wait!

226
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:26,345
The accused will now spin the wheel
of punishment to determine his sentence.

227
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,611
I said I would face justice, so I will.

228
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,224
Come on, torture machine!

229
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:39,262
Eaten by bears!

230
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,260
Razor pit!

231
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:45,002
Community service! Please
stop on community service.

232
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,667
Looks like it's "boiled in oil."

233
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:07,625
We've come to claim this
village for the Fire Lord!

234
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:11,863
Now show me your leader so I may...

235
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,142
dethrone him.

236
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:17,985
That's him over there!

237
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,909
You! Avatar! Do something!

238
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:26,194
Gee, I'd love to help, but
I'm supposed to be boiled in oil.

239
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:33,663
There! "Community service." Now serve
our community and get rid of those rhinos!

240
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,127
Rough Rhinos, to the town!

241
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:32,056
Boomerang! You do always come back!

242
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:25,495
From now on, we'll celebrate a new Avatar
Day in honor of the day Avatar Aang...

243
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:28,789
saved us from the Rough Rhino Invasion.

244
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,293
What is this?

245
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:35,124
That's our new festival
food, unfried dough.

246
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:44,883
May we eat it and be reminded of how on
this day the Avatar was not boiled in oil.

247
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:53,733
Happy Avatar Day, everyone.

248
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,226
This is by far the worst
town we've ever been to.

249
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:04,043
