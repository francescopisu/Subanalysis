1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,329
If I want to catch my
prey, I must be agile...nimble.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,460
I need a small, elite team.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,760
Even though I was born blind,
I've never had a problem seeing.

4
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:18,790
I see with earthbending.

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,459
You're gonna be a great teacher, Toph.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,449
I thought a lot about what you said

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,500
you did?

8
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,319
Good, good

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,720
we no longer have anything
to gain by traveling

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,643
I need to find my own way.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,590
Hey, you guys picked a great campsite.

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,000
The grass is so soft.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,050
That's not grass. Appa's shedding.

14
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,350
Oh, gross!

15
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:57,349
That's not gross; it's just
a part of spring. You know,

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,300
rebirth, flowers blooming,
and Appa gets a new coat!

17
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:03,290
Ah, the beauty of spring.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,420
Stop, Appa, stop!

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,620
It's not that bad, Katara.
It makes a great wig!

20
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:16,060
And a great beard!

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,950
I'm just glad we finally have another girl
in the group because you two are disgusting.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,610
Excuse me, does anyone have a razor?
..because I've got some hairy pits!

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,490
So, Toph, usually when setting
up camp we try to divide up the work.

24
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:53,490
Hey, don't worry about me, I'm good to go.

25
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:56,349
Well, actually, what I'm
trying to say is, uh,

26
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,170
some of us might fetch water while
someone else might set up the fire pit...

27
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:01,580
or put up the tent.

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,545
Even Momo does his fair share.

29
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,585
Katara, I'm fine.
I can carry my own weight.

30
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't need a fire, I've already
collected my own food, and look.

31
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,690
My tent's all set up.

32
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,500
Well, that's great for you,
but we still need to finish...

33
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:19,010
I don't understand.
What's the problem here?

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,640
Never mind.

35
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,970
Sorry

36
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,805
Hey Toph, I wanted to
apologize for earlier.

37
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:39,379
I think we're all just a little
tired and getting on each others' nerves.

38
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,740
Yeah, you do seem pretty tired.

39
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,850
I meant all of us.

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,270
Well, goodnight.

41
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:48,362
Goodnight.

42
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,090
There's something coming toward us!

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,490
What is it?

44
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,285
It feels like an avalanche...

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,580
But also not like an avalanche.

46
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,520
Your powers of perception are frightening.

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,890
Should we leave?

48
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,450
Better safe than sorry.

49
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,290
What is that thing?

50
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,720
Ahh, land, sweet land!

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,200
See you guys in the morning!

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,160
Actually, can you help us unload?

53
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,930
Really? You need me to help unload
Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?

54
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,420
Well, yeah.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,815
That and everything else.

56
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,229
You're a part of our team now and...

57
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,410
Look. I didn't ask you
to help unload my stuff.

58
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,739
I'm carrying my own weight.

59
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,130
That's not the point.

60
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,180
Ever since joining us you've been
nothing but selfish and unhelpful.

61
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,299
What?

62
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,299
Look here,

63
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,220
sugar queen, I gave up everything I had
so that I could teach Aang earthbending,

64
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:14,400
so don't you talk to me
about being selfish!

65
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,770
Sugar Queen!?

66
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,180
D-Did you just slam the door in my face!?

67
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:23,830
How can you be so infuriating!?

68
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,549
Should we...do something?

69
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,410
Hey, I'm just enjoying the show.

70
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,635
Okay, okay, you both need to calm down.

71
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,600
Both? I'm completely calm!

72
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,280
I... can see that.

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,800
The stars sure are beautiful tonight.
Too bad you can't see them, Toph!

74
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,050
Hey, how is a guy supposed to sleep
with all this yelling and earthquaking!?

75
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,210
That thing is back!

76
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,380
Well, how far away is it? Maybe we
can close our eyes just for a few minutes.

77
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,620
I don't think so, Sokka.

78
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,410
Seriously, what is that thing?

79
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,950
And how does it keep finding us?

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,110
I don't know, but this time
I'm going to make sure we lose 'em.

81
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,900
Okay, forget about setting up camp.

82
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,515
I'm finding the softest
pile of dirt and going to sleep.

83
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,495
That's good, because Toph
wasn't going to help anyway.

84
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,765
Oh, I didn't realize baby still
need someone to tuck her in bed.

85
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,000
Come on guys, there's something after us
and we don't even know what or who it is.

86
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:56,360
It could be Zuko. We haven't
seen him since the North Pole.

87
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:57,445
Who's Zuko?

88
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,130
Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail
who's tracked us all over the world.

89
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:04,640
What's wrong with ponytails, ponytail?

90
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:08,065
This is a warrior's wolf tail.

91
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,890
Well, it certainly tells the other
warriors that you're fun and perky!

92
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,139
Anyway, whoever's chasing us, they couldn't have
followed us here. So... now would everyone...

93
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,190
just...sshhh!

94
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,520
No, Momo, ssh! Sleepy time.

95
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,715
Aww, don't tell me?

96
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,310
That's impossible.

97
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,614
There's no way they could have tracked us.

98
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:37,850
I can feel it with my own two feet!

99
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,810
Let's get out of here!

100
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:47,269
Maybe we should face them.

101
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,050
Find out who they are. Who
knows, maybe they're friendly.

102
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,060
Always the optimist.

103
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,339
It's those three girls from Omashu!

104
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:20,609
We can take 'em. Three on three.

105
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,639
Actually, Toph, there's four of us.

106
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:26,909
Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't count you.
You know, no bending and all.

107
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,259
I can still fight!

108
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:31,179
Okay. Three on three plus Sokka.

109
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,219
Well, we wanted to find out who they were.
We found out. Now let's get out of here.

110
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,369
Appa, yip yip!

111
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:08,479
I can't believe those girls
followed us all the way from Omashu.

112
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,979
I still think we could've taken them.

113
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,389
Are you kidding me?

114
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:16,159
The crazy blue firebending and
the flying daggers are bad enough,

115
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,909
but last time we saw them one of those girls
did something that took my bending away.

116
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,319
That's scary.

117
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:27,009
Oh no, the sun is rising! We've
been up all night with no sleep.

118
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,949
Sokka, we'll be okay.

119
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,899
Are you sure!? I've never not slept before!

120
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:36,539
What if I fall asleep now and something
happens? And something always happens!

121
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,859
Every time we land, those girls are there,

122
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:41,134
so we'll just have to keep flying.

123
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,199
We can't keep flying forever.

124
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,949
So, what's the plan?

125
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:04,978
Don't know...too tired to think.

126
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:08,349
I'm sure we'll come up with
something after a short nap.

127
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:09,434
Yes!

128
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:11,319
Sleep!

129
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:16,869
What's going on!?

130
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,409
Appa fell asleep!

131
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:24,309
Wake up buddy!

132
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:43,049
Appa's exhausted.

133
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:46,918
Okay, we've put a lot of
distance between us and them.

134
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,764
The plan now is to follow
Appa's lead and get some sleep.

135
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,349
Of course, we could have gotten some sleep
earlier if Toph didn't have such issues.

136
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,969
What?

137
00:09:57,249 --> 00:10:01,199
Alright, alright! Everyone's exhausted.
Let's just get some rest.

138
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:04,629
No! I want to hear what Katara has to say.

139
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:06,429
You think I have issues?

140
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:11,318
I'm just saying, maybe if you helped out
earlier we could've set up our camp faster...

141
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,799
and gotten some sleep and then
maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!

142
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,529
You're blaming me for this!?

143
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,589
No, no! She's not blaming you!

144
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:22,859
No, I'm blaming her!

145
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:27,789
Hey, I never asked you for diddly doo da.
I carry my own weight!

146
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:31,449
Besides, if there's anyone
to blame, it's sheddy over here!

147
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:33,554
What? You're blaming Appa?

148
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:38,909
Yeah! You wanna know how they keep finding
us? He's leaving a trail everywhere we go!

149
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:40,846
How dare you blame Appa!?

150
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:42,749
He saved your life three times today!

151
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,989
If there's anyone to blame, it's you!

152
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,634
You're always talking about how you carry
your own weight, but you're not! He is!

153
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:54,169
Appa's carrying your weight! He never had a
problem flying when it was just the three of us!

154
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,219
I'm outta here.

155
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:00,519
Wait

156
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:18,388
What did I just do!? I can't believe
I yelled at my earthbending teacher.

157
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:19,439
Now she's gone.

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,608
I know.

159
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:23,349
We're all just trying to
get used to each other,

160
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,378
and I was so mean to her.

161
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,989
Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.

162
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,808
Thanks, Sokka.

163
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:30,278
No problem.

164
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,469
We need to find Toph and apologize.

165
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:37,429
Okay, but what are we going to do about the
tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?

166
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,129
I have a plan.

167
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,719
Toph was right. Appa's fur
was leaving a trail right to us.

168
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,148
But now that he's clean, no more trail!

169
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:00,829
Are you sure that he's okay to fly?

170
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,874
He'll be fine as long as we leave
his saddle and all our stuff here.

171
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,666
I'm going to use Appa's fur to make
a fake trail and lead the tank off course.

172
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:36,585
Ohhh? That really hurt my tailbone.

173
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,750
Wads of wet fur.

174
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:44,835
How delightful.

175
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,440
Hmm? They're not wads, more like...
bundles.

176
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,580
Or bunches? It's got an "uh" sound.

177
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,700
Clumps?

178
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,850
Clumps! They're clumps!

179
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,820
The trail goes this way.

180
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,650
The Avatar is trying to give us the slip.
You two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison.

181
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,768
I'll follow this trail.

182
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:22,174
Toph couldn't have made it too far.

183
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:24,384
What is it Momo?

184
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:25,914
Oh no, katara

185
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:28,614
How did they find us?

186
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:32,064
Appa, come on! We need to go faster!

187
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:33,669
He's too tired!

188
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:35,254
Not good, not good!

189
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:39,934
We just need to make it across that river!

190
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:43,054
Oh, no, Appa, just a little further!

191
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,423
We made it!

192
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:58,333
We're safe!

193
00:14:58,334 --> 00:14:59,384
You did it, Appa!

194
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,304
Good try, but no.

195
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:52,669
How ya doing?

196
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:53,754
Well, you know!

197
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:58,073
I thought when Ty Lee and I finally caught you guys.
..it would be more exciting.

198
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:01,874
Oh well, victory is boring.

199
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:08,754
Thanks Appa. I don't know
what we'd do without you.

200
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:17,544
Was it just me, or was that guy kinda cute?

201
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:37,014
Alright, you've caught up with me.
Now who are you and what do you want?

202
00:16:37,314 --> 00:16:41,234
You mean you haven't guessed?
You don't see the family resemblance?

203
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,224
Here's a hint.

204
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:46,274
I must find the Avatar to restore my honor.

205
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:50,644
It's okay. You can laugh. It's funny.

206
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,133
So what now?

207
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:53,184
Now?

208
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,034
Now it's over. You're tired
and you have no place to go.

209
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:59,404
You can run, but I'll catch you.

210
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,324
I'm not running.

211
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,194
Here is your tea.

212
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:18,864
You seem a little too
young to be traveling alone.

213
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,904
You seem a little too old.

214
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,124
Perhaps I am.

215
00:17:26,264 --> 00:17:30,514
I know what you're thinking. I look
like I can't handle being by myself.

216
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:32,619
I wasn't thinking that.

217
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:35,104
You wouldn't even let me
pour my own cup of tea.

218
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:39,784
I poured your tea because
I wanted to and ...

219
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:41,879
for no other reason.

220
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:44,274
People see me and think I'm weak.

221
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:48,594
They want to take care of me. But
I can take care of myself by myself.

222
00:17:49,594 --> 00:17:51,704
You sound like my nephew.

223
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:57,764
Always thinking you need to do things
on your own without anyone's support.

224
00:17:58,154 --> 00:18:02,684
There is nothing wrong with
letting people who love you help you.

225
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:06,004
Not that I love you; I just met you.

226
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:10,274
So, where is your nephew?

227
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,944
I've been tracking him, actually.

228
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:14,724
Is he lost?

229
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:16,859
Yes, a little bit.

230
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:23,344
His life has recently changed and
he's going through very difficult times.

231
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:26,974
He is trying to figure out who he is ...

232
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,419
and he went away.

233
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:31,109
So... now you're following him.

234
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:34,494
I know he doesn't want me around right now,

235
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:37,614
but, if he needs me, I'll be there.

236
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,334
Your nephew is very lucky,

237
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,404
even if he doesn't know it.

238
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:44,704
Thank you.

239
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:52,154
My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating
stranger is one of life's true delights.

240
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:54,294
No, thank you for what you said.

241
00:18:54,824 --> 00:18:56,124
It helped me.

242
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:58,232
I'm glad.

243
00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:04,184
Oh, and about your nephew? Maybe you
should tell him that you need him too.

244
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:14,464
Do you really want to fight me?

245
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:18,624
Yes, I really do.

246
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,709
Zuko

247
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:22,484
I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu.

248
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:24,909
Zuzu?

249
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,434
Back off, Azula! He's mine!

250
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:31,074
I'm not going anywhere.

251
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,764
Katara

252
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:24,993
Uncle?

253
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,424
Get up!

254
00:21:37,184 --> 00:21:39,224
I thought you guys could use a little help.

255
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:40,774
Thanks.

256
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:55,164
Well, look at this. Enemies
and traitors all working together.

257
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:58,717
I'm done. I know when I'm beaten.

258
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,917
You got me.

259
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:02,224
A princess surrenders with honor.

260
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:30,194
Get away from us!

261
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,864
Zuko, I can help!

262
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:38,954
Leave!

263
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:57,338
