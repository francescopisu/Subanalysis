<i>Water</i>

00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:04,281
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:06,525
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:08,567
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:12,703
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony</i>

6
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:17,031
<i>then everything changed
when the firenation attacked</i>

7
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:21,977
<i>Only the avatar mastered
all four elements could stop them</i>

8
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:23,779
<i>but when the world
needed him most...</i>

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,185
<i>an airbinder named Aang</i>

10
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:27,406
<i>And although his airbinding
skill is great,</i>

11
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:30,238
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he is ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:33,868
<i>But I believe...
... Aang can save the world</i>

13
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:46,676
I came along because I wanted to make sure
you got through the Serpent's Pass safely.

14
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:49,911
But now I need to get back
to the other Kyoshi warriors.

15
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:53,681
You stole Appa! Where's
he? What did you do to him?

16
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:56,894
I traded him.
He's probably in Ba-Sing-Se by now!

17
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:59,851
He is here. I can feel it.

18
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:02,564
I am Long Feng, head of the Dai Li.

19
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:05,176
I understand you've been
looking for your bison.

20
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:09,101
It would be quite a shame if you
were not able to complete your quest.

21
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:25,047
No, stop sinking!

22
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,772
Don't make me put this down!

23
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:47,498
Put a muzzle on him!

24
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,059
I'm sorry Appa.

25
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:50,764
Ransack his saddle. Who knows
what treasures are stashed in there?

26
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:55,613
He's tied up good, he can't hurt you.

27
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,920
What's your father going to do when
he finds out we lost a sand sailor?

28
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:11,689
Nothing. It's the one
we stole from the Hammi tribe.

29
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:14,375
Did you empty the saddle?

30
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:18,476
That's it! Nothing but garbage!

31
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,571
It doesn't matter.

32
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:25,506
We'll still make a profit from selling
him to those beetle-headed merchants!

33
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,410
How's his temper?

34
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:43,429
Pretty good.

35
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:47,556
Uh, most of the time.

36
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,548
I bet someone will pay a
fortune for him in Ba Sing Se.

37
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:54,002
All right. You've got a deal.

38
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,304
Appa...
Appa...

39
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,607
He's your problem now.

40
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,335
What...

41
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:32,996
We need the shirshu spit darts!

42
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:34,301
Got em'!

43
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:38,034
Ok big fella, you're gonna
take a nice little snoozle.

44
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:49,997
Appa...

45
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:54,174
No...

46
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,720
NO...

47
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:08,616
We've gotta get rid of this
one! He's too much trouble.

48
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,864
We could sell him for parts.

49
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:19,507
Oh. I understand you've
had a rather hard time lately.

50
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,228
That's too bad.

51
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:27,456
You probably felt you had no
choice but to behave outrageously.

52
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,935
Like a wild animal.

53
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:33,024
But don't worry, you won't anymore.

54
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,731
Because I am going to break you.

55
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,028
Hungry?

56
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:59,839
Don't worry, I'm going to feed you too.

57
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:02,641
But not yet.

58
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:06,495
First I am going to show
you how you'll earn it.

59
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:35,767
Or course, when you perform,
the hoops will be flaming.

60
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:39,614
And if you are careful,
you won't get burned.

61
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:45,278
You're about to be sorry.

62
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:52,504
It's obvious that whoever
your previous owner was,

63
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:56,044
he had no idea how to handle you properly.

64
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:12,270
I am gonna get a bag of sizzle-crisps.

65
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:14,866
Stay here and stay away from that monster.

66
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,525
Behave yourself, or you'll regret it.

67
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,819
He's a difficult creature,

68
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,101
stubborn and willful.
I need more time with him.

69
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,432
It's too risky right now.

70
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,365
Too Risky? What are you talking about?

71
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,981
This is the circus, home
of fear and danger.

72
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:46,563
I want the Wind Buffalo to perform tonight.

73
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,910
If you don't behave yourself,

74
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:53,356
you'll regret it.

75
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:03,877
Let's go!

76
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,436
See ya later buddy.

77
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:21,829
Ladies and gentleman, now
for something truly special.

78
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:26,292
A noble beast so magnificent and rare,

79
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:29,924
it hasn't been seen by
human eyes in generations.

80
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:34,184
I give you the Wind Buffalo!

81
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:42,853
Up!

82
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,305
Up, you insolent cow!

83
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,781
Run away! Get away from him.

84
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:25,755
Go. You can do it.

85
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,840
Get back here, you stupid beast!

86
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,266
Chose well.

87
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:49,238
A sky bison is a companion for life.

88
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:06,053
Ugh! I guess this mean
we'll always be together.

89
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,945
Always.

90
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:20,491
It's some kind of monster!

91
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:49,402
Uncle?

92
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:50,912
What are you looking at?

93
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:52,387
Is there something out there?

94
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:56,239
It's nothing. Go back to sleep.

95
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,315
Must have been some fight.

96
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,044
Wait. Let me see that.

97
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,584
No. It couldn't be.

98
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:54,217
Appa, oh no.

99
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,937
It's gonna be ok Appa.

100
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:08,035
I have to leave, but I am
gonna be back soon with help.

101
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,148
No sudden movements.

102
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:17,212
He's been lost for awhile,
and he looks like he's hurt.

103
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:19,594
He's shy around people and scared.

104
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:21,941
Stay low, and stay quiet.

105
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:24,479
I can't believe you found
the Avatar's bison.

106
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:27,467
Didn't you just see the
Avatar a few days ago?

107
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:29,838
Yes, so he can't be too far from here.

108
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,601
It's our responsibility
to get Appa back to him safely.

109
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,137
This could be our most
important mission yet.

110
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:41,674
Give him some space!

111
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:46,284
Appa.

112
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:48,117
Appa, it's me, Suki.

113
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:49,713
I'm a friend.

114
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:55,807
I want to help you.

115
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:59,116
You're hurt. We can help you feel better.

116
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,160
And we can help you find Aang.

117
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:28,754
My, my, you're easy to find.

118
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:32,621
It's really astounding my
brother hasn't captured you yet.

119
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:42,602
What do you want with us?

120
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,917
Who are you, the Avatar's fan girls?

121
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:50,455
Oh, I get it! Good one azula!

122
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,610
If you are looking for
the Avatar, you're out of luck.

123
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:56,420
I knew this was a waste of time.

124
00:16:57,022 --> 00:16:58,325
No avatar huh?

125
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:03,240
Well that's ok, any friend
of the Avatar, is an enemy of mine.

126
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:15,142
You're so colorful, it's
making me nauseous.

127
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,003
You're not prettier than we are!

128
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:33,684
Afraid of fire I see. That's good,

129
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,920
you should be!

130
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,058
Go Appa! Fly away from here!
Get out of here.

131
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:58,939
Get out of here! You have to find Aang!

132
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:00,182
We'll be ok!

133
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:12,347
Don't you know that fans
just make flames stronger?

134
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:21,756
Hello. I am Guru Pathik.

135
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:31,209
I know I am not the person you expected.

136
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:35,854
And I didn't expect to be
licked by a giant tongue just now.

137
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,660
The world is full of surprises.

138
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:15,652
Oh, dear.

139
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,505
You've been through so much recently.

140
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,318
Hurt and betrayed,

141
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,096
so twisted up inside.

142
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:28,670
You're still full of love.

143
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,286
But fear has moved in
where trust should be.

144
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:37,823
I've been expecting you and the
young Avatar for quite a long time.

145
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:41,810
I had a vision many years
ago of helping him.

146
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:44,846
That's why I came to the
Eastern Air Temple.

147
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:53,285
Ahh. Your emotions are so turbulent.

148
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,803
Like swirling storm clouds.

149
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:02,137
Let the clouds in your
mind be gentle, peaceful ones.

150
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:24,044
Someone looks very well-rested,

151
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,406
judging by your bed head.

152
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:52,990
I have prepared a message for Aang.

153
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,957
May I attach it to your horn?

154
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:04,403
You and the Avatar's energies are mixed.

155
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:06,846
You have an unbreakable bond.

156
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,246
By reading your energy,
I can sense where Aang is.

157
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,417
Funny, what invisible
strings connect us all.

158
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:30,739
I will see you again, great beast.
