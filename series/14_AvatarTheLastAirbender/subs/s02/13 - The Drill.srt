1
00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:01,758
<i>Water</i>

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:04,231
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:06,475
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:08,517
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,653
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony</i>

6
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:16,981
<i>then everything changed
when the firenation attacked</i>

7
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:21,927
<i>Only the avatar mastered
all four elements could stop them</i>

8
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:25,007
<i>but when the world needed
him most he vanished</i>

9
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:29,063
<i>100 years passed, my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

10
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:31,076
<i>airbinder named Aang</i>

11
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,617
<i>And although his airbinding
skill is great,</i>

12
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,449
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he is ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,306 --> 00:00:40,079
<i>But I believe...
... Aang can save the world</i>

14
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,319
This drill is a feat of scientific
ingenuity and raw destructive power.

15
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,544
Once it tunnels through the wall,

16
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,119
our troops will storm their city.
The Earth kingdom will finally fall,

17
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:58,309
and you can claim Ba Sing
Se in the name of your father.

18
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,309
Nothing can stop us.

19
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:04,499
Hmm. What about those
muscle-y guys down there?

20
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:09,054
Please

21
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:12,969
the drill's metal shell is impervious
to any earthbending attack.

22
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,939
Oh, I'm sure it is War Minister Ching.
But just to be on the safe side?

23
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:20,519
Mai, and Ty lee, take the earthbenders out!

24
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,219
Finally, something to do.

25
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:33,649
Aang, what are you doing here?
I thought you were looking for Appa?

26
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:37,309
I was, but something stopped me.
Something big.

27
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,309
Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?

28
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,279
That

29
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:55,309
We made it to Ba Sing
Se, and we're still not safe.

30
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:56,789
No one is.

31
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:59,019
What are you people doing here?

32
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,109
Civilians aren't allowed on the wall.

33
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:04,879
I'm the Avatar.
Take me to whoever's in charge.

34
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:09,999
It is an honor to welcome
you to the outer wall young Avatar,

35
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:12,159
but your help is not needed.

36
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:13,691
Not needed?

37
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,189
Not needed.

38
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,464
I have the situation under control.

39
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:22,579
I assure you the Fire Nation
cannot penetrate this wall.

40
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,819
Many have tried to break through
it, but none have succeeded.

41
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,009
What about the Dragon of the West?
He got in.

42
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:37,159
Well...uh...technically yes.
But he was quickly expunged.

43
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,899
Nevertheless, that is why
the city is named Ba Sing Se.

44
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,779
It's the impenetrable city.

45
00:03:44,814 --> 00:03:47,269
They don't call it Na Sing Se.

46
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,194
That means penetrable city.

47
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:54,999
Yeah, thanks for the tour,
but we still got the drill problem.

48
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,094
Not for long. To stop it, I've sent ...

49
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,919
an elite platoon of earthbenders
called the Terra Team.

50
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,119
That's a good group name, very catchy.

51
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,059
Ready! Attack!

52
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,669
We're doomed!

53
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:51,644
Get a hold of yourself man!

54
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,819
You're right, I'm sorry.

55
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:57,089
Maybe you'd like the Avatar's help now?

56
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,939
Yes, please.

57
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,789
The question is, how
are we gonna stop that thing?

58
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,369
Why are you all looking at me?

59
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,174
You're the idea guy.

60
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:15,169
So I'm the only one who
can ever come up with a plan?

61
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:16,404
That's a lot of pressure.

62
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,079
And also the complaining guy.

63
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:19,319
That part I don't mind.

64
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:28,569
So, Mr. Lee, and Mr... umm Mushy is it?

65
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:30,374
It's pronounced Moo-shee.

66
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:32,649
You telling me how to do my job?

67
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:34,284
No, no.

68
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,919
But may I just say that you're like a
flower in bloom, your beauty intoxicating.

69
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:46,369
You're pretty easy on the
eyes yourself handsome.

70
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,689
Welcome to Ba Sing se.

71
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,799
I'm gonna forget I saw that.

72
00:05:57,249 --> 00:05:59,494
I think Lee would make a
good Freedom Fighter.

73
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:02,559
He's just trying to find
his way in the world, like us.

74
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:04,894
You don't know anything about him Jet.

75
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,489
I know he didn't get
that scar from a waterbender.

76
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:10,014
Besides, I thought we
were going straight now?

77
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:13,279
We are, and the new Freedom
Fighters could use a guy like Lee.

78
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,069
What do you think Longshot?

79
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,669
I can respect that.

80
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,899
What's wrong with him?
He doesn't look injured.

81
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,649
His Chi is blocked.

82
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:28,034
Who did this to you?

83
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:29,754
Two girls ambushed us,

84
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,064
one of them hit me with
a bunch of quick jabs,

85
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:36,013
and suddenly I couldn't earthbend,
and I could barely move

86
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:37,579
and then she cart wheeled away.

87
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:40,274
Ty-Lee

88
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:44,159
She doesn't look dangerous, but she
knows the human body and it's weak points.

89
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:46,719
It's like she takes you
down from the inside.

90
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:49,474
Yes.

91
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,084
What you just said,

92
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:52,828
that's how we're gonna take down the Drill.

93
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,759
The same way Ty lee took
down all these big earthbenders.

94
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:57,809
By hitting its pressure points!

95
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:02,622
We'll take it down from the inside.

96
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,660
Once I whip up some cover, you're not
gonna be able to see, so stay close to me.

97
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:21,392
Run!

98
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,478
Hey, look at that dust cloud.
It's so...poofy. Poof!

99
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,700
Don't worry Princess.
I'm sure it's nothing.

100
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,020
Everyone into the hole!

101
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,820
It's so dark down here,
I can't see a thing.

102
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,190
Oh no, what a nightmare.

103
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,275
Sorry.

104
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,770
There!

105
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,694
Toph, Come on!

106
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:15,229
No way am I going in that metal monster.
I can't bend in there.

107
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,860
I'll try to slow it down out here.

108
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,580
Okay, good luck.

109
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,330
I need a plan of this machine.
Some schematics that show what the inside looks like.

110
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:35,457
Then we can find it's weak points.

111
00:08:35,492 --> 00:08:37,652
Where are we gonna get something like that?

112
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,530
What are you doing!?
Someone's gonna hear us!

113
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:41,685
That's the point.

114
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,890
I figure a machine this
big needs engineers to run it,

115
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,522
and when something breaks...

116
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,120
They come to fix it.

117
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,140
Hi!

118
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,400
This'll work, thanks!

119
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:07,654
It looks like the Drill is
made up of two main structures.

120
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:09,849
There's the inner mechanism,
where we are now,

121
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,355
and the outer shell.

122
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:13,874
The inner part and the outer
part are connected by these braces.

123
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,575
If we cut through them,
the entire thing will collapse.

124
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,080
So, you guys got plans
once you're inside the city?

125
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:27,970
Get your hot tea here!
Finest tea in Ba Sing Se!

126
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,590
Oh! Jasmine, please.

127
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,462
Blaugh! Ugh. Coldest tea
in Ba Sing Se is more like it.

128
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:43,600
What a disgrace!

129
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,320
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

130
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,120
You and I have a much better chance of
making it in the city if we stick together.

131
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:55,932
You want to join the Freedom Fighters?

132
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,675
Thanks, but I don't think
you want me in your gang.

133
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:04,050
Come on, we made a great team looting that Captain's food.
Think of all the good we could do for these refugees.

134
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,320
I said no.

135
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,610
Have it your way.

136
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,530
Hey!

137
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,345
What are you doing firebending your tea?

138
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,369
For a wise old man, that
was a pretty stupid move.

139
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,990
I know you're not supposed
to cry over spilled tea, but

140
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,750
.. that's so sad.

141
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,180
Wow, it looks a lot thicker
in person than it does in the plans.

142
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,509
We're going to have to work
pretty hard to cut through that.

143
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,780
What's this we stuff? Aang and
I are going to have to do all the work.

144
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:51,050
Look, I'm the plan guy, You two are
the "cut stuff up with waterbending" guys.

145
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,200
Together, we're Team Avatar!

146
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,800
C'mon team, don't quit now, we're...

147
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,630
I mean, you're almost there.

148
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:34,890
At this rate, we won't do enough
damage before the drill reaches the wall.

149
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:37,145
I don't know how many more
of those I have in me.

150
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,510
Do you hear that? We took it down.
We better get out of here fast!

151
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,850
Congratulations crew, the Dill has
made contact with the wall of Ba Sing Se.

152
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,730
Start the countdown to victory!

153
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,520
C'mon brace, budge!

154
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,369
This is bad, really bad.

155
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,890
We're putting everything we've got into busting
these braces, but it's taking too long!

156
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,015
Maybe we don't need to
cut all the way through.

157
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,030
Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't
give 100% of your energy into any one strike.

158
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:50,202
Sokka, take a fighting stance.

159
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,305
You've gotta be quick and accurate.

160
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,590
Hit a series of points,
and break your opponent's stance.

161
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,465
And when he's reeling back,
you deliver the final blow

162
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,670
His own weight becomes his downfall.
Literally.

163
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,170
So we just need to weaken the braces,
instead of cut all the way through.

164
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:09,620
Then I'll go to the top of this
thing, and deliver the final blow.

165
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,300
And boom, it all comes crashing down!

166
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,890
Everyone inside that wall,
the whole world, is counting on us.

167
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:20,570
The whole world, minus
the Fire Nation that is.

168
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,660
C'mon twinkle toes, hurry up!

169
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,140
That's enough, we need
to get to the next one!

170
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,415
War Minister, an engineer was
ambushed! His schematics were stolen!

171
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,180
War Minister, a brace on the starboard side has
been cut clean through! It's sabotage sir!

172
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,080
Let's go ladies.

173
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,600
Good work Team Avatar. Now
Aang just needs to ... DUCK!

174
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,402
Wow Azula, you were right,
it is the Avatar! ...and friends.

175
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,360
Hey

176
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,390
Guys get out of here, I
know what I need to do.

177
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,870
Wait! You need this water more than I do!

178
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,870
Follow them, the Avatar is mine.

179
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,500
Slurry pipeline? What does that mean?

180
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,670
It's rock and water mixed
together, it means our way out.

181
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,175
Ughh, disgusting!

182
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,750
Come on, you heard Azula.
We have to follow them.

183
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,480
She can shoot all the lightning she wants at
me, I am not going in that wall sludge juice.

184
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,900
Why don't you try blocking
my chi now circus freak!

185
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:00,395
Katara, keep that up.

186
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,530
The pressure will build up in the drill, then when
Aang delivers the final blow, it will be ready to pop!

187
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,120
This looks like a good spot Momo.

188
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,620
General Sung, tell your soldiers
to stop shooting rocks down here!

189
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,560
Soldiers, whatever you do, don't
stop shooting rocks down there!

190
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,515
Good technique little sister!

191
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,205
Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe!

192
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,160
You know, I am just about sick and
tired of you telling me what to do all day.

193
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:56,084
You're like a chattering Hog-Monkey!

194
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:58,140
Just bend the slurry woman!!

195
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,800
You guys need some help?

196
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:03,010
Toph, help me plug up this drain!

197
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,940
What I'd give to be a metal bender.

198
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,940
Momo, get out of here!

199
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,120
Thanks Momo, I owe you one.

200
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,040
Now all I need is a...

201
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,910
Actually, that is what I needed for once.

202
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,180
Here it comes!

203
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,850
We lost.

204
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,645
Last call for Ba Sing se!

205
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,110
Jet, relax! So the old
guy had some hot tea. Big deal.

206
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:52,710
He heated it himself!
Those guys are firebenders.

207
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,800
What a handsome baby.

208
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:07,450
Thank you.

209
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,060
I just want to say, good effort
out there today Team Avatar.

210
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:33,405
Enough with the Team Avatar stuff.

211
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,370
No matter how many times you
say it, it's not gonna catch on.

212
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:37,775
How about...

213
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,715
the "Boomerang Squad",

214
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,110
see it's good cause it's got "Aang" in it.

215
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,380
Boomer- Aang

216
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,960
I kinda like that one.

217
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,630
Let's talk about this on
our way into the city.

218
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,770
The "Aang Gang"?

219
00:22:48,771 --> 00:22:49,849
Sokka

220
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,220
The "Fearsome Foursome"?

221
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,259
You're crazy.

222
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,770
Why? We're fearsome!
