1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:01,549
<i>Water</i>

2
00:00:02,972 --> 00:00:04,022
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:06,266
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:08,308
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:12,444
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony</i>

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:16,772
<i>then everything changed
when the firenation attacked</i>

7
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:21,718
<i>Only the avatar mastered
all four elements could stop them</i>

8
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:24,798
<i>but when the world needed
him most he vanished</i>

9
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:28,854
<i>100 years passed, my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

10
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:30,867
<i>airbinder named Aang</i>

11
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:33,408
<i>And although his airbinding
skill is great,</i>

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,240
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he is ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:39,870
<i>But I believe...
...Aang can save the world</i>

14
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,886
The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter.

15
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:56,841
I want you to do whatever it takes
to bring her home.

16
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:04,219
I discovered a hidden library

17
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:08,399
I tore through scroll after scroll.

18
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,662
You did it! You're a earthbender.

19
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:17,944
Sozen's comet will return
by the end of this summer

20
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:23,744
and Firelord Ozai will use its
power to finish the war once for all

21
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:28,810
You must defeat the Firelord
before the comet arrives.

22
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:39,887
What's out here?

23
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:42,594
A lot actually.
There's hundreds of little...

24
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:46,101
Shhh! I know you can see underground,
but don't ruin the surprise.

25
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:47,621
Just watch.

26
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:56,171
I'm putting an orchestra together.

27
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:57,307
Orchestra huh?

28
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:59,452
Well la dee da.

29
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:14,527
This is great and all, but don't we
have more important things to worry about?

30
00:02:14,528 --> 00:02:16,271
We should be making plans.

31
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:17,876
We did make plans.

32
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:19,962
We're all picking mini-vacations.

33
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:21,934
There's no time for vacations.

34
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:24,294
I'm learning the elements as fast as I can.

35
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:27,225
I practice hard everyday
with Toph and Katara.

36
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:29,116
I've been training my arrow off.

37
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:32,539
Yeah. What's wrong with having
a little fun in our downtime?

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,451
Even if you do master
all of the elements, then what?

39
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:37,695
It's not like we have a
map of the fire nation.

40
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,570
Should we just head west until
we reach the Fire Lord's house?

41
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:43,729
Knock knock! Hello, Fire Lord?
Anybody home?

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,627
I don't think so.

43
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:47,268
We need some intelligence
if we're gonna win this war.

44
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,192
Alright, we'll finish our vacations,

45
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:54,082
and then we'll look for
Sokka's intelligence.

46
00:02:54,863 --> 00:02:58,430
Your turn Katara. Where would
you like to go on your mini-vacation?

47
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:02,653
How about the Misty Palms
Oasis? That sounds refreshing.

48
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:03,920
Oh yeah, I've been there.

49
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:07,768
It's a pristine natural ice spring,
and I usually don't use the word pristine.

50
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,232
It's one of nature's wonders.

51
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,596
Must have changed ownership
since I was here.

52
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:40,729
One mango please.

53
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,855
I don't see anything wrong with
having one of those fruity beverages ...

54
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,449
while we plan our strategy.

55
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,603
Excuse me.

56
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:08,153
No worries, I clean up easy.

57
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:12,201
Oh, You're a living relic!

58
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:13,657
Thanks. I try.

59
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,867
An Air Nomad, right in front of me.

60
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:20,959
Professor Zei, head of anthropology
at Ba Sing Se University.

61
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,015
Tell me, which of the
Air temples do you hail from?

62
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:26,331
The southern temple.

63
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,753
Oh splendid! Now tell me, what was the
primary agricultural product of your people?

64
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:35,144
Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?

65
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:38,933
Oh, truly fascinating.
That is one for the journal.

66
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:42,456
So professor, you're obviously
a well traveled guy.

67
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:46,113
Do you have a more current map?
Ours seems to be a little dated.

68
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:47,666
Certainly.

69
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:54,667
What, no Fire Nation? Doesn't
anybody have a good map of that place?

70
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:56,792
You've made a lot of trips into the desert.

71
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:58,854
All in vain I'm afraid.

72
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:01,978
I've found lost civilizations
all over the Earth Kingdom,

73
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:06,073
but I haven't managed to
find the crown jewel...

74
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:08,448
Wan Shi Tong's Library.

75
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:11,297
You spent years walking
through the desert ...

76
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:13,550
to find some guy's library?

77
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,205
This library is more valuable
than gold, little lady.

78
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:20,863
It is said to contain
a vast collection of knowledge,

79
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:21,938
and knowledge

80
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:24,048
is priceless.

81
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:26,285
Mm, sounds like good times.

82
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,143
Oh, it is.

83
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:31,957
According to legend, it was
built by the great knowledge spirit,

84
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,983
Wan Shi Tong, with the help
of his foxy knowledge seekers.

85
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:39,672
Oh, so this spirit has
attractive assistants, huh?

86
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,832
I think he means they
look like actual foxes, Sokka.

87
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:44,213
You're both right.

88
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:45,391
Handsome little creatures.

89
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:49,989
Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge seekers
collected books from all over the world,

90
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,522
and put them on display
for mankind to read,

91
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:55,203
so that we might better ourselves.

92
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:59,028
If this place has books from all over the world,
do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation?

93
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,529
A map maybe?

94
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,932
I wouldn't know, but if
such a thing exists,

95
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:06,776
it's in Wan Shi Tong's Library.

96
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,056
Then it's settled.

97
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:12,969
Aang, I do believe it's my turn.
I'd like to spend my vacation

98
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,590
<i><b>AT THE LIBRARY! </b></i>

99
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:19,068
Uh, hey? What about me?
When do I get to pick?

100
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,673
You gotta work here a little longer
before you qualify for vacation time.

101
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,327
Of course there's the matter of finding it.

102
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:28,386
I've made several trips
into the Si Wong Desert,

103
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,192
and almost died each time.

104
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:33,839
I'm afraid that desert's
impossible to cross.

105
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,559
Professor, would you like
to see our sky bison?

106
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:38,985
A sky bison?

107
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,227
You actually have one?

108
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,380
Sandbenders! Shoo! Away from the bison!

109
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:10,936
Tell me, sky bison. Are
you the last of your breed?

110
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:15,567
Oh, delightful!
I only wish I spoke his tongue.

111
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,872
Oh the stories this beast could tell.

112
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,383
Shush, chatty monkey.

113
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:25,925
Wow, shouldn't be too hard
to find a place like this out here.

114
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:32,567
Aw, does this place even exist?

115
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,152
Some say it doesn't.

116
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,055
Shouldn't you have mentioned that before?

117
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:46,406
There it is!

118
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:52,705
That's what it will sound
like when one of you spots it.

119
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,831
It shouldn't be this hard to spot
a giant ornate building from the air.

120
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,635
Down there. What's that?

121
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:14,201
Forget it. It's obviously
not what we're looking for.

122
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,599
The building in this drawing is enormous.

123
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,685
What kind of animal is that?

124
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,782
I think that was one of
the knowledge seekers.

125
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:35,123
Oh, we must be close to the library!

126
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:38,577
No, this is the library. Look!

127
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,417
It's completely buried.

128
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:49,847
The library is buried!?

129
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:52,970
My life's ambition is now full of sand.

130
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:55,676
Well, time to start excavating.

131
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:01,018
Actually, that won't be necessary.

132
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,637
The inside seems to be completely intact,

133
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:05,724
and it's huge.

134
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,586
That fox thingy went in through a window.

135
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:09,738
I say we climb up there and give it a look.

136
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:12,196
I say you guys go ahead without me.

137
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:14,183
You got something against libraries?

138
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:18,162
I've held books before,
and I gotta tell you,

139
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:20,113
they don't exactly do it for me.

140
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:22,150
Oh, right. Sorry.

141
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:24,964
Let me know if they have
something you can listen to.

142
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:33,800
Don't worry buddy. I'm not making
you go underground ever again.

143
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,708
You can stay out here with Toph.

144
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,282
What's up?

145
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:55,206
Oh, it's breath taking.

146
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:58,220
The spirits spared no
expense designing this place.

147
00:09:58,221 --> 00:10:00,632
Look at those beautiful buttresses!

148
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:03,066
What's funny?

149
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,751
Nothing. We just like architecture.

150
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,443
As do I.

151
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:11,569
My word!

152
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,608
The exquisite mosaic handiwork
of this tile-rendered avian symbol

153
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:19,838
Eh, nice...owl.

154
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:37,624
I know you're back there.

155
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:46,107
Hello! I'm Professor Zei, head of
anthropology at Ba Sing Se University.

156
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:48,782
You should leave the way you came

157
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:52,428
unless you want to become
a stuffed head of anthropology.

158
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:57,596
Are you the spirit who brought
this library to the physical world?

159
00:10:57,597 --> 00:11:00,239
Indeed, I am Wan Shi Tong,

160
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,497
he who knows 10,000 things.

161
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,668
And you are obviously humans,

162
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:08,064
which by the way are no
longer permitted in my study.

163
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:09,685
What do you have against humans?

164
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,841
Hmm, humans only bother learning
things to get the edge on other humans,

165
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:18,594
like that firebender who came
to this place a few years ago,

166
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,562
looking to destroy his enemy.

167
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:22,393
So...

168
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:24,925
who are you trying to destroy?

169
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:26,134
What? Oh, no,

170
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:29,206
no, no destroying, we're not into that.

171
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:31,787
Then why have you come here?

172
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:35,833
Knowledge, for, knowledge's sake.

173
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:40,049
If you're going to lie
to an all-knowing spirit being,

174
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,553
you should at least put
some effort into it.

175
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:45,281
I'm not lying. I'm here
with the Avatar, and he's ...

176
00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:47,962
the bridge between our
worlds, he'll vouch for me.

177
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:52,306
Uh, yeah, I'll vouch.

178
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:55,883
We will not abuse the knowledge
in your library, good spirit.

179
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:57,319
You have my word.

180
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:00,006
Very well.

181
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:02,892
I'll let you peruse my vast collection,

182
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:04,762
on one condition.

183
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:10,648
To prove your worth as scholars, you have
to contribute some worthwhile knowledge.

184
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,932
Please accept this tome
as a donation to your library.

185
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,983
First edition, very nice.

186
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:23,968
I have an authentic waterbending scroll.

187
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:28,204
Oh...these illustrations are quite stylish.

188
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:32,422
Uh, oh, I know!

189
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,385
I suppose that counts.

190
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,637
Oh, great spirit, Check this out!

191
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,925
It's a special knot!
That counts as knowledge.

192
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:49,434
You're not very bright, are you?

193
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:53,837
Enjoy the library.

194
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,273
Bright enough to fool you.

195
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:07,266
So,

196
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,159
you like flyin'?

197
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,662
Of course, I'm more comfortable
on the ground, where I can see.

198
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:17,616
Well, I don't see the way you do.

199
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:20,611
I feel the vibration in
the ground with my feet,

200
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:23,596
but this sand is so loose and shifty,

201
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:26,152
it makes everything look fuzzy.

202
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,080
Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy.

203
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:43,004
Hey, look at these weird
lion turtle things.

204
00:13:44,312 --> 00:13:45,726
Eh, I've seen weirder.

205
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:48,857
Aang, did you know in a
past life, you were left handed?

206
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,590
I always knew I was special.

207
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:03,691
The darkest day in Fire Nation history.

208
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,300
It's got a date at the top,
but it doesn't say anything else.

209
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:16,001
Sokka, where are you going?

210
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:19,068
I want to know what happened to
the Fire Nation on their darkest day.

211
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:20,554
This could be promising.

212
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:25,354
The information on the Fire
Nation should be right up here.

213
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:29,664
Firebender.

214
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:32,771
They destroyed everything
having to do with the Fire Nation.

215
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:35,031
That's so unfair!

216
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:37,713
Just when I think I'm one
step ahead of the Fire Nation,

217
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:40,201
it turns out they beat
us here a long time ago.

218
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,633
I need to know what happened
on the darkest day.

219
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,869
Hello, little weird fox guy.

220
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,669
Seems it's trying to assist you.

221
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:57,634
Um, sure, I'll guess I'll follow you.

222
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:27,270
This room is a true marvel.

223
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:28,947
A mechanical wonder!

224
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:32,123
It's a planetarium that
shows the heavens moving.

225
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,016
Uh, this is beautiful,
but, how is it helpful?

226
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:41,414
Maybe these dials represent
dates and times.

227
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,311
Sokka, try entering that
date from the parchment you took.

228
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:45,925
Shh, Katara

229
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:49,694
Not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.

230
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,267
Wow, I gotta hand it to you Sokka. You
picked the best mini-vacation, for sure.

231
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,937
Hey wait, what happened to the sun?

232
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,114
Great, you must have broken it.

233
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,915
It's not broken.

234
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:29,951
The sun is behind the moon,
it's a solar eclipse!

235
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:33,555
It's literally the darkest day
in Fire Nation history. Now I get it!

236
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:38,268
Something awful happened on that day,
I don't know what, but I do know why.

237
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:41,829
Firebenders loose their
bending during a solar eclipse!

238
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,144
Sorry

239
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:44,428
That makes sense.

240
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:48,362
I mean, think of what the lunar eclipse
at the North Pole did to the waterbenders.

241
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:49,777
This is huge.

242
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,840
Fine, you earned it.

243
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:59,642
We've got to get this information
to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se.

244
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:04,148
We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade
the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless.

245
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,443
The Fire Lord is goin' down!

246
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,728
Mortals are so predictable.

247
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,249
And such terrible liars.

248
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:17,563
You betrayed my trust.

249
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:22,341
From the beginning you intended to
misuse this knowledge for evil purposes.

250
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:26,041
You don't understand. If anyone's
evil, it's the Fire Nation.

251
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:29,968
You saw what they did to your library.
They're destructive and dangerous.

252
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,771
We need this information.

253
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,880
You think you're the first person
to believe their war was justified?

254
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:41,328
Countless others before you have come here, seeking
weapons or weaknesses or battle strategies.

255
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,808
We had no choice.

256
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,960
Please, we're just desperate
to protect the people we love.

257
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:49,865
And now I'm going to protect what I love.

258
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:55,156
What are you doing?

259
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,595
I'm taking my knowledge back.

260
00:17:57,596 --> 00:18:00,503
No one will ever abuse it again.

261
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:03,309
He's sinking the building!
We've gotta get out of here!

262
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,966
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

263
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:08,228
You already know too much.

264
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:22,096
I already told you, I
don't want to snuggle.

265
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,612
Library's sinking

266
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:29,491
Library's sinking!

267
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,471
Great knowledge spirit, I beg you.

268
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:05,754
Do not destroy your vast
collection of priceless tomes.

269
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:19,388
We've gotta get back to the surface.

270
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:22,974
Sokka, let's go!

271
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,629
But we still don't know when
the next eclipse is gonna happen.

272
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,855
Don't be stupid, we'll find out later.

273
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,041
No, we won't.

274
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,742
If we leave this place we'll
never get the information.

275
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,383
Aang, come with me to
the planetarium, I need cover.

276
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:36,802
Katara, take Momo and get out of here.

277
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:37,335
But

278
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:38,268
Go£¡

279
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:40,355
Hurry, Sokka

280
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:57,259
What is it now?

281
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:06,903
Who's there?

282
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,558
Why are we doing this?

283
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,380
Because if this calendar can
tell us about eclipses in the past,

284
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:20,891
then maybe it can project
when the next one will be.

285
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:23,151
You can't possibly check every single date.

286
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:24,202
I don't have to.

287
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:27,373
We just have to check every
date before Sozin's comet arrives,

288
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:29,069
because after that...

289
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,070
Well, try not to think about that.

290
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:52,806
Come on eclipse!

291
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:58,011
That's it, the solar eclipse!

292
00:20:58,332 --> 00:20:59,812
It's just a few months away.

293
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:04,024
Got it. Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.

294
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:24,375
Don't make me put this down.

295
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:36,958
No, stop sinking.

296
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,009
NO

297
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:44,326
I'm sorry Appa.

298
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:07,835
At least I'll have one specimen
to add to my collection.

299
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,175
Your waterbending won't
do you much good here.

300
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:26,780
I've studied Northern Water Style, Southern
Water Style, even Foggy Swamp Style.

301
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,729
That's called Sokka style. Learn it!

302
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:44,216
Wait! Professor, let's go!

303
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:49,628
I'm not leaving. I can't. I've spent
too long trying to find this place.

304
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:53,023
There's not another collection
of knowledge like this on Earth.

305
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:57,233
I could spend an eternity in here.

306
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:58,715
Just go!

307
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:29,066
We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming.

308
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,252
The Fire Nation's in trouble, now!

309
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:35,351
Where's Appa?

310
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:47,767
