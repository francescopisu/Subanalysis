four elements could stop them</i>

Aang?

16
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,130
Do you wanna talk about it?

17
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:42,785
Naah.. just a nightmare

18
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,846
I was in the Avatar State

19
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,265
But I was outside my body
watching myself

20
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:50,255
It was scary

21
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,467
I was scary

22
00:01:57,643 --> 00:02:00,416
Kitara, I want you to have this

23
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:04,029
This amulet contains water from
the Spirit Oasis

24
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:06,383
The water has unique properties

25
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:07,864
Don't lose it

26
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:09,956
Thank you Master Pakku

27
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,717
Aang, these scrolls will help you
master waterbending

28
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:14,540
But remember,

29
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,622
there are no substitutes
for a real master.

30
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:23,608
Sokka

31
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:26,483
Take care son.

32
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:31,817
Fly straight to the Earth Kingdom
based to the east of here

33
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:35,423
General Fong will provide you with
an escort to Omashu

34
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:36,867
There you'll be safe

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,516
to begin your earthbending
training with King Bumi

36
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:41,700
Appa, yip yip!

37
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,600
Say hi to Gran Gran for me!

38
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,335
Aahh..

39
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,660
This is what I've been missing

40
00:02:56,863 --> 00:03:02,849
Who knew floating on a piece of a driftwood
for 3 weeks with no food or water..

41
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:08,936
And sea vultures waiting to pluck out
your liver could make one so tense?

42
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,075
I see

43
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,079
It's the anniversary isn't it?

44
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:17,833
3 years ago today I was banished

45
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,459
I lost it all

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,970
I want it back!

47
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,933
I want the Avatar,
I want my honor, my throne!

48
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:28,421
I want my father not to
think I'm worthless.

49
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:29,820
I'm sure he doesn't.

50
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:33,239
Why would he banish you
if he didn't care?

51
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:38,434
Urgh.. that came out wrong didn't it?

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,850
My brother and my uncle has
disgraced the Fire Lord

53
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:08,000
and brought shame on all of us.

54
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:11,611
You may have mixed feeling about
attacking members of the royal family

55
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:13,600
I understand. But I assure you..

56
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:18,328
If u hesitate, I will not hesitate
to bring you down.

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,929
Dismissed.

58
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:26,541
Princess, I'm afraid the tide will not allow us
to bring the ship into port before nightfall.

59
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:29,890
I'm sorry Captain, but I do not know
much about the tides

60
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:32,143
Can you explain something to me?

61
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:33,724
Of course, your Highness

62
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:35,872
Do the tides command this ship?

63
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:38,814
I'm afraid I don't understand.

64
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:42,672
You said the tides would not allow us
to bring this ship in.

65
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:44,673
Do the tides command this ship?

66
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:46,354
No, Princess.

67
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:48,914
And if I would have you thrown overboard

68
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:52,681
Would the tides think twice about
smashing you against the rocky shore?

69
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,424
No, Princess

70
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:58,950
Well then, maybe you should worry less
about the tides if they're already made up

71
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:00,513
their mind about killing you,

72
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:03,906
and worry more about me,
who's still mulling it over.

73
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,204
I'll pull us in.

74
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,535
There it is!

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,376
Welcome, Avatar Aang.

76
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:23,824
I am General Fong.

77
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,401
And welcome to all of u, great heroes.

78
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:32,560
Appa, Momo, brave Sokka,
the mighty Katara.

79
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,100
"Mighty Katara"?
I liked that.

80
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,863
Not bad, not bad.

81
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:49,100
Avatar Aang, we were all amazed at the
stories of how you single handedly

82
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:52,500
wiped out an entire Fire Navy fleet
at the North Pole.

83
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,459
I can't imagine what it feels like
to wield such devastating power.

84
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,077
It's an awesome responsibility.

85
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,212
I tried not to think
about it too much.

86
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:05,924
Avatar, you're ready
to face the Fire Lord now.

87
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:08,155
What? No I'm not!

88
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,920
Aang still needs to master all
four elements.

89
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:14,224
Why? With the kind of power he possesses,

90
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:17,500
power enough to destroy hundreds
of battleships in a matter of minutes,

91
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,342
he could defeat the Fire Lord now!

92
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:23,597
But, sir, the thing is, Aang can only
do those things when he's in Avatar State.

93
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:25,800
See, it's a special state where..

94
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:26,855
I'm well aware

95
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:29,679
Your eyes and tattoos glow,
and you're able to summon

96
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,220
unbelievable power

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,370
Without you we'd be slaughtered
before we even reach their shores.

98
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,850
But with you leading the way,

99
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,492
as the ultimate weapon,

100
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,743
we could cut us warf right through
to the heart of the Fire Nation.

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,599
Right, but, I don't know how to
get in or out of the Avatar State.

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,431
Much less what to do
once I'm there.

103
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:50,694
So it's decided then

104
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,530
I'll help you figure out how to
get into the Avatar State

105
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:55,229
and then you'll face your destiny.

106
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,346
No, nothing's decided.

107
00:06:57,396 --> 00:07:01,499
We already have a plan.
Aang's pursuing his destiny his way.

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,964
Well, while you take your time
learning the elements,

109
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,531
the war goes on.

110
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,100
May I show you something?

111
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:11,565
That's the infirmary,

112
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,912
and those soldiers
are the lucky ones...

113
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,493
they came back.

114
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:20,575
Everyday the Fire Nation takes lives,
people are dying Aang!

115
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,877
You could end it, now.

116
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:23,970
Think about it.

117
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:45,232
Almost perfect.

118
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:48,066
One hair out of place.

119
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:51,599
Almost isn't good enough.

120
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:05,238
General Fong?

121
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,289
Come in, Aang.

122
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:08,334
Have you thought about our discussion?

123
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:10,724
L'm in.

124
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:12,693
L'll fight the Fire Lord.

125
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:25,843
L told the General l'd help him

126
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,365
by going into the Avatar State.

127
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:29,699
Aang, no.

128
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,938
This is not the right way.

129
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,553
Why not? Remember when
he took out the Fire Navy?

130
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,650
He was incredible.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,570
There's a right
way to do this...

132
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,391
practice, study and discipline.

133
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,192
Or just glow it up and
stop that Fire Lord.

134
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,590
Lf you two meatheads want to throw away

135
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:44,591
everything we've worked for,

136
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,593
Fine. Go ahead and glow it up.

137
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,595
Katara, l'm just being realistic.

138
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:51,842
L don't have time to
do this the right way.

139
00:08:57,441 --> 00:09:00,835
This rare chi-enhancing
tea is a natural stimulant.

140
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:02,742
Ln an ordinary warrior,

141
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,562
it improves strength and energy tenfold.

142
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:09,495
Ln you, it may induce the Avatar State.

143
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,612
Tenfold energy, huh?

144
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:15,522
Ls it working? ls it working?

145
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:16,523
L can't tell! Somebody tell me

146
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:18,092
if l'm in the Avatar State

147
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:19,526
'cause l don't have
a good view of myself.

148
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:20,755
Am l talking too loud?

149
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:23,631
L guess he could talk
the Fire Lord to death.

150
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,850
Ooh!

151
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,665
Maybe l can shock yo
u into the Avatar State.

152
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,538
L love surprises.

153
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:35,174
(shrieking)

154
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,267
(yells)

155
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,712
Still not glowing.

156
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,648
Uh... Uh... Ahh!

157
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,283
You are wearing a
ceremonial piece of clothing

158
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,658
from each of the bending nations.

159
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:55,781
Now, l will join the
four elements into one!

160
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:57,025
Water...

161
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:58,133
Earth...

162
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,541
Fire...

163
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:00,817
Air...

164
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:04,633
Four elements together as one!

165
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,750
This is just mud.

166
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:10,064
So, do you feel anything?

167
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,138
(sneezes)

168
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:18,465
We have to find a way.

169
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,056
Look at these magnificent shells.

170
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,558
L'll enjoy these keepsakes
for years to come.

171
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:30,685
We don't need any more useless things.

172
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,960
You forget, we have to carry
everything ourselves now.

173
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:35,406
Hello, brother.

174
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,002
Uncle.

175
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,971
What are you doing here?

176
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,035
Ln my country, we
exchange a pleasant 'hello'

177
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:42,824
before asking questions.

178
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,127
Have you become

179
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:46,346
uncivilized so soon, Zuzu?

180
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:47,914
Don't call me that!

181
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,350
To what do we owe this honor?

182
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:52,919
Hmm. Must be a family trait.

183
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,321
Both of you so quick
to get to the point.

184
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,522
L've come

185
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,024
with a message from home.

186
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,359
Father's changed his mind.

187
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,328
Family is suddenly
very important to him.

188
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,664
He's heard rumors of
plans to overthrow him,

189
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,133
treacherous plots.

190
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:11,271
Family are the only ones
you can really trust.

191
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:13,940
Father regrets your banishment.

192
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:15,909
He wants you home.

193
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:18,942
Did you hear me?

194
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:20,413
You should be happy.

195
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,415
Excited. Grateful.

196
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,350
L just gave you great news.

197
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,343
L'm sure your brother
simply needs a moment to...

198
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:28,688
Don't interrupt, Uncle!

199
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,090
L still haven't heard my thank you.

200
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,525
L'm not a messenger.

201
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,093
L didn't have to come all this way.

202
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,528
Father regrets?

203
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,531
He... wants me back?

204
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,534
L can see you need time to take this in.

205
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,536
L'll come to call on you tomorrow.

206
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,587
Good evening.

207
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:49,542
KATARA: Can we talk about something?

208
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,593
AANG: Sure.

209
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:53,012
Do you remember when we
were at the Air Templee

210
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,881
and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton?

211
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:58,551
Lt must have been so
horrible and traumatic for you.

212
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:02,088
L saw you get so upset that
you weren't even you anymore.

213
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,457
L'm not saying the
Avatar State doesn't have

214
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,426
incredible- and
helpful- power,

215
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,262
but you have to understand,

216
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,264
for the people who love you,

217
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:13,266
watching you be in
that much rage and pain

218
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,269
is really scary.

219
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,838
L'm really glad you told me that.

220
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,840
But l still need to do this.

221
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,141
L don't understand.

222
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,976
No, you don't.

223
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,172
Every day more and more people die.

224
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,648
L'm already a hundred years late.

225
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,649
Defeating the Fire Lord

226
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,651
is the only way to stop this war.

227
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,176
L have to try it.

228
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,655
L can't watch you do this to yourself.

229
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:37,657
L'm not coming tomorrow.

230
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,659
Good night.

231
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,994
Good night.

232
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,996
ZUKO: We're going home.

233
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,398
After three long years.

234
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,400
Lt's unbelievable.

235
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,969
Lt is unbelievable.

236
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,373
L have never known my
brother to regret anything.

237
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:55,875
Did you listen to Azula?

238
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,311
Father's realized how
important family is to him.

239
00:12:58,312 --> 00:12:59,112
He cares about me.

240
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,314
L care about you.

241
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,283
And if Ozai wants you back,

242
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:06,185
well, l think it may not
be for the reasons

243
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,387
you imagine.

244
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,389
You don't know how my
father feels about me.

245
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,356
You don't know anything.

246
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:13,893
Zuko, l only meant that, in our family,

247
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,896
things are not always what they seem.

248
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,899
L think you are
exactly what you seem...

249
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,568
a lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man

250
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,679
who's always been
jealous of his brother.

251
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:39,335
(yells)

252
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,558
(gasps)

253
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,428
Sokka, Sokka, wake up.

254
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:49,395
Huh?

255
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,397
L don't think we should be trying

256
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:52,899
to bring on the Avatar State.

257
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,600
You sure? Yes.

258
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,002
Okay.

259
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,471
Do you think the General will be mad?

260
00:13:58,472 --> 00:13:59,572
What can he say?

261
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:00,540
You're the Avatar.

262
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,408
Who knows better than you?

263
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:13,219
Wait. Don't leave without me.

264
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,155
Uncle, you've changed your mind.

265
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,488
Family sticks together, right?

266
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,294
We're finally going home.

267
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,205
AANG: The
thing is...

268
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,875
l don't think we'll ever be
able to trigger it on purpose.

269
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,477
So l guess that's it.

270
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,412
Sure l can't change your mind?

271
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:40,980
L'm sure.

272
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,015
L can only reach the Avatar State

273
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,317
when l'm in genuine danger.

274
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,152
L see.

275
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,121
L was afraid you'd say that.

276
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:52,959
Aang!

277
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,053
(yelling)

278
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,098
Men, attack the Avatar!

279
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:18,951
What are you doing?

280
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,546
L believe we are about to get results.

281
00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:30,363
L'm not your enemy.

282
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,734
L won't fight you.

283
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:10,603
You can't run forever.

284
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,333
You can't fight forever.

285
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:32,525
Brother, Uncle...

286
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,894
Welcome.

287
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:37,064
L'm so glad you decided to come.

288
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,403
Are we ready to depart, Your Highness?

289
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:43,536
Set our course for home, Captain.

290
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,371
Home.

291
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,839
You heard the Princess.

292
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,357
Raise the anchors.

293
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,843
We're taking the prisoners home.

294
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,338
Your Highness, l...

295
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,856
You lied to me.

296
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,121
Like l've never done that before.

297
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,857
(yelling)

298
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:15,835
l wonder what crazy
thing they're trying now.

299
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,999
(rumbling)

300
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,873
Maybe we should just
make sure Aang's okay.

301
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,611
What's going on?

302
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,213
The General's gone crazy.

303
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,581
He's trying to force Aang

304
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,846
into the Avatar State.

305
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,027
Good bird-horse thingie.

306
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:47,501
(roaring)

307
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:52,052
Maybe you can avoid me, but she can't.

308
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,279
(yells)

309
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,916
(grunts)

310
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,967
l can't move.

311
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,346
Don't hurt her.

312
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:12,158
) (yells

313
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,252
Katara, no!

314
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,533
Stop this.

315
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:21,967
You have to let her go.

316
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,804
You could save her if you
were in the Avatar State.

317
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:27,406
L'm trying. l'm trying!

318
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,408
Aang, l'm sinking.

319
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,502
L don't see glowing.

320
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,130
(screaming)

321
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:34,880
Please!

322
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,349
You don't need to do this!

323
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,317
Apparently...

324
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,580
l do.

325
00:18:45,577 --> 00:18:47,626
Lt worked.

326
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,152
Lt worked!

327
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,499
(yells)

328
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,248
Zuko, let's go!

329
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,162
You know, Father blames Uncle
for the loss at the North Pole.

330
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,598
And he considers you
a miserable failure

331
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,433
for not finding the Avatar.

332
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,235
Why would he want you back home

333
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,998
except to lock you up

334
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:32,872
where you can no longer embarrass him?

335
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:35,034
(grunting)

336
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,443
(yells)

337
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:13,646
Avatar Aang,

338
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,015
can you hear me?

339
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:18,017
Your friend is safe.

340
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:21,320
Lt was just a trick
to trigger the Avatar State.

341
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,482
And it worked!

342
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,103
Lt's time you learned.

343
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,022
The Avatar State is
a defense mechanism

344
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,191
designed to empower you
with the skills and knowledge

345
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,626
of all the first Avatars.

346
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:06,232
The glow is the combination
of all your past lives

347
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:11,471
focusing their energy
through your body.

348
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:15,306
Ln the Avatar State,

349
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,600
you're at your most powerful...

350
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,915
but you're also at
your most vulnerable.

351
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,116
What do you mean?

352
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,386
Lf you are killed in the Avatar State,

353
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,990
the reincarnation cycle will be broken

354
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:34,358
and the Avatar will cease to exist.

355
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,512
L'm sorry, Katara.

356
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:56,482
L hope you never have to
see me like that again.

357
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,983
Ha. Are you joking?

358
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,318
That was almost perfect.

359
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,920
We just have to find out a way

360
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:02,354
to control you when you're like that.

361
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,879
You're out of your mind.

362
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:06,994
L guess we'll figure it out
on the way to the Fire Nation.

363
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,015
Anybody got a problem with that?

364
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:13,559
Do you still want an escort to Omashu?

365
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,198
L think we're all set.

366
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,475
Anyone who harbors these traitors

367
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:26,045
will face the wrath of the Fire Lord.

368
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:27,172
(gasps)

369
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:30,247
There will be no place left to hide.

370
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:34,419
(panting)

371
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:37,924
l think we 're safe here.
