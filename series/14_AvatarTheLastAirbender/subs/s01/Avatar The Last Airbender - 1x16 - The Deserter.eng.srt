1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,629
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,339
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,674
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,468
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:18,726
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:23,689
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

10
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,984
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:31,197
<i>100 years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,865
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

13
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,243
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

14
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,828
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,913
Oof.

16
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:42,250
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

17
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:06,857
This should give us a good idea
of what's around here.

18
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,063
See if you can find a menu.

19
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,360
I'm starving.

20
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:11,279
I bet we'll find something
to eat here...

21
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,322
The Fire Days Festival.

22
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,575
Fire Nation cultural exhibits,

23
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,577
jugglers, benders, magicians...

24
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,539
This would be a great place for me
to study some real firebenders.

25
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:22,957
You might want to rethink that.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,041
Look at this.

27
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,419
Hey, a poster of me!

28
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,004
A wanted poster.

29
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:29,714
This is bad.

30
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,966
I think we better keep moving.

31
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,093
I have to learn firebending
at some point,

32
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,805
and this could be my only chance
to watch some masters up close.

33
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,599
I guess we could go check it out.

34
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,058
What?

35
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,727
You want to walk into
a Fire Nation town

36
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,730
when they're all fired up
with all their, you know, fire?

37
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,189
We'll wear disguises.

38
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,834
And if it looks like trouble,
we'll leave.

39
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,026
Yeah.

40
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,737
Because we always leave
before we get into trouble.

41
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,916
You guys stay out of sight here
while we go to the festival.

42
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,301
Ready disguises.

43
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,311
It's like you're a whole
different person.

44
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:26,771
Let's go!

45
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,072
Ha ha ha ha!

46
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,247
I think we need
some new disguises.

47
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,667
Where are we gonna get
masks like that?

48
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,587
Get your genuine
Fire-Festival masks here!

49
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,798
That was surprisingly easy.

50
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:05,226
Hey, there's some food.

51
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,310
Finally!

52
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,020
What do you have?

53
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,230
Flaming fire flakes.

54
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:10,356
Best in town.

55
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,440
I'll take 'em.

56
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,692
Mmm! Mmm!

57
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,277
Oh, hot, hot!

58
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,030
Flaming fire flakes, hot.

59
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,115
What do you know?

60
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,199
Hey, look at this!

61
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,704
Don't worry, loyal citizens,

62
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:27,957
no one can surprise the Fire Lord!

63
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:29,792
- Oh, no!
- Look out!

64
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:37,341
Aang, hold on.

65
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,551
Where are we going?

66
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:39,635
I don't know...

67
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,887
But there's a big crowd,
so it must be good.

68
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,156
Knowing the Fire Nation,

69
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,598
it's probably an execution.

70
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,316
I gotta learn that trick.

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,526
Thank you!

72
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:56,652
For my next trick,

73
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,696
I need a volunteer from the audience.

74
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,197
Ooh, ooh! Me! Me!

75
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,782
What do you think you're doing?

76
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,534
I want to get a closer look.

77
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:06,746
It's better that we don't attract
any attention to ourselves.

78
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,622
How about you, little lady?

79
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,749
Uh...

80
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,792
Aw, she's shy.

81
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,587
Let's give her some
encouragement, folks.

82
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:19,550
Aw, that could have been me.

83
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,849
This next trick is called
Taming the Dragon!

84
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:28,768
You will be my captured princess.

85
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:41,197
Don't worry, young maiden!

86
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,408
I will tame this fiery beast!

87
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:51,040
It's too strong!

88
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,124
I can't hold it!

89
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,876
We gotta help her!

90
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,586
No, we don't want to make a scene.

91
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:58,005
The rope... It's breaking!

92
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:10,726
Hey, you trying to upstage me, kid?

93
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,110
Hey! That kid's the Avatar!

94
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,659
I think it's time to go.

95
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:27,785
Follow me!

96
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:28,994
I can get you out of here!

97
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,079
There they are!

98
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:40,589
Over there!

99
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm calling Appa.

100
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:49,807
I hope he can really hear
that bison whistle!

101
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,058
This way!

102
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,854
Ok, not this way.

103
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,695
Huh?

104
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,662
Appa, down here!

105
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,642
Beautiful!

106
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,648
Nice touch setting off the fireworks.

107
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,775
You seem to really know
your explosives.

108
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,860
I'm familiar.

109
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,695
You're a Fire Nation soldier.

110
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:45,863
Was.

111
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:47,406
My name's Chey.

112
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,577
I serve a man...

113
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,828
More than a man, really,

114
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,996
he's a myth...

115
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,040
But he's real, a living legend...

116
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,958
Jeong Jeong the Deserter.

117
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,127
He was a Fire Nation general.

118
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,254
Or wait... Was he an admiral?

119
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,381
He was very highly ranked. We get it.

120
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:06,216
Yeah! Way up there!

121
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,177
But he couldn't take
the madness anymore.

122
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,180
He's the first person ever
to leave the army and live.

123
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,641
I'm the second, but you don't
get to be a legend for that.

124
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,725
It's ok, though.

125
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,269
Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius.

126
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,771
Some say he's mad,

127
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,272
but he's not.

128
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,732
He's enlightened.

129
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:23,400
You mean there's a firebender out here

130
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,902
who's not with the Fire Lord?

131
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,153
We've gotta go see him!

132
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:27,237
He can train me!

133
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,990
We're not gonna go find
some crazy firebender.

134
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,784
He's not crazy!

135
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:33,577
He's a genius!

136
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,163
And he's the perfect person
to train the Avatar.

137
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:38,499
That's why I followed you
into the festival.

138
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:39,959
Look, thanks for the help,

139
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,211
but we're leaving for the North Pole
in the morning.

140
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:46,507
Sokka, this could be my only chance
to meet a firebending master

141
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,926
who would actually be willing
to teach me.

142
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:50,719
It can't hurt just to talk to him.

143
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,263
That's what you said about
going to the festival!

144
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,349
Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me?

145
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,352
Aagh!

146
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,190
Don't move.

147
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,617
Jeong Jeong told you
not to look for Avatar.

148
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,369
Hold on. You know these guys?

149
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,578
Oh, yeah.

150
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,871
Lin Ye's an old buddy.

151
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,081
Right, Lin Ye?

152
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:20,582
Shut up. Keep moving.

153
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,761
Go on. He sees you only.

154
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,054
Oh, that's ok.

155
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,431
We can chat later.

156
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,890
Is that where Jeong Jeong is?

157
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,559
I need to talk to him right away.

158
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,269
No. You wait there.

159
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:41,937
Go, now!

160
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,189
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

161
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,899
He's a great man.

162
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,234
A great man!

163
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,949
So, the Avatar was here

164
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,492
and you let him slip away?

165
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:56,827
Yes, sir.

166
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,371
But other than that,
the festival went off without a hitch.

167
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,791
No fights. Theft was way down.

168
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,627
I don't care
about your local crime rates!

169
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,379
Which way did they go?

170
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,048
They headed into the forest.

171
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:10,549
Up the river, I suspect.

172
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,634
Ready the riverboats.

173
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,803
We're going after the Avatar.

174
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,106
What happened?
Can I see Jeong Jeong now?

175
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,524
He won't see you.

176
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,735
He's very angry
that I brought you here.

177
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,320
He wants you to leave immediately.

178
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:33,238
Finally! Let's hit the road.

179
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,782
Why won't he see me?

180
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:36,742
He says you're not ready.

181
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,578
Says you haven't mastered
waterbending and earthbending yet.

182
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,330
Wait, how does he know that?

183
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,665
He saw the way you walked into camp.

184
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,000
He can tell.

185
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,293
I'm going in anyway.

186
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,763
Get out!

187
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:03,477
Master, I need to learn firebending.

188
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,481
Only a fool seeks his own destruction.

189
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,274
I am the Avatar.

190
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,026
- It's my destiny to...
- Destiny?

191
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,362
What would a boy know of destiny?

192
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:16,115
If a fish lives its whole life
in this river,

193
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,950
does he know the river's destiny?

194
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,201
No!

195
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:22,287
Only that it runs on and on
out of his control.

196
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,997
He may follow where it flows,

197
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,375
but he cannot see the end.

198
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,752
He cannot imagine the ocean.

199
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,088
Ok...

200
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:32,548
But it's the Avatar's duty

201
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,883
to master all of
the bending disciplines.

202
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,136
To master the bending disciplines,

203
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,055
you must first master
discipline itself.

204
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,890
But you have no interest in this,

205
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,517
so I have no interest in you.

206
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,644
Now, get out.

207
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,272
Please, I have to learn.

208
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:49,940
This could be my only chance.

209
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:51,567
Are you deaf?

210
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,028
How can I teach you
if you refuse to listen?

211
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,864
Before learning firebending,

212
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,032
you must learn water and earth.

213
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,160
Water is cool and soothing.

214
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,162
Earth is steady and stable.

215
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,580
But fire...

216
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,373
Fire is alive.

217
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,667
It breathes, it grows.

218
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,336
Without the bender,
a rock will not throw itself.

219
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,838
But fire will spread

220
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,048
and destroy everything in its path

221
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,801
if one does not have
the will to control it!

222
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,678
That is its destiny.

223
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,180
You are not ready!

224
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,265
You are too weak!

225
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,521
You think I am weak?

226
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,273
Avatar Roku!

227
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:32,482
No, no!

228
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,692
I did not mean that.

229
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:35,319
I have mastered the elements

230
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:38,614
a thousand times
in a thousand lifetimes.

231
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,408
Now, I must do it once again.

232
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,996
You will teach the Avatar firebending.

233
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,414
Yes, yes.

234
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,708
I will teach you.

235
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,792
Really?

236
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,252
That's great!

237
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,677
Widen your stance.

238
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,014
Wider!

239
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,307
Bend your knees.

240
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,850
Now, concentrate.

241
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,186
Good. Good!

242
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,562
Wait. What do I do now?

243
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,774
Silence! Talking is not concentrating.

244
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:15,901
Look at your friend. Is she talking?

245
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,320
Even that oaf knows to concentrate
on what he's doing.

246
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:19,404
Hey!

247
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,698
But what am I concentrating on?

248
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,284
Feel the heat of the sun.

249
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,578
It is the greatest source of fire,

250
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,289
yet it is in complete balance
with nature.

251
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,999
So, when do I get to make some fire?

252
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,918
Concentrate!

253
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,657
Are we coming up here
so I don't burn anything

254
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,682
with my fire blasts?

255
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,350
No fire yet.

256
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:49,518
What?

257
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,272
Power in firebending
comes from the breath.

258
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,024
That is why you must master
proper breath control.

259
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:58,694
You brought me up here to breathe?

260
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,279
Assume your stance.

261
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,405
Wider.

262
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:02,757
- You're not even look...
- Wider!

263
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06,034
Now, inhale through the nose
and exhale through the mouth...

264
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,119
Without talking.

265
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,458
Good. Keep going.

266
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,321
What are you doing here?

267
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,888
I did not tell you to stop!

268
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,557
I've been breathing for hours.

269
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,684
You want to stop breathing?

270
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,186
I want you to stop wasting my time.

271
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,105
I already know
how to squat and breathe

272
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:36,273
and feel the sun.

273
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:39,234
I want to know how to shoot fire
out of my fingertips.

274
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:43,030
I had a pupil once

275
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,283
who had no interest
in learning discipline.

276
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:49,244
He was only concerned
with the power of fire...

277
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,538
How he could use it
to destroy his opponents

278
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,875
and wipe out the obstacles
in his path,

279
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,878
but fire is a horrible burden to bear.

280
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,921
Its nature is to consume,

281
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,925
and without control,
it destroys everything around it.

282
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,773
Learn restraint,

283
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,401
or risk destroying yourself
and everything you love.

284
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,829
I thought about what you said.

285
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,581
I promise I'll be more patient.

286
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,959
We're going to work with fire now.

287
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,169
Oh, yeah!

288
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,464
I mean...

289
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:43,548
Let us begin.

290
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,887
Concentrate on the fire.

291
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:51,932
I want you to keep this flame
from reaching the edges of the leaf

292
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,059
for as long as you can.

293
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,354
Master, there is trouble!

294
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:58,814
What's going on?!

295
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,357
Concentrate on your leaf.

296
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,859
This is the worst
firebending instruction ever.

297
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,986
All he does
is leave me alone for hours

298
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,738
to concentrate or breathe.

299
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,615
I'm sure there's a good reason.

300
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,992
But I'm ready to do so much more.

301
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:26,716
I did it. I made fire!

302
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,052
Aang, that's great.

303
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,679
But you should take it slow.

304
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,139
- Whoa!
- Careful!

305
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,723
Aagh!

306
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,517
Now, that's firebending.

307
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,354
Aang, you'll hurt yourself.

308
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:46,278
I wonder how that juggler did it.

309
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:53,952
Katara!

310
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,454
I'm so sorry!

311
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,457
Katara, what's wrong?

312
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,958
What did you do?

313
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,543
It was an accident!

314
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,295
I was... Uh! Katara, I'm so...

315
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,190
I told you we shouldn't
mess around with this!

316
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:07,299
Look what you did!

317
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,301
You burned my sister!

318
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,067
You burned my sister!

319
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,986
This is all your fault!

320
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,821
I know! Now, pack your things.

321
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,573
You must leave immediately.

322
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,742
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,118
I didn't...

324
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,536
I'm sorry!

325
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,193
You have healing abilities.

326
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:12,948
The great benders of the Water Tribes
sometimes have this ability.

327
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,992
I've always wished
I were blessed like you...

328
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,662
Free from this burning curse.

329
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,622
But you're a great master.

330
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,457
You have powers I'll never know.

331
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,669
Water brings healing and life.

332
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:29,005
But fire brings only destruction
and pain.

333
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,550
It forces those of us
burdened with its care

334
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:36,012
to walk a razor's edge
between humanity and savagery.

335
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,307
Eventually we're torn apart.

336
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:48,441
Go get your friends and flee!

337
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,403
Do not come back here
or you will all be destroyed!

338
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:52,737
Hurry!

339
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,591
Don't worry, men.

340
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,760
My old teacher gave up fighting
a long time ago...

341
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:19,347
Haven't you, Master Jeong Jeong?

342
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,064
Katara, are you all right?

343
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,357
I'm fine.

344
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,650
We've gotta get out of here.

345
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,901
Where's Aang?

346
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:42,162
Jeong Jeong tried to tell me
that I wasn't ready.

347
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:43,788
I wouldn't listen.

348
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,749
I'm never gonna firebend again.

349
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,417
You'll have to eventually.

350
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,669
No, never again.

351
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,921
It's ok, Aang. I'm healed.

352
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,632
What? How?

353
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,175
I'll explain later.

354
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:56,968
But, right now,
we have to get out of here.

355
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,220
Zhao and his soldiers are attacking.

356
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,347
Where?

357
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:01,681
By the river.

358
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,266
They captured Jeong Jeong.

359
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,976
I have to help him!

360
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,895
Look at you.

361
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:10,148
You were once so great.

362
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:12,275
I can't believe my former master

363
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,070
has become nothing more
than a simple savage.

364
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,864
It is you who have embraced
savagery, Zhao.

365
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,492
It's Admiral Zhao now.

366
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:23,536
That title will not help you
against the Avatar.

367
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,996
Do not try to fight him.

368
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,748
You are no match.

369
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,042
I think I can handle a child.

370
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,004
I have never seen such raw power.

371
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:35,340
Jeong Jeong!

372
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:36,508
We'll see.

373
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,259
Men, take The Deserter.

374
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,727
It's a trick!

375
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,062
He's run off into the woods.

376
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,647
Find him!

377
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:55,193
Let's find out what my old master
has taught you.

378
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,028
You were Jeong Jeong's student?

379
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,988
Until I got bored.

380
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,663
I see he taught you
how to duck and run like a coward,

381
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:10,667
but I doubt he showed you
what a firebender is truly capable of!

382
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:15,755
Whoa! Wild shot!

383
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,716
I'll show you wild!

384
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,474
No self-control.

385
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,687
Stand and fight, Avatar!

386
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,230
Oh, were we fighting?

387
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:34,107
I thought you were
just getting warmed up.

388
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,316
I was.

389
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,195
Is that all you got?

390
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,781
Man, they'll make anyone
an admiral these days.

391
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,080
Ahoy!

392
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,790
I'm Admiral Zhao.

393
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:02,427
I don't know why, but I thought
you'd be better than Zuko.

394
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,678
Aagh!

395
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:07,182
Sloppy.

396
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,100
Very sloppy.

397
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:22,405
Nowhere to run now,

398
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,282
you little smart mouth.

399
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,329
You've lost this battle.

400
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,499
Are you crazy?

401
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:34,334
You haven't thrown a single blow.

402
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,461
No, but you have.

403
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,636
Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.

404
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,022
Have a nice walk home!

405
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:57,398
Aang, come on!

406
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,691
Let's go!

407
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:03,196
Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?

408
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,864
He disappeared.

409
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,157
They all did.

410
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,708
Hey, where'd everybody go?

411
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,211
Very funny, guys!

412
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,222
Aang, you're burned.

413
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:32,725
Let me help you.

414
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:47,031
Wow! That's good water.

415
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,242
When did you learn how to do that?

416
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:50,535
I guess I always knew.

417
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:52,370
Oh. Well, then,

418
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:54,223
thanks for all the first aid
over the years...

419
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,207
Like, when I fell into
the greaseberry bramble,

420
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,168
and that time I had two fishhooks
in my thumb!

421
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,461
Two?

422
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,423
He tried to get the first fishhook out
with another fishhook.

423
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:06,134
Oh, and the time
that mink snake bit me.

424
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,760
Thanks for healing that up.

425
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,804
That's great. Really helpful.
