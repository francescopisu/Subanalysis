1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,797
<i>Water, earth,</i>

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>fire, air...</i>

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

4
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:18,726
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,689
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

6
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

7
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,984
<i>he vanished.</i>

8
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:31,197
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,865
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

10
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,243
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

11
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,995
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,250
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

13
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,570
Great. You're back. What's for dinner?

14
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,071
We've got a few options.

15
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:16,158
First, round nuts and some kind of
oval-shaped nuts.

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,537
And some rock-shaped nuts
that might just be rocks.

17
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:23,374
Dig in.

18
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,043
Seriously, what else you got?

19
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,970
What was that?

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,769
It's coming from over there.

21
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,815
Shouldn't we run away from
huge booms, not toward them?

22
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,576
Hyah.

23
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,202
An earthbender.

24
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,454
Let's go meet him.

25
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:03,998
He looks dangerous,
so we better approach cautiously.

26
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:06,250
Hello there! I'm Katara.

27
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,752
What's your name?

28
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:09,170
Ah!

29
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:17,970
Nice to meet you!

30
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,847
I just wanted to say hi.

31
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,308
Hey, that guy's
got to be running somewhere.

32
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:23,934
Maybe we're near a village.

33
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,354
And I bet that village has a market.

34
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,439
Which means no nuts for dinner.

35
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:30,608
Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts.

36
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,486
Yeah, I hate them, too.

37
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:43,454
Great hat.

38
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,081
I'll trade you some nuts for it.

39
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,835
Hey!

40
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,171
Hi, Mom.

41
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:53,464
Where have you been, Haru?

42
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:54,548
You're late!

43
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,384
Get started on your chores.

44
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,260
Hey! You're that kid.

45
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,345
Ah!

46
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:00,530
Why did you run away before?

47
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:03,349
Uh... You must have me confused
with some other kid.

48
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,185
No, she doesn't.
We saw you earthbending.

49
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,814
They saw you doing what?

50
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,399
They're crazy, Mom.

51
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,983
I mean, look at how they're dressed.

52
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:17,321
You know how dangerous that is.

53
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,616
You know what would happen
if they caught you earthbending.

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,034
Open up!

55
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,664
Fire Nation. Act natural.

56
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,675
Aah!

57
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,178
What do you want?
I've already paid you this week.

58
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,847
The tax just doubled.

59
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,182
We wouldn't want an accident,
would we?

60
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:49,520
Fire is sometimes so hard to control.

61
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,613
You can keep the copper ones.

62
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,411
Nice guy.

63
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:07,288
How long has
the Fire Nation been here?

64
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,249
Five years. Fire Lord Ozai

65
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:13,085
uses our town's coal mines
to fuel his ships.

66
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,713
They're thugs. They steal from us.

67
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,548
And everyone here
is too much of a coward

68
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,883
to do anything about it.

69
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,009
Quiet, Haru!

70
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,552
Don't talk like that!

71
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,012
But Haru's an earthbender.

72
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,096
He can help.

73
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,307
Earthbending is forbidden.

74
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,642
It's caused nothing
but misery for this village.

75
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,103
He must never use his abilities.

76
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,772
How can you say that?

77
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,565
Haru has a gift.

78
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,192
Asking him not to earthbend

79
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,569
is like asking me not to waterbend.

80
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:39,945
It's a part of who we are.

81
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,739
You don't understand.

82
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,909
I understand that Haru can help
you fight back.

83
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:46,494
What can the Fire Nation do to you

84
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,995
that they haven't done already?

85
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:50,623
They could take Haru away,

86
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,541
like they took his father.

87
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:02,551
My mom said
you can sleep here tonight.

88
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,637
But you should leave in the morning.

89
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,515
Thanks. I'll make sure
Appa doesn't eat all your hay.

90
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,648
I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

91
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,191
I didn't know about your father.

92
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,609
That's ok.

93
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,238
It's funny. The way you were talking
back in the store,

94
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:24,198
it reminded me of him.

95
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,282
Thanks.

96
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:26,992
My father was very courageous.

97
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,953
When the Fire Nation invaded,

98
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,580
he and the other earthbenders
were outnumbered ten to one.

99
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,165
But they fought back anyway.

100
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,167
He sounds like a great man.

101
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,629
After the attack,
they rounded up my father

102
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,381
and every other earthbender

103
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:43,467
and took them away.
We haven't seen them since.

104
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:45,636
So that's why
you hide your earthbending.

105
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,720
Yeah.

106
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:49,056
The problem is,

107
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,643
the only way I can feel close
to my father now

108
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,854
is when I practice my bending.

109
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,898
He taught me everything I know.

110
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,360
See this necklace?

111
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,903
My mother gave it to me.

112
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,280
It's beautiful.

113
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,366
I lost my mother
in a Fire Nation raid.

114
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,009
This necklace is all
I have left of her.

115
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,203
It's not enough, is it?

116
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,454
No.

117
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,211
Aah! Help!

118
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,296
The mine!

119
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,089
Aah...

120
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,842
Help me!

121
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:32,766
Ah! It's not working.

122
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,143
We have to get help.

123
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,770
There's no time. Pull harder!

124
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,440
Haru, there's a way you can help him.

125
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:40,774
I can't.

126
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,985
Please. There's no one around
to see you.

127
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,445
It's the only way!

128
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:55,080
Ah!

129
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,709
Haru, you did it!

130
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,845
It was so brave of Haru
to use his earthbending

131
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,096
to help that old man.

132
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,432
You must have really inspired him.

133
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:14,558
I guess so.

134
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,060
Everyone should get some sleep.

135
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,227
We're leaving at dawn.

136
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,271
Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once?

137
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,773
Absolutely not!

138
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,900
This village is crawling
with Fire Nation troops.

139
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,735
If they discover you're here, Aang,

140
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,378
we'll be eating fireballs
for breakfast.

141
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:27,571
Good night.

142
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,865
I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.

143
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,283
Good night.

144
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,015
Ah!

145
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,225
That's him!

146
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,268
That's the earthbender!

147
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,728
Aah!

148
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,133
They took him!

149
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,552
- They took Haru away!
- What?

150
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,512
The old man turned him in
to the Fire Nation.

151
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,889
It's all my fault.
I forced him into earthbending.

152
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,559
Slow down, Katara.
When did this happen?

153
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,437
Haru's mother said
they came for him at midnight.

154
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,248
Then it's too late to track him.
He's long gone.

155
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,648
We don't need to track him.

156
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,234
The Fire Nation is going to
take me right to Haru.

157
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,862
And why would they do that?

158
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:53,157
Because they're going to arrest me
for earthbending.

159
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:58,078
I thought you were
crazy at first, Katara,

160
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,246
but this might work.

161
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:01,457
There are ventilation shafts
throughout these mines.

162
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,208
All Aang has to do is
send an air current

163
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,127
from that vent to this one right here.

164
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,546
The boulder levitates and ta-da...

165
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:08,922
Fake earthbending.

166
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,424
Aang, did you get all that?

167
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,551
Sure, sure. I got it.

168
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:14,136
Do you remember your cue?

169
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,221
Yeah, yeah. Just relax.

170
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,140
You're taking all the fun out of this.

171
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:20,809
By "this" do you mean
intentionally being captured

172
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,728
by an army of ruthless firebenders?

173
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:25,272
Exactly. That's fun stuff.

174
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,900
Here they come.
Get in your places.

175
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,905
Uh! Get out of my way, pipsqueak.

176
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:37,493
How dare you call me pipsqueak,
you giant-eared cretin?

177
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,119
What did you call me?

178
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,246
A giant-eared cretin.

179
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,664
Look at those things.

180
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,167
Do herds of animals
use them for shade?

181
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,336
You better back off!

182
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:48,587
Seriously, back off.

183
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,464
I will not back off!

184
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:52,049
I bet elephants get together

185
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:55,010
and make fun of
how large your ears are.

186
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,513
That's it! You're going down.

187
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,848
I'll show you who's boss,

188
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,434
earthbending style.

189
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:09,149
I said, "earthbending style!"

190
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:15,906
That lemur. He's earthbending.

191
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,952
No, you idiot. It's the girl.

192
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:22,412
Oh. Of course.

193
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,873
I'll hold her!

194
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,209
You've got 12 hours
to find Haru.

195
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:29,169
We'll be right behind you.

196
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,513
Momo, you have some big ears.

197
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:21,555
She'll be fine, Aang.
Katara knows what she's doing.

198
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,691
Earthbenders,
it is my pleasure to welcome you

199
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:35,027
aboard my modest shipyard.

200
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,529
I am your warden.

201
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,949
I prefer to think of you
not as prisoners,

202
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,327
but as honored guests.

203
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,621
And I hope you come to think of me

204
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,374
as your humble and caring host.

205
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,586
You will succeed here
if you simply abide...

206
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:56,840
Hyah!

207
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,471
What kind of guest dishonors his host
by interrupting him?

208
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,972
Take him below.

209
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:08,018
One week in solitary
will improve his manners.

210
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:11,647
Simply treat me with the courtesy
I give you

211
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,317
and we'll get along famously.

212
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,736
You will notice, earthbenders,

213
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:21,240
that this rig is made
entirely of metal.

214
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,285
You are miles away
from any rock or earth.

215
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,455
So, if you have any illusions
about employing

216
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:31,708
that brutish savagery
that passes for bending

217
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,711
among you people, forget them.

218
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:38,006
It is impossible.

219
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,425
Good day.

220
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,119
Katara?

221
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,328
Haru!

222
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,496
What are you doing here?

223
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,957
It's my fault you were captured.

224
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:13,625
I came to rescue you.

225
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,627
So you got yourself arrested?

226
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,671
It was the only way to find you.

227
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:20,215
You've got guts, Katara.
I'll give you that.

228
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,302
Come on. There's someone
I want you to meet.

229
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,431
Katara, this is my father, Tyro.

230
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,684
Dad, this is Katara.

231
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,060
It's an honor to meet you.

232
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,522
Have some dinner, Katara.

233
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,858
Ew.

234
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,027
It's not as bad as it looks.

235
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:43,613
Eew!

236
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,615
It's still pretty bad, though.

237
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,326
Tyro, the prisoners are complaining

238
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,244
there aren't enough blankets
to go around.

239
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,912
I'll talk to the guards.

240
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,957
In the meantime, make sure
the elderly are taken care of.

241
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,710
The rest of us will simply have to
hope for warmer weather.

242
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:58,211
If you don't mind me asking,

243
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,504
what's your escape plan?

244
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,589
Excuse me?

245
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,300
You know, the plan
to get everyone off the rig?

246
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,093
What is it? Mutiny, sabotage?

247
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,305
The plan? The plan is to survive,

248
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:10,932
wait out this war, hope that one day

249
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,852
some of us can get back home
and forget this ever happened.

250
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:15,812
How can you say that?

251
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,416
You sound like
you've already given up.

252
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,400
Katara, I admire your courage.

253
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,569
And I envy your youth.

254
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,197
But people's lives are at stake here.

255
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,532
The warden is a ruthless man,

256
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,951
and he won't stand for any rebellion.

257
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm sorry, but we're powerless.

258
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,664
We'll see about that.

259
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,504
Earthbenders!

260
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:43,298
You don't know me, but I know of you.

261
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,635
Every child in my water tribe village
was rocked to sleep

262
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:49,054
with stories of the brave
Earth Kingdom

263
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:52,182
and the courageous earthbenders
who guard its borders.

264
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,768
Some of you may think
that the Fire Nation

265
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:56,311
has made you powerless.

266
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:59,564
Yes. They have taken away
your ability to bend.

267
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,067
But they can't take away your courage.

268
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,569
And it is your courage
they should truly fear,

269
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,988
because it runs deeper than any mine

270
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,532
you've been forced to dig,

271
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:11,201
any ocean that keeps you
far from home.

272
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:13,120
It is the strength of your hearts

273
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,704
that make you who you are,

274
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,166
hearts that will remain unbroken
when all rock and stone

275
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,459
has eroded away.

276
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,170
The time to fight back is now!

277
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,465
I can tell you
the Avatar has returned!

278
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,717
So remember your courage,
earthbenders!

279
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,220
Let us fight for our freedom!

280
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,088
Ah!

281
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,381
Shh.

282
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,803
Your 12 hours are up. Where is Haru?

283
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,096
We've got to get out of here.

284
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,015
I can't.

285
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:17,517
We don't have much time.
There are guards everywhere.

286
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,894
Get on!

287
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:20,687
Katara, what's wrong?

288
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:22,397
I'm not leaving.

289
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,984
I'm not giving up on these people.

290
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:33,384
What do you mean,
you're not leaving?

291
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,494
We can't abandon these people.

292
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,204
There has to be a way to help them.

293
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,207
Maybe she's right.
What do you say, Sokka?

294
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,875
I say you're both crazy.

295
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:46,171
Last chance. We need to leave now.

296
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
No.

297
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:50,258
I hate when you get like this.

298
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,718
Come on, we better hide.

299
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,763
Go.

300
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,393
Look!

301
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:03,897
Tell me exactly what you saw.

302
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,899
Well, sir, it looked like
a flying bison.

303
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:06,983
What?

304
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,985
It was a giant, flying buffalo, sir,

305
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,111
with an empty saddle.

306
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,156
Which was it, a buffalo or a bison?

307
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,034
I'm not sure what the difference is,

308
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:18,078
but that's not really the point,
is it, sir?

309
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:21,206
I'll decide what the point is, fool!

310
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,458
Aah!

311
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,838
You! Wake up the captain!
Search the entire rig!

312
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,215
- Sir.
- What?

313
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,760
That was the captain
you just threw overboard, so...

314
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:36,179
Then wake up someone
I haven't thrown overboard

315
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,597
and search the rig.

316
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,767
There's something going on here,
and I don't like it.

317
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:51,236
We don't have much time.
What are we gonna do?

318
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,154
I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.

319
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,242
The warden would run away,
and we would steal his keys.

320
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,661
Wouldn't he just
take his keys with him?

321
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,830
I'm just tossing ideas around.

322
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,140
I tried talking the earthbenders

323
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:05,625
into fighting back,
but it didn't work.

324
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,712
If there was just a way
to help them help themselves.

325
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:12,299
For that they need some kind of
earth or some rock,

326
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,301
something they can bend.

327
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,094
But this entire place
is made of metal.

328
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,099
No, it's not. Look at the smoke.

329
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,019
I bet they're burning coal.

330
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,478
In other words...

331
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,022
Earth.

332
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,361
It's almost dawn.
We're running out of time.

333
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,946
You sure this is gonna work?

334
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,156
It should.

335
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,883
These vents reminded me
of our little trick

336
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:39,075
back at the village.

337
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,203
We're gonna do the same thing,
but on a much bigger scale.

338
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,998
There's a huge deposit of coal
at the base of this island.

339
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:46,791
And the whole system is ventilated.

340
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,085
Aang closed off
all the vents except one.

341
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,378
When he does his airbending,

342
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,172
the coal only has one place to go...

343
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,423
Right back here.

344
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,258
There's the intruder!

345
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,427
Stay back! I'm warning you!

346
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,597
Katara, stop.
You can't win this fight.

347
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:05,602
Listen to him well, child.

348
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,687
You're one mistake away

349
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,065
from dying where you stand.

350
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,796
Here's your chance, earthbenders!

351
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,465
Take it!
Your fate is in your own hands!

352
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,809
Foolish girl.

353
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:48,603
You thought a few inspirational words

354
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,273
and some coal
would change these people?

355
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,403
Look at these blank hopeless faces.

356
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,489
Their spirits were broken
a long time ago.

357
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,159
Oh, but you still believed in them.

358
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,412
How sweet.

359
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,082
They're a waste of your energy,
little girl.

360
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:11,626
You failed.

361
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,631
Grr.

362
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,676
Hyah!

363
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,225
Show no mercy!

364
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,813
Aah!

365
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:32,939
For the Earth Kingdom,

366
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,399
attack!

367
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,270
Get to the ship! We'll hold them off!

368
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,147
Do not let them escape!

369
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,277
Guys, throw me some coal!

370
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:36,586
No, please. I can't swim.

371
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:39,297
Don't worry. I hear cowards float.

372
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,227
I want to thank you for saving me,

373
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,603
for saving us.

374
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,647
All it took was a little coal.

375
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:58,149
It wasn't the coal, Katara.

376
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,692
It was you.

377
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,403
Thank you for helping me
find my courage,

378
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,155
Katara of the water tribe.

379
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,908
My family and everyone here

380
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:08,868
owes you much.

381
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,412
So, I guess you're going home now.

382
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,040
Yes, to take back my village.

383
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,459
To take back all of our villages!

384
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,711
The Fire Nation will regret the day

385
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,672
they set foot on our land!

386
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,132
Come with us.

387
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,342
I can't.

388
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,302
Your mission
is to take back your home.

389
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,056
Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.

390
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:32,183
That's him, isn't it? The Avatar.

391
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:38,022
Katara, thank you for bringing
my father back to me.

392
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,275
I never thought I'd see him again.

393
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,026
I only wish there was some way...

394
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,862
I know.

395
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,447
My mother's necklace! It's gone!
