1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,544
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:06,088
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,301
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:15,264
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:19,018
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,605
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,566
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:28,653
<i>100 years passed,</i>

12
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:30,988
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar,</i>

13
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,865
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

14
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>And although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,454
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

16
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

17
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:18,703
Absolutely not.

18
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:21,163
The Yuyan archers stay here.

19
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,083
Your request is denied,
Commander Zhao.

20
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,795
Colonel Shinu, please reconsider.

21
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,006
Their precision is legendary.

22
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:33,050
The Yuyan can pin a fly
to a tree from 100 yards away

23
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,677
without killing it.

24
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:40,683
You're wasting their talents
using them as mere security guards.

25
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,311
I can do whatever I want
with their talents.

26
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,272
They're my archers,
and what I say goes.

27
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:48,357
But my search for the Avatar is...

28
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,860
Is nothing but a vanity project.

29
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,862
We're fighting a real war here,

30
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,448
and I need every man
I've got, commander.

31
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:56,574
But...

32
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:57,658
That's final!

33
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,619
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

34
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,466
News from Fire Lord Ozai?

35
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:16,802
It appears I've been
promoted to admiral.

36
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:20,598
My request is now an order.

37
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,704
This should bring your fever down.

38
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,583
You know what I love
about Appa the most?

39
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,293
His sense of humor.

40
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:50,670
That's nice.

41
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,754
I'll tell him.

42
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,632
Ha ha ha!

43
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,008
Classic Appa.

44
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,176
How's Sokka doing?

45
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:58,469
Not so good.

46
00:02:58,552 --> 00:02:59,762
Being out in that storm

47
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:00,925
really did a number on him.

48
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,686
I couldn't find
any ginger root for the tea,

49
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,229
but I found a map.

50
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:09,563
There's a herbalist institute

51
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,065
on the top of that mountain.

52
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:12,948
We could probably
find a cure for Sokka there.

53
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,611
Aang, he's in no condition to travel.

54
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,321
Sokka just needs more rest.

55
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:19,407
I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.

56
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,870
Not you, too.

57
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,164
Relax. It was just a little cough.

58
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,249
I'm fin...

59
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,549
That's how Sokka started yesterday.

60
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:37,800
Now look at him.

61
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,343
He thinks he's an earthbender.

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,929
Take that, you rock.

63
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,516
A few more hours
and you'll be talking nonsense, too.

64
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,976
I'm going to find some medicine.

65
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,360
Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.

66
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,778
Keep an eye on them, guys.

67
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,615
Ha ha!

68
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,159
You guys are killing me.

69
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,841
We haven't been able to pick up
the Avatar's trail since the storm,

70
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,886
but if we continue
heading northeast...

71
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,722
What do they want?

72
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,892
Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho.

73
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,482
The hunt for the Avatar

74
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,941
has been given prime importance.

75
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:37,902
All information regarding the Avatar

76
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,237
must be reported
directly to Admiral Zhao.

77
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,573
Zhao has been promoted?

78
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:44,867
Well, good for him.

79
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,953
I've got nothing to report to Zhao.

80
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,498
Now get off my ship and let us pass.

81
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,750
Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships

82
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,376
in or out of this area.

83
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:56,670
Off my ship!

84
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:58,923
Excellent.

85
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,509
I take the pot.

86
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,053
But you're all improving.

87
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:07,056
I'm certain you will win
if we play again.

88
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,648
It says here
that the Avatar can create tornadoes

89
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,149
and run faster than the wind.

90
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,651
Pretty amazing.

91
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:21,862
Aw, that's just a bunch
of Fire Lord propaganda.

92
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,614
There's no way that's true.

93
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,258
Katara, please, water.

94
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,635
Listen carefully, Momo.

95
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:48,889
I need you to take this
to the river and fill it with water.

96
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:55,145
Got it?

97
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,458
Hello. I'm sorry
to barge in like this,

98
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,502
but I need some medicine
for my friends.

99
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,146
They have fevers
and they've been coughing...

100
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,089
Settle down, young man.

101
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:25,092
Your friends are going to be fine.

102
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:29,138
I've been up here
for over 40 years, you know.

103
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,683
Used to be others,
but they all left years ago.

104
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,853
Now it's just me and Miyuki.

105
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:37,771
That's nice.

106
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:42,109
Wounded Earth Kingdom troops
still come by now and again.

107
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,819
Brave boys,

108
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,863
and thanks to my remedies,

109
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:49,450
they always leave in better shape
than when they arrived.

110
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,410
That's nice. Are you almost done?

111
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:52,870
Hold on.

112
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:55,873
I just need to add
one last ingredient.

113
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,626
Oh, sandalwood?

114
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,920
Oh, yes... No, that won't do.

115
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,088
Banana leaf? Eh, nope.

116
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:04,840
Ginger root?

117
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,008
Uh-uh.

118
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,260
Oh, where is that pesky little plant?

119
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:16,852
Is everything ok?

120
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,063
It's been almost an hour

121
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,732
and you haven't given
the men an order.

122
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,317
I don't care what they do.

123
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,527
Don't give up hope yet.

124
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,113
You can still find the Avatar
before Zhao.

125
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,740
How, uncle?

126
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:30,824
With Zhao's resources,

127
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,159
it's just a matter of time

128
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:33,661
before he captures the Avatar.

129
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:37,206
My honor, my throne, my country...

130
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,832
I'm about to lose them all.

131
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,630
Oh, here's what I was looking for.

132
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,924
Plum blossom.

133
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:50,219
Finally. Thanks for all your help.

134
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,303
Hands off.

135
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,222
What do you think you're doing?

136
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:54,598
Taking the cure to my friends.

137
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,434
Oh! Ha ha! This isn't a cure.

138
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,269
It's Miyuki's dinner.

139
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,981
Plum blossom is her favorite.

140
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,607
What about my friends?

141
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,319
Well, all they need
is some frozen wood frogs.

142
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,738
There's plenty of them
down in the valley swamp.

143
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,241
What am I supposed to do
with frozen frogs?

144
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,368
Why, suck on them, of course.

145
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,078
Suck on them?

146
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,580
The frog skin excretes a substance

147
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,290
that'll cure your friends,

148
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,418
but make sure you get plenty.

149
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,712
Once those little critters thaw out,

150
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,879
they're useless.

151
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,091
You're insane, aren't you?

152
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,634
That's right.

153
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,388
Well, don't stand there all day.

154
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,015
Go!

155
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:40,477
Uh! Whoa!

156
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,242
Uh, I think you dropped this.

157
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,630
Aah!

158
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,255
A frog!

159
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:32,673
So this is the great Avatar,

160
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:35,509
master of all the elements.

161
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,928
I don't know how
you've managed to elude

162
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:40,180
the Fire Nation for 100 years,

163
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:44,268
but your little game
of hide and seek is over.

164
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,978
I've never hidden from you.

165
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,896
Untie me and I'll fight you right now.

166
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,065
Uh, no.

167
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,778
Tell me, how does it feel
to be the only airbender left?

168
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,489
Do you miss your people?

169
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,409
Oh, don't worry.

170
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,327
You won't be killed like they were.

171
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,997
See, if you die, you'll just be reborn

172
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,432
and the Fire Nation will have to begin

173
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:09,042
its search for the Avatar
all over again.

174
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:13,797
So I'll keep you alive,
but just barely.

175
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,680
Blow all the wind you want.

176
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:23,932
Your situation is futile.

177
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,893
There is no escaping this fortress

178
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:29,730
and no one is coming to rescue you.

179
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,863
Water.

180
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:40,324
Momo should be back any minute.

181
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,664
No, Momo.

182
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,957
Water.

183
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,876
Wa-ter.

184
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,424
Aang, what in the world
is taking you so long?

185
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,167
All clear.

186
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:45,472
All clear.

187
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:46,556
Go on in.

188
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:12,749
We are the sons and daughters
of fire, the superior element,

189
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:17,004
until today, only one thing
stood in our path to victory...

190
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,380
The Avatar!

191
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:23,218
I am here to tell you
that he is now my prisoner!

192
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:30,934
This is the year Sozin's Comet
returns to grant us its power!

193
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,480
This is the year the Fire Nation

194
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,191
breaks through
the walls of Ba Sing Se,

195
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,861
and burns the city to the ground.

196
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,006
What? No!

197
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,884
Don't leave, frogs. My friends
are sick and they need you.

198
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,053
Please go back to being frozen.

199
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,236
Aah!

200
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:10,742
Aah!

201
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:23,338
Who are you? What's going on?

202
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,048
Are you here to rescue me?

203
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,261
I'll take that as a yes.

204
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,518
My frogs!

205
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:37,602
Come back!

206
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,312
And stop thawing out!

207
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:41,481
Wait!

208
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,067
My friends need to
suck on those frogs!

209
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,493
How many times
do I have to tell you, Momo?

210
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,953
We need water.

211
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:57,289
Wa-ter.

212
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,749
Oh, forget it.

213
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,461
Aang, please hurry.

214
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,714
Who is this Aang kid
you keep talking about, your highness?

215
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,368
I want a full transcription
of my speech

216
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,786
sent to the Fire Lord,

217
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,247
Along with glowing testimonials

218
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,917
from all of the ranking officers
present, and...

219
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,681
Sir, shall I hold off
sending that speech to the Fire Lord?

220
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,025
There. On the wall!

221
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,319
Aah!

222
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,535
The Avatar has escaped!

223
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,745
Close all the gates immediately.

224
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,206
Stay close to me.

225
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:09,170
Aah!

226
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,766
Aah!

227
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,583
Take this.

228
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,585
Jump on my back!

229
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,635
Give me the next one!

230
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,862
Hold your fire!

231
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:18,448
The Avatar must be captured alive.

232
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,414
Open the gate.

233
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:28,416
Admiral, what are you doing?

234
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,542
Let them out.

235
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
Now!

236
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,507
How could you let them go?

237
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,178
A situation like this requires...
Precision.

238
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,277
Do you have a clear shot?

239
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,864
Knock out the thief.

240
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,077
I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord
along with the Avatar.

241
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,510
Quick! Recover the Avatar!

242
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,306
You know what the worst part

243
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:08,808
about being born
over 100 years ago is?

244
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,352
I miss all the friends
I used to hang out with.

245
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,354
Before the war started,

246
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,648
I used to always
visit my friend, Kuzon.

247
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,650
The two of us, we'd get in and out

248
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,111
of so much trouble together.

249
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,739
He was one of the best friends
I ever had...

250
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:25,867
And he was from the Fire Nation,
just like you.

251
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,077
If we knew each other back then,

252
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,038
do you think
we could have been friends, too?

253
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,937
Where have you been, Prince Zuko?

254
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,605
You missed music night.

255
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,651
Lieutenant Jee sang
a stirring love song.

256
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,736
I'm going to bed.

257
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,946
No disturbances.

258
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,167
Suck on these.

259
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,585
It'll make you feel better.

260
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,841
Aang, how was your trip?

261
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,843
Did you make any new friends?

262
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:26,135
No.

263
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,262
I don't think I did.

264
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:45,154
Mm!

265
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,948
This is tasty.

266
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,241
Mm, mm!

267
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,202
Ptooey!

268
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,328
Aah!
