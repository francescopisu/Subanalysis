1
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:04,295
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,297
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,674
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,510
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:15,014
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,893
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:22,355
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:23,689
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,441
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

10
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,068
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:31,197
<i>100 years passed, and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar,</i>

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,949
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

13
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,284
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great,</i>

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,870
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,955
Unh!

16
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,999
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

17
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:06,274
Hey, look!
A sword made out of a whale's tooth!

18
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:07,567
Let me see that.

19
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:19,662
This is a Water Tribe weapon.

20
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:21,455
See if you can find anything else.

21
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,250
Did someone lose something?

22
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,626
No, we found something.

23
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,131
It's burned.

24
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,134
There was a battle.

25
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,678
Water Tribe warriors ambushed
a group of firebenders.

26
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,763
The firebenders fought back,

27
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:39,568
but the warriors
drove them down this hill.

28
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,607
So then what happened?

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,525
I don't know. The trail ends here.

30
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,360
Wait! Look!

31
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,821
It's one of our boats!

32
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,241
Is this dad's boat?

33
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,827
No, but it's from his fleet.

34
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,078
Dad was here.

35
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:05,958
Ahh!

36
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,044
See, Prince Zuko?

37
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:11,714
A moment of quiet is good
for your mental well-being.

38
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,675
Unh!

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,262
Watch out!

40
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,472
Get back!

41
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:20,723
We're after a stowaway.

42
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,600
There are no stowaways on my ship.

43
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,659
He's paralyzed.

44
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,243
Only temporarily.

45
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,096
The toxins will wear off
in about an hour.

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,413
But by then, he'll be in jail,

47
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,873
and I'll have my money.

48
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,667
But how did you find him on my ship?

49
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,170
My shirshu can smell a rat
a continent away.

50
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,089
Well, I'm impressed.

51
00:02:57,593 --> 00:02:59,970
Very impressed.

52
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,949
Sokka.

53
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,075
I'm coming with you.

54
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,953
You're not old enough to go to war,
Sokka. You know that.

55
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,414
I'm strong. I'm brave.

56
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,957
I can fight!

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,417
Please, dad?

58
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,461
Being a man is knowing
where you're needed the most,

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,132
and for you right now,
that's here protecting your sister.

60
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,300
I don't understand.

61
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,428
Someday you will.

62
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,305
I'm gonna miss you so much.

63
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:50,604
Who's there?

64
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,815
Sokka?

65
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:53,899
Bato?

66
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,484
Who the what now?

67
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,736
Bato!

68
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:59,530
Sokka! Katara!

69
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,741
It is so good to see you two.

70
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,493
Oh. You've grown so much.

71
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,995
Hi, I'm Aang.

72
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:07,413
- Where's dad?
- Is he here?

73
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,415
No. He and the other warriors

74
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:12,251
should be in the eastern
Earth Kingdom by now.

75
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,464
This is no place for a reunion.

76
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,882
Let's get inside.

77
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,972
After I was wounded,

78
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,974
your father carried me to this abbey.

79
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,728
The sisters
have cared for me ever since.

80
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:33,230
Superior, these are Hakoda's children.

81
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,191
They've been traveling
with the Avatar.

82
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:36,817
I found them by my boat.

83
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,570
Young Avatar, it gives me great joy

84
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:40,863
to be in your presence.

85
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,990
Welcome to our abbey.

86
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:45,659
Thank you.
It's truly an honor to be here.

87
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,036
If there's anything...

88
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:48,329
What smells so good, Bato?

89
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,166
The sisters craft ointments
and perfumes.

90
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,211
Perfume? Maybe we could
dump some on Appa,

91
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,670
because he stinks so much.

92
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,172
Am I right?

93
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,801
You have your father's wit.

94
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:06,096
Bato, it looks like home!

95
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,849
Everything's here, even the pelts.

96
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,561
Yeah. Nothing's cozier
than dead animal skins.

97
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,315
Ack!

98
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:21,904
No way! Stewed sea prunes?

99
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:23,989
Help yourself.

100
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,158
Dad could eat
a whole barrel of these things.

101
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:29,119
Ugh!

102
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:32,790
Bato, is it true you
and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?

103
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,416
It was your father's idea.

104
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,168
He just dragged me along.

105
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,212
Well, the hippo did the dragging.

106
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,172
Hey, I ride animals, too!

107
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,174
One time, there was
this giant eel, and I...

108
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,760
So, who was it that came up
with the great blubber fiasco?

109
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,345
You knew about that?

110
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,847
Everyone does.

111
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,181
What's that story?

112
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,307
It's a long one, Aang.

113
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,517
Some other time.

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,311
You and dad had
so many hilarious adventures.

115
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,273
Not all of which
were hilarious at the time,

116
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,775
but everything's funny with hindsight.

117
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,901
Aang!

118
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,280
Please put that down.
It's ceremonial and very fragile.

119
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:08,158
Was it you or dad
that put an octopus on your head

120
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,053
and convinced gran-gran
you were a water spirit?

121
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:13,664
Your dad wore the octopus,
but I did the spooky voice.

122
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,877
Aah! Unh...

123
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:29,805
Out of my way! Step aside, filth.

124
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,765
He means no offense.

125
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,310
I'm certain you bathe regularly.

126
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,061
I need to talk to you.

127
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,314
Well, if it isn't my new friends,

128
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:40,524
Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.

129
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,359
Heh heh heh!

130
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,868
Your beast trashed my ship.

131
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,244
You have to pay me back.

132
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,954
Well, I'd love to help you out,

133
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,456
but I'm a little short on money.

134
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:56,957
Drinks on me!

135
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,006
Money isn't what I had in mind.

136
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,760
I need you to find someone.

137
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:10,429
What happened?
Your girlfriend run off on you?

138
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:12,181
It's not the girl I'm after.

139
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,824
It's the bald monk
she's traveling with.

140
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,768
Whatever you say.

141
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,311
If you find them,

142
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,980
I'll consider the damage
to my ship paid for.

143
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,899
Ha! Forget it.

144
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:24,735
Plus, we'll pay your weight in gold.

145
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,947
Make it your weight,
and we got a deal.

146
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,449
Ha ha ha! You got it!

147
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:31,575
Get on!

148
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,136
There's something
I should tell you kids.

149
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,509
I'm expecting a message
from your father.

150
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,761
- Really?
- When?

151
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,262
Any day now.

152
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,931
Your father said he'd send a message

153
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:55,724
when they found the rendezvous point.

154
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,018
If you wait here
until the message arrives,

155
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,771
you can come with me
and see your father again.

156
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,399
It's been over two years
since we've seen dad.

157
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:04,942
That would be so incredible.

158
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,026
Katara!

159
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,653
I do really miss him.

160
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,905
It would be great to see dad.

161
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,408
It's been far too long,
hasn't it?

162
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,035
I'm not sure when word will arrive,

163
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,620
but when it does...

164
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,750
It would be great, but we can't.

165
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,169
We have to take Aang
to the North Pole first.

166
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,098
Even if we had time
to wait for the message,

167
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,090
who knows how far we'd have to travel?

168
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,134
We don't have time for a long detour.

169
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:33,012
I'm sure your father would understand,

170
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,764
and be proud that his children
are helping the Avatar.

171
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,937
I can't believe they would leave me.

172
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,737
I'm looking for Bato
of the Water Tribe.

173
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,989
Uh, I know Bato.

174
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,824
Make sure he gets this.

175
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,206
It's the map
to Sokka and Katara's dad.

176
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,559
Hey, everyone.

177
00:09:20,642 --> 00:09:21,852
Sorry I was gone so long.

178
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,896
Hey, Aang. I didn't notice you left.

179
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,981
Yep. But now I'm back.

180
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,526
Sure could go for some
delicious sea prunes.

181
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,612
Mmm! Yum yum! Mmm!

182
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:33,822
Mmm!

183
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,960
Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?

184
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,407
We're looking for someone.

185
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,672
I hope it's not Miyuki.

186
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,302
Miyuki, did you get in trouble
with the Fire Nation again?

187
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,114
The Avatar's been through here.

188
00:09:58,138 --> 00:09:59,431
Let's keep moving.

189
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,779
Aha! I caught you.

190
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:16,073
You should be ashamed of yourself.

191
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:19,076
Littering in the courtyard.

192
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,370
I'm sorry. I'll take care of this.

193
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,419
This ship is sentimental to me.

194
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,171
It was built by my father.

195
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:40,323
Is this the boat
he took you ice dodging in?

196
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:42,391
Yep, and it's got
the scar to prove it.

197
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,434
Ha! How about you, Sokka?

198
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,729
You must have some good stories
from your first time ice dodging.

199
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,565
He never got to go.

200
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,150
Dad left before he was old enough.

201
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,735
Oh, I forgot. You were too young.

202
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:55,571
What's ice dodging?

203
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,240
It's a rite of passage
for young Water Tribe members.

204
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:01,034
When you turn 14, your dad takes you...

205
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:02,786
You know what?

206
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,371
You're about to find out.

207
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,884
Why are we stopping?

208
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,428
Because the girl must have
spent a lot of time here.

209
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,054
We have no time for this.

210
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,767
Hey, watch it!

211
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,395
- Heh heh heh!
- Oh, look. He likes you.

212
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,148
Care to hear your fortune, handsome?

213
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,902
At my age, there's really
only one big surprise left,

214
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,447
and I'd just as soon
leave it a mystery.

215
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,121
Ice dodging is a ceremonial test

216
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,790
of wisdom, bravery, and trust.

217
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,810
In our village,
it was done by weaving a boat

218
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,586
through a field of icebergs.

219
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,380
How are we supposed
to ice dodge without ice?

220
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,008
You'll be dodging... Those.

221
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,556
Sokka, you steer and call the shots.

222
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,266
Lead wisely.

223
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,310
Katara, you secure the mainsail.

224
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,605
The winds can be brutal. So be brave.

225
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:13,690
Aang, you control the jib.

226
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,360
Without your steady hand,
we all go down.

227
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,363
Your position is about trust.

228
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,949
I know that! Why wouldn't I know that?

229
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,993
I'm the Avatar! I know about trust.

230
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:28,121
For this to be done right,
I cannot help.

231
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:30,123
You pass or fail on your own.

232
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,215
Aang, ease up on the jib.

233
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,800
Katara, steady.

234
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:44,763
Aang, less sail.

235
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,640
Unh! Katara, give him room.

236
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:50,435
Unh!

237
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:57,526
Aang, helm to lee. Helm to lee!

238
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,361
What does that even mean?

239
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,539
Great job!

240
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,960
There's no way through!

241
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,378
We can make it!

242
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,131
Sokka, you've already proven yourself.
Maybe we should...

243
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,091
Aang! I'm gonna need air in that sail!

244
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:23,677
Katara, I want you to bend
as much water as you can

245
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,804
between us and those rocks.

246
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:27,597
Now!

247
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,287
The spirits of water bear witness
to these marks.

248
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,832
For Sokka, the mark of the wise...

249
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,668
The same mark your father earned.

250
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,254
For Katara, the mark of the brave.

251
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,631
Your courage inspires us.

252
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,552
And for Aang, the mark of the trusted.

253
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:09,181
You are now an honorary member
of the Water Tribe.

254
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,390
I can't.

255
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,808
Of course you can.

256
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,853
No. You can't trust me.

257
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,730
Aang, what are you talking about?

258
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,108
A messenger gave this to me for Bato.

259
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:24,571
You have to understand.
I was afraid you wouldn't...

260
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:26,323
This is the map to our father!

261
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:28,033
You had it the whole time?

262
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,368
How could you?

263
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,787
Well, you can go to
the North Pole on your own.

264
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:33,455
I'm going to find dad.

265
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,290
Now, Sokka, I think you should...

266
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,625
Katara, are you with me?

267
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,589
I'm with you, Sokka.

268
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,944
Good luck.

269
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:06,154
Okay. You too.

270
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:14,204
Guess I should be moving on.

271
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,789
That would be best.

272
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,214
I'm an idiot, Momo.

273
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,527
We're getting close.

274
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,456
That wolf sounds so sad.

275
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,332
It's probably wounded.

276
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,335
No. It's been separated from the pack.

277
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,504
I understand that pain.

278
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,548
It's how I felt when
the Water Tribe warriors

279
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,717
had to leave me behind.

280
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,677
They were my family,

281
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,346
and being apart from them
was more painful than my wounds.

282
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,523
Sokka?

283
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,941
We need to go back.

284
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,860
I want to see dad,

285
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,948
but helping Aang is where
we're needed the most.

286
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:29,988
You're right.

287
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:32,449
Your father will understand,

288
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,284
and I know he's proud of you.

289
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,702
Thanks, Bato.

290
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,370
I know where to go from here.

291
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,581
Take this in case you want to find us.

292
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:41,583
I'll leave a message
at the rendezvous point.

293
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,087
Looks like we're going alone, guys.

294
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,256
Avatar! You must leave.

295
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,884
Okay, I get it.
Everybody wants me gone.

296
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:53,553
A group of people came to the abbey
looking for you.

297
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,679
Who?

298
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,890
A fierce-looking woman
with a horrible monster,

299
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,642
and a young man with a scar.

300
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,851
Zuko.

301
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,646
The beast was using the scent
of a necklace to follow you.

302
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:04,189
A necklace?

303
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,899
Katara!

304
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:21,331
So this is your girlfriend.

305
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,832
No wonder she left.

306
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,251
She's way too pretty for you.

307
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,419
Where is he? Where's the Avatar?

308
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,463
We split up. He's long gone.

309
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:31,049
How stupid do you think I am?

310
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,260
Pretty stupid. Run!

311
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,055
Aah! Unh!

312
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,910
What are we supposed to do now?

313
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,435
It's seeking a different scent,

314
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,688
perhaps something
that the Avatar held.

315
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,079
What's it doing?

316
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:02,282
It's just going in a circle.

317
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,637
- Aang!
- Up!

318
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,325
Hah!

319
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:41,953
Aargh!

320
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,627
- Aah!
- Unh!

321
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,339
Oof!

322
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,965
Unh!

323
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,141
Come on, get up!

324
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,546
Unh!

325
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:40,887
Aah!

326
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:02,826
I'm starting to get some feeling back.

327
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:03,952
Ow...

328
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,339
Ahh...

329
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,102
You've got something I want.

330
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,624
Aah!

331
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,834
Unh!

332
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,592
Oof!

333
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,325
Ugh.

334
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,536
That thing sees with its nose.

335
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:30,101
Let's give him something to look at.

336
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,372
The perfume?

337
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:01,152
Ohh!

338
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:06,074
June, no!

339
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,918
Uncle?

340
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,753
I didn't see you get hit
with the tongue.

341
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,922
Shh...

342
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,512
So... Where do we go?

343
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,639
We're getting you to the North Pole.

344
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:32,141
Yeah. We've lost
too much time as it is.

345
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,044
Don't you want to see your father?

346
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,645
Of course we do, Aang,

347
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:37,564
but you're our family, too,

348
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,107
and right now, you need us more.

349
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,817
And we need you.

350
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:43,945
I wish I could give you
a little piece of home, Katara,

351
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:45,697
something to remind you...

352
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:48,741
- I'll be okay.
- Still, just a little trinket.

353
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,536
Maybe something like... This?

354
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,498
Aang! How'd you get that?

355
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:58,293
Zuko asked me
to be sure I got it to you.

356
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:01,754
Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko.

357
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,816
Would you give him a kiss for me
when you see him?

358
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,883
Sure.

359
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,801
Mwah.
