1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,797
<i>Water, earth,</i>

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>fire, air...</i>

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

4
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:18,726
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,689
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

6
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

7
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,984
<i>he vanished.</i>

8
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:31,197
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,865
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

10
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,243
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

11
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,995
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,250
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

13
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:02,186
The Earth Kingdom City of Omashu!

14
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,191
I used to always come here
to visit my friend Bumi.

15
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,401
Wow!

16
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:10,653
We don't have cities like this
in the South Pole.

17
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,239
They have buildings here
that don't melt.

18
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,824
Well, let's go, slowpokes.

19
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,743
The real fun is inside the city!

20
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,328
Wait, Aang.

21
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,580
It could be dangerous

22
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,164
if people find out you're the Avatar.

23
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,624
You need a disguise.

24
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,585
So, what am I supposed to do,

25
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,919
grow a mustache?

26
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,757
Oh, this is so itchy.

27
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,051
How do you live in this stuff?

28
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:36,971
Great!

29
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:38,574
Now you look just like my grandfather.

30
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,017
Technically, Aang is 112 years old.

31
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:44,854
Now, let's get to skipping,
young whipper snappers!

32
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,314
The big city awaits!

33
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,749
You guys are gonna love Omashu.

34
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:07,460
The people here are the friendliest
in the world.

35
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,839
What kind of slum
do you think this is?

36
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,847
No! My cabbages!

37
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:24,518
Just keep smiling.

38
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,480
Heh heh heh.

39
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,318
State your business!

40
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,738
My business is my business, young man,

41
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,198
and none of yours.

42
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,158
I've got half a mind
to bend you over my knee

43
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,701
and paddle your backside.

44
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,745
Settle down, old timer.

45
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:44,205
Just tell me who you are.

46
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:49,168
Name's Bonzoo Pippenpadlopsicopolis
the Third.

47
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:51,295
And these are my grandkids.

48
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,506
Hi. June Pippenpadlopsicopolis.

49
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:54,590
Nice to meet you.

50
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,844
You seem like
a responsible young lady.

51
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,222
See that your grandfather
stays out of trouble.

52
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:02,306
Enjoy Omashu.

53
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,599
We will.

54
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,104
Wait a minute!

55
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,983
You're a strong young boy.

56
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,527
Show some respect for the elderly

57
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,529
and carry your grandfather's bag.

58
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,531
Good idea.

59
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,894
This is
the Omashu delivery system...

60
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,355
Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.

61
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,360
Earthbending brings the packages up,

62
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,362
and gravity brings them down.

63
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:01,365
Great, so they get their mail on time.

64
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,075
They do get their mail on time.

65
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,662
But my friend Bumi
found a better use for these chutes.

66
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,459
Look around you!

67
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,543
What do you see?!

68
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:15,254
Um... The mail system.

69
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:17,298
Instead of seeing
what they want you to see,

70
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:20,384
you gotta open your brain
to the possibilities.

71
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,803
A package-sending system?

72
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,890
The world's greatest super slide!

73
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,684
Bumi, you're a mad genius.

74
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,610
Yeah! Ha ha ha ha!

75
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,781
One ride...

76
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,824
Then we're off to the North Pole...

77
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,201
Airbender's honor.

78
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,470
This sounded like fun at first,

79
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,579
but now that I'm here,

80
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:52,208
I'm starting to have second thoughts!

81
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,714
Yeah!

82
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,341
Ha ha ha ha!

83
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,815
I'm on it!

84
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,073
Men, you'll be going off
to combat soon.

85
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,826
It's important that you be prepared
for anything.

86
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,545
Aang, do something!

87
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,338
Use your airbending!

88
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,131
Yeah! Good idea!

89
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,008
That will make us go even faster.

90
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,920
Sorry!

91
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,647
My cabbages!

92
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,232
You're gonna pay for this!

93
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,527
Two cabbages, please.

94
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:57,666
Hmm?

95
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,126
Your Majesty,

96
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,587
these juveniles were arrested
for vandalism,

97
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,047
traveling under false pretenses,

98
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,798
and malicious destruction of cabbages.

99
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,175
Off with their heads!

100
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:07,968
One for each head of cabbage!

101
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,345
Silence!

102
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,680
Only the king can pass down judgment.

103
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,265
What is your judgment, sire?

104
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,059
Hmm.

105
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:28,155
Throw them...

106
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,323
A feast.

107
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,991
Ugh!

108
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:32,534
Huh?

109
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,711
The people in my city

110
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,714
have gotten fat from too many feasts.

111
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,051
So, I hope you like your chicken
with no skin.

112
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:50,803
Thanks, but I don't eat meat.

113
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:52,388
How about you?

114
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,390
I bet you like meat.

115
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,143
Is it just me,

116
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,854
or is this guy's crown
a little crooked?

117
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,066
So, tell me, young bald one,

118
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:05,567
where are you from?

119
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,821
I'm from Kangaroo Island.

120
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,991
Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh?

121
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,035
I hear that place is really hopping.

122
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,292
What?

123
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,585
It was pretty funny.

124
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,341
All these good jokes
are making me tired.

125
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,885
Guess it's time to hit the hay.

126
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,600
There's an airbender in our presence,

127
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,645
and not just any airbender...

128
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,063
The Avatar.

129
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:47,901
Now, what do you have to
say for yourself,

130
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,279
Mr. Pippenpadlopsicopolis?

131
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:59,121
Ok, you caught me.

132
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:00,789
I'm the Avatar...

133
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,374
Doing my Avatar thing,

134
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,126
keeping the world safe.

135
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,627
Everything checks out.

136
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,254
No firebenders here.

137
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:08,756
So, good work, everybody.

138
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,840
Love each other,

139
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:10,924
respect all life,

140
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:12,926
and don't run with your spears.

141
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,303
We'll see you next time!

142
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,849
You can't keep us here.

143
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,267
Let us leave!

144
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:22,603
Lettuce leaf?

145
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,191
We're in serious trouble.

146
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,942
This guy is nuts.

147
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:33,405
Tomorrow, the Avatar will face
three deadly challenges.

148
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,284
But for now, the guards
will show you to your chamber.

149
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,162
My liege, do you mean
the good chamber or the bad chamber?

150
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,955
The newly-refurbished chamber.

151
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,333
Wait. Which one are we talking about?

152
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,127
The one that used to be
the bad chamber...

153
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,797
Until the recent refurbishing,
that is.

154
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,007
Of course, we've been calling it
the new chamber,

155
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,234
but we really should
number them.

156
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,259
Uh...

157
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,512
Take them to the refurbished chamber

158
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,263
that was once bad.

159
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,649
This is a prison cell?

160
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:09,900
But it's so nice.

161
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:12,194
He did say it was newly refurbished.

162
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:14,321
Nice or not, we're prisoners.

163
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,824
I wonder what these challenges
are gonna be.

164
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,992
We're not sticking around to find out.

165
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,869
There's gotta be some way out of here.

166
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,079
The air vents!

167
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:25,999
If you think we're gonna
fit through there,

168
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,626
you're crazier than that king.

169
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,919
We can't.

170
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,462
But Momo can.

171
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,800
Momo, I need you to find Appa

172
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,218
and bust us out of here.

173
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,394
Go on, boy!

174
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:46,937
Get Appa!

175
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,023
Eh, how was Appa supposed to
save us anyway?

176
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,776
Appa is a 10-ton flying bison.

177
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,903
I think he could figure something out.

178
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:58,323
Well, no point arguing about it now.

179
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,200
Get some rest, Aang.

180
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,994
Looks like you'll need it
for tomorrow.

181
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:12,629
Sokka? Katara?

182
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,464
Where are my friends?

183
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,050
The king will free them
if you complete your challenges.

184
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,927
And if I fail?

185
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,137
He didn't say.

186
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,221
Your staff, please?

187
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,771
First, Avatar,

188
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,899
what do you think of my new outfit?

189
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,442
I want your honest opinion.

190
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,405
I'm waiting.

191
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,573
I...

192
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:40,908
Guess it's fine.

193
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,159
Excellent.

194
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,869
You've passed the first test.

195
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:44,953
Really?

196
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,079
Well...

197
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,831
Not one of the deadly tests.

198
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,541
The real challenges are much more...

199
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,626
Challenging.

200
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,089
I don't have time
for your crazy games.

201
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:58,258
Give me my friends back.
We're leaving!

202
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,428
Oh, I thought you might refuse,

203
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,766
so I will give your friends
some special souvenirs.

204
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:07,643
Those delightful rings

205
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,394
are made of pure genomite...

206
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,564
Also known as Creeping Crystal.

207
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:15,817
It's crystal that grows
remarkably fast.

208
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,571
By nightfall, your friends will be
completely covered in it.

209
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,073
Terrible fate, really.

210
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,532
I can stop it,

211
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,910
but only if you cooperate.

212
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,579
Agh! It's already creeping!

213
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,666
I'll do what you want.

214
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,167
Hmm!

215
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,257
Ha ha ha ha ha!

216
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:45,055
It seems I've lost my lunchbox key,

217
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,556
and I'm hungry.

218
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,521
Oh, there it is!

219
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,189
Would you mind fetching it for me?

220
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,916
Ooh!

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,293
Climbing the ladder.

222
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,253
No one's thought of that before!

223
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,881
Aah!

224
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,283
That's right.

225
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,743
Keep diving head in.

226
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,578
I'm sure it will work eventually.

227
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:04,259
Huh?

228
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,054
There! Enjoy your lunch!

229
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,139
I want my friends back now!

230
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,724
Uh, not yet.

231
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,934
I need help with another matter.

232
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,188
It seems I've lost my pet Flopsy.

233
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,899
Ok, found him.

234
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:20,025
Bring him to me.

235
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,694
Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsy.

236
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,279
Come here, Flopsy.

237
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:27,282
Heh heh.

238
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,705
Flopsy, wait!

239
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,956
Flopsy!

240
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:40,003
Flopsy!

241
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:52,724
Wait a minute.

242
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,396
Flopsy?

243
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,403
Flopsy!

244
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,995
Oh, that's a good boy.

245
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,415
Yes! Who has a soft belly?

246
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,377
Guys, are you ok?

247
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,171
Other than the crystal slowly
encasing my entire body,

248
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,423
doing great.

249
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,470
Oh, yes.

250
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,723
Come on. I'm ready
for the next challenge.

251
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,309
Ah! Ha ha ha ha ha!

252
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,065
Your final test is a duel.

253
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,276
And, as a special treat,

254
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,403
you may choose your opponent.

255
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,580
Point and choose.

256
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,417
So, you're saying
whoever I point to...

257
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,002
That's the person I get to fight?

258
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,754
Choose wisely.

259
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:07,966
I...

260
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,218
Choose...

261
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,428
You.

262
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:13,972
Ha ha. Wrong choice.

263
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,609
Whoa!

264
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:27,986
Oof!

265
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:43,627
You thought I was a frail old man,

266
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,422
but I'm the most powerful earthbender
you'll ever see.

267
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,091
Can I fight the guy
with the ax instead?

268
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,970
There are no take-backsies
in my kingdom.

269
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,680
You might need this.

270
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,397
Typical airbender tactic...

271
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,191
Avoid and evade.

272
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:08,985
I'd hoped the Avatar
would be less predictable.

273
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,782
Don't you have any surprises for me?

274
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:16,952
Sooner or later,
you'll have to strike back.

275
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,428
Oh, you'll have to be
a little more creative than that.

276
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:49,192
Did someone leave the windows open?

277
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,778
It feels a little drafty in here.

278
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:54,531
Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?

279
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,215
How are you going to get me
from way over there?

280
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,030
Oof!

281
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:20,367
Aah!

282
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,371
Huh.

283
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,336
Ha ha. Well done, Avatar.

284
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:34,547
You fight with much fire
in your heart.

285
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:39,636
Huh?

286
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,104
You've passed all my tests.

287
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:52,232
Now, you must answer one question.

288
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:53,608
That's not fair.

289
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,236
You said you would release my friends
if I finish your tests.

290
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,115
Oh, but what's the point of tests
if you don't learn anything?

291
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,825
Oh, come on!

292
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,868
Answer this one question

293
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,913
and I will set your friends free.

294
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:09,791
What is my name?

295
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,627
From the looks of your friends,

296
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,338
I'd say you only have a few minutes.

297
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,882
How am I supposed to know his name?

298
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:19,592
Think about the challenges.

299
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,136
Maybe it's some kind of riddle.

300
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,220
- I got it!
- Yeah?

301
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,097
He's an earthbender, right?

302
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,265
Rocky...

303
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,226
You know, because of all the rocks.

304
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,436
We're gonna keep trying,

305
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,687
but that is a good backup.

306
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:33,106
Ok, so back to the challenges.

307
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,066
I got a key from a waterfall,

308
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,569
I saved his pet, and I had a duel.

309
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,695
And what did you learn?

310
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,407
Well, everything was different
than I expected.

311
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,534
And...

312
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:46,035
Well...

313
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,080
They weren't straightforward.
To solve each test,

314
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,542
I had to think differently
than I usually would.

315
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,127
I know his name.

316
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,966
I solved the question
the same way I solved the challenges.

317
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:02,135
As you said a long time ago,

318
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:04,971
I had to open my brain
to the possibilities.

319
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:10,769
Bumi, you're a mad genius.

320
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:15,648
Oh, Aang, it's good to see you.

321
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,443
You haven't changed a bit...

322
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:19,611
Literally.

323
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:21,654
Uh, over here.

324
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,739
A little help.

325
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:28,661
Genomite is made of rock candy.

326
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:30,830
Delicious!

327
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,793
So, this crazy king
is your old friend Bumi?

328
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,294
Who you calling old?

329
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,588
Ok, I'm old.

330
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,256
Why did you do all this

331
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,425
instead of just telling Aang
who you were?

332
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,635
First of all,

333
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:45,637
it's pretty fun messing with people.

334
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,805
Ha ha.

335
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,306
But I do have a reason.

336
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:51,643
Aang, you have a difficult task ahead.

337
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:54,938
The world has changed in the 100 years
you've been gone.

338
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:58,233
It's the duty of the Avatar
to restore balance to the world

339
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,735
by defeating Fire Lord Ozai.

340
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,945
You have much to learn.

341
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,322
You must master the four elements

342
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:06,074
and confront the Fire Lord.

343
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,617
And when you do,

344
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,286
I hope you will think
like a mad genius.

345
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,960
And it looks like
you're in good hands.

346
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:20,505
You'll need your friends
to help you defeat the Fire Nation.

347
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,384
And you'll need Momo, too.

348
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,177
Thank you for your wisdom.

349
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,887
But before we leave,

350
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,848
I have a challenge for you.

351
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:33,434
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

352
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,023
My cabbages!
