1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:04,545
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,130
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,591
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,510
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:14,680
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:18,935
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,438
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,898
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

10
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,193
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>100 years passed, and my brother and I</i>

12
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,657
<i>discovered the new Avatar,
an airbender named Aang.</i>

13
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,834
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great,</i>

14
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:37,620
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:38,704
Unh!

16
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,958
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

17
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,479
Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?

18
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:05,356
Right. Got it.

19
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:07,858
Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp

20
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,026
on top of the tent.

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,861
You know, so we don't get rained on?

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,822
Ordinarily, you'd be right,

23
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,258
but seeing how it's the dry season,

24
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,283
you're not.

25
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:17,094
Besides, that tarp makes
a pretty warm blanket.

26
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,619
But what if it does rain?

27
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:19,829
What if it doesn't?

28
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,754
Then I would have put
the tarp up for nothing.

29
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:24,333
Uh! You're infuriating.

30
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,698
Katara, why don't you worry about
gathering the firewood?

31
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:30,131
Because that kindling's
looking pretty sorry.

32
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,049
If you don't like my firewood...

33
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:33,509
Uh!

34
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:36,262
Fine by me! If you're not
gonna do your job...

35
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,555
Uh!

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,765
Okay, I got the grub
if you guys got the...

37
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,475
Hey, where's the campfire,

38
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,060
and what happened to the tent?

39
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:46,022
Why don't you ask
Miss Know-it-all, Queen of the twigs?

40
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:50,234
Oh, yeah? Well,
you're Mr. Lazy-bum, King of the...

41
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,569
Tents!

42
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,572
Okay. Listen, guys.

43
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,616
Harsh words won't solve problems.

44
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,825
Action will.

45
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,869
Why don't you just switch jobs?

46
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,120
- Sounds good.
- Whatever.

47
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:02,204
You see that?

48
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,332
Settling feuds and making peace...

49
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,626
All in a day's work for the Avatar.

50
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,435
Come on, Momo. That's fair.

51
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,437
Appa's got five stomachs.

52
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:33,736
There it is, guys, The Great Divide.

53
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:36,697
Wow. I could just stare at it forever.

54
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,574
Okay. I've seen enough.

55
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,285
How can you not be fascinated, Sokka?

56
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,996
This is the largest canyon
in the entire world.

57
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,374
Then I'm sure we'll be
able to see it very clearly

58
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,000
from the air while we fly away.

59
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,645
Hey, if you're looking
for the canyon guide,

60
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,003
I was here first.

61
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,465
Ooh. Canyon guide. Sounds informative.

62
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,634
Believe me, he's more
than a tour guide.

63
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,802
He's an earthbender,

64
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,527
and the only way
in and out of the canyon

65
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:00,971
is with his help.

66
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,224
And he's taking my tribe across next.

67
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,101
Calm down. We know you're next.

68
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,561
You wouldn't be calm if the
Fire Nation destroyed your home

69
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,979
and forced you to flee.

70
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,148
My whole tribe has to
walk thousands of miles

71
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,776
to the capital city of Ba Sing Se.

72
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,486
You're a refugee.

73
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,238
Huh. Tell me something I don't know.

74
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,659
Is that your tribe?

75
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,119
It most certainly is not.

76
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,912
That's the Zhang tribe,

77
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,706
a bunch of lowlife thieves.

78
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,165
They've been the enemies

79
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,583
of my tribe for a hundred years.

80
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,961
Hey, Zhangs!

81
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,838
I'm saving a spot for my tribe,

82
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,506
so don't even think of stealing it.

83
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,633
Where are the rest of the Gan Jin?

84
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:40,553
Still tidying up their campsite?

85
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,472
Yes, but they sent me
ahead of them to hold a spot.

86
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,808
I didn't know the canyon guide
took reservations.

87
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,768
Huh! Of course you didn't.

88
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,311
That's the ignorance I'd expect

89
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,188
from a messy Zhang,

90
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,482
so unorganized
and ill-prepared for a journey.

91
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,741
Uhh!

92
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,163
Sorry about the wait, youngsters.

93
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,124
Who's ready to cross this here canyon?

94
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:12,752
Uh, one of them, I think.

95
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,837
I was here first.
My party's on their way.

96
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,590
I can't guide people who aren't here.

97
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,593
Guess you guys will have
to make the trip tomorrow.

98
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:23,429
Wait! Here they come.

99
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,788
You're not seriously gonna cave in

100
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:33,272
to these spoiled Gan Jins.

101
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:35,483
I mean, we're refugees, too,

102
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,693
and we've got sick people
that need shelter.

103
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,570
I, uh, well...

104
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,364
We've got old people
who are weary from traveling.

105
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,075
Sick people get
priority over old people.

106
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,578
Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't
have so many sick people

107
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:49,914
if you weren't such slobs.

108
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,249
If you Gan Jins weren't so clean,

109
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:54,710
maybe you wouldn't live to be so old.

110
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,062
I could smell your stink...

111
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:57,421
Well, Aang, ready to put

112
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,857
your peacemaking skills to the test?

113
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,674
I don't know...

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,551
A fight over chores is one thing.

115
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:05,346
These people have been
feuding for a hundred years.

116
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,389
Everyone listen up!

117
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,099
This is the Avatar,

118
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,684
and if you give him a chance,

119
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm sure he can come up
with a compromise

120
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,438
that will make everyone happy.

121
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:20,027
Uh, you could share the earthbender
and travel together?

122
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,905
Absolutely not. We'd rather
be taken by the Fire Nation

123
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,491
than travel with those
stinking thieves.

124
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,369
We wouldn't travel
with you pompous fools anyway.

125
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:31,455
All right, here's the deal!

126
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,082
You're all going down together,

127
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,668
and Appa here
will fly your sick and elderly across.

128
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,294
Does that seem fair?

129
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,850
Sorry, Appa. You'll have to
do this on your own.

130
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,686
Aang, this feuding tribe
stuff is serious business.

131
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,956
Are you sure it's a good idea
getting involved in this?

132
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,941
To tell the truth, I'm not sure,

133
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,276
but when have I ever been?

134
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:01,819
He's the avatar, Sokka.

135
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,238
Making peace
between people is his job.

136
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:07,366
His job's gonna make us cross this
whole thing on foot, isn't it?

137
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,160
Okay, now comes the bad news.

138
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:13,163
No food allowed in the canyon.

139
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,167
It attracts dangerous predators.

140
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,587
No food? This is ridiculous.

141
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:24,049
Oh, you babies can go
a day without food.

142
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,261
Would you rather be hungry or dead?

143
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:30,514
Now, we're heading down in 10 minutes.

144
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,725
All food better be in your gut,

145
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,268
or in the garbage!

146
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,986
Appa's gonna take good care of you
till we get there.

147
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,113
See you on the other side, buddy.

148
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,323
Yip yip!

149
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,753
Huh!

150
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,380
Nice bending.

151
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:07,176
The job's much more than bending, kid.

152
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,802
Folks want information.

153
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,431
Many of you are probably wondering

154
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:14,391
how canyons are formed.

155
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:16,936
Experts tell us
this canyon was most likely

156
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,105
carved into the ground
by earth spirits,

157
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,775
who were angry at local farmers

158
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:26,320
for not offering them
a proper sacrifice.

159
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:37,498
Uh! Ha ha!
Guess the spirits are still angry.

160
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,542
Hope you all brought sacrifices.

161
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,926
Okay. Everyone
stand clear of the wall.

162
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,720
Uh! Uh!

163
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:55,766
Why did you do that?

164
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:59,061
These people are fleeing
the Fire Nation, aren't they?

165
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:01,689
I've got to make sure
we can't be followed.

166
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,524
We'll be safe now.

167
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,192
Uh!

168
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,527
Ah!

169
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:10,030
We've got to help him! Uh!

170
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:12,741
Aah!

171
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,121
Okay, now we've got to help me!

172
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,502
Aah!

173
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:24,586
Hah!

174
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:38,976
What was that?

175
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,686
Canyon crawler.

176
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,189
Oh... And there's sure to be more.

177
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:46,775
Your arms... They're broken.

178
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,403
Without my arms, I got no bending.

179
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:50,779
In other words...

180
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,489
We're trapped in this canyon.

181
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,300
I thought the whole point
of ditching our food

182
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:08,172
was so we wouldn't have to deal
with things like canyon crawlers.

183
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,423
It's the Zhangs.

184
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:12,926
They took food down here
even after the guide told them not to.

185
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,595
What?

186
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:16,531
If there's anyone who
can't go without food for a day,

187
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,849
it's these pampered Gan Jins.

188
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,601
I hope you're happy.

189
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,853
We're stuck in this canyon
with no way out.

190
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,522
Why don't you thank yourself,
food-hider?

191
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,108
Look, sticking together
is the only way to...

192
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,694
I'm not walking another step
with the likes of them.

193
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,238
Now there's something we can agree on.

194
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:34,948
Any ideas?

195
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,118
No bending. We need to get
out of this canyon.

196
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,079
I won't die down here.

197
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,998
I won't become part of the food chain.

198
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,919
See? We're going to become
part of the food chain

199
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,127
because of you.

200
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:50,547
Sure. Unjustly blame
the Zhangs, like you always do.

201
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,091
Gladly.

202
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,342
Enough!

203
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,135
I thought I could
help you guys get along,

204
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,700
but I guess that's not gonna happen.

205
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,432
We should split up...

206
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,227
Gan Jins on this side
and Zhangs on that side.

207
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:05,437
We'll travel in two separate lines.

208
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:14,113
Sokka, you go with the Zhangs,

209
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,823
and, Katara, you go with the Gan Jins.

210
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,368
See if you can find out why
they hate each other so much.

211
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,139
So, you guys aren't gonna
put up your tarps?

212
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:42,307
What for? It's the dry season.

213
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,600
Exactly!

214
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,436
Besides, we like to use
the tarp as a blanket.

215
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,355
Finally someone gets it.

216
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:57,656
Do you really think it'll rain?

217
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,160
No, but you can never
be too careful, right?

218
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,972
Would you care for some bread, Katara?

219
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,891
So it was you guys who had food.

220
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:25,350
Oh, come now.

221
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,870
Do you really think
that tribe of thieves

222
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,187
isn't smuggling food?

223
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,063
Why should my people go hungry

224
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,192
when the sneaky Zhangs
are stuffing their faces?

225
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:37,738
Well, I guess it's okay
if everyone's doing it.

226
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,703
So, why does your tribe
hate the Zhangs so much?

227
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:47,581
You seem like a smart girl, Katara.

228
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:50,292
I bet you would enjoy
hearing some history.

229
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,801
<i>The patriarch
of our tribe, Jin Wei,</i>

230
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,428
<i>was an earthbender warrior</i>

231
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:03,805
<i>who was assigned an important duty:</i>

232
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,099
<i>Transporting our sacred orb.</i>

233
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,811
<i>From the great eastern gate
to the great western gate.</i>

234
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,027
<i>Taking the orb
from the east to the west</i>

235
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:20,322
<i>represents the sun's
rising and setting.</i>

236
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:24,618
<i>It was our tribe's
ancient redemption ritual.</i>

237
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,620
<i>But as he approached the gate,</i>

238
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,915
<i>Jin Wei was attacked
by one of the Zhangs...</i>

239
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,167
<i>A vermin named Wei Jin</i>

240
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:35,295
<i>who looked at the orb with envy.</i>

241
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,007
<i>That coward Wei Jin
knocked Jin Wei to the ground</i>

242
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,134
<i>and stole our sacred orb.</i>

243
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,305
Our people have never forgotten.

244
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,016
You can never trust a Zhang.

245
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,357
Care for some meat?

246
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:56,858
Would I?

247
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:58,902
I know what you must be thinking.

248
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,862
We're horrible for
endangering everybody

249
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,364
by bringing food down here.

250
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,657
Mmm-hmm.

251
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,617
The Gan Jins think so badly of us,

252
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:07,703
they probably assumed
we brought food in

253
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,663
and decided to bring
food in themselves.

254
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,290
That's why we brought food in.

255
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,416
Mmm.

256
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,126
Our conflict with the Gan Jin

257
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,670
goes back over 100 years.

258
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,677
<i>Our forefather, Wei Jin,
was leaving the western gate</i>

259
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,972
<i>of our village when he saw
a figure in the distance.</i>

260
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,851
<i>It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe,
Jin Wei,</i>

261
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,728
<i>collapsed on the ground.</i>

262
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,980
<i>Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him.</i>

263
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,025
<i>Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb,</i>

264
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,945
<i>a very powerful relic used in
his tribe's redemption ritual.</i>

265
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,531
<i>Wei Jin tried to tend
to the man's wounds,</i>

266
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:47,826
<i>but Jin Wei insisted the orb
was more important</i>

267
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,620
<i>and asked him to take it
back to his tribe.</i>

268
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,623
<i>Kind Wei Jin promised to send
help for the man</i>

269
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,875
<i>as soon as he could.</i>

270
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,127
<i>But as Wei Jin crossed the border</i>

271
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,129
<i>to return the orb
into Gan Jin territory,</i>

272
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:00,714
<i>he was arrested.</i>

273
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:08,805
<i>Instead of thanking him
for his kind and selfless deed,</i>

274
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,975
<i>they sentenced him
to 20 long years in prison.</i>

275
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,313
We Zhangs will never forget
that injustice.

276
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:18,565
That's just terrible.

277
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,858
Are you gonna finish that?

278
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,320
Sure would be nice

279
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,405
to be around one of those campfires.

280
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,824
Telling stories and laughing.

281
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,703
It's okay, Momo.
We'll be out of here soon enough,

282
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,789
and then we can eat our weight
in litchi nuts.

283
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:42,798
Nah. I'll wait for the litchi nuts.

284
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:46,760
It's lonely,
isn't it, being impartial?

285
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,388
I wish I could help
these people get along,

286
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,264
but it just seems impossible.

287
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,830
Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem.

288
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,017
Is getting out of here.

289
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,563
I'm not so sure the two problems
are unrelated.

290
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:09,032
All clear.
We're almost to the other side.

291
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:21,878
Katara, Sokka,
will these people cooperate

292
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,463
long enough to get out of the canyon?

293
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,840
I don't think so, Aang.

294
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,175
The Zhangs really
wronged the Gan Jins.

295
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,137
They ambushed Jin Wei
and stole the sacred orb.

296
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,721
What are you talking about?

297
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:33,974
Yeah, Katara, what
are you talking about?

298
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,101
Wei Jin didn't steal the orb.

299
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:37,909
He was returning it
to their village gate

300
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,729
and was wrongfully
punished by the Gan Jin.

301
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,773
Not punished enough, if you ask me.

302
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,943
Okay, okay. I get it.
Now I need your help.

303
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:47,529
Let's get everyone together
at the base of the canyon wall.

304
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,457
Please, everyone.
As soon as we get out of here,

305
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,292
we can eat and then
go our separate ways.

306
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,186
But I need you all
to put your heads together

307
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,004
and figure out a way up this cliff.

308
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,131
Maybe the Zhang can climb the wall.

309
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,425
With their long,
disgusting fingernails.

310
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:11,344
Oh, sorry.
I forgot that to the Gan Jin,

311
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:15,474
unclipped fingernails is a crime
punishable by 20 years in jail.

312
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,100
Why, you dirty thief.

313
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:18,977
You pompous fool.

314
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,731
Guys, focus!

315
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,524
How many times do I have to say it?

316
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,276
Harsh words won't solve problems.

317
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,736
Action will!

318
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,822
Perhaps the Avatar is right.

319
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,782
Yes. Perhaps he is.

320
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:37,829
Harsh words will never
solve our problems.

321
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:39,915
Action will.

322
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,168
- Huh!
- Huh!

323
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:44,336
Aah!

324
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:52,260
To the death, and let this
be the end of this rivalry.

325
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,262
You know, I take it back.

326
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,805
Harsh words aren't so bad.

327
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,689
Huh?

328
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:13,532
Hyah!

329
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:23,458
Is that food?

330
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,710
Everyone smuggled food down here?

331
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,170
Unbelievable!

332
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,755
You guys put our lives in danger

333
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,132
because you couldn't go
without a snack for a day?

334
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,094
You are all awful!

335
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,852
So hungry...

336
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,314
Is that egg custard in that tart?

337
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,743
Oh, no.
That's a lot of canyon crawlers.

338
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:00,704
We barely survived one.

339
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,747
They're coming back for me.

340
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:05,709
They've had a taste,
and they're coming back for me.

341
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,960
Sokka, wait.

342
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,546
I don't care about the stupid feud.

343
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,464
I just want us to get
out of here alive.

344
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:14,968
Me, too. I only took their side
because they fed me.

345
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,725
Hyah!

346
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,655
Hyah!

347
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,085
Aah!

348
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:55,258
Aah!

349
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:20,075
Everybody, watch me and do what I do!

350
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,228
Now follow me.

351
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,979
We're riding out of this hole.

352
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,665
Everyone get off!

353
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,170
We made it!

354
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:16,715
Uh!

355
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:19,300
Huh!

356
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,853
I never thought a Gan Jin
could get his hands dirty like that.

357
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:33,356
And I never knew you Zhangs
were so reliable in a pinch.

358
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,984
Perhaps we're not
so different after all.

359
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:39,988
Too bad we can't rewrite history.

360
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:43,742
You thieves stole our sacred orb
from Jin Wei.

361
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,496
You tyrants unjustly imprisoned
Wei Jin for 20 long years.

362
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,291
Ugh. Wait a second...

363
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,336
Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys.

364
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,506
Yes, yes.
We're all aware of the story.

365
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,259
No, I mean I really knew them.

366
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:04,137
I might not look it,
but I'm 112 years old.

367
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,805
I was there 100 years ago

368
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,599
on the day you're talking about.

369
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,977
<i>There seems to be a lot of confusion
about what happened.</i>

370
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,355
<i>First of all, Jin Wei
and Wei Jin weren't enemies.</i>

371
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:17,358
<i>They were brothers. Twins, in fact.</i>

372
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,403
<i>And they were eight,
and most importantly,</i>

373
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,071
<i>they were just playing a game.</i>

374
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,198
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

375
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,783
<i>The sacred orb from the legend...</i>

376
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,034
<i>That was the ball.</i>

377
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,577
<i>And the eastern and western gates</i>

378
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,912
<i>were the goal posts.</i>

379
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,223
<i>Jin Wei had the ball
and was running toward the goal</i>

380
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:32,957
<i>when he fell and fumbled it.</i>

381
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,168
<i>Wei Jin didn't steal the ball.</i>

382
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:36,931
<i>He picked it up and started
running it back</i>

383
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:39,756
<i>toward the other goal,
but he stepped out of bounds.</i>

384
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,926
<i>So the official put him
in the penalty box...</i>

385
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,637
<i>Not for 20 long years
but for two short minutes.</i>

386
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,013
Hee hee hee!

387
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,391
There was no stealing
and no putting anyone in prison...

388
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,851
Just a game.

389
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,896
You're saying the sacred orb
was actually a sacred ball?

390
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,940
Nope, just a regular ball.

391
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,192
What about our tribe's
redemption ritual?

392
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,694
That's what the game
was called, Redemption.

393
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:04,739
As soon as someone got
the ball from one goal to the other,

394
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,116
everyone would yell, "Redemption!"

395
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:11,120
Don't get me wrong...
Wei Jin was kind of a slob,

396
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,622
and Jin Wei was a little stuffy.

397
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:13,832
That much is true.

398
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:16,543
But they respected
each other's differences

399
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,253
enough to share
the same playing field.

400
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,172
I suppose it's time
we forget the past.

401
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,800
And look to the future.

402
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,895
Good to see you, boy.
Did you miss me?

403
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,273
I cannot thank you enough, Avatar.

404
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:40,525
Well, you know. I try.

405
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:41,860
Oh!

406
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,780
Let us travel
to the Earth Kingdom capital

407
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,532
as one tribe.

408
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:50,827
I'm going, too!

409
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,495
I'm sick of this place.

410
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:55,498
That's some luck
you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.

411
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:57,584
You could call it luck,

412
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,210
or you could call it lying.

413
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,462
- What?
- I made the whole thing up.

414
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,798
You did not.

415
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,592
That is so wrong.

416
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:07,594
Now, where's that custard tart?

417
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,012
I'm starving!
