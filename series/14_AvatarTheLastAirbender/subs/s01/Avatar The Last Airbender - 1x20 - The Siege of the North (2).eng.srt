1
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,256
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,509
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,344
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,140
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:20,269
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:23,397
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,690
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,275
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,610
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,695
<i>100 years passed,</i>

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,864
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar...</i>

13
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,574
<i>An airbender named Aang.</i>

14
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,952
<i>And although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

15
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,663
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

16
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:39,872
Oof.

17
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

18
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,398
I can't believe I lost him.

19
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:07,275
You did everything you could.

20
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,211
And now we need to
do everything we can

21
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,611
to get him back.

22
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,862
Zuko can't have gotten far.

23
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,072
We'll find him.

24
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,782
Aang's gonna be fine.

25
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:15,866
Ok.

26
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:21,789
It's all right.

27
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:22,915
You stay here, Momo...

28
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,375
In case Aang comes back.

29
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,459
Yip, yip!

30
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,862
Om.

31
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,281
Om.

32
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:56,699
Hello?

33
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:58,034
I'm sorry to disturb you.

34
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,535
I just really need to find

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,859
the moon and the ocean spirits.

36
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:02,997
Go away.

37
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,084
You're still here?

38
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,252
Yes, I need...

39
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,546
Om!

40
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,757
Perhaps that thing will help you.

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,008
Chase it!

42
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,720
Finally.

43
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,063
Come back!

44
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:31,734
Hello, Aang.

45
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:32,902
Roku?!

46
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,827
Huh?!

47
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:58,844
Shelter!

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,233
Roku, the water tribe is under attack!

49
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:14,652
I need to find
the ocean and the moon spirits.

50
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,782
The ocean and the moon
are ancient spirits...

51
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,410
They crossed over
from the spirit world

52
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,788
to the mortal world
very near the beginning.

53
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,249
There is only one spirit I know of

54
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,043
who is old enough to remember...

55
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,336
Who?

56
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,131
The spirit's name is Koh,

57
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,133
but he is very dangerous...

58
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,845
They call him the Face Stealer.

59
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,763
When you speak with him,

60
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,932
you must be very careful

61
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:46,934
to show no emotion at all...

62
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,937
Not the slightest expression...

63
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,690
Or he will steal your face.

64
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,252
I finally have you,

65
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,589
but I can't get you home
because of this blizzard.

66
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,132
There's always something.

67
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,342
Not that you would understand.

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,386
You're like my sister.

69
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,555
Everything always came easy to her.

70
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:26,599
She's a firebending prodigy...

71
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:28,434
And everyone adores her.

72
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,728
My father says she was born lucky.

73
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:33,063
He says I was lucky to be born.

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,542
I don't need luck, though...

75
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,193
I don't want it.

76
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,069
I've always had to struggle and fight,

77
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,905
and that's made me strong...

78
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:42,656
It's made me who I am.

79
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:14,383
I don't need to remind you

80
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:15,606
we have a time limit.

81
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,858
If we don't defeat the water tribe

82
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,819
before the full moon rises,

83
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,695
they will be undefeatable.

84
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,988
I assure you...

85
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,740
I have everything under control.

86
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:27,785
I intend to remove
the moon as a factor.

87
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,370
Remove the moon?

88
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:30,579
How?

89
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,997
Admiral Choi!

90
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:35,501
Prepare to meet your fate!

91
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,170
Whoa!

92
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,756
As I was saying.

93
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,842
Years ago, I stumbled upon

94
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,969
a great and powerful secret...

95
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,597
The identity of the moon spirit's
mortal form.

96
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,015
What?!

97
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,433
I was a young lieutenant

98
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,686
serving under General Xu
in the Earth Kingdom.

99
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:55,980
<i>L discovered a hidden library...</i>

100
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,481
<i>Underground, in fact.</i>

101
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,526
<i>I tore through scroll after scroll.</i>

102
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,654
<i>One of them contained
a detailed illustration...</i>

103
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,699
<i>And the words "moon" and "ocean."</i>

104
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,702
<i>I knew then that these spirits
could be found...</i>

105
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,245
<i>And killed...</i>

106
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:14,874
And that it was my destiny to do so.

107
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:18,002
Zhao, the spirits
are not to be trifled with!

108
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,506
Yes, yes, I know
you fear the spirits, Iroh...

109
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,942
I have heard rumors about your journey

110
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,885
into the spirit world.

111
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,137
But the ocean and moon
gave up their immortality

112
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,306
to become a part of our world.

113
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,517
And now they will
face the consequences.

114
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,203
Phew!

115
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,414
You're just a curly-tailed bluenose.

116
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,130
Show no fear.

117
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:05,007
Show no emotion at all.

118
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,730
Hello?

119
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:22,483
I'm looking for a spirit named Koh.

120
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:36,789
Welcome.

121
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,709
Thank you.

122
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,671
My old friend, the Avatar...

123
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,715
It's been a long time.

124
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,008
You know me?

125
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,803
How could I forget you?

126
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:52,513
One of your previous incarnations

127
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,098
tried to slay me...

128
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:56,809
Maybe 800 or 900 years ago.

129
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,769
I didn't know that.

130
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,898
Why did he... Or I... Try to kill you?

131
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,567
Oh, it was something about

132
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,611
stealing the face
of someone you loved.

133
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:18,247
Of course, that's all behind us.

134
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,249
Why should I hold a grudge against you

135
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:21,709
for something in a past life?

136
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,503
After all...
You're a different person now.

137
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,881
You've come to me with a new face.

138
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,139
Guess we'll be here awhile.

139
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,643
Don't worry.

140
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,996
Prince Zuko can't be getting too far

141
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,438
in this weather.

142
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:45,107
I'm not worried
they'll get away in the blizzard.

143
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,192
I'm worried that they won't.

144
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,076
They're not gonna
die in this blizzard.

145
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,739
If we know anything,
it's that Zuko never gives up.

146
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,867
They'll survive... And we'll find them.

147
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,827
It's been a long time

148
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,913
since I've added
a child's face to my collection.

149
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,290
So...

150
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,333
How may I help you?

151
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,003
I need to find
the moon and the ocean.

152
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,840
Their spirit names
are "Tui" and "La... ".

153
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,801
Push and pull.

154
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,720
And that has been the nature

155
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:17,347
of their relationship for all time.

156
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,683
Please, help me find them.

157
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,186
An entire culture could be destroyed

158
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,812
if I don't get their help.

159
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:26,899
Oh, you think you need their help?

160
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:29,693
Actually, it's quite
the other way around.

161
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,113
Someone is going to kill them!

162
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,698
What do you mean?

163
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,492
How can I find them and protect them?

164
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:39,953
You've already met them, actually.

165
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:44,541
Tui and La... Your moon and ocean...

166
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,711
Have always circled each other
in an eternal dance.

167
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:50,089
They balance each other:

168
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,008
Push and pull, life and death,

169
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,552
good and evil...

170
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,679
Yin and Yang.

171
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,185
The koi fish!

172
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,189
I must be going now.

173
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,650
We'll meet again.

174
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,490
The spirits are in trouble!

175
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:18,213
I need to get back
to the physical world!

176
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,870
A friend is here to guide you back.

177
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,955
Hei Bai!

178
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,299
We'll be following this map

179
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:17,134
to a very special location.

180
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,178
And when we get there...

181
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,346
We're going fishing.

182
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,560
This is where I came in...

183
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,187
But how do I get back?

184
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,112
Good riddance.

185
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,994
Momo!

186
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,495
Momo?

187
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,580
Oh, no...

188
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,873
Where's my body?

189
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,215
Look!

190
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,299
That's got to be Aang!

191
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:58,425
Yip, yip!

192
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:04,264
Huh?!

193
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:09,436
Welcome back.

194
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:10,687
Good to be back.

195
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,947
That won't be enough to escape.

196
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,782
Appa!

197
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:26,286
Whoa!

198
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,371
Here for a rematch?

199
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,081
Trust me, Zuko,

200
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,728
it's not going to be much of a match.

201
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,675
Hey, this is some quality rope.

202
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,218
We need to get to the oasis!

203
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,844
The spirits are in trouble.

204
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,851
Wait... We can't just leave him here.

205
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,395
Sure, we can.

206
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:52,479
Let's go.

207
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:53,563
No.

208
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,065
If we leave him, he'll die.

209
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:00,588
Yeah, this makes
a lot of sense...

210
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:03,282
Let's bring the guy
who's constantly trying to kill us.

211
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,440
Are you ok?

212
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:37,899
I feel faint.

213
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,192
I feel it, too.

214
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:43,030
The moon spirit is in trouble.

215
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,407
I owe the moon spirit my life.

216
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,491
What do you mean?

217
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,035
When I was born,

218
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,412
I was very sick and very weak.

219
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,081
Most babies cry when they're born,

220
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,667
<i>but I was born as if I were asleep,</i>

221
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,085
<i>my eyes closed.</i>

222
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,172
<i>Our healers did everything they could.</i>

223
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:03,425
<i>They told my mother and father
I was going to die.</i>

224
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,054
<i>My father pleaded
with the spirits to save me.</i>

225
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,890
<i>That night... Beneath the full moon...</i>

226
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:13,518
<i>He brought me to the oasis
and placed me in the pond.</i>

227
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,687
<i>My dark hair turned white.</i>

228
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,440
<i>I opened my eyes and began to cry...</i>

229
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:19,733
Waah!

230
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:21,193
<i>And they knew I would live.</i>

231
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,321
That's why my mother named me Yue,

232
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,655
for the moon.

233
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,329
I am a legend now.

234
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,539
The Fire Nation will for generations

235
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,708
tell stories about the Great Zhao,

236
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,752
who darkened the moon.

237
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,297
They will call me
Zhao the Conqueror...

238
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,424
Zhao the Moon-slayer...

239
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,177
Zhao the Invincible!

240
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,721
Get it off!

241
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,889
Get it off!

242
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:00,982
Don't bother.

243
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,903
Zhao, don't!

244
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,988
It's my destiny...

245
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,241
To destroy the moon

246
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,867
and the Water Tribe.

247
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,369
Destroying the moon

248
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,413
won't just hurt the Water Tribe,

249
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,540
It will hurt everyone...

250
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:17,916
Including you.

251
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,668
Without the moon,

252
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,711
everything would fall out of balance...

253
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,089
You have no idea what kind of chaos

254
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:25,549
that would unleash on the world.

255
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,259
He's right, Zhao.

256
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,469
General Iroh,

257
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,221
why am I not surprised

258
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,806
to discover your treachery?

259
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:35,016
I'm no traitor, Zhao.

260
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,310
The Fire Nation needs the moon, too.

261
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,980
We all depend on the balance.

262
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,983
Whatever you do to that spirit,

263
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:45,610
I'll unleash on you tenfold!

264
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:47,279
Let it go now!

265
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,780
There's no hope now.

266
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:32,616
It's over.

267
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:35,785
No...

268
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,953
It's not over.

269
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,281
You're alive?!

270
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,116
You tried to have me killed!

271
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,704
Yes, I did.

272
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:02,747
You're the Blue Spirit...

273
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,833
An enemy of the Fire Nation!

274
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,127
You freed the Avatar.

275
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,587
I had no choice!

276
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:15,010
You should have chosen
to accept your failure,

277
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,886
your disgrace...

278
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:19,681
Then at least you could have lived.

279
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,652
It's too late...

280
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,404
It's dead.

281
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,535
You have been touched
by the moon spirit.

282
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,038
Some of its life is in you.

283
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:45,665
Yes, you're right...

284
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,126
It gave me life.

285
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:50,462
Maybe I can give it back.

286
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,714
No!

287
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:53,882
You don't have to do that.

288
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,009
It's my duty, Sokka.

289
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:57,594
I won't let you.

290
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,804
Your father told me to protect you!

291
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,056
I have to do this.

292
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,445
No!

293
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,032
She's gone.

294
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:20,575
She's gone.

295
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,928
Good-bye, Sokka.

296
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,013
I'll always be with you.

297
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,305
It can't be!

298
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,066
Take my hand!

299
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,711
I've decided to go to the South Pole.

300
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,297
Some other benders and healers
want to join me.

301
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,925
It's time we helped rebuild
our sister tribe.

302
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,802
What about Aang?

303
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,887
He still needs to learn waterbending.

304
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,306
Well... Then he better get used to

305
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:50,642
calling you Master Katara.

306
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,480
The spirits gave me a vision

307
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:56,856
when Yue was born.

308
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,983
I saw a beautiful,

309
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:03,404
brave young woman
become the moon spirit.

310
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,907
I knew this day would come.

311
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,700
You must be proud.

312
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,369
So proud...

313
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:11,454
And sad.

314
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:16,251
I'm surprised, Prince Zuko,

315
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:17,710
Surprised that you are not

316
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,839
at this moment
trying to capture the Avatar.

317
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,966
I'm tired.

318
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,926
Then you should rest.

319
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,720
A man needs his rest.

320
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,823
You, too, Momo!

321
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:47,907
Come here!

322
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:01,254
Iroh is a traitor,

323
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:04,132
and your brother Zuko is a failure.

324
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,218
I have a task for you...
