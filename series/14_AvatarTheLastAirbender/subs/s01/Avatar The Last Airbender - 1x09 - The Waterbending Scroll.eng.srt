1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,628
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,339
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:08,382
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,301
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:19,393
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:22,647
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,566
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,901
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:28,653
<i>100 years passed,</i>

12
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:30,988
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar...</i>

13
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,615
<i>An airbender named Aang.</i>

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,992
<i>And although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

15
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,703
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

16
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,788
Oof!

17
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:42,083
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

18
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,023
Would you sit down?!

19
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,150
If we hit a bump,
you'll go flying off!

20
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,485
What's bugging you anyway?

21
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:11,571
It's what Avatar Roku said.

22
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,489
I'm supposed to master
all four elements

23
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,865
before that comet arrives.

24
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,950
Well, let's see.

25
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:17,535
You pretty much mastered airbending,

26
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,412
and that only took you 112 years.

27
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:20,788
I'm sure you can master

28
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,271
three more elements by next summer.

29
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:24,542
I haven't even started waterbending,

30
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,711
and we're still weeks away
from the North Pole.

31
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,462
What am I gonna do?!

32
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,547
Calm down.

33
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,756
It's gonna be ok.

34
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:32,466
If you want,

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,551
I can try and teach you

36
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:34,635
some of the stuff I know.

37
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,720
You'd do that?

38
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,388
We'll need to find

39
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,639
a good source of water first.

40
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,601
Maybe we can find a puddle
for you to splash in.

41
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,688
Nice puddle.

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,366
Yeah!

43
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,701
Don't start without me, boy!

44
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,369
Remember the reason we're here.

45
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,454
Oh, right.

46
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:02,830
Time to practice waterbending.

47
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,541
Great. So, what am I supposed to do?

48
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,376
You could clean the gunk

49
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,461
out of Appa's toes.

50
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,173
So, while you guys
are playing in the water,

51
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:13,507
I'm supposed to be hard at work

52
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,593
picking mud
out of a giant bison's feet?

53
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:16,844
Mud and bugs.

54
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,181
Ok.

55
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,399
Whoa! Whoa!

56
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,692
Oof!

57
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,976
Someone's changing our course.

58
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,215
What's the meaning of this mutiny?

59
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,866
No one told you to change course.

60
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,993
Actually, someone did.

61
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,411
I assure you,

62
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,872
it is a matter of utmost importance,

63
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,040
Prince Zuko.

64
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,102
Is it something to do with the Avatar?

65
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:49,835
Even more urgent.

66
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,128
It seems I...

67
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,922
I've lost my lotus tile.

68
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,591
Lotus tile?

69
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:57,718
For my pai sho game.

70
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,595
Most people think the lotus tile

71
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,805
insignificant.

72
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,684
But it is essential
for the unusual strategy

73
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,519
that I employ.

74
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:09,605
You've changed our course
for a stupid lotus tile?

75
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,565
See, you, like most people,

76
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,651
underestimate its value.

77
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,070
Just give me 10 minutes
to check the merchants

78
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:17,488
at this port of call.

79
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:20,741
Hopefully, they'll have
the lotus tile in stock

80
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,285
and I can get on with my life.

81
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:29,208
I'm lucky to have such
an understanding nephew.

82
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,046
Yeah, don't get too happy.

83
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,172
You've got to do me next.

84
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,843
This is a pretty basic move,

85
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,011
but it still took me
months to perfect.

86
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,763
So, don't be frustrated

87
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,140
if you don't get it right away.

88
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,810
Just push and pull the water
like this.

89
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,854
The key is getting
the wrist movement right.

90
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,398
Like this?

91
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,569
That's almost right.

92
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:58,112
If you keep practicing,

93
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,321
I'm sure eventually...

94
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,823
Hey, I'm bending it already!

95
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:03,534
Wow! I can't believe
you got that so quickly.

96
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,245
It took me two months
to learn that move.

97
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:07,528
Well, you had to figure it out

98
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,748
all on your own.

99
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,458
I'm lucky enough
to have a great teacher.

100
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:11,959
Thanks.

101
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,627
So, what's next?

102
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,337
This is a more difficult move.

103
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,298
I call it streaming the water.

104
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:21,844
It's harder than it looks,

105
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,127
so don't be disappointed if...

106
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,065
Nice work.

107
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,401
Though the over-the-head
flair was unnecessary.

108
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,028
Sorry.

109
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:40,488
Well, don't stop now.

110
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,739
Keep 'em coming.

111
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:43,491
Well, I kind of know
this one other move,

112
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,201
But it's pretty hard.

113
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,952
I haven't even totally
figured it out yet.

114
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,664
The idea is to create
a big, powerful wave.

115
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,421
So, like this?

116
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,761
Aang!

117
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,646
Looks like I got
the hang of that move.

118
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,980
What else you got?

119
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,690
That's enough practicing for today.

120
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,400
Yeah, I'll say!

121
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,985
You just practiced our supplies.

122
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,070
Down the river.

123
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,905
Uh, sorry.

124
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,740
I'm sure we can find some way

125
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,864
to replace all this stuff.

126
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,201
My life was hard enough

127
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:28,564
when you were just an airbender.

128
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,881
Please, put me down!

129
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,925
See the wonder in this bag!

130
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,095
Who's brave enough
to look into this bag?!

131
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,179
Wow!

132
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,226
We've got exactly
three copper pieces left

133
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:53,703
from the money that King Bumi gave us.

134
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,104
Let's spend it wisely.

135
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,648
Uh, make that
two copper pieces, Sokka.

136
00:05:58,065 --> 00:05:59,441
I couldn't say no to this whistle.

137
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,572
It doesn't even work.

138
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,035
See? Even Momo thinks
it's a piece of junk.

139
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,745
No offense, Aang,

140
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,497
but I'll hold the money from now on.

141
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,130
Earth Nation! Fire Nation!

142
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:22,464
Water Nation.

143
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,134
So long as bargains
are your inclination,

144
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:26,760
you're welcome here!

145
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,928
Don't be shy.

146
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,722
Come on by!

147
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,473
Oh, you there!

148
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,517
I can see from your clothing

149
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,477
that you're world traveling types.

150
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,062
Perhaps I can interest you

151
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,189
in some exotic curios?

152
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:40,566
Sure!

153
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:41,817
What are curios?

154
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:45,988
I'm not entirely sure,

155
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,197
But we got 'em.

156
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,163
Huh?

157
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,343
I've never seen
such a fine specimen of lemur.

158
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,762
That beast would fetch me a hefty sum

159
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,847
if you'd be interested in bartering.

160
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,602
Momo's not for sale.

161
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,446
Look at this, Aang!

162
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,490
It's a waterbending scroll.

163
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,617
Check out these crazy moves.

164
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:34,536
Where did you get
a waterbending scroll?

165
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,623
Let's just say I got it up north

166
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:39,458
at a most reasonable price...

167
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,834
Free.

168
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,422
Wait a minute.

169
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,966
Sea-loving traders

170
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,426
with suspiciously acquired merchandise

171
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,221
and pet reptile birds?

172
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,139
You guys are pirates!

173
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,475
We prefer to think of ourselves as

174
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:57,977
high-risk traders.

175
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:02,272
So, how much for the traded scroll?

176
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,899
I've already got a buyer...

177
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,901
A nobleman in the Earth Kingdom...

178
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,654
Unless, of course, you kids have

179
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:11,615
200 gold pieces on you right now.

180
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,492
I know how to deal
with these guys, Katara.

181
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:14,868
Pirates love to haggle.

182
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,248
Watch and learn.

183
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,459
What say ye to the price of...

184
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,003
One copper piece?

185
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,630
Ha ha ha ha!

186
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,258
The price is 200 gold pieces.

187
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,927
I don't haggle on items this rare.

188
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,722
Ok, two copper pieces.

189
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,599
It's not as amusing
the second time, boy.

190
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,643
Aang, can we get out of here?

191
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,395
I feel like we're getting weird looks.

192
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,273
Aye! We be casting off now!

193
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,692
What was that all about, Katara?

194
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,610
Yeah, I was just starting
to browse through

195
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,778
their boomerang collection.

196
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,447
I'll just feel a lot better

197
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,610
once we get away from here.

198
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,199
Hey, you!

199
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,534
Get back here!

200
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:56,660
Well, well.

201
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,287
Look who's come to their senses.

202
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:00,227
Told you the haggling would pay off.

203
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,177
There they are!

204
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,261
Get 'em!

205
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:16,305
Nobody's going nowhere!

206
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,018
I don't think these pirates

207
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,311
are here to trade with us.

208
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,937
Get back here!

209
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,647
You little...

210
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,774
Come on!

211
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:28,108
This way.

212
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,276
Let's cut 'em off!

213
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,404
Whoa!

214
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,116
Whoa!

215
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,201
Oof!

216
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,749
Oh! Oh!

217
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh! Oh!

218
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,466
My cabbages!

219
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:54,176
This place is worse than Omashu!

220
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:02,309
Aha!

221
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,814
I hope that lemur of yours

222
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,148
has nine lives.

223
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:13,278
Now, who gets to taste

224
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,405
the steel of my blade first?

225
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,740
No, thanks.

226
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,492
Haa!

227
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,121
Grab on tight!

228
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,580
Aang, I thought we were

229
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,124
running away from the pirates.

230
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,792
Just hang on.

231
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,960
Whoa!

232
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:29,670
Ow!

233
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:31,213
Whoa!

234
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,468
I used to kind of look up to pirates,

235
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,970
but those guys are terrible.

236
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:39,138
I know.

237
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,181
That's why I took this.

238
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:42,599
No way!

239
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,017
Isn't it great?!

240
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,811
No wonder they were
trying to hack us up.

241
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,105
You stole their waterbending scroll.

242
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:49,857
I prefer to think of it as

243
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,567
high-risk trading.

244
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,651
Ha ha ha.

245
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,194
Good one, Katara.

246
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,280
Sokka, where to you think they got it?

247
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,574
They stole it from a waterbender.

248
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,117
It doesn't matter.

249
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,660
You put all of our lives in danger

250
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:02,744
just so you could learn

251
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,496
some stupid, fancy splashes.

252
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:07,583
These are real waterbending forms.

253
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,876
You know how crucial it is

254
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,544
for Aang to learn waterbending.

255
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,380
Whatever.

256
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:14,756
Well, what's done is done.

257
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,924
We have it.

258
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,248
We might as well learn from it.

259
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,729
I've checked all the shops
on this pier.

260
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:32,357
Not a lotus tile
in the entire marketplace.

261
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,960
It's good to know this trip

262
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,044
was a complete waste of time

263
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,361
for everyone!

264
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,821
Quite the contrary.

265
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,782
I always say
the only thing better than

266
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,076
finding something you are looking for

267
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,538
is finding something
you weren't looking for

268
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,916
at a great bargain.

269
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,627
You bought a sungi horn?

270
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,212
For music night on the ship.

271
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,797
Now, if we only had some woodwinds.

272
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,843
Oh, this place looks promising.

273
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,555
Oh, that is handsome!

274
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,308
Wouldn't it look
magnificent in the galley?

275
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:07,893
We lost the water tribe girl

276
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:08,977
and the little bald monk

277
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,562
she was traveling with.

278
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,606
This monk, did he have
an arrow on his head?

279
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,902
I just want to try
this one move first,

280
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,195
and then it's all yours.

281
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:19,318
Here, hold it open for me.

282
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,534
The single water whip.

283
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:26,411
Looks doable.

284
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,209
Ow!

285
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:33,585
Ha ha ha!

286
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,003
What's so funny?

287
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,797
I'm sorry, but you deserved that.

288
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,090
You've been duped.

289
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,841
She's only interested
in teaching herself.

290
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,260
Aang will get his turn

291
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,678
once I figure out the water whip.

292
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,893
Ugh! Why can't I get
this stupid move?!

293
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,978
You'll get it.

294
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,107
You've just gotta shift your weight

295
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,441
through the stances.

296
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,110
There. See?

297
00:12:58,193 --> 00:12:59,194
The key to bending is...

298
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,154
Will you please shut your air hole!

299
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,864
Believe it or not,
your infinite wisdom

300
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,533
gets a little old sometimes!

301
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,618
Why don't we just
throw the scroll away

302
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,246
since you're so naturally gifted?!

303
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:11,873
What?!

304
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:16,461
Oh, my gosh, Aang.

305
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,255
I am so sorry.

306
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,257
I don't know what came over me.

307
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:21,883
But you know what?

308
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,343
It won't happen again.

309
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,012
Here, this is yours.

310
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,263
I don't want to have

311
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:27,764
anything to do with it anymore.

312
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:29,266
It's ok, Katara.

313
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,600
What about Momo?

314
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,060
He's the real victim here.

315
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,270
I'm sorry, Momo.

316
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,730
And what about me?

317
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,853
There was that time you...

318
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:37,024
No more apologies.

319
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,662
Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?

320
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,039
We don't need to stop.

321
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,749
They stole
a waterbending scroll, right?

322
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,250
Mm-hmm.

323
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,710
Then they'll be on the water.

324
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,523
Shh.

325
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,817
Momo, go back to sleep.

326
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,738
Shh!

327
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:36,875
Shoot!

328
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,252
Come on, water! Work with me here!

329
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,505
Ok, what if I... Ow!

330
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,133
Ok, Katara,

331
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,135
shift your weight through the stances.

332
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:48,428
Ugh!

333
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,520
Ah! No!

334
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:57,604
Let go of me!

335
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,858
I'll save you from the pirates.

336
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,827
Tell me where he is,

337
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,304
and I won't hurt you or your brother.

338
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:14,329
Go jump in the river!

339
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,707
Try to understand,

340
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,917
I need to capture him

341
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,320
to restore something I've lost...

342
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:21,711
My honor.

343
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,547
Perhaps in exchange,

344
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,070
I can restore something you've lost.

345
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:28,927
My mother's necklace.

346
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,929
How did you get that?!

347
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,264
I didn't steal it

348
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:33,627
if that's what you're wondering.

349
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,642
Tell me where he is.

350
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:36,726
No!

351
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,645
Enough of this necklace garbage.

352
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,106
You promised the scroll.

353
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,733
I wonder how much money this is worth.

354
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,110
No!

355
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,862
A lot, apparently.

356
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:49,573
Now, you help me find what I want,

357
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:50,782
you'll get this back,

358
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,617
and everyone goes home happy.

359
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,245
Search the woods for the boy
and meet back here.

360
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,329
Fine.

361
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
Huh?

362
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,670
Where did she go?

363
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,130
I don't believe it.

364
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,299
What's wrong?

365
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:08,425
She took the scroll.

366
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:09,759
She's obsessed with that thing.

367
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,136
It's just a matter of time

368
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,363
before she gets us all in deep...

369
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:13,638
Whoa!

370
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,736
I've got him. Come on!

371
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,906
Oh, what?
I'm not good enough to kidnap?

372
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,324
Aagh!

373
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:37,204
Nice work.

374
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,086
Aang, this is all my fault.

375
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,796
No, Katara, it isn't.

376
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,423
Yeah, it kind of is.

377
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,092
Give me the boy.

378
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,428
You give us the scroll.

379
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,764
You're really gonna
hand over the Avatar

380
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,807
for a stupid piece of parchment?

381
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,059
Don't listen to him.

382
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,782
He's trying to turn
us against each other.

383
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,271
Your friend is the Avatar?

384
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,397
Sure is.

385
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,191
And I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more

386
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:08,109
on the black market
than that fancy scroll.

387
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,778
Shut your mouth,

388
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,029
you water tribe peasant!

389
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:14,241
Yeah, Sokka,
you really should shut your mouth.

390
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,951
I'm just saying,

391
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,369
it's bad business sense.

392
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:18,804
Just imagine how much the Fire Lord

393
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:20,288
would pay for the Avatar.

394
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,499
You guys would be set for life.

395
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,417
Keep the scroll.

396
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,211
We can buy 100 with the reward

397
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:27,504
we'll get for the kid.

398
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,382
You'll regret breaking a deal with me.

399
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:53,655
Thanks, Momo.

400
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:55,323
I owe you a bushel of apples.

401
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,101
Hey!

402
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:36,656
Aah!

403
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:39,117
Aang, are you there?

404
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,328
I'm over here! Follow my voice.

405
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:43,413
Where? I can't find you!

406
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:44,623
I'm right here!

407
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:50,670
Uh, never mind.

408
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,963
I'll find you!

409
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:54,758
Run!

410
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,136
Katara, you're ok.

411
00:18:58,511 --> 00:18:59,989
Help me get this boat
back in the water

412
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,139
so we can get out of here.

413
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:06,811
We need a team of rhinos

414
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,021
to budge this ship.

415
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:09,356
A team of rhinos...

416
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,274
Or two waterbenders.

417
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:23,286
Everybody in!

418
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,124
Are you so busy fighting

419
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,793
you cannot see your own ship

420
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,503
has set sail?

421
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:33,421
We have no time
for your proverbs, uncle.

422
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,173
It's no proverb.

423
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,343
Bleeding hog monkeys!

424
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,512
Ha ha ha ha!

425
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,352
Hey, that's my boat!

426
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,479
Maybe it should be a proverb.

427
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:50,563
Come on, uncle.

428
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,319
Sokka, can't you make it
go any faster?

429
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:57,987
I don't know how.

430
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,711
This thing wasn't made
by the water tribe.

431
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,039
Whoa!

432
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,292
Whoa!

433
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,006
Oof!

434
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,134
Hey! You did the water whip.

435
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,107
I couldn't have done it
without your help.

436
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:23,024
Will you two quit
congratulating each other

437
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,139
and help me out?

438
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,282
That's good.

439
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,200
Wah!

440
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,368
Hah!

441
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,042
Aang, look!

442
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,464
Oh, no!

443
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,931
Aah! Oh!

444
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,475
Have you lost your mind?

445
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,685
This is no time for flute practice!

446
00:21:12,645 --> 00:21:13,813
We can stop the boat.

447
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,148
Aang, together,

448
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:16,357
push and pull the water.

449
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,116
It's working.

450
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,201
It's slowing down.

451
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,834
We're doing it!

452
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,252
But we have another problem.

453
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:40,006
Whoa! Whoa!

454
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,134
Jump!

455
00:21:58,691 --> 00:22:01,110
I knew a bison whistle
would come in handy.

456
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:02,529
Thanks, Appa.

457
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,988
Yeah, we owe you one.

458
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,701
My boat!

459
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:15,792
Prince Zuko,

460
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,877
you're really going to
get a kick out of this.

461
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:22,632
That lotus tile
was in my sleeve the whole time!

462
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,684
Aang,

463
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,310
I still owe you an apology.

464
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:36,729
You were just so good at waterbending

465
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,189
without really trying.

466
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,691
I got so competitive

467
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:41,067
that I put us all in danger.

468
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,819
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,737
That's ok, Katara.

470
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,782
Besides, who needs
that stupid scroll anyway?

471
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,076
Is that really how you feel?

472
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,286
The scroll!

473
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,121
First, what did you learn?

474
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,747
Stealing is wrong.

475
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:57,959
Unless it's from pirates.

476
00:22:58,334 --> 00:22:59,419
Ha ha ha!

477
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:00,628
Good one, Katara.
