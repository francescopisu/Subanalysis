1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:03,794
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,130
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,301
<i>Air...</i>

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,555
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:18,684
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,853
<i>Only the avatar,</i>

8
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,313
<i>master of all four elements,</i>

9
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:23,481
<i>could stop them.</i>

10
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:25,274
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>he vanished.</i>

12
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:29,320
<i>A hundred years passed,
and my brother and I</i>

13
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,947
<i>discovered the new Avatar,</i>

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,698
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

15
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,159
<i>And although his airbending
skills were great,</i>

16
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,363
<i>he has a lot to learn before</i>

17
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>he's ready to save anyone.</i>

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

19
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:11,237
Those clouds
look so soft, don't they?

20
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:13,155
Like you could just jump down

21
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,658
and you'd land in a big, soft,
cottony heap.

22
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,201
Maybe you should give it a try.

23
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,494
You're hilarious.

24
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,079
I'll try it!

25
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,414
Ha ha ha!

26
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,334
Yeah!

27
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:32,341
Turns out, clouds are made of water.

28
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:39,515
Hey, what is that?

29
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,646
It's like a scar.

30
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,235
Listen.

31
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,696
It's so quiet.

32
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:55,406
There's no life anywhere.

33
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,158
Aang, are you ok?

34
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,201
Fire Nation!

35
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,078
Those evil savages make me sick.

36
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,222
They have no respect for...

37
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:03,497
Shh.

38
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,416
What, I'm not allowed to be angry?

39
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:12,423
Why would anyone do this?

40
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,467
How could I let this happen?

41
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,802
Aang, you didn't let this happen.

42
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,471
It has nothing to do with you.

43
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,306
Yes, it does.

44
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,642
It's the avatar's job
to protect nature,

45
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,685
but I don't know how to do my job.

46
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,604
That's why we're going
to the North Pole...

47
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,189
To find you a teacher.

48
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,524
Yeah. A waterbending teacher.

49
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,319
But there's no one who can
teach me how to be the Avatar.

50
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:36,072
Monk Gyatso said
that Avatar Roku would help me.

51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,032
The Avatar before you?

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,575
He died over a hundred years ago.

53
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,118
How are you supposed to talk to him?

54
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,496
I don't know.

55
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,627
Uncle, it's time to leave.

56
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,421
Where are you? Uncle Iroh!

57
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,923
Over here.

58
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,091
Uncle?

59
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,717
We need to move on.

60
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,594
We're closing in
on the Avatar's trail,

61
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,596
and I don't want to lose him.

62
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,599
You look tired, Prince Zuko.

63
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,019
Why don't you join me
in these hot springs

64
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,814
and soak away your troubles?

65
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:12,191
My troubles cannot be soaked away.

66
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:13,609
It's time to go!

67
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,320
You should take your teacher's advice

68
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,406
and relax a little.

69
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,534
The temperature's just right.

70
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:24,203
I heated it myself.

71
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,375
Enough. We need to leave now.

72
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,459
Get out of the water!

73
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,169
Very well.

74
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,295
On second thought,

75
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,214
why don't you take
another few minutes?

76
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,091
But be back at the ship
in half an hour,

77
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:38,426
or I'm leaving without you.

78
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,177
Ahh.

79
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,764
Hey, Aang.

80
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,088
Are you ready to be cheered up?

81
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:46,308
No.

82
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,393
Ow!

83
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,479
Hey, how is that cheering me up?

84
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,023
Cheered me up.

85
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,108
Ow!

86
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,110
Yeah, I probably deserved that.

87
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,363
These acorns are everywhere, Aang.

88
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:02,533
That means the forest will grow back.

89
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:05,244
Every one of these will be
a tall oak tree someday,

90
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:06,662
and all the birds and animals

91
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,080
that lived here will come back.

92
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,293
Thanks, Katara.

93
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,381
Hey, who are you?

94
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,550
When I saw the flying bison,

95
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,594
I thought it was impossible,

96
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,888
but those markings...

97
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,766
Are you the Avatar, child?

98
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,979
My village
desperately needs your help.

99
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,455
This young person is the Avatar.

100
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:52,583
So the rumors of your return are true.

101
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,752
It is the greatest honor of a lifetime

102
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,420
to be in your presence.

103
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,047
Nice to meet you, too.

104
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,802
So, is there something
I can help you with?

105
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,845
I'm not sure.

106
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,806
Our village is in crisis.

107
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,808
He's our only hope.

108
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,852
For the last few days at sunset,

109
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,231
a spirit monster comes
and attacks our village.

110
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,483
He is Hei Bai,

111
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,735
the black and white spirit.

112
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,362
Why is it attacking you?

113
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,155
We do not know.

114
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,115
But each of the last three nights,

115
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,992
he has abducted one of our own.

116
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,661
We are especially fearful

117
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:30,579
because the winter solstice
draws near.

118
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,331
What happens then?

119
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:34,333
As the solstice approaches,

120
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,961
the natural world and the spirit world

121
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:39,004
grow closer and closer,

122
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,589
until the line between them

123
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,591
is blurred completely.

124
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:46,762
Hei Bai is already causing
devastation and destruction.

125
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,597
Once the solstice is here,

126
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,016
there is no telling what will happen.

127
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,686
So what do you want me to do exactly?

128
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,646
Who better to resolve a crisis

129
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,524
between our world and the spirit world

130
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,860
than the Avatar himself?

131
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,611
You are the great bridge

132
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,738
between man and spirits.

133
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,366
Right. That's me.

134
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,201
Hey, great bridge guy.

135
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,911
Can I talk to you over here
for a second?

136
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,875
Aang, you seem a little
unsure about all this.

137
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,419
Yeah. That might be because
I don't know anything at all

138
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:19,670
about the spirit world.

139
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,799
It's not like there's someone
to teach me this stuff.

140
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,302
So, can you help these people?

141
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,178
I have to try, don't I?

142
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,723
Maybe whatever I have to do
will just...

143
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:31,807
Come to me.

144
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,728
I think you can do it, Aang.

145
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,230
Yeah.

146
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,524
We're all gonna get eaten
by a spirit monster.

147
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,702
Who's there?

148
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,331
A meadow vole.

149
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,708
I should have known.

150
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,002
You startled me, little one.

151
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:06,133
Seems I dozed off and missed
my nephew's deadline,

152
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:08,928
but it was a very sweet nap.

153
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:18,812
Uhh!

154
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:23,400
He's a Fire Nation soldier.

155
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,235
He's no ordinary soldier.

156
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,279
This is the Fire Lord's brother.

157
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,781
The Dragon of the West...

158
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,617
The once great General Iroh.

159
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,911
But now, he's our prisoner.

160
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:49,218
Hello? Spirit? Can you hear me?

161
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,637
This is the Avatar speaking.

162
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,390
I'm here to try to help stuff.

163
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:55,891
This isn't right.

164
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,726
We can't sit here and cower while Aang

165
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,436
waits for some monster to show up.

166
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:02,064
If anyone can save us, he can.

167
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,817
He still shouldn't have to
face this alone.

168
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,157
The sun is set.

169
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,034
Where are you, Hei Bai?

170
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,788
Well, spirit, uh,

171
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,373
I hereby ask you

172
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:21,166
to please leave this village in peace.

173
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,800
Ok. Well, I guess
that's settled, then.

174
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:53,073
You must be the Hei Bai spirit.
My name is...

175
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,456
My name is Aang. I'm the avatar,

176
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,915
and I would like to help.

177
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,083
Hey, wait up!

178
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,596
Uh...

179
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,058
The avatar's methods are...

180
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,392
Unusual.

181
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,619
It doesn't seem too interested

182
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:22,853
in what he's saying.

183
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,188
Maybe we should go help him.

184
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:28,233
No. Only the Avatar
stands a chance against the Hei Bai.

185
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,445
Aang will figure out
the right thing to do, Sokka.

186
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:37,576
Please, would you stop
destroying things and listen?

187
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,537
I'm just trying to do my job
as spirit bridge.

188
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,247
Excuse me.

189
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,083
Would you please turn around?

190
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,127
I command you to turn around now!

191
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,505
Uhh!

192
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,842
That's it. He needs help.

193
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,010
Sokka! Wait!

194
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,888
It's not safe.

195
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,182
Hei Bai. Over here!

196
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:05,896
Sokka! Go back!

197
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,606
We'll fight him together, Aang.

198
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,900
I don't want to fight him unless I...

199
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,157
Sokka!

200
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,290
Uncle.

201
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,126
Uncle, where are you?

202
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,253
Sir, maybe he thought
you left without him.

203
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:31,213
Something's not right here.

204
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:32,923
That pile of rocks.

205
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,176
It looks like
there's been a landslide, sir.

206
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,137
Land doesn't slide uphill.

207
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,639
Those rocks didn't move naturally.

208
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:43,308
My uncle's been captured
by earthbenders.

209
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,530
Aang! Over here!

210
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,663
Help!

211
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,123
Hang on, Sokka!

212
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,215
Aah!

213
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,383
Uhh!

214
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,517
Sokka!

215
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,813
I've failed.

216
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,954
Where are you taking me?

217
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,831
We're taking you to face justice.

218
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,957
Right.

219
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,543
But where, specifically?

220
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,296
A place you're quite
familiar with, actually.

221
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:58,342
You once laid siege
to it for 600 days,

222
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:00,427
but it would not yield to you.

223
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,431
Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se.

224
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,267
It was greater than
you were, apparently.

225
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,188
I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se.

226
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,274
After 600 days away from home,

227
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:18,320
my men were tired, and I was tired.

228
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,408
And I'm still tired.

229
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,681
I'm sure they'll be back.

230
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,765
I know.

231
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,687
You should get some rest.

232
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,063
Everything's gonna be ok.

233
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,484
Your brother is in good hands.

234
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,027
I would be shocked

235
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,488
if the Avatar returned without him.

236
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,908
Katara? Katara, I lost him.

237
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,454
The sun is rising.

238
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,749
Perhaps he will return soon.

239
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,668
What? No. I'm right here.

240
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:15,752
Grr!

241
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,637
I'm in the spirit world.

242
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,565
Ugh. Yep, that's Uncle Iroh.

243
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:43,071
I'll figure this out, Katara.
I promise.

244
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:44,990
Like they said, I'm the bridge

245
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:46,825
between the worlds, right?

246
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:49,745
All I have to do
is figure out what I have to do,

247
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,580
but once I do that, no problem.

248
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:55,876
Appa. Hey, buddy. I'm right here.

249
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:00,464
But I guess you can't see me, either.

250
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:04,384
It's ok, Appa. Don't worry.

251
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,386
I'm sure they're on their way back.

252
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,889
I bet they even found you
a bunch of moon peaches,

253
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,057
for a treat.

254
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,311
What am I supposed to do?

255
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,439
Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?

256
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:20,984
Sokka?

257
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,576
That's definitely not Sokka.

258
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:32,996
Uhh!

259
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,295
What?

260
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,881
I can't airbend in the spirit world.

261
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:00,607
You don't know where Sokka is, do you?

262
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,745
You're Avatar Roku's animal guide,

263
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,497
like Appa is to me.

264
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,958
I need to save my friend,
and I don't know how.

265
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,252
Is there some way for me
to talk to Roku?

266
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,716
I'll be back, Katara.

267
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:29,678
Take me to Roku.

268
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,403
Oh.

269
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:47,696
What's the problem?

270
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,406
Nothing.

271
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,785
Actually, there is a bit of a problem.

272
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,955
My old joints
are feeling sore and achy,

273
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:59,499
and these shackles are too loose.

274
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,834
Too loose?

275
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,170
That's right. The cuffs are loose,

276
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,214
and they jangle around
and bump my wrists.

277
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,842
It would help me
if you would tighten them

278
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,344
so they wouldn't shake around so much.

279
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:12,804
Very well.

280
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,890
Corporal, tighten
the prisoner's handcuffs.

281
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:23,690
Aah!

282
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:24,816
Aah!

283
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:28,695
Aah!

284
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,044
Hey! What are you doing?!

285
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,004
Aah!

286
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,553
I don't understand.

287
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,305
This is just a statue of Roku.

288
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,484
Is that what Roku
wants to talk to me about?

289
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:08,818
A comet?

290
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:10,737
When can I talk to him?

291
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,308
It's a calendar,

292
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,686
and the light will reach Roku
on the solstice.

293
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,730
So that's when I'll be able
to speak to Roku?

294
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,359
But I can't wait that long.

295
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:51,236
I need to save Sokka now!

296
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,156
Ugh! Uhh!

297
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:57,784
Hyah!

298
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,669
He is too dangerous, captain.

299
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,504
We can't just carry him
to the capital.

300
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,172
We have to do something now.

301
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,591
I agree.

302
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,859
He must be dealt with immediately

303
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:15,760
and severely.

304
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,886
Ptoh!

305
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,975
It's no use, Appa.
I don't see them anywhere.

306
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,270
Our best hope is to go back
to the village and wait.

307
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,321
The Avatar.

308
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,501
Whoa.

309
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:50,253
Aah!

310
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:20,158
You're back!

311
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,119
Where's Sokka?

312
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,372
I'm not sure.

313
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:33,463
These dangerous hands
must be crushed.

314
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:40,303
Hyah!

315
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,682
Hyah!

316
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,226
Excellent form, Prince Zuko.

317
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,769
You taught me well.

318
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,646
Surrender yourselves.

319
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,022
It's five against two.

320
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,899
You're clearly outnumbered.

321
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:54,943
Uh, that's true,

322
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:57,821
but you are clearly outmatched.

323
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,823
Hy... Ah!

324
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:00,990
Yah! Yah!

325
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,661
Hyah! Hyah!

326
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,709
Hyah!

327
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,793
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

328
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:18,049
Uhh!

329
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,009
Uhh! Uhh!

330
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:23,346
Yah!

331
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,267
Oh!

332
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,693
Now, would you please
put on some clothes?

333
00:20:58,506 --> 00:20:59,799
Aah!

334
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,301
Aang! What are you doing?!

335
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:02,844
Run!

336
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,030
You're the spirit of this forest.

337
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:23,823
Now I understand.

338
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,533
You're upset and angry

339
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,160
because your home was burned down.

340
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:29,746
When I saw the forest had burned,

341
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:30,955
I was sad and upset,

342
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,665
but my friend gave me hope

343
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,029
that the forest would grow back.

344
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:55,438
Sokka!

345
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,316
What happened?

346
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:01,444
You were trapped in the spirit world
for 24 hours.

347
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,779
How are you feeling?

348
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:04,572
Like I seriously need
to use the bathroom.

349
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,827
Thank you, Avatar.

350
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,411
If only there were a way

351
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,996
to repay you for what you've done.

352
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,916
You could give us
some supplies and some money.

353
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:16,334
- Sokka.
- What?

354
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:17,710
We need stuff.

355
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:22,090
It would be an honor
to help you prepare for your journey.

356
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:24,300
I'm so proud of you, Aang.

357
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,594
You figured out what to do
all on your own.

358
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,264
Actually, I did have a little help.

359
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:30,765
And there's something else.

360
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:35,728
What is it?

361
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,021
I need to talk to Roku,

362
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,356
and I think I found a way

363
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:39,774
to contact his spirit.

364
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,485
- That's great.
- Creepy, but great.

365
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,946
There's a temple
on a crescent-shaped island,

366
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,614
and if I go there on the solstice,

367
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,241
I'll be able to speak with him.

368
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,785
But the solstice is tomorrow.
