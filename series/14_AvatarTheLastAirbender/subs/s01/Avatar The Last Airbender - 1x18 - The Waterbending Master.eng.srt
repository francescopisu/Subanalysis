1
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:06,881
<i>Water, earth,</i>

2
00:00:06,964 --> 00:00:10,259
<i>fire, air...</i>

3
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:15,431
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,809
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

5
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

6
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,691
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

7
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,068
<i>he vanished.</i>

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,280
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

9
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,949
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

10
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:35,326
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

11
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:38,079
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:42,333
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

13
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,475
I'm not one to complain,

14
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,019
but can't Appa fly any higher?

15
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,481
I have an idea.

16
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,108
Why don't we all get on your back,

17
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,859
and you can fly us to the North Pole.

18
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,403
I'd love to.

19
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,113
Climb on, everyone.

20
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:14,323
Sokka is ready for takeoff.

21
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,161
Look, we're all just a little tired
and cranky

22
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,330
because we've been flying
for two days straight.

23
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,748
And for what?

24
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,552
We can't even find
the Northern Water Tribe.

25
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,544
There's nothing up here.

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,715
Aagh!

27
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:45,563
They're water benders.

28
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,064
We found the Water Tribe.

29
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,112
He's heading north.

30
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,448
The Northern Water Tribe.

31
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:58,409
The Avatar
needs to master waterbending.

32
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,494
He is looking for a teacher.

33
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,205
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's go get him.

34
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,625
Patience, Captain Li.

35
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,144
This isn't some little earth village

36
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,170
we can just march into.

37
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,255
The Water Tribe is a great nation.

38
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,925
There's a reason they've survived
100 years of war.

39
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,469
The frozen tundra is treacherous.

40
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,846
The landscape itself
is an icy fortress.

41
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,516
We'll need a massive invasion force.

42
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,271
There it is!

43
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:31,025
The Northern Water Tribe.

44
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,318
We're finally here.

45
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:56,842
I can't believe
how many waterbenders live up here.

46
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,387
We'll find a master
to teach us no problem.

47
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,638
This place is beautiful.

48
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,014
Yeah.

49
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,474
She is.

50
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,489
<i>Winter, spring.</i>

51
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,950
<i>Summer and fall.</i>

52
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,661
<i>Winter, spring.</i>

53
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,789
<i>Summer and fall.</i>

54
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,417
<i>Four seasons.</i>

55
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,211
<i>Four loves.</i>

56
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,173
<i>Four seasons.</i>

57
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:19,884
<i>For love</i>

58
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,575
Tonight, we celebrate the arrival

59
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:46,535
of our brother and sister

60
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,204
from the Southern Tribe.

61
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,999
And they have brought with them
someone very special,

62
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,001
someone who many of us believed

63
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,505
disappeared from the world
until now...

64
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,131
The Avatar.

65
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:07,681
We also celebrate
my daughter's 16th birthday.

66
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,477
Princess Yue is now of marrying age.

67
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:13,521
Thank you, Father.

68
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,314
May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits

69
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:17,733
watch over us
during these troubled times.

70
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,613
Now, Master Pakku
and his students will perform!

71
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,261
Hi there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.

72
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:46,762
Very nice to meet you.

73
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:51,517
So, uh...

74
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:54,395
You're a princess, huh?

75
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,815
You know, back in my tribe,
I'm kind of like a prince myself.

76
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:59,942
Ha! The prince of what?

77
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,277
A lot of things!

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,737
Do you mind? I'm trying
to have a conversation here.

79
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,948
My apologies, Prince Sokka.

80
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:10,578
So, it looks like
I'm gonna be in town for a while.

81
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,580
I'm thinking maybe we could...

82
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:14,748
Do an activity together?

83
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,542
Do an activity?

84
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,756
Very smooth.

85
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,466
Master Pakku,

86
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,594
meet your newest student:

87
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,887
The Avatar.

88
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,639
Just because
you're destined to save the world,

89
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,100
don't expect any special treatment.

90
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,271
My friend and I can't wait
to start training with you...

91
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:39,315
After we relax for a couple of days.

92
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:40,941
If you want to relax,

93
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,235
then I suggest
visiting a tropical island.

94
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,322
If not, I'll see you both at sunrise.

95
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,781
Good night.

96
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,332
For the last time,
I'm not playing the sungi horn.

97
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,584
No, it's about our plans.

98
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,628
There is a bit of a problem.

99
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,883
I'm taking your crew.

100
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:06,967
What?

101
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,011
I've recruited them
for a little expedition

102
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,554
to the North Pole.

103
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,097
Uncle, is that true?

104
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,641
I'm afraid so.

105
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,434
He's taking everyone...

106
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,227
Even the cook.

107
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,938
Sorry you won't be there

108
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,814
to watch me capture the Avatar,

109
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,401
but I can't have you
getting in my way again.

110
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,153
No!

111
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,298
I didn't know you were skilled
with broadswords, Prince Zuko.

112
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,675
I'm not.

113
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,385
They're antiques.

114
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,095
Just decorative.

115
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:54,098
Have you heard of the Blue Spirit,
General Iroh?

116
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,516
Just rumors.

117
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,393
I don't think he is real.

118
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,269
He's real, all right.

119
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,562
He's a criminal

120
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,606
and an enemy of the Fire Nation.

121
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,235
But I have a feeling justice
will catch up with him soon.

122
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:09,697
General Iroh, the offer
to join my mission still stands...

123
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:11,323
If you change your mind.

124
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,580
I've waited for this day
my whole life.

125
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:22,376
I finally get to learn from
a real waterbending master!

126
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,131
Good morning, Master Pakku!

127
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:28,882
No, please! March right in!

128
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,051
I'm not concentrating or anything.

129
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,512
Uh, this is my friend... Katara...

130
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,930
The one I told you about.

131
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,683
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:39,852
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

133
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,146
You didn't tell me
your friend was a girl.

134
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,398
In our tribe, it is forbidden

135
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:46,942
for women to learn waterbending.

136
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,077
What do you mean, you won't teach me?

137
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,079
I didn't travel
across the entire world

138
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,706
so you could tell me no!

139
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,124
No.

140
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,084
But there must be
other female waterbenders

141
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,210
in your tribe.

142
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:07,379
Here, the women learn from Yagoda

143
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,339
to use their waterbending to heal.

144
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,300
I'm sure she would be
happy to take you

145
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,718
as her student...

146
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,344
Despite your bad attitude.

147
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,555
I don't want to heal. I want to fight!

148
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,182
I can see that.

149
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,851
But our tribe has customs, rules.

150
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,102
Well, your rules stink!

151
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,353
Yeah!

152
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,605
They're not fair.

153
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:26,440
If you won't teach Katara, then...

154
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:27,524
Then what?

155
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,610
Then I won't learn from you!

156
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:31,862
Well, have fun teaching yourself.

157
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:33,822
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

158
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,907
Wait!

159
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,867
Aang didn't mean that.

160
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,828
You can't risk your training for me.

161
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,747
You have to learn from Master Pakku,

162
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:44,124
even if he is a big jerk.

163
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,088
Why don't we get started, then.

164
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,635
Princess Yue, good morning!

165
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,263
Hey, how about that picnic last night?

166
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,891
Boy, your dad sure knows
how to throw a party.

167
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,559
I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.

168
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,020
Well, it wasn't as much fun
after you left.

169
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,359
So, I'm still hoping
we can see more of each other.

170
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,569
Do an activity, you mean?

171
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,322
Yes, at a place...

172
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:16,782
For some time.

173
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,033
I'd love to.

174
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,077
I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.

175
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,495
Great! I'll see you...

176
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,080
Aagh!

177
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,165
Sorry.

178
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,085
That's ok. It was worth it.

179
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,171
See you tonight.

180
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,132
I'm very impressed.

181
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:35,801
You all seem highly qualified

182
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,137
for the mission I have in mind.

183
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:42,224
That's some tasty gold.

184
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:45,185
What do you need us to do?

185
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:48,480
I believe you're acquainted
with Prince Zuko.

186
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,948
Um, hi.

187
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,032
Are you Yagoda?

188
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,160
Are you here for the healing lesson?

189
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,082
I guess I am.

190
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,208
Welcome!

191
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,960
Welcome!

192
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,843
You're moving the water around,

193
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:20,846
but you're not feeling
the push and pull.

194
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,514
I'm trying.

195
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,851
Ahh!

196
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,811
Maybe that move
is too advanced for you.

197
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,855
Why don't you try an easier one?

198
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,446
Thanks for the lesson.

199
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,072
So, who's the lucky boy?

200
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,157
Huh?

201
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,575
Your betrothal necklace.

202
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,994
You're getting married, right?

203
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,204
Oh, no.

204
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,331
I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

205
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:49,416
My grandmother
gave my mother this necklace,

206
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:51,376
and my mother passed it down to me.

207
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,505
I recognize this carving!

208
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,091
I don't know
why I didn't realize sooner.

209
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,177
You're the spitting image of Kanna.

210
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,470
Wait!

211
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:03,513
How do you know my gran-gran's name?

212
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:06,016
When I was about your age,

213
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,643
I was friends with Kanna.

214
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,561
She was born here...

215
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,104
In the Northern Tribe.

216
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,856
She never told me.

217
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,067
Your grandmother
had an arranged marriage

218
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,652
with a young waterbender.

219
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,904
He carved that necklace for her.

220
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:22,157
If gran-gran was engaged,
why did she leave?

221
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,742
I don't know.

222
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,786
That's always been a mystery to me.

223
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:29,206
She left without saying good-bye.

224
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,333
Good luck!

225
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,046
The crew wanted me
to wish you safe travels.

226
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,090
Good riddance to those traitors.

227
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:40,217
It's a lovely night for a walk.

228
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,094
Why don't you join me?

229
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:44,054
It would clear your head.

230
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,350
Or just stay in your room

231
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,269
and sit in the dark.

232
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,187
Whatever makes you happy.

233
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,798
Whoa!

234
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,925
Careful with the blasting jelly.

235
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,429
Ooh!

236
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:27,848
Uncle?

237
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:29,433
Uncle, is that you?

238
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,589
Aah!

239
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,477
Zuko!

240
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,612
Zuko.

241
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:36,500
Hi, Princess Yue.

242
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,251
I made you something.

243
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,628
I carved it myself.

244
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:41,546
It's a bear.

245
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,424
Actually, it's supposed to be a fish.

246
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,343
See, it has a fin.

247
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:47,969
Oh.

248
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,348
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

249
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,475
I shouldn't have
asked you to come here.

250
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,046
How's warrior training going?

251
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:05,946
That bad?

252
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:07,948
No, it's Princess Yue.

253
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,199
I don't get it.

254
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,676
One minute,
she wants to go out with me,

255
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,380
and the next,
she's telling me to get lost.

256
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,080
So, how's waterbending training?

257
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:19,084
Master Poop-head won't teach her
because she's a girl.

258
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:21,420
Why don't you just teach her, Aang?

259
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,713
Why didn't I think of that?

260
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,424
At night, you can teach me

261
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,634
whatever moves
you learn from Master Pakku.

262
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:29,437
That way,
you have someone to practice with,

263
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,012
and I get to learn waterbending.

264
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,848
Everyone's happy!

265
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,224
I'm not happy.

266
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:35,434
But you're never happy.

267
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,768
Come on, Aang.

268
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,191
Master Pakku said this move

269
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,319
is all about sinking and floating.

270
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,364
I got it!

271
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,451
That was amazing!

272
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:53,785
That wasn't me.

273
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:58,373
I was just showing Katara a few moves.

274
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,041
You have disrespected me,

275
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,627
my teachings, and my entire culture.

276
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,753
I'm sorry, I...

277
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,549
You are no longer welcome
as my student.

278
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,308
What do you want me to do?

279
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:18,852
Force Master Pakku to take Aang back

280
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:19,978
as his student?

281
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:22,022
Yes. Please.

282
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:24,900
I suspect he might change his mind

283
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:28,528
if you swallow your pride
and apologize to him.

284
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:33,408
Fine.

285
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,911
I'm waiting, little girl.

286
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:37,996
No!

287
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,541
No way am I apologizing
to a sour old man like you!

288
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:44,586
Uh, Katara...

289
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,963
I'll be outside
if you're man enough to fight me.

290
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,345
I'm sure she didn't mean that.

291
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:55,013
Yeah, I think she did.

292
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,268
I'm devastated
to hear about Prince Zuko.

293
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,354
Just devastated.

294
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,981
The Fire Lord will not be pleased

295
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,776
when he learns who was responsible.

296
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,570
You know who was behind the attack?

297
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,615
Yes. Pirates.

298
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,618
We had a run-in with them
a while back.

299
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,495
They wanted revenge.

300
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,375
So, have you reconsidered my offer?

301
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,544
Yes, I accept.

302
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,089
It will be an honor
to serve as your general.

303
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,508
To the Fire Nation.

304
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:32,801
To victory!

305
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:37,764
Are you crazy, Katara?

306
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:39,724
You're not gonna win this fight.

307
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,601
I know. I don't care.

308
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,311
You don't have to do this for me.

309
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,854
I can find another teacher.

310
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,690
I'm not doing it for you.

311
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:49,234
Someone needs to
slap some sense into that guy.

312
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,195
So, you decided to show up?

313
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:56,866
Aren't you gonna fight?

314
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,618
Go back to the healing huts

315
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,412
with the other women,
where you belong.

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,167
Fine.

317
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,794
You want to learn to fight so bad,

318
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:09,296
study closely.

319
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,284
Don't worry.
I'm not going to hurt you.

320
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:26,187
Ow!

321
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:42,579
You can't knock me down!

322
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:44,080
Go, Katara!

323
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,457
Well, I'm impressed.

324
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,959
You are an excellent waterbender.

325
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,128
But you still won't teach me,
will you?

326
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,463
No.

327
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,864
This fight is over.

328
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,409
Come back here. I'm not finished yet.

329
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,244
Yes. You are.

330
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:09,165
This is my necklace.

331
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:11,960
No, it's not. It's mine. Give it back!

332
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:14,504
I made this 60 years ago...

333
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,215
For the love of my life...

334
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,550
For Kanna.

335
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:21,636
My gran-gran
was supposed to marry you?

336
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,769
Our plan is working perfectly.

337
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,230
Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.

338
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,649
You didn't have to do this.

339
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:38,194
No nephew of mine
is going to stow away on a ship

340
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,529
without some backup.

341
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,864
Thank you, Uncle.

342
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,575
Someone's coming.

343
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,619
Stay hidden
until we get to the North Pole

344
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,955
and the Avatar will be yours.

345
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:50,457
Good luck.

346
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:55,378
I carved this necklace
for your grandmother

347
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,380
when we got engaged.

348
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,176
I thought we would have
a long happy life together.

349
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,677
I loved her.

350
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,679
But she didn't love you, did she?

351
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:06,598
It was an arranged marriage.

352
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,644
Gran-gran wouldn't let your tribe's
stupid customs run her life.

353
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,396
That's why she left.

354
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,523
It must have taken a lot of courage.

355
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,235
Go get her.

356
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,495
What do you want from me?

357
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:29,871
Nothing.

358
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:32,874
I just want you to know
I think you're beautiful.

359
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:35,960
And I never thought a girl like you
would even notice a guy like me.

360
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,545
You don't understand.

361
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,880
No, no.

362
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:40,381
See, that's the thing.

363
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,091
I think I do understand now.

364
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,677
You're a princess, and I'm...

365
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,262
I'm just a southern peasant.

366
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,014
No, Sokka.

367
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,349
It's ok.

368
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:50,809
You don't have to say anything.

369
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,685
I'll see you around, ok.

370
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,317
Ok, now I'm really confused!

371
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,195
Happy, but confused.

372
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:04,739
I do like you... A lot!

373
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,533
But we can't be together.

374
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,701
And not for the reason you think.

375
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:11,246
It's because...

376
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,956
I'm engaged.

377
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,125
I'm sorry.

378
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,263
Not bad. Not bad.

379
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,430
Ha ha ha ha.

380
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,074
Keep practicing,
and maybe you'll get it

381
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,976
by the time you're my age.

382
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,688
Hey, Katara.

383
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:38,147
What do you think you're doing?

384
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:40,400
It's past sunrise.

385
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:42,026
You're late.

386
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:44,028
Good to see you here.

387
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:45,280
You, too.

388
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:55,540
My fleet is ready.

389
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,585
Set a course
for the Northern Water Tribe.
