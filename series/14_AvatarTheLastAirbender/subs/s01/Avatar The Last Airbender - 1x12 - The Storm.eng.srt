1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:04,337
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:06,255
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,341
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:10,593
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:14,388
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,351
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:23,439
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,734
<i>But when the world needed him most,
he vanished.</i>

10
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,988
<i>100 years passed, and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar,</i>

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,865
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

12
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,117
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,662
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,829
Unh!

15
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,999
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

16
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,826
We need you, Aang.

17
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:18,995
I need you, too.

18
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,044
Be careful, guys!

19
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,296
Guys?

20
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,840
Gyatso?

21
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,592
<i>Why did you disappear?</i>

22
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:34,719
I didn't mean to.

23
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,060
<i>We need you, Aang.</i>

24
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,568
<i>We need you, Aang.
We need you.</i>

25
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,696
<i>We need you, Aang. We need you.</i>

26
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,617
Huh! What's going on?

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,951
Did we get captured again?

28
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:01,412
It's nothing. I just had a bad dream.

29
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:02,747
Go back to sleep.

30
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,110
You don't have to tell me twice.

31
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,875
Are you all right, Aang?

32
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,043
I'm okay.

33
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:09,146
You seem to be having
a lot of nightmares lately.

34
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,963
You want to tell me about it?

35
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,798
I think I just need some rest.

36
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,509
You guys want to hear about my dream?

37
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:19,055
That's okay. I didn't want
to talk about it anyway.

38
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,478
Look at those clear skies, buddy.

39
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,563
Should be some smooth flying.

40
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,610
Well, we'd better
smoothly fly ourselves to a market,

41
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:33,903
because we're out of food.

42
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,155
Guys, wait. This was in my dream.

43
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:37,573
We shouldn't go to the market.

44
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,777
What happened in your dream?

45
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,785
Food eats people!

46
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:44,246
Also, Momo could talk.

47
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,290
You said some very unkind things.

48
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,508
There is a storm coming.

49
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:56,884
A big one.

50
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,511
You're out of your mind, uncle.

51
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,721
The weather is perfect.
There's not a cloud in sight.

52
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,308
A storm is approaching from the north.

53
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,479
I suggest we alter our course
and head southwest.

54
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,398
We know the Avatar
is traveling northward,

55
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,066
so we will do the same.

56
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,277
Prince Zuko,
consider the safety of the crew.

57
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,738
The safety of the crew doesn't matter.

58
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:24,161
Finding the Avatar
is far more important

59
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,205
than any individual's safety.

60
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:33,629
He doesn't mean that.
He's just all worked up.

61
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,468
It's good.
It's perfect, I'm telling you.

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,681
I don't know if I like
the sound of that swishing.

63
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,307
Swishing means it's ripe.

64
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,061
It's the ripe juices
swishing around, huh?

65
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,563
I think it's true, Katara.

66
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:51,856
Swishing means it's ripe.

67
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,275
I just realized
we're out of money, anyway.

68
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,278
Aww...

69
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,783
Out of food and out of money.

70
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,285
Now what are we supposed to do?

71
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:06,245
You could get a job, smart guy.

72
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,764
We shouldn't go out there.

73
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,749
Please! The fish can wait.

74
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,667
There's going to be a terrible storm.

75
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,336
Aw, you're crazy. It's a nice day.

76
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,464
No clouds, no wind, no nothing,

77
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,466
so quit your nagging, woman.

78
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:21,385
Maybe we should find some shelter.

79
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,763
Are you kidding? Shelter from what?

80
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,390
My joints say
there's going to be a storm,

81
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,850
a bad one.

82
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,895
Well, it's your joints
against my brain.

83
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,606
Then I hope your brain can find
someone else to haul that fish,

84
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:34,774
'cause I ain't coming!

85
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,734
Then I'll find a new fish hauler,

86
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,277
and pay him double what you get.

87
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,528
How do you like that?

88
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,613
I'll go.

89
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:41,947
You're hired.

90
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,201
What? You said get a job.

91
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,702
And he's paying double.

92
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,996
Double? Who told you that nonsense?

93
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,048
Oh. Looks like your uncle was right
about the storm after all.

94
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:00,257
Lucky guess.

95
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,593
Lieutenant,
you'd better learn some respect,

96
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,888
or I will teach it to you.

97
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,557
What do you know about respect?

98
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,770
The way you talk
to everyone around here,

99
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:15,648
from your hard-working crew
to your esteemed uncle,

100
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,943
shows you know nothing about respect.

101
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:21,821
You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

102
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:26,033
Then again, what should I expect
from a spoiled prince?

103
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:31,247
Easy now.

104
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,001
Enough!

105
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,339
We're all a bit tired
from being at sea so long.

106
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,050
I'm sure after a bowl of noodles,

107
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,136
everyone will feel much better.

108
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,517
I don't need your help
keeping order on my ship.

109
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,736
Sokka, maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

110
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,988
Look at the sky.

111
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,614
I said I was gonna do this job.

112
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,825
I can't back out just because
of some bad weather.

113
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,245
The boy with the tattoos
has some sense.

114
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:12,413
You should listen to him.

115
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,748
Boy with tattoos?

116
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,959
Airbender tattoos.

117
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,004
Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle.

118
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:21,505
You're the Avatar, ain't you?

119
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:22,882
That's right.

120
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,842
Well, don't be so smiley about it.

121
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:28,721
The Avatar disappeared
for a hundred years!

122
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,848
You turned your back on the world.

123
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,725
Don't yell at him!

124
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:34,894
Aang would never
turn his back on anyone.

125
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,104
Oh, he wouldn't, huh?

126
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,023
Then I guess I must have imagined

127
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:42,234
the last hundred years
of war and suffering.

128
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,904
Aang is the bravest person I know.

129
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,906
He has done nothing but help people,

130
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,241
and save lives since I met him.

131
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,911
It's not his fault he disappeared,
right, Aang?

132
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,662
Aang, what's wrong?

133
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:58,876
That's right! Keep flying!

134
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:00,669
You're a horrible old man!

135
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,921
Ehh!

136
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,967
Appa, yip yip!

137
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,135
Uhh!

138
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:10,387
Hey! They left
without saying good-bye.

139
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,556
Your friends ain't too polite,
are they?

140
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,683
I know. This one time, I was...

141
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,685
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get below deck.

142
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,749
I'm sorry for running away.

143
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:41,502
It's okay. That fisherman
was way out of line.

144
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,046
Actually, he wasn't.

145
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,632
What do you mean?

146
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,509
I don't want to talk about it.

147
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:51,261
It has to do with your dream,
doesn't it?

148
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,888
Talk to me.

149
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,391
Well, it's kind of a long story.

150
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,691
I'm gonna try to get
a little fire going.

151
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,905
I'll never forget the day
the monks told me I was the Avatar.

152
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,202
<i>L was playing with some other kids
just outside the south wall.</i>

153
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,871
<i>I was trying to teach them
how to do the air scooter.</i>

154
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:21,375
First you form a ball.
Then you've got to get on quick.

155
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,378
Ha ha ha!

156
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:26,588
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

157
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,257
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

158
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:31,218
Okay, here goes.

159
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,428
Quick. Get on.

160
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,972
Whoa. Whoa...

161
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:36,724
Uhh!

162
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:39,143
You kind of have to balance on it
like it's a top.

163
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,061
Man, that's hard.

164
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,750
Where did you learn that trick, Aang?

165
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,981
I made it up.

166
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,607
Wow!

167
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,776
Aang, come with us.

168
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,778
We need to speak with you.

169
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,704
How do you know it's me?

170
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:02,124
We have known you were
the Avatar for some time.

171
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,126
Do you remember these?

172
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,633
Those were some of my favorite toys
when I was little.

173
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,762
You chose them
from among thousands of toys, Aang.

174
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,974
The toys you picked
were the four Avatar relics.

175
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,144
These items belonged to Avatars past.

176
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:24,396
Your own past lives.

177
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,565
I just chose them
because they seemed fun.

178
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:29,777
You chose them
because they were familiar.

179
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:34,615
Normally, we would have told you
of your identity when you turned 16.

180
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,451
But there are troubling signs.

181
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,496
Storm clouds are gathering.

182
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,416
I fear that war may be upon us,
young Avatar.

183
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,126
We need you, Aang.

184
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:55,886
I'm sick of taking his orders,

185
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,013
and I'm tired of chasing his Avatar.

186
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,516
I mean, who does Zuko think he is?

187
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:02,476
Do you really want to know?

188
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,478
General Iroh, we were just...

189
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,105
It's okay.

190
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:07,606
May I join you?

191
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:08,732
Of course, sir.

192
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,279
Try to understand,

193
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,907
my nephew is a complicated young man.

194
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,992
He has been through much.

195
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,500
Let me in!

196
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,377
Prince Zuko, what's wrong?

197
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,003
I want to go into the war chamber,

198
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,839
but the guard won't let me pass.

199
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,424
You're not missing anything. Trust me.

200
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,427
These meetings are dreadfully boring.

201
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,721
If I'm going to rule
this nation one day,

202
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,141
don't you think I need
to start learning as much as I can?

203
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,854
Very well,
but you must promise not to speak.

204
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:49,773
These old folks are a bit sensitive,
you know?

205
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,067
Thank you, uncle.

206
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:01,577
The Earth Kingdom defenses
are concentrated here,

207
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,288
a dangerous battalion
of their strongest earthbenders,

208
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:06,165
and fiercest warriors.

209
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:09,585
So, I am recommending
the 41 st division.

210
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:12,504
But the 41 st is entirely new recruits.

211
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,300
How do you expect them to defeat
a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?

212
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,552
I don't.

213
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,304
They'll be used as a distraction

214
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,306
while we mount an attack
from the rear.

215
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:26,518
What better to use as bait
than fresh meat?

216
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:29,271
You can't sacrifice
an entire division like that!

217
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,481
Those soldiers love
and defend our nation.

218
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,900
How can you betray them?

219
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,738
Zuko was right, you see?

220
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,116
But it was not his place to speak out.

221
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,911
And there were dire consequences.

222
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,957
So you were upset
that you were the Avatar?

223
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,501
Why wouldn't you be excited about it?

224
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:54,087
Well, I didn't know
how to feel about it.

225
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,381
All I knew was that after I found out,

226
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,258
everything began changing.

227
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,594
Hey, not bad.

228
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:01,929
You guys have been practicing.

229
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:03,639
Not only that,

230
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,642
we made up a game you can play
with the air scooters.

231
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,935
Great!

232
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:13,815
What's going on?

233
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,651
Now that you're the Avatar,

234
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,486
it's kind of an unfair advantage

235
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:19,071
for whichever team you're on.

236
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,572
But I'm still the same.

237
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,616
Nothing has changed.

238
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,244
So, what? I can't play?

239
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:26,954
That's the only fair way.

240
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,706
Oh, okay...

241
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,625
Sorry, Aang.

242
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,379
Okay, now, who wants
to have Jinju on their team?

243
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,016
Very interesting move, young one.

244
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:49,768
What do you mean?

245
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:56,483
Hey! Ha ha ha!

246
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,986
Ha ha ha!

247
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,029
You're playing games with him?

248
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,365
The Avatar should be training.

249
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:06,159
Aang has already
trained enough for today.

250
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,495
Time is short. Come with me.

251
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:11,373
I must test you
on some high-level techniques.

252
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,209
No. As long as I am his guardian,

253
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,295
I will decide when he trains.

254
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,172
And when he gets his butt kicked
at Pai Sho.

255
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:20,841
Hmmph!

256
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:30,183
After Zuko's outburst in the meeting,

257
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,854
<i>the Fire Lord became
very angry with him.</i>

258
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,066
<i>He said that Prince Zuko's
challenge of the general</i>

259
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:42,195
was an act of complete disrespect.

260
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,782
And there was only one way
to resolve this.

261
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,577
Agni Kai. A fire duel.

262
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,662
That's right.

263
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,999
Zuko looked upon
the old general he had insulted,

264
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:56,752
and declared that he was not afraid.

265
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,755
<i>But Zuko misunderstood.</i>

266
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,257
<i>When he turned to face his opponent,</i>

267
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,594
<i>he was surprised to see
it was not the general.</i>

268
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,723
<i>Zuko had spoken out
against the general's plan,</i>

269
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:12,809
<i>but by doing so
in the Fire Lord's war room,</i>

270
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,938
<i>it was the Fire Lord
whom he had disrespected.</i>

271
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:22,402
<i>Zuko would have to duel
his own father.</i>

272
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,656
Then, just when
I was starting to feel better,

273
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,533
something worse happened.

274
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,203
Aang needs to have freedom and fun.

275
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:34,623
He needs to grow up as a normal boy.

276
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,085
Hmm. You cannot keep protecting him
from his destiny.

277
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,004
Gyatso, I know you mean well,

278
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,800
but you are letting your affection
for the boy cloud your judgment.

279
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:48,470
All I want is what is best for him.

280
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:51,807
But what we need
is what's best for the world.

281
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:57,813
You and Aang must be separated.

282
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:00,732
The Avatar will be sent away
to the Eastern Air Temple

283
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,692
to complete his training.

284
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:14,913
That's awful, Aang.

285
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,332
I don't know what to say.

286
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,042
How could they do that to me?

287
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,728
They wanted to take away
everything I knew,

288
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,003
and everyone I loved!

289
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,131
Whoa! Hot cinders.

290
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,300
I'm sorry I got so mad.

291
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,219
You have a right to be angry

292
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:30,862
after the monks
sent you away like that.

293
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,849
Well, that's not exactly
what happened.

294
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,231
<i>I was afraid and confused.</i>

295
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,275
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

296
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,158
Aang?

297
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,743
I'm not going to let them
take you away from me.

298
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,120
Aang?

299
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,630
<i>I never saw Gyatso again.</i>

300
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:23,523
<i>Next thing I knew,
I was waking up in your arms</i>

301
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,734
<i>after you found me in the iceberg.</i>

302
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,197
You ran away.

303
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,033
And then the Fire Nation
attacked our temple.

304
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,202
My people needed me,
and I wasn't there to help.

305
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,953
You don't know what would have...

306
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,917
The world needed me,
and I wasn't there to help.

307
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:40,999
- Aang...
- The fisherman was right.

308
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,876
I did turn my back on the world.

309
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,378
You're being too hard on yourself.

310
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,838
Even if you did run away,

311
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,007
I think it was meant to be.

312
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:51,027
If you had stayed,
you would have been killed

313
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,761
along with all the other airbenders.

314
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,387
You don't know that.

315
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,515
I know it's meant to be this way.

316
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:59,935
The world needs you now.

317
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,269
You give people hope.

318
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:10,320
When Prince Zuko saw
that it was his father

319
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:12,364
who had come to duel him,

320
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,032
he begged for mercy.

321
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,244
Please, father,

322
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,407
I only had the Fire Nation's
best interests at heart.

323
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,914
I'm sorry I spoke out of turn.

324
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:24,167
You will fight for your honor.

325
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,503
I meant you no disrespect.

326
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:27,837
I am your loyal son.

327
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:31,341
Rise and fight, Prince Zuko.

328
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:33,093
I won't fight you.

329
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,637
You will learn respect,

330
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:39,599
and suffering will be your teacher.

331
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,687
<i>I looked away.</i>

332
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:52,946
I always thought that Prince Zuko
was in a training accident.

333
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,740
It was no accident.

334
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,742
After the duel,

335
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,329
the Fire Lord said
that by refusing to fight,

336
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:04,958
Zuko had shown shameful weakness.

337
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,627
As punishment, he was banished,

338
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,797
and sent to capture the Avatar.

339
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:14,884
Only then could he return
with his honor.

340
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,013
So that's why he's so obsessed.

341
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,724
Capturing the Avatar
is the only chance he has

342
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,059
of things returning to normal.

343
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:25,312
Things will never return to normal,

344
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:27,939
but the important thing is,

345
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,525
the Avatar gives Zuko hope.

346
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,086
Help! Oh, please, help!

347
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,464
It's okay. You're safe.

348
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:54,341
But my husband isn't.

349
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,593
What do you mean? Where's Sokka?

350
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,261
They haven't returned.

351
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,888
They should have been back by now.

352
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,223
And this storm is becoming a typhoon.

353
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,059
They're caught out at sea!

354
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,685
I'm going to find them.

355
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,936
I'm going with you.

356
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,229
I'm staying here.

357
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:13,568
We'll be back soon. I promise.

358
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,368
Where were we hit?

359
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,452
I don't know.

360
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,371
Look!

361
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:26,247
The helmsman!

362
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:44,307
Aah!

363
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:55,777
Where are they?

364
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:00,907
Come on, Appa!

365
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:13,670
The boat! There!

366
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:17,674
The Avatar!

367
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:20,343
What do you want to do, sir?

368
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,970
Let him go.

369
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,972
We need to get this ship to safety.

370
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,059
Then we must head directly
into the eye of the storm.

371
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,611
I'm too young to die!

372
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,488
I'm not, but I still don't want to!

373
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,005
Hang on to the rope!

374
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,969
Whoa! Whoa!

375
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:52,393
Uncle, I am sorry.

376
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,896
Your apology is accepted.

377
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,794
Oh! You're alive!

378
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,338
You owe this boy an apology.

379
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:22,257
He doesn't have to apologize.

380
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,134
What if, instead of an apology,

381
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,637
I give him a free fish,
and we call it even?

382
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,597
Actually, I don't eat meat.

383
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:31,057
Fish ain't meat.

384
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:33,601
Seriously, you're still gonna pay me,
right?

385
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:35,895
Aah!

386
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:38,022
Katara, I think you were right before.

387
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,566
I'm done dwelling on the past.

388
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,775
Really?

389
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,087
I can't make guesses about
how things would have turned out.

390
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,320
If I hadn't run away.

391
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:47,029
I'm here now, and I'm going
to make the most of it.

392
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:49,617
I don't think you're gonna have
those nightmares anymore.

393
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:52,412
If you weren't here now...

394
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,956
Well, I guess, I wouldn't be either.

395
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:57,709
Thank you for saving my life, Avatar.

396
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,337
Do you hear that?

397
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,422
It stopped raining.

398
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,848
Uh! Appa!
