1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:05,546
<i>Water, earth,</i>

2
00:00:06,964 --> 00:00:09,926
<i>fire, air...</i>

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,555
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

4
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:18,476
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,895
<i>Only the Avatar,</i>

6
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,563
<i>master of all four elements,</i>

7
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,689
<i>could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,525
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,901
<i>he vanished.</i>

10
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,488
<i>100 years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,907
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,076
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

13
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,579
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

14
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:41,874
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

15
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,106
- Yay! Yay!
- Aang's back!

16
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,032
I knew it.

17
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,243
You signaled the Fire Navy
with that flare.

18
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,579
You're leading them
straight to us, aren't you?

19
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,997
Aang didn't do anything.

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,582
It was an accident.

21
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,083
Yeah, we were on the ship

22
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,227
and there was this booby trap,

23
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,044
and, well, we...

24
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,462
We boobied right into it.

25
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,382
Katara, you shouldn't have
gone on that ship.

26
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,509
Now we could all be in danger.

27
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,011
Don't blame Katara.

28
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,679
I brought her there.

29
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:37,888
It's my fault.

30
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,973
A-ha!

31
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:40,433
The traitor confesses!

32
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,602
Warriors, away from the enemy!

33
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,062
The foreigner is banished
from our village.

34
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,398
Sokka, you're making a mistake.

35
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,734
No, I'm keeping my promise to dad.

36
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,777
I'm protecting you
from threats like him.

37
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,030
Aang is not our enemy.

38
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:55,781
Don't you see?

39
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,241
Aang's brought us something

40
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,161
we haven't had in a long time... Fun.

41
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,164
Fun? We can't fight firebenders
with fun!

42
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:05,082
You should try it sometime.

43
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:07,460
Get out of our village, now!

44
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:10,963
Grandmother, please,
don't let Sokka do this.

45
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,966
Katara, you knew going on
that ship was forbidden.

46
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,635
Sokka is right.

47
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,304
I think it best
if the airbender leaves.

48
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,223
Fine, then I'm banished, too.

49
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,892
Come on, Aang, let's go.

50
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,269
Where do you think you're going?

51
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,021
To find a waterbender.

52
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,398
Aang is taking me to the North Pole.

53
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:31,275
I am?

54
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,985
- Great!
- Katara!

55
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:35,863
Would you really choose him
over your tribe,

56
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,615
your own family?

57
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,666
Katara, I don't want to come between
you and your family.

58
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,796
So you're leaving the South Pole?

59
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,714
This is goodbye?

60
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,716
Thanks for penguin sledding with me.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,259
Where will you go?

62
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,887
Guess I'll go back home
and look for the airbenders.

63
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,847
Wow.

64
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,141
I haven't cleaned my room
in 100 years.

65
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,060
Not looking forward to that.

66
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,315
It was nice meeting everyone.

67
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,694
Let's see your bison fly now, Airboy.

68
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,696
Come on, Appa, you can do it.

69
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:18,030
Yip yip!

70
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,951
Yeah, I thought so!

71
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,706
Aang, don't go.

72
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,957
I'll miss you.

73
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,917
I'll miss you, too.

74
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:36,674
Come on, boy.

75
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:48,728
Katara, you'll feel better after you...

76
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,062
You happy now?

77
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,315
There goes my one chance
of becoming a waterbender!

78
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,531
All right, ready our defenses!

79
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:02,908
The Fire Nation could be
on our shores any moment now!

80
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,034
But I got to...

81
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,578
And no potty breaks!

82
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,259
Yeah, I liked her, too.

83
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:28,976
The village!

84
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,858
Appa, wait here!

85
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,552
Oh, man!

86
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:54,937
Oh, man.

87
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,833
Sokka! Get out of the way!

88
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,950
Where are you hiding him?

89
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,209
He'd be about this age,

90
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,211
master of all elements.

91
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,972
I know you're hiding him.

92
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,486
Show no fear!

93
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,577
Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka.

94
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,328
Hi, Aang.

95
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,413
Thanks for coming.

96
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:15,804
Looking for me?

97
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,765
You're the airbender?

98
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:20,392
You're the Avatar?

99
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,186
Aang?

100
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,270
No way.

101
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:29,485
I've spent years preparing
for this encounter,

102
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,737
training, meditating.

103
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,031
You're just a child.

104
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,324
Well, you're just a teenager.

105
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,507
If I go with you,

106
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,383
will you promise
to leave everyone alone?

107
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,771
No, Aang, don't do this.

108
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:07,523
Don't worry, Katara.

109
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,691
It'll be ok.

110
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,776
Unh!

111
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:16,490
Take care of Appa for me
until I get back.

112
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:18,534
Head a course to the Fire Nation.

113
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:19,993
I'm going home.

114
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,077
We have to go after that ship, Sokka.

115
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,579
Aang saved our tribe.

116
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,080
Now we have to save him.

117
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,248
Katara, I...

118
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,250
Why can't you realize
that he's on our side?

119
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,544
If we don't help him, no one will.

120
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:12,838
I know you don't like Aang,
but we owe him and...

121
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,215
Katara, are you going to talk all day

122
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,800
or are you coming with me?

123
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,927
Sokka!

124
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,055
Get in.

125
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,366
We're going to save your boyfriend.

126
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,683
- He's not my...
- Whatever.

127
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:27,352
What do you two think you're doing?

128
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,106
You'll need these.

129
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,483
You have a long journey ahead of you.

130
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,406
It's been so long since I've had hope,

131
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,408
but you brought it back to life,

132
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,534
my little waterbender.

133
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,539
And you, my brave warrior,

134
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,583
be nice to your sister.

135
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,669
Yeah, ok, Gran.

136
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,005
Aang is the Avatar.

137
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:57,299
He's the world's only chance.

138
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:59,676
You both found him for a reason.

139
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:03,513
Now your destinies
are intertwined with his.

140
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,327
There's no way we're going to catch

141
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,144
a warship with a canoe.

142
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,274
Appa!

143
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,318
You just love taking me
out of my comfort zone,

144
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,402
don't you?

145
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,453
This staff will make
an excellent gift for my father.

146
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,580
I suppose you wouldn't
know of fathers,

147
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,666
being raised by monks.

148
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,210
Take the Avatar to the prison hold

149
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,836
and take this to my quarters.

150
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:39,675
Hey, you mind taking this
to his quarters for me?

151
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:42,177
Ugh!

152
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,527
So, I guess you've never fought
an airbender before.

153
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,112
I bet I can take you both

154
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:01,655
with my hands tied behind my back.

155
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:02,739
Silence.

156
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,969
The Avatar has escaped!

157
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,019
Go.

158
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:33,603
Fly.

159
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,063
Soar.

160
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:38,108
Please, Appa, we need your help.

161
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:39,401
Aang needs your help.

162
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:40,485
Up.

163
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,987
Ascend.

164
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,196
Elevate.

165
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:45,991
Sokka doesn't believe you can fly,

166
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,909
But I do, Appa.

167
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,995
Come on, don't you want to save Aang?

168
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,583
What was it that kid said?

169
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,709
Yee-ha?

170
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:56,793
Hup-hup?

171
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,878
Wa-hoo?

172
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,088
Uh, yip yip?

173
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,391
You did it, Sokka!

174
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,352
He's flying!

175
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,436
He's flying!

176
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,521
Katara, he's...

177
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,066
I mean, big deal.

178
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,192
He's flying.

179
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,870
Aah!

180
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:35,123
You haven't seen
my staff around, have you?

181
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,631
Thanks, anyway.

182
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,698
Sorry.

183
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:16,998
My staff!

184
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,419
Looks like I underestimated you.

185
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,224
What is that?

186
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,561
Appa!

187
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:24,125
Aang, no!

188
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,588
Aang! Aang!

189
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,382
Aang!

190
00:17:57,784 --> 00:17:59,327
Did you see what he just did?

191
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,871
Now that was some waterbending.

192
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,716
Aang, are you ok?

193
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,386
Hey, Katara.

194
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:17,679
Hey, Sokka.

195
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:19,014
Thanks for coming.

196
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,391
Well, I couldn't let you
have all the glory.

197
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,143
I dropped my staff.

198
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:24,352
Got it.

199
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:36,656
Ha!

200
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,991
That's from the water tribe!

201
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,210
Katara!

202
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,182
Hurry up, Sokka!

203
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,017
I'm just a guy with a boomerang.

204
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,895
I didn't ask for all this
flying and magic.

205
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,481
Yip yip! Yip yip!

206
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:14,778
Huh?

207
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:15,862
Huh?

208
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,036
Shoot them down!

209
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:50,897
Good news for the Fire Lord.

210
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,817
The Fire Nation's greatest threat

211
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,318
is just a little kid.

212
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,738
That kid, uncle, just did this.

213
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,157
I won't underestimate him again.

214
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,410
Dig this ship out and follow them.

215
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,025
As soon as you're done with that.

216
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,424
How did you
do that with the water?

217
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,926
It was the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

218
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,469
I don't know.

219
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,304
I just sort of did it.

220
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:27,308
Why didn't you tell us
you were the Avatar?

221
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,562
Because I never wanted to be.

222
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:44,325
But, Aang, the world's been waiting
for the Avatar to return

223
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,619
and finally put an end to this war.

224
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:48,872
And how am I going to do that?

225
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,206
According to legend,

226
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,167
You need to first master water,

227
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,252
then earth, then fire, right?

228
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:55,754
That's what the monks told me.

229
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,839
Well, if we go to the north pole,

230
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,883
you can master waterbending.

231
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:01,301
We could learn it together!

232
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,887
And, Sokka,
I'm sure you'll get to knock

233
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,597
some firebender heads on the way.

234
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,931
I'd like that.

235
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,475
I'd really like that.

236
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,852
Then we're in this together.

237
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:12,896
All right,
but before I learn waterbending,

238
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:15,565
we have some
serious business to attend to

239
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:18,026
here, here, and here.

240
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,694
What's there?

241
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,863
Here we'll ride the hopping llamas.

242
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:25,033
Then way over here we'll surf
on the backs of giant koi fish.

243
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,869
Then back over here
we'll ride the hog monkeys.

244
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,746
They don't like people riding them,

245
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,247
but that's what makes it fun!
