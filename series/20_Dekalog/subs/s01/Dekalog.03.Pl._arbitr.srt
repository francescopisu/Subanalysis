1
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
Who is it?

2
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,080
The Santa Klaus

3
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,080
Merry Christmas!

4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
"Oh, sorry..."
I didn't recognize you

5
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,200
"And you must be Krysia, right?"

6
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,400
"Well, Krysia, this is for you"
A small gift

7
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,440
"And you're Antos, aren't you?"

8
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,200
"There's something for you, too"

9
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,600
And for grandma

10
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,040
Thank you

11
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
This is for Basia

12
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,200
Here's something for Mummy

13
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,080
"Yes, let me see now"

14
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,640
Thank you

15
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Do you really think we'll go?

16
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,440
We'll try

17
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Thank you

18
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,160
She's in her room

19
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,800
Is she feeling bad?

20
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,560
"Merry Christmas, Aunt"

21
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,720
Ewa?

22
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
My dear Ewa...

23
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,520
Have you done your homework?

24
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,160
"Yes, Aunt"

25
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,760
"The maths, too?"

26
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,280
"Yes, Aunt"

27
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,680
I was always very good at maths...

28
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,440
I thought you'd come with...

29
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
what's-his-name... er...

30
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,200
Edward

31
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,880
Yes

32
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,880
Merry Christmas... once more

33
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,440
"The kids will never forget this Christmas,"
the Santa Klaus and the midnight mass

34
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
"Oh yes, It's been as before"

35
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,240
Yes

36
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,840
Yes?

37
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,520
I don't know

38
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,640
It seems someone's trying to steal our car

39
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,120
I'll be back soon

40
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,920
Where's my home?

41
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Where's my home...

42
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,760
Where...

43
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,400
IT seems you forgot to wish me
merry Christmas once again

44
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,840
What do you want?

45
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,080
It's the Christmas Eve

46
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
"Tell me, what do you want?"

47
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,560
Edward's missing

48
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,040
What?

49
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,400
He's gone

50
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,560
Ewa...

51
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,760
Went out in the morning
and never come back

52
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,720
We've got to find him

53
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,720
It's the Christmas Eve

54
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,080
I'm sorry

55
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,920
Ewa...

56
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
"All right, I'll go with you"

57
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,280
What have you told your wife?

58
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,480
That someone was trying to steal the car

59
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,120
Let me have the keys

60
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,920
Join me behind the corner

61
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,840
It's been stolen

62
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,960
Somebody's seen it in Wislostrada street

63
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,440
You call the police

64
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,400
...and I'll try to catch a taxi

65
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,120
Is it worth your while?

66
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,520
"The car earns our living, doesn't it?"

67
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,480
We attended the midnight mass

68
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,400
"No, I didn't"

69
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,320
I saw you there

70
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,160
"Ah, all right, let's forget it"

71
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,560
I've checked everywhere

72
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,440
"...with friends, with the police..."

73
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,480
Where to?

74
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,240
Where would you go
if your wife disappeared?

75
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,840
"I don't know, to the hospital?"
...the emergency department

76
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,680
The emergency service's
in Banacha street tonight

77
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,640
"Do you have emergency service tonight,
Doctor?"

78
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,840
"Not today, yesterday"

79
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,440
I've made a mistake

80
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,360
What about today?

81
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,200
Which hospital has?

82
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,440
Whom are you trying to find?

83
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,640
A husband

84
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,160
"No, mine"

85
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,400
"That you, Jurek?"

86
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,200
Do you happen to have a patient...

87
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,280
His name?

88
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,080
By the name of Garus?

89
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,960
Thirty-eight

90
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,680
"Yes, Garus, thirty-eight"

91
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,080
"No, there's a female here..."
looking for her husband

92
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
When was he brought to you?

93
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,920
When did he leave home?

94
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,800
At noon

95
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,720
It doesn't seem to be him
"He left home at noon, yeah"

96
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,200
"They have a casualty,"
no legs no papers

97
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,280
But that was before eleven
The Prague hospital

98
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,920
Shall I put the light off?

99
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,240
"No, thanks, I'm on duty"

100
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,200
It's his car

101
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,080
And his scarf

102
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,840
I'll leave it here
He might be cold when he's back

103
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,840
He can hardly be back
if he has no legs any more

104
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,240
"You'd better leave a sandwich for him, too"
He might be hungry when he's back

105
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
"Go on, it's very funny"

106
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,120
"Gladly,"

107
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,760
"Why don't we go to bed together,"
in a hotel?

108
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,440
And then you could call him
to tell him the number of our room

109
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,320
I... I didn't call him

110
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,960
You wanted to be through with me
and to go home

111
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,280
And to be left in peace

112
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,640
I didn't call him

113
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,000
He told me

114
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,320
"You didn't say who was calling,"
I admit

115
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,200
"Ewa,"

116
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,120
"I didn't call him, believe me"
I'm not.

117
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,840
Nothing to choose between all of you

118
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,640
"O.K., forget it"

119
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,680
"Take me to the Prague hospital, please"

120
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
The fellow with his legs cut off

121
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,720
"Ewa... There, there, Ewa..."

122
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,040
"No, let me have a look"

123
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
It isn't him

124
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,440
I'd like it to be him...

125
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,880
or you...

126
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,720
Many a time I imagined...

127
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,000
"both of you run over by a truck,"
the face squashed by the tires

128
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,160
I once saw you in my dream

129
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,560
Your neck was broken

130
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,240
I could see your tongue protruding

131
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,960
I just looked at you - and laughed

132
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,200
I wonder who's had a spite
against this one here

133
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
Who's going to be glad

134
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,360
It's the police

135
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,560
So what?

136
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,800
You're driving a stolen car
Did you call them?

137
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,840
Hold on

138
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,280
"Hey, Andrzej"
This is that stolen car

139
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,040
They're following us

140
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,240
Got any papers?

141
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,480
Yes

142
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Then you'd better slow down

143
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,080
Drive slowly

144
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,400
Get out of the car

145
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,800
Put your hands on the roof

146
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,720
"All right, this your car, Mister?"

147
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,400
This car's been reported stolen

148
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,280
We've only just found it
Abandoned in Wislostrada street

149
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,040
Had a drink?

150
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,920
I haven't had the time

151
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,000
"Like driving fast, eh?"

152
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,280
You're lucky
it's the Christmas Eve tonight

153
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,000
He was right
I was driving too fast

154
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,600
You could have wrecked the car
and killed me and yourself

155
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,400
Shall we have another try?

156
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
Do you want it?

157
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,640
Fasten the belts

158
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Got enough?

159
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,440
We were to go home

160
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,480
All right

161
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,120
Your car isn't here

162
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,120
Are you getting out?

163
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,560
He couldn't have left the car
before noon

164
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,360
Why?

165
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
It was snowing in the afternoon

166
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,880
But the car had no snow on it

167
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,200
"You know, I mean that snow cap"

168
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,000
It started snowing at five pm

169
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,400
"Well, I don't know"

170
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,200
I say...

171
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,520
What if he's at home?
We shouldn't go in together

172
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Wait here

173
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,120
"If he isn't there,"
I'll come out to the balcony

174
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,440
"If I don't come out in five minutes,"
drive home.

175
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,960
Ewa...

176
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,800
In case he's there

177
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,400
Good-bye

178
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,000
Emergency service

179
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,000
There's been an accident
A man has fainted

180
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,840
He's lying at the bus stop

181
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,800
"May I have the address, please?"

182
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,000
It's at the corner of Pulawsah and
"Walbrzyska streets, the city way"

183
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,080
Perhaps he's drunk?

184
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,760
"No, he's sober"
We have his papers

185
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,760
His name?

186
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,240
Edward Garus
Born in 1949...

187
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,320
"Your name, please?"

188
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,240
Anna Tatarkiewiez

189
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,600
He isn't there

190
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,920
"Like I told you, he isn't"

191
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,120
Why don't you take off your coat?

192
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,120
"I'd rather not, I'm freezing"

193
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,200
Want some tea?

194
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,840
Yeah

195
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,960
I didn't phone Edward that night
"three years ago, it's nonsense to say I did"

196
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,440
That was important to me

197
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,640
You were important

198
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,480
"If you really want to know,"
I loved you

199
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,400
And I wanted...

200
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,720
to change everything

201
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,880
"When we were getting dressed,"

202
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,840
and he was standing there
with his back to us...

203
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,920
You didn't even look at me once

204
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,600
I took you by the hand
But you tore yourself away

205
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,800
"Then he said,"
now that we're both dressed

206
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,120
"You can choose, you can stay or go"
And added he was going

207
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,920
And you followed him without a word

208
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,600
"Yes, it was like that?"

209
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,440
Yeah

210
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,080
Edward made still another condition

211
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,320
"I could follow him,"

212
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,200
if I would never meet you again

213
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,640
Yes...

214
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,960
And you said
I have no intention to see him

215
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,840
"And then I answered, all right"

216
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,600
That's how it happened?

217
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Give me your hand

218
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,920
The poor boy whom nobody loved
or understood

219
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,960
You're right

220
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,800
It was all my fault

221
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,440
"But you seem to have landed well,"
don't you?

222
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,760
"You're the same as before, aren't you?"

223
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,480
You went as it hammer and tongs
to straighten things

224
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,360
"You're a good husband and father,"
you provided well for your family

225
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,480
And you never forget
to collect the laundry

226
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,560
Let me go

227
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,120
I'll be glad to
your hands stink of petrol

228
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,760
Did you ever think what happened
after we left that hotel?

229
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,240
How I was feeling? What I felt
when we watched some love story on TV

230
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,160
...and he looked at me all the time
instead of the screen?

231
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,040
I never made love to him
since that night

232
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,640
What are you doing?

233
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Nothing special...

234
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,760
washing my hands

235
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,520
It's the Christmas Eve

236
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,400
I'm sorry

237
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,200
I lied to you

238
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,080
"I do sleep with him, quite normally"

239
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,720
The same to you
All the best

240
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,240
To us

241
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,320
It's him

242
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,720
At the wrong moment again

243
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,400
"Baby Jesus, sleep"

244
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,880
Sleep now

245
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,720
Mother is soothing

246
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,840
your cries...

247
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,600
How about the second verse?

248
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,800
This is all we know

249
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,080
Special night rates

250
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,280
"Thank you, merry Christmas"

251
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,120
Has he grown a beard?
"I mean, Edward?"

252
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,560
"No, not at all..."

253
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,280
We're breaking the wafer as if
here forgetting what we're really doing

254
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,880
Let's go

255
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,440
Where to?

256
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,520
The emergency service or
the rail way station

257
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,600
"Yes, the railway station"

258
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,520
"Just a second longer, O.K.?"

259
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Is this the emergency service?

260
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,080
Could you tell me if a Mr. Garus
has been brought to you?

261
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,840
Edward Garus

262
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,320
Born 1949...

263
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,760
"Ah, I see, and do you receive"
notifications from all over Warsaw?

264
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,360
A notification? Where was it?

265
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
And?

266
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,320
Thank you very much

267
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,480
"I phoned the emergency service,"
there's been a notification

268
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,640
A notification?

269
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,280
"Yes, somebody reported him lying, when the"
"ambulance arrived, he wasn't there anymore"

270
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,280
"He wasn't there, that's all"

271
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,120
They say it's usually like that
with drunks

272
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,160
They told me to check
at the sobering-up station

273
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,920
Where's my home?

274
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,880
Where is it?

275
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,920
"Let me see, Garus..."

276
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,720
A Jew?

277
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,960
No

278
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,480
"We had a Garus once, back in 1979"

279
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,920
He was a Jew

280
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,240
Do you have cards with particulars
of all your patients?

281
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,280
"Yes, perhaps he's one of those"
who's been brought in today

282
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,280
Better have a look at them

283
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,160
"Ah, they've gone to sleep"

284
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,240
Just look at them dancing

285
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,760
What about this one?

286
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,240
Or that one?

287
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,480
Stop it!

288
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,000
"Stop it, will you!"

289
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,760
Can't you see they're cold?

290
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,840
"You deserve to be pun in there, you bum?"

291
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,520
Stop!

292
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,480
Just try
"Come on, try it!"

293
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,920
"Let's dance, come on!"

294
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,760
It doesn't make any sense
to go on looking

295
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,040
I'm going home

296
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,760
Where shall I take you?

297
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,160
I wrecked you car

298
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,640
And ruined your Christmas Eve

299
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,600
"Not at all, it was very nice"

300
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,280
Come with me...

301
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,000
"to the railway station, please"

302
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,560
Are you on duty at the TV sets?

303
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,520
Yes

304
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,480
I keep falling asleep
That's why I'm skating

305
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,360
We're looking for...
Has there been an accident perhaps?

306
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,400
No

307
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,800
Do you remember a man
wearing a short sheep skin coat?

308
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,040
A jacket actually?

309
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,320
He comes here quite often
Never goes anywhere

310
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,680
Who's this man?

311
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,480
Edward

312
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,440
And the woman?

313
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,840
His wife

314
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,120
And these are his children

315
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,640
He's living in Crakow
For nearly three years now

316
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,280
For three years?

317
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,760
Nearly...

318
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,360
I lied a lot tonight

319
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,200
But why?

320
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,000
I don't know

321
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,440
Do you know a game?
You say to yourself

322
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,720
If the person who appears from behind
"the corner is a man, I'll be lucky"

323
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,280
"If it's woman,"
it means bad luck

324
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,240
I know it

325
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,880
I played that game tonight

326
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,880
I said to myself

327
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,560
If I manage to spend the whole night
"with you, till seven in the morning"

328
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,120
no matter how...

329
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,240
What then?

330
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,200
Then everything is going to be all right

331
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,880
What if you failed?

332
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,760
I've made preparations

333
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,320
I live alone

334
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,200
It's so very hard to be alone...

335
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,640
on a night like this

336
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,520
People just...

337
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,720
"Yeah, they lock themselves in,"
curtain the windows

338
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,640
Exactly

339
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,800
"Going to the midnight mass tonight,"

340
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,240
I saw a boy

341
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,680
He slipped away from the hospital

342
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,800
Still wearing his pajamas...

343
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,640
What happened to him?

344
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,600
They got him

345
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,200
I know...

346
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,840
it wasn't you who phoned that night

347
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,760
Be seeing you

348
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,200
"They're all asleep, aren't they?"

349
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,880
The car's been found

350
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,480
I know

351
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,960
I phoned during the night

352
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,080
Was it Ewa?

353
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,840
Yes

354
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,800
Are you going to spend the evening
away from home like before?

355
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,840
No

356
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,160
"No, I'm not"

357
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,560
I'll be here
