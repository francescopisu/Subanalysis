1
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,240
Good morning

2
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,200
Is this perhaps yours, sir?
Fell out of somebody's window

3
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,400
No!

4
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,040
Oh, sorry

5
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,760
Want anything from me?

6
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
Yes

7
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,720
What is it?

8
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,440
I live in the upper floor
I hope you remember me

9
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,800
Yes, you ran my dog
over two years ago

10
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,000
My name is Dorota Geller
My husband's a patient of yours

11
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,600
I don't remember all the names
about his health?

12
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,520
Yes

13
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,120
I inform the families on
Wednesdays, 3 to 5:00:00 PM

14
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
Come to the hospital

15
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,040
But Wednesday's only
the day after tomorrow...?

16
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,000
It's Monday today

17
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm sorry I didn't run you over
instead of your dog

18
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,120
Come on in, Barbara!

19
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,760
Good morning, Doctor?

20
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,600
There's something wrong, Barbara...

21
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,480
It doesn't bloom

22
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,360
Dorota? Are you there, Dorota?

23
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,480
Why don't you answer the phone?
The perhaps you're out...

24
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,560
This is Abka speaking...

25
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,040
I'm going away for a week
with the class...

26
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,160
I'll let you know when I'm back...
bye...

27
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,680
This is Janek Wierzbicki...
I must talk to you

28
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,440
Could I perhaps drop in tonight?

29
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,400
Well, what was it?

30
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
Not the cold, you know...

31
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,840
He's teething... He cried all night
Only went to sleep at dawn

32
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,960
I spent the night at his bed

33
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
She didn't sleep, either

34
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
She was worried about the
two of us getting no sleep

35
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,040
Father came into the room
in the morning

36
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,280
All dressed, he was, and laughing

37
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,880
He opened his mouth and showed
us a hole where a tooth had been

38
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,760
He extract that tooth himself

39
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,360
Well, I told him the little one
had just cut his first tooth

40
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,320
And he just laughed and said
True enough

41
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeah, That's how it is, Barbara

42
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
I tie my scarf
The kid's sleeping peacefully

43
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,520
I can see the man
through a half-open door

44
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,000
Father hold his granddaughter
on his knees

45
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,080
She's laughing and trying his tooth

46
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,360
And then that lady comes
to meet me in the hall

47
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,480
Her eyes are black ringed
for lack of sleep

48
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,880
She says, I don't like it...
Too many teeth here...

49
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,280
I answer, Go get some sleep,

50
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,400
father's staying home today
She nods and says, O.K.

51
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,560
Well, the next episode coming to
you next week

52
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Excuse me, Madam

53
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes?

54
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,360
A hare fell out of somebody's window...
The caretaker was asking...

55
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,240
Was it perhaps yours?

56
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,840
No

57
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,640
I can see you this afternoon
if it's really urgent...

58
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,920
Mrs. Geller?

59
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,360
Money order
Your husband's sick benefit

60
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,000
May I see your
identification card, please?

61
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,720
I only have a passport

62
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,720
That will do

63
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,280
Do you know the time?

64
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,520
It's past ten...

65
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,720
Thank you

66
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,680
Which room is Mr. Geller in?

67
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,320
Geller... The one we've
operated on? Room12

68
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,720
I'd like to see his records

69
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,640
Yes, sir

70
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,240
Just leave it here...

71
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
Perhaps he'll feel like
eating it later

72
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,800
Has he had anything today?

73
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,680
Not much

74
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,680
Good-bye

75
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,240
May I help you?

76
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,760
I have an appointment
with the ward head

77
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,000
No families received today

78
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,640
But he told me to come
My name's Geller

79
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,440
A lady to see you, Doctor
Mrs. Geller

80
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,720
Is it afternoon already?

81
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,720
Ten past twelve

82
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,560
The doctor will see you

83
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,960
Sit down, please

84
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,080
Can I smoke?

85
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,720
I don't smoke, but if you have to...

86
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,480
The diagnosis, the treatment,
the operation ther belated, all of that

87
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,360
What do you mean?

88
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,560
Thing ae in a bad way

89
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,320
Will he live?

90
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
I don't know

91
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,040
But I've got to know
You've got to know it, too

92
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,320
No, the only thing I've got to do
is treat your husband as best I can

93
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,200
And I know just one thing;
that I don't know

94
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,440
Give me the district clinic, please

95
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,480
Yes, the district clinic

96
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,200
Shall I give you a lift?

97
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,000
No, thank you
I always walk

98
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,320
Your soup's in the fridge, I repotted
your cactus, please don't touch it

99
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,640
I checked on the ads

100
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,320
Will tell you about them when
I come on Wednesday, Barbara

101
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,200
Just a moment

102
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm coming

103
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,520
I took the other staircase

104
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,520
Smoke if you like

105
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,160
How do you cope with bathing?

106
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,840
I warm potfuls of
water on the stove

107
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,360
Look here, Madam...
I really don't know

108
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,440
You see... I...

109
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,000
We're very happy together,
my husband and I...

110
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,880
I love him very much

111
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,720
I saw you together several times

112
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,560
You seemed happy

113
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,800
Madam...

114
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,160
Please try to understand me...

115
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,040
We know nothing about causes...
very little about effects...

116
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,720
and next to nothing
about prognosis

117
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,720
They tell patients the
truth in America

118
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,760
So they do

119
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,680
They usually prove right...
It's different with optimistic forecasts

120
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,160
I don't care, I can stand
a pessimistic prognosis

121
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,400
Please tell me: Is he going to die?
I have to know

122
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,760
I want to do everything
I can for him

123
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,080
There's nothing you can do
Just wait

124
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,040
If you let me talk
just a minute longer,

125
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,200
I'll tell you about my problem

126
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,160
Go on

127
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,600
You see, I couldn't get
pregnant before I'm pregnant now

128
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,640
three months ago. The father is
another man, not my husband

129
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,320
I know I won't ever have children again
if I have an abortion now, I know it

130
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,040
But if my husband is to live,
I can't have that baby

131
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,600
The man I've told you about
is avery close friend

132
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,480
I don't know what to do...

133
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,080
Do you understand?

134
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,200
Do you know it's possible...

135
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,560
to love two men at once?

136
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,000
It is...

137
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,720
Do you understand?

138
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,760
He has little chance to get better,
about several percent

139
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,320
The odds that he's
going to live,

140
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,240
that is just to vegetate,
are fifteen percent

141
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,320
That's what you can find
in scitific books

142
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,680
But I've seen too
many people in my life

143
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,320
who ought to have
died but lived on

144
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
...and too many others
who died for no reason,

145
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,120
I can't pass the sentence

146
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,680
You see, one of them...

147
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,880
that is, my husband - made
me feel safe and comfortable

148
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
The other one...

149
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,800
Ah, well...

150
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,360
it's wrong to want too much

151
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,200
It's conceit

152
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,040
Do you believe in God?

153
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,120
I have a God that's enough
for myself only, I guess...

154
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,680
Your private one?

155
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,480
Yes...

156
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Then ask your God for absolution

157
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,920
Janek!

158
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,200
I phoned, didn't you listen to
the recordings?

159
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,280
Yes, yes, I did
What's the matter?

160
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
We're going away

161
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,920
When?

162
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,000
In a week's time... To Delhi

163
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,760
And then we're going on to
the first camp, with the Sherpas

164
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,840
What have you brought with you?

165
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,440
Andrzej's rucksack
Why should somebody else bury it...

166
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,480
Isn't it a bit too early
for the funeral?

167
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,200
We'll miss him
...up there in the mountains

168
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,080
Take it

169
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Take it away

170
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,800
He's still member of the club,
isn't he?

171
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,400
Then let it stay there, damn it!

172
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,400
At least until he dies...

173
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,360
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

174
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,120
I know

175
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,760
My poor girl...

176
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,480
No, no
Not any more

177
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,560
This is 31-23-67...

178
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Please leave a brief message
after the electronic signal

179
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,040
Hello, Dorota - it's me
It's afternoon here

180
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,920
I know it's already dark back home

181
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,240
I've just returned from a rehearsal

182
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,200
Lots of friends,
but I don't feel good here

183
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,640
I can't wait to see you

184
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,520
I'll phone again tomorrow evening
Tomorrow night, to you

185
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,680
I'd like to tell you
one more thing,

186
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,000
but perhaps the recording
will soon end

187
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,400
Everything's fine, wonderful

188
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,240
All right, you can get dressed

189
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,560
I must get rid of it, Doctor

190
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,400
Everything goes so well?

191
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,920
All right, if you insist
It's the last moment to do it

192
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,800
Have you ever been my patient?

193
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,960
No, this is my first visit

194
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,440
Let me see...

195
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
the day after tomorrow...
one o'clock

196
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,240
Your name, please?

197
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,320
Dorota Geller

198
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Dorota... A pretty name...

199
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,320
It's you, isn't it?

200
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,480
Yes

201
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,880
When have you arrived?

202
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,120
Yesterday night

203
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,880
He wanted me to
tell you about himself

204
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,680
Please do

205
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,640
Well, he rehearses a lot
Had one concert already

206
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,680
He thought you'd be there

207
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,240
Can't get through to you...

208
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,520
Said to tell you
he'd try again tonight

209
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,400
I know...

210
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,400
Well, that's about all

211
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,560
Have you got the key to his flat?

212
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,240
He wants you to
take the scores with you

213
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,960
when you're going to join him

214
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,520
They're on the piano,
several sheets in a green cover

215
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,400
All right

216
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,680
Ah, that's your coffee...

217
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,640
It's cold already

218
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,400
Yes, it is

219
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,600
This is the previous segment...

220
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,360
And the one before that...

221
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,080
Just look at them

222
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,680
This one's a month old

223
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,440
and this one - just two weeks

224
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,080
And this is the latest one

225
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,480
You've always taught us, sir...

226
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,960
Forget it, what do you think?

227
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,320
Progression...

228
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,000
Answer it, Dorota

229
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,640
You're there, aren't you?

230
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,040
You are! Can you hear me?

231
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,240
Dorota?

232
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,080
Yes

233
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,480
At least! Good morning,
or is it good evening?

234
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,760
Good morning, I guess

235
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,280
Good morning, then I tried to get
hold of you the last few days

236
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,120
I know, I'm sorry
I was out

237
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,840
Have you got the passport?

238
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,560
Yes, but it doesn't matter anymore

239
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,440
Why?

240
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,320
How's Andrzej?

241
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,280
Pretty bad...

242
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,400
But why doesn't it matter?
What you said about the passport?

243
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,760
I'm going to have an
abortion, tomorrow

244
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,880
I don't get you

245
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,840
I'm having an abortion tomorrow

246
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,360
Do you understand?

247
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,240
Yes, I do

248
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,480
If you do it and
Andrzej dies, Dorota...

249
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
you will never want me again

250
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,960
I know

251
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
You'll pay a fortune for this call...

252
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,720
Yes, we won't be together
Do you understand?

253
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,240
Yes

254
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,080
I want to be with you, Remember
I want it very much

255
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,880
You'll have to ask somebody else
to bring you the score

256
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,000
Dorota...

257
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,320
I love you

258
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,600
Just a short story today, Barbara

259
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,920
I went to work, to the hospital

260
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,760
A man came to see me and said...

261
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,120
We had to make a
transfer to England, that night

262
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,520
I phoned home

263
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,320
Father answered it and said she was
asleep, he had to speak softly

264
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,240
I asked about the kids

265
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,240
They're fine, he said, the girl laughed
so much she wetted her panties

266
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,200
And the boy woke up ever so hungry

267
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,160
I fed him... And then I couldn't
hear him anymore

268
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,880
just ga-ga-ga... He must have put
the receiver right up to the kid's mouth

269
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,320
That was at eleven o'clock

270
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,920
Soon after twelve, I obtained
a release and went home

271
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,880
But there wasn't any home

272
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,200
Yes, it was then

273
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,600
it was...

274
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,920
Where our house use to stand,
there was just a hole in the ground

275
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,160
It was on that day
A few minutes past twelve

276
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,960
The boss said it was
only exceptionally

277
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,880
Yes

278
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,400
Andrzej?

279
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,920
Can you hear me, Andrzej?

280
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,760
I love you...

281
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,360
so much

282
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,840
Andrzej...

283
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,960
Will you please
excuse me, gentleman

284
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,360
We'd like to talk in private

285
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,480
No, please stay
It won't take long

286
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,000
You didn't want to pass a sentence
in my husband's case

287
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,240
But I don't wan you to
have a clean conscience

288
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,400
I'm having an abortion in an hour

289
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,800
Go out!

290
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,920
Didn't I tell you?
Please don't do it

291
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,360
What do you mean?

292
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,720
Don't do it

293
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,160
Why not?

294
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,760
He's going to die

295
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,880
How do you know?

296
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,080
Metastasis proceeds quicker and
is more dangerous than before

297
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,680
He hasn't the ghost of a chance

298
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,280
Can you swear?

299
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,080
I swear

300
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,560
And, Madam...

301
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,480
You play with the philharmonic,
don't you?

302
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,280
Yes

303
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,280
I'd like to listen to
your performance

304
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,680
Yes, please
Come on in

305
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,120
I'm sorry...
You've been sleeping

306
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,000
No, just dozing

307
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,720
Please sit down

308
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,840
I'd like to thank you

309
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,600
There's nothing to thank me for

310
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,920
Nothing really...

311
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,800
We've only just learned
once again that

312
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,840
it's not the X-ray pictures
that we're treating

313
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,520
I'm coming back...

314
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,520
from the other side

315
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,360
Yes...

316
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,920
You know, the world...

317
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,960
seemed to me
to be disintegrating,

318
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,040
Everything grew uglier,
more hideous

319
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,560
Everything grew uglier,
more hideous

320
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,440
As if somebody did it on purpose

321
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,720
So that I wouldn't be sorry

322
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,200
But now...

323
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,600
I could know

324
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,760
I can touch the table

325
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,240
And what's more... you know...

326
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,480
We're going to have a baby

327
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,960
I'm glad to hear it

328
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,320
Do you know what it means,

329
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,800
to have a baby?

330
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,280
Yes, I do
