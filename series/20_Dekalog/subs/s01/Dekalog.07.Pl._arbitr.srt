1
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,640
Excuse me

2
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes?

3
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,920
I'd like to return my book
of registration

4
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,560
Aren't you going to appeal?
This is your last year

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,760
"No, expelled is expelled"

6
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Ten pages are missing

7
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,840
"I tore them out, they concerned the"
exams during the last two semesters

8
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,040
What country are you going to?

9
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,680
Canada

10
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,880
To your family?

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
"No, acquaintances"

12
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,560
This is your passport

13
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,280
But if you want to take the child with
"you, you'll need the mother's consent"

14
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,360
"I know, I just wanted to check"
whether the passport's ready

15
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,400
It is

16
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,240
I think I'd better collect my own passport
and provide that consent the next time

17
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,360
You'll get the passport
straight away then

18
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,240
Ania!

19
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,920
Ania! Ania!

20
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,080
Go away

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,160
Ania dear...
Get out of here

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,520
Mother...

23
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,760
You don't know how to hush her
Get out!

24
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,360
"Ania baby, it's all right, Ania"

25
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,200
What happened?
Dreamt of wolves?

26
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,320
Hasn't Mummy told you
there aren't any wolves?

27
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,000
Ania... There aren't
"It's all right now, isn't it?"

28
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,800
It's all right
"Now you're going to sleep, O.K.?"

29
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
My dearest little one

30
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,320
Dad...

31
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,360
I can't stand it

32
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,840
"There, there, Majka"

33
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,680
"You used to cry like this, too,"
when you were a baby

34
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,480
But why does she tell her
about wolves?

35
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,440
I believe you're to be up early

36
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,920
"There, there..."

37
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,240
Listen

38
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,960
Ania

39
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,720
Ania

40
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,840
"You're free, Princess"

41
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,680
How did that magic spell go?
"Do you remember, children?"

42
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,400
Abrakadabra...

43
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,880
May the cave open!

44
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,440
You're all invited to the wedding
party!

45
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,560
"Are we hiding, Majka?"

46
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
"No, we're running away"

47
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,880
Shall we play a trick on Mummy?

48
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,680
I have no coat

49
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,640
I've brought it with me

50
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,320
Madam? A child's disappeared

51
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,760
My daughter...

52
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,520
"Christ, don't you understand?"
My child's gone...

53
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,880
Ania

54
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,640
Shall we have a ride?

55
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
On what?

56
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,840
Look

57
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,720
Have you kidnapped me?

58
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,080
What?

59
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,400
You've kidnapped me
Like in that book

60
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,800
"You're a big girl now, aren't you?"

61
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,800
Mummy says I am

62
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,080
Exactly

63
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,360
Now look at me...

64
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,000
"You see,"

65
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,200
Mummy isn't your mother

66
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,760
And I have no mother at all?

67
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,640
"Oh yes, you have"

68
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,240
Your real mother

69
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,360
"You see, I am your mother"

70
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,840
"Yes, we have"

71
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,120
"Even two... Yes, two tents"
and two mattresses

72
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,720
Majka went to the Bleszczady Mountain
An excursion from the University

73
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,000
"Phone next week, O.K.? I believe"
someone's just entered the flat

74
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,720
Ania? Ania...

75
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,120
Ewa? Ewa...

76
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,160
You...

77
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,680
It's Ania...

78
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,720
She disappeared

79
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,800
What is it?

80
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,800
"I must go to the toilet, Majka"

81
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,960
"All right, go"
I'll be on the look out

82
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,360
Is it her?

83
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,920
"Yes, she's rather excited"
That's why she has to pee

84
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
What do you want?

85
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,840
May we come in?

86
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,440
What do you want?

87
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,720
I took her with me and
ran away from home

88
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,160
"You ran away, and?"

89
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,120
Hi

90
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
Hi

91
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,280
A lot has changed

92
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,360
So it has
We haven't seen each other for

93
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,040
"Father died, three years ago"

94
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,720
And you?

95
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,520
""Teddy bear maker""

96
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,320
I made teddy bears

97
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,000
What happened to your former plans?
"The University, the things you wrote?"

98
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,320
I gave it up

99
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,400
What about this?

100
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,360
What anything to eat?
Or maybe some tea?

101
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,400
She's asleep

102
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,680
Perhaps I'd better take her to bed?

103
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,160
"No, she's happy"
Just look at her

104
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,880
Do you still remember me?

105
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,040
No

106
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,600
I paid a lot for it
But it's all right now

107
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,360
Do they know?

108
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,120
No

109
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,160
I picked her up at the theatre

110
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,280
Mother was running about like crazy
Stumbled against a step

111
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,200
Nearly fell down the stairs

112
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,680
Why are you speaking of her like this?

113
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,840
You should be glad to hear it?

114
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,880
It started some time ago
I think I hate her

115
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,440
"You haven't changed, or maybe"
there are just the two extreme

116
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,200
Just the two

117
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,320
"For today, the situation is that I took"
"Ania with me, I won't give her back"

118
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,800
I first thought about it some
three or four years ago

119
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,560
I'm not a good girl in a drak-blue
skirt anymore

120
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,640
The girl who fell in love with her
Polish teacher...

121
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,840
just because what he said
was different

122
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,880
You still have lots of chances

123
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,640
You haven't stolen anything
or killed anybody

124
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,080
Is it possible to steal
your own property?

125
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,360
I don't know

126
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
I guess not

127
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,320
This means I haven't stolen anything

128
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,760
That's a fact

129
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
"Yeah, and as for killing"

130
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,880
"Yes, I think I could kill her"

131
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
It isn't much that you know
about your mother

132
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
I've only just learned quite recently

133
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,320
What?

134
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,360
Why she's like that

135
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
"After I was born,"

136
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,760
she could have no more children
This means it was because of me in a way

137
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,000
But she always wanted children
I know that

138
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,400
"And then, when Ania was born"
"You see, this does explain a thing or two"

139
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,640
"There was another person, too"
"who agreed to that arrangement, you"

140
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,640
I was only sixteen then

141
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,000
Jeanne d'Arc hadn't been much older

142
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,560
You said that before

143
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,200
They said they meant well
I should finish school and so on

144
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,480
It's only now that I know they were
really after the baby

145
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,480
"And there was that scandal at school, too"
"She was the headmistress,"

146
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,320
"I was a young teacher, and you went"
to that same school

147
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,280
But you mattered most

148
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,320
The moment you ought to have said you wanted
"that baby to be ours, you said nothing"

149
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,320
I couldn't

150
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,800
You couldn't?

151
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,920
"You were involved, too"

152
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,240
"Mother said, "If you don't want"
"trouble for seducing a minor,"

153
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,640
if you want still to be a teacher

154
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,480
"...keep quiet"
Am I right?

155
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,080
Is that what she told you?

156
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,720
I overheard her say that to Father
"It's just like her, you knew she'd do it"

157
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,720
She said it to your father?

158
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,080
Yes

159
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,600
Was she lying?

160
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
To be frank...

161
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,440
I never though this could be arranged
like that in Poland:

162
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,280
That your own child is officially
registered as somebody else's...

163
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
Of course it can be arranged

164
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,600
All it takes is a doctor you know
He did not know what he was doing

165
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
I usually take a nap in the afternoon
An hour or so

166
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,440
"O.K., take it"

167
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,040
There's no reason why you should
change your routine

168
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,680
Now I think it's good she agreed then

169
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,720
"This way, I have my peace"

170
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,960
Yes

171
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,720
And I won't trouble you too long

172
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
Are you going away?

173
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,040
"Yes, I'm making an excursion"
"to Romania, in summer"

174
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,040
"Let me see your passport, it's a long"
since I've seen such a document

175
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,600
Here

176
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,560
What's this?

177
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,960
A certificate stating that I gave
birth to a baby six years ago

178
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,800
What about your mother?
Is she willing to give you the girl back?

179
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,920
Mother?

180
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,920
"Yes, mother"

181
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,640
She'll have to

182
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,320
You'd never believe it

183
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,600
I never knew she could be so tender
and loving

184
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,320
She never gave that to me

185
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,960
Let me tell you something

186
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,800
Something that I should never tell
to anybody

187
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,440
When Ania was still a baby
"about six months old, she was..."

188
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,800
I returned from a holiday camp

189
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,600
...somewhat earlier than planned
They always send me to such camps then

190
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,200
"Well, I came back..."

191
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,840
I saw Mother feeding Ania

192
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,920
"So what? It's normal, isn't it?"

193
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,600
"No, she was breast-feeding"

194
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,960
Why...

195
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,960
She had no

196
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,720
"But she gave suck to Ania,"
and Ania sucked

197
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,120
She won't let you go now

198
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,400
What happened?

199
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
"Nothing, I just cut my finger"

200
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,760
It won't hurt anymore

201
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,320
"Go to sleep no, Ania"
"Sleep, my baby..."

202
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,120
I'm going out
Take care of Ania

203
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,360
What do you want to do?

204
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,720
Annoy Mum just a little
I'm going to the telephone booth

205
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,680
"No, wait"

206
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,400
"Here, use this"

207
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,520
"Oh no, not from your place"
They certainly notified the police

208
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,960
Your phone might be tapped
I'll phone from the booth

209
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,800
Want me to go with you?
The booth is at the station

210
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,920
Are you going to leave Ania
all along?

211
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,360
Want me to read you a story?

212
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,640
About...

213
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,640
your mother and

214
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,360
...your grandmother

215
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,240
"The Italian film"

216
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,960
...mother and daughter

217
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,480
...some scenes that

218
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,280
...I can touch

219
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,920
...around me

220
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,800
Hush...

221
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,440
Got the bears?

222
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,480
Yes

223
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,160
Who's this?

224
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,760
My daughter

225
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,120
Don't come here a day or two
I might be in trouble

226
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,160
Because of her?

227
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,400
Dad?

228
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,160
I have her with me

229
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,760
What are you planning to do?

230
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,880
Let me speak to Mother

231
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,760
Tell me

232
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,000
"You can't help me, Dad"

233
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,280
Mother cried all the time

234
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,680
She's taken a pill or something
and I believe she's asleep now

235
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,800
Who is it?

236
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,120
I have her with me

237
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,160
"Oh God, she's with you..."

238
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,200
Have you notified the police?

239
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,240
"Yes, but it doesn't matter"
Where are you?

240
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,600
"Call it off, tell them you"
"found her, that's for one thing"

241
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,640
Of course I will
Where are you?

242
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,400
We're coming to you

243
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,640
Stefan

244
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,560
"Well, where are you?"
We'll be there in no time

245
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,720
"We're somewhere, I won't tell you where"
You've got to change everything

246
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,040
What?

247
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,720
What do you want me to change?

248
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,880
Everything
Ania's got to be mine

249
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,520
She can't

250
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,200
She has to

251
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,440
But nobody knows anything

252
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,960
So what? I'll tell them all
I can prove it

253
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,040
You can prove nothing

254
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,280
"Ania's mine, she's registered"
as my daughter

255
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,680
Only Jadwiga know you're actually
"Ania's mother, but Jadwiga won't tell"

256
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,680
Where are you?

257
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,240
"Father know, too"

258
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,720
"Father know nothing, nothing at all"

259
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,040
And Wojtek

260
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,800
Don't count on Wojtek
I'll tell you about it when I'm retired

261
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,080
Now listen to me
You stole my baby

262
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,880
You stole my baby and
my motherhood...

263
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,880
My love... You stole myself

264
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,240
Everything...

265
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,960
You have two hours time to decide what
"to do, then I'll tell you what I want"

266
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,480
Where's Majka?

267
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,400
She had to go out
She'll be back soon

268
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,120
What woke you up?

269
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,000
I often wake up like this

270
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,200
Majka says I have no mother

271
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,600
You must have got her wrong
Of course you have a mother

272
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,800
And a father?

273
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
"You have the father, too"

274
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,320
Majka says you are my...

275
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,600
Aren't you sleepy anymore?

276
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,880
Want me to show you how
Teddy bears are made?

277
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,800
Yes

278
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,920
"I say, did you know she was"
going to kidnap Ania?

279
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,040
No

280
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,120
I haven't got any spot

281
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,960
"Oh, but you have... here"

282
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,600
And here...

283
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
"Ah, that's right... Great"

284
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,400
Are you a wizard?

285
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,320
Yes

286
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,080
No

287
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,160
Yes

288
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,240
I once was a wizard

289
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,760
"A great one, and"
very very wicked

290
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,080
Wicked?

291
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,560
Know any more tricks?

292
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,560
Sure

293
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,680
Show me

294
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,800
Why are you up?

295
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,600
She woke up

296
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,440
Majka...

297
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,760
He says he's a wizard

298
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,760
You were to call me Mummy

299
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,560
"Say Mummy, please"

300
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,640
"No, Mummy"

301
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,960
"Please, Ania"

302
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,640
"Say Mummy, Mummy"

303
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,560
Do you hear?

304
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,560
Please call you mummy Mummy

305
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,720
Please

306
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,200
Please call me Mummy

307
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,520
Do you hear?

308
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,080
Who?

309
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,080
"Ah yes, now I know"

310
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,400
It's all right... No

311
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,800
I have no idea
I haven't seen her six years long

312
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,480
All right

313
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,160
They're looking for you

314
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,120
I know

315
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,320
He know nothing
He was asleep

316
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,560
We woke quite a lot of people up

317
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,800
They won't kill them

318
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,240
We know nothing
about our own child

319
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,520
"About her friends,"
where she might be now

320
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,480
We lost her

321
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,920
I never thought she
might do this to Ania

322
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,880
She loves Ania

323
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
You've got to give her back

324
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,640
I can't

325
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,880
Majka was always your little daughter

326
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,320
Ania was mine

327
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,720
Majka couldn't have been
your little daughter

328
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,360
You always exacted too much of her
You wanted she can't cope with it

329
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,320
She knew she had to become
worthy of your love

330
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,440
And that day when you saw her
in the bathroom

331
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,760
With the traces of bandage across
"her belly, she was six months gone then"

332
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,120
You started streaming

333
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,400
I knew that was the end

334
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,480
She didn't say anything

335
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,160
Now don't tell me the history
"of our family, I know it"

336
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,560
But you think Majka doesn't
She does all right

337
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,200
"I say, Stefan"

338
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,800
She wants to take Ania away forever

339
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,120
To take her far away...

340
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,800
"If you know what I mean,"
"Far, far away..."

341
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,560
Once and for all

342
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,520
Where to?

343
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
Canada

344
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
She got an invitation

345
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,760
A fictitious one

346
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,680
I thought perhaps it was all
"for the better, let her go..."

347
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,560
Let us stay here
with the little one

348
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,600
Let her go and never come back

349
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,320
But she's thought it all out
They're both going

350
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,360
Do you hear?

351
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,760
We'll lose both of them

352
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,920
We've got to find them

353
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,920
Go some place!

354
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,160
Where to?

355
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,400
You used to have such
a lot of friends

356
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,400
"Yeah, I don't have them anymore"

357
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,760
Grzegorz

358
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,240
Phone Grzegorz...
"I beg you, Stefan"

359
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,320
"Wake up, Ania"

360
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,120
It's all right

361
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,920
It's all right now
Can you sleep?

362
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,720
It's all right

363
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
"All right, now"

364
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,480
She screams nearly every night
It's been going like this for years

365
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,760
"She dreams of something, but she's"
never told us about her dream

366
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,520
I wonder that she might be afraid of

367
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,600
Of the future

368
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,200
If you're planning to take her away...

369
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,160
Where to?

370
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,400
Anywhere... Far away...

371
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,920
"Well, she won't stand it:"

372
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,800
"Your shouting at her, knocking her"
"about, your hysterics"

373
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,920
She's too sensitive

374
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
You seem to have taken scare?

375
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,040
"No, you can stay here"
as long as you like

376
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,080
No

377
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,040
No?

378
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,040
You're going to ruin your own child

379
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,960
"She's your child, too"

380
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,880
You should go back home

381
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,480
I see

382
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,920
She needs a normal home

383
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,720
"Her own toys, her bed, milk"
at supper... don't you see?

384
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,280
"Yes, I see..."

385
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,600
What do you see?

386
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,560
That she needs a home

387
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,920
You're right

388
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,880
A fellow I know has a car
He delivers the Teddy bears

389
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,520
You'll be back in Warsaw
before it dawns

390
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,640
"All right, go get him"

391
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,440
But you can live here
I'll move away

392
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,280
"No, you're right"
Go get that car

393
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,960
"Wake up, Ania"
We're going away

394
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,000
"Get up, and put our clothes on"

395
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,120
Where's Wojtek?

396
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,720
Wojtek doesn't want us

397
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,560
But he said to give you
this Teddy bear

398
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,040
Have I woken you up?

399
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,200
I'm sorry
It doesn't make any sense

400
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,080
"But it's Ewa, you know her"

401
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,920
She kissed my hand to make me
come to you

402
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,840
Yes?

403
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm afraid
All of this is...

404
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,960
There isn't much I can do

405
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,600
I might try and announce it

406
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,480
...on TV tomorrow

407
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,800
And if she hasn't collected her
"passport yet, we could stop it"

408
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,240
I'm really sorry

409
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,840
I hope I haven't roused the kids?

410
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,640
"No, they're asleep"

411
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,160
I feared this might happen
She's away

412
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,560
What shall we do?

413
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,000
"Well, two hours have passed"

414
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,360
"Yes, two and a half actually"

415
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,000
Now listen to me

416
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,120
You're bringing Ania back
Father will sell the car and his organ

417
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,760
You'll buy a flat for yourself

418
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,920
You'll see Ania whenever
you'll like...

419
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,960
"You'll take her with you on all Sundays,"
to the cinema or no matter where

420
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,640
Ania will be mine and yours

421
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,560
"After my death,"
she'll be yours only

422
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,440
Want anything else?

423
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,240
"Yes, your authenticated consent to"
Ania's going abroad... to Canada

424
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,560
I need it for tomorrow

425
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,920
Do you understand?

426
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,640
Majka...

427
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,400
Please... I can't

428
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,280
"In that case,"
you won't ever see us again

429
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,960
Ania's asleep in my arms now

430
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,560
And I don't care

431
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,640
This night I understood...

432
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,760
I only have her and nobody else
in the world

433
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,360
"I'm counting five, if you don't say yes"
"you can say good-bye to us, forever"

434
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,560
"one, two..."

435
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,320
"three, four, five..."

436
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,720
"Majka, I agree!"

437
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,160
Yes!

438
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,360
I agree! Majka?
"Come back, Majka"

439
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,960
"It's me, Wojtek"

440
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,920
Who?

441
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,880
Wojtek

442
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,640
Yes

443
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,600
You lied to us before

444
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,440
"Yes, I did"

445
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,240
Is she there?

446
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:50,720
She was

447
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,920
She ran away taking the girl with her

448
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,120
Where is she?

449
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,680
She said she didn't care anymore

450
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,800
She couldn't have gone too far
I'll start looking for her...

451
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,200
To the left of the track
You check it to the right

452
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,520
Near your place?

453
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,240
"Yes, the neighborhood of Josefow"

454
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,560
Want to pretend the sticks are boats?

455
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,760
Yes

456
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,320
"Kiss me, Ania"

457
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:48,960
Give me a hearty kiss

458
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,840
Do you love me?

459
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,680
Yes...

460
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:45,840
Nothing?

461
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,880
Nothing

462
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,320
I'm afraid...

463
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,720
We did it all wrong

464
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,320
Let's check the railway stations

465
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,960
It's too early for the first train
Today is Sunday

466
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,800
"Our family brings you bad luck,"
Wojtek dear

467
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,880
I'll drive that forest road
to Otwock...

468
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,320
Go now

469
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,760
When does the train leave?

470
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,760
Where to?

471
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,880
Anywhere

472
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,800
In two hours
It's Sunday

473
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,000
A husband?

474
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,720
"You've run away from your husband,"
eh?

475
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
From everything

476
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,800
Come on in

477
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,440
"It's warm inside, I've got a blanket"
You can get some sleep

478
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,160
Have you seen a girl with a child?
Have you?

479
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,640
"A young girl, wears glasses..."

480
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,320
Had a big bag on her shoulder

481
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,200
And the child is a girl of six

482
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,440
"Yes, she was here"
But she went away some two hours ago

483
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,400
Where did she go?

484
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,160
"No idea, she asked about the road"
I don't know

485
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,280
Ania...

486
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,640
Mummy!

487
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,320
Ania baby...
My dear little girl

488
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,280
"My darling, my baby..."

489
00:51:59,160 --> 00:51:59,960
Majka!

490
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,600
Majka baby!
