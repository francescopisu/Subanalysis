1
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:21,760
Roman

2
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,360
What do you want to know?

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,360
The truth

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,960
Are you sure?

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
Yes, that's why I've come to you

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,040
How many women have you had
in your life?

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,000
You know, women, girls or
whatever you call them

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,000
Eight... nine...
I don't know, maybe fifteen

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,160
That's enough

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,200
I've been married for ten years now
And frankly...

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,520
That's enough, too

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,640
Are you sure I don't ever be able to
make love to any woman?

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,120
I'm afraid you won't, the findings are
typical, and so are the symptoms

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
What's your wife like?

15
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
She's wonderful

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,680
Take a divorce

17
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,800
Romek

18
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,440
I heard your car

19
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,440
Come on

20
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,000
You didn't want to meet you,
did you?

21
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
I did

22
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Your suit is dripping wet

23
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,960
Don't you want to know
why I went to Krakow?

24
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,480
Why, you have friends there

25
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,320
Just one

26
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,840
Why don't you tell me about Zagreb?

27
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,200
I delivered several lectures
I assisted during several operations

28
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,360
On three occasions, I operated myself
I got paid and by the tim

29
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,680
I was leaving, the money I got was only
worth a half of its original value

30
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,480
Are you tired?

31
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,840
No

32
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
I say, Hanka darling...

33
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,800
Mhm... Not now, please

34
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,560
Tell me everything

35
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,640
I'm not afraid anymore

36
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,320
I went to Krakow to meet Mikolaj

37
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,160
He's a friend of mine
I told you about him once, didn't I?

38
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,920
That son of a bitch, I remember

39
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,400
Well, he examined me and
had all the analyses made

40
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,480
He was quite frank

41
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,080
I haven't any chances
Today, tomorrow...

42
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Or ever...

43
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
I don't believe it

44
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
These are facts

45
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,800
Do you love me?

46
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,280
Well, do you or not?

47
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,400
You're afraid to say you do
although you do love me after all

48
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,480
Love is not just panting in bed
for five minutes once a week

49
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,520
It is that, too

50
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,240
It's just biology

51
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,000
True love is situated in one's heart
and not between the legs

52
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,120
What matters to me is what we have
and not what we haven't

53
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,160
You're young and...

54
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,400
I can manage

55
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,560
You'll have to find yourself a lover

56
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,800
That is, if you haven't found one yet

57
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,480
I haven't

58
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,240
Some things are better left unsaid

59
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,360
Oh no

60
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,640
All right, so you've been frank with me
You won't ever be able to make love to me

61
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,520
At least that's what the doctors say
I'm telling you this

62
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,720
I want to be with you anyway

63
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,120
I love you

64
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,120
May I cuddle up to you?

65
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,840
Yes

66
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
Tightly, O.K.?

67
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,680
You asleep, Hanka?

68
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,960
No

69
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,440
We've never wanted a baby

70
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,760
No

71
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,560
It would perhaps be easier now
if there was one

72
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Perhaps

73
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,880
Can I help?

74
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,320
If you're so kind...
Just hold the funnel, will you?

75
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,160
May I join, Doctor?

76
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,160
Make a decision

77
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,640
It's not very good for you

78
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,680
But not fatal

79
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,840
The ward head told me he found it rather
difficult to come to terms with you

80
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,800
Really? But it's perfectly simple

81
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
You see, Doctor

82
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,040
I have a voice

83
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,160
How's that?

84
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,240
A singing voice

85
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,840
My mother is a hard-working woman
She wants me to be somebody

86
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,680
I wasn't admitted to the school
of music because of my heart

87
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,920
I shouldn't sing, my heart's too weak,
but Mother wants me to become a singer

88
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,760
What's your specialty?

89
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
Bach and Mahler
Do you know Mahler?

90
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,720
And... van den Budemayer?

91
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,480
No, I don't know that one

92
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,400
His works are... well, difficult
But I can sing them

93
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,840
Mother wants me to make a career
abroad or at least here

94
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
This is what that operation's for

95
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,720
Mother wants the ward head to operate
on me or better still, you

96
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,600
Do you want it, too?

97
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,280
I want to live, that's enough for me
I don't have to sing

98
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,520
Besides, I'm scared

99
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,240
I guess the ward head wanted you to

100
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,200
reassure me to tell me
it isn't dangerous

101
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,200
I'll be able to do everything
afterwards...

102
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,480
Well, go on, tell me

103
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,800
Know what, it's not that simple

104
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,840
Such operations are usually
carried out to save, I mean...

105
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,320
They are the last resort,
when nothing else can be done

106
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,640
Which is not the case with me, right?

107
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,040
Frankly speaking, that's what I mean

108
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,760
Various people have different needs

109
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,880
Mother wants me to have everything

110
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,640
...while I only need this much

111
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,840
Good afternoon
May I speak to Hanka please?

112
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,480
I'm afraid she's out

113
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
Oh, I thought she was
Thank you

114
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,480
Want me to give her a message?

115
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,320
No, thanks
I'll try to reach her later

116
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,720
What is it?

117
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,320
Van den Budenmayer
Beautiful, isn't it?

118
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,480
Yes

119
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
I once heard it before

120
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,080
I took a call to you

121
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,760
Who was it?

122
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,160
Beautiful, really

123
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,520
I've bought something for you
Care to try it on?

124
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
It's for you

125
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,240
Hello, Hanka, at last!

126
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,080
Hanka...

127
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,120
I must see you
You didn't come at four

128
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,520
All right

129
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,280
Hanka darling

130
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,960
All right, I'll be there

131
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,560
Yes, it's better this way

132
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,800
I see

133
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,240
Yes, sure, O.K.

134
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,080
Can you hear me?

135
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,000
Why, hello, Mum

136
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,600
When could you send it to me?

137
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,440
We fly on Thursdays
and Saturdays now

138
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,360
Fine, go to my flat and find that
black shawl and umbrella

139
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,240
All right

140
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,080
Please come in

141
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I've been thinking about you

142
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,600
After we'd talked yesterday,
I bought a record

143
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,040
What record? Van den Budemayer?

144
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,120
In Dutch, it's wonderful

145
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,360
Remember anything?

146
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Your singing's beautiful

147
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,680
A pity you don't want it for a career

148
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,600
That's what Mother says

149
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,080
And rightly, too

150
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
What did you dream about
when you were my age?

151
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,160
I wanted to become a doctor,
a surgeon

152
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,120
And what about having home, a family?
Didn't you dream about that?

153
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,920
I never thought about it

154
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,960
Mariusz Zawydzki, Physics

155
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,160
Eleven... Twenty-three...
Forty-five...

156
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,920
Eleven... Twenty-three...
Forty-five...

157
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,360
Oh, I forgot

158
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,120
Mother phoned
She wants her umbrella and shawl

159
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,680
Why don't they sell shawls in shops
where she is?

160
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,960
Don't you know her?
She wants to have her own one

161
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,680
When is the plane due?

162
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,440
At twelve, a few minutes past

163
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,360
I don't operate until the afternoon
I may go to the airport,

164
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,360
I'm free for an hour

165
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
You're a dear

166
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,040
Oh, give me the key

167
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,640
The umbrella is on the coat-stand
A black folding one

168
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,640
The shawls's black, too, it's in
the chest of drawers in the bedroom

169
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,400
I'll find it

170
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,720
It's me

171
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,000
Do me a favour, will you?
Never call me on the phone at home

172
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,960
unless you have to

173
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,000
Anything wrong?

174
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,760
No, phone me at the office,
it's better that way

175
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,360
Ten to six, right?

176
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,080
And ten to eight
on Thursdays and Tuesdays

177
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
As you wish, Madam
Have you been to your mother's flat?

178
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,160
I send a postcard to you saying
I love you and will keep our date today

179
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,080
A postcard?

180
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,200
Yes, a silly one, with the Pope
on the reverse side

181
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,160
When did you mail it?

182
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,040
After our last meeting, as usual
Haven't you got it?

183
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,040
No, bye

184
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,480
May I speak to Mr. Mariusz, please?
It's the right number, isn't it?

185
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,360
Mariusz! For you again!

186
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,200
Hallo

187
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,200
It's me, so you're there?

188
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,040
Yes

189
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,760
I tried to reach you but the number
was engaged all the time...

190
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,280
I've just come in
You must have got the number wrong

191
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,720
Hurry up, Roman, don't rummage the flat
Mother doesn't like it

192
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,520
Hope I can still make it,
they haven't taken off yet,

193
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
I'm free at six

194
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,680
You can have the car

195
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,680
Oh, but what about you?

196
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,920
I've got time enough

197
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,760
That's great
I'll come to fetch you

198
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,400
I'll be free at nine
Is it comfortable?

199
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,680
Yes

200
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,320
No mail in Mother's flat?

201
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,200
Ah, I didn't check, you should have
told me to when you phoned

202
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,240
I didn't think about it

203
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,160
Well, be seeing you

204
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,600
Roman

205
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,440
The registration card?

206
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,280
It's in the glove compartment

207
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,480
See you in the evening

208
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
I can't sleep

209
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,160
You were good at physics,

210
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,560
...weren't you?

211
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,880
Tell me how that law goes

212
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,880
The loss of weight of
a floating body

213
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
...is equal to

214
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,320
How does it go?

215
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,680
The apparent loss of weight

216
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,920
...is equal to the weight of water
that body has dislodged

217
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,360
Something like that

218
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,640
I think...

219
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,680
You've had a bad day

220
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,920
Was it an operation?

221
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,840
Yes

222
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,040
Someone died, right?

223
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,680
Yes... don't

224
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,040
Who was it?

225
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,520
Don't touch me

226
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,000
Sorry

227
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,080
It's me

228
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,840
Why, hello, Hanka darling...

229
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,520
I must see you

230
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,080
This is what I've been
telling you all week long,

231
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,720
but the last two days you refused

232
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Now I want it

233
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,200
I miss you

234
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,600
All right,
is Thursday all right with you?

235
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,480
Any time will be fine

236
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,840
At six on Thursday, then

237
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,880
Is anything wrong, darling?

238
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,800
At six

239
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,640
Are you there...

240
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,600
Roman?

241
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,000
Yes

242
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,040
No, don't take it off
I have very little time

243
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,120
I've missed you so much

244
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,760
No... don't

245
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,080
O.K. Not now

246
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,880
And never again
This is the last time we meet

247
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,600
That's what I wanted to tell you

248
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,600
But Hanka...

249
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,200
Go away now

250
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,400
All right, we don't have to go to bed
But don't make me go, please

251
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,160
It's not that, but go now

252
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,280
I love you

253
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,960
We never talked about it

254
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,880
And we're not going to

255
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,600
Did he find out about us?

256
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,200
We're not going to discuss him, either

257
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,320
He hasn't found out and
he won't ever find out

258
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,600
Button you jacket up and go

259
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,600
You're looking swell

260
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,080
Well, go away now

261
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,040
Come out

262
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,320
Come out, will you?

263
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,480
Come out!

264
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,360
Why have you done it?

265
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,600
Tell me, why?

266
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,880
You wanted to see me having
fun with him in bed?

267
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,360
You should have come last week,
you'd have seen everything

268
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,000
I was here last week, too

269
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,960
How's that?

270
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,320
I was sitting
on the steps and listening

271
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,160
Open the door

272
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,480
Perhaps you'd like me
to marry you...

273
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,720
You know, you could
get a divorce and

274
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,960
Roman

275
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,040
Please take me in your arms

276
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,800
Take me tightly

277
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,680
I can't

278
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,520
Please

279
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,160
Oh please do

280
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,880
You're not going to walk out on me

281
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,080
...just because I went to bed with...

282
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,840
I didn't know... I know you well
enough but I never thought...

283
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,680
I didn't know how much
I'd hurt you

284
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,800
I have no right to be jealous
I can't demand it from you

285
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,000
Of course you have the right

286
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,800
You were right about that
other thing, too

287
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,240
Nothing should be left unsaid

288
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,160
I'll never lie to you again
I don't want to hide behind a wardrobe

289
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,080
I had an extra key made

290
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,520
You won't ever have to

291
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,440
We should have a child, adopt one
You were right

292
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,840
We need a rest from each other

293
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,200
Yes

294
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,320
All right, take a holiday

295
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,400
And I'll talk to some lawyer in the
meantime about that adoption

296
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,520
No, I want you to go away

297
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,080
I won't have that physicist...

298
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,920
Good

299
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,120
Not too short?

300
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,680
They're my wife's

301
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,120
Could you tell me...

302
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,320
How much is a ticket to Melbourne?

303
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,360
Go away

304
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,800
I just wanted to ask how much
is a ticket to Melbourne

305
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,720
Janusz

306
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,360
This gentleman will tell you all

307
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,840
you want to know,
Melbourne is his department

308
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,040
What can I do for you?

309
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,040
It takes longer if you want a boy,
and much shorter with a girl

310
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,240
The lawyer was very nice
It would be fully confidential

311
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,240
All right, but how long does it take?

312
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,960
Well, several months with a girl
Everybody wants a boy

313
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,800
You'd just have to provide
a certificate of sterility

314
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,680
I might get it from Mikolaj

315
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,600
Tell me, Roman
Is it what you really want?

316
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:08,760
Yes

317
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,680
Want me to phone you every day
from Zakopane?

318
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,960
No, don't do it

319
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,480
But you do trust me, don't you?

320
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,360
How are you?

321
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,480
I hate you

322
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,680
Why, you agreed, didn't you?

323
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,120
Yes... But I didn't want it

324
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,960
Has anything happened?
What's wrong?

325
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,520
Nothing yet, but I know I'm a
different person now

326
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,560
What do you mean?

327
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,200
I want to sing
And to have a large audience

328
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,640
Hallo?

329
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,800
Good evening

330
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,280
I couldn't get a connection at an
earlier hour... Mariusz, please?

331
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,120
He's away
Who's speaking, please?

332
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,440
A friend from the university

333
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,200
My son went away to Zakopane to ski

334
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,680
Do you want me to give him
your message?

335
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,200
The tickets for today are sold out

336
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,160
The booking-office does not sell
tickets in advance for tomorrow

337
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,440
It's open daily from
seven thirty a.m.

338
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,160
Passengers are invited
to come back tomorrow

339
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,720
Two for ten thirty

340
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,560
What are you doing here?

341
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,520
I was told you went
for a skiing holiday

342
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,160
I thought, maybe you are
in Zakopane So I came here too

343
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,320
I forgot

344
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,440
Hold this a minute, I forgot

345
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:27,880
Is this the hospital?

346
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,920
Yes, may I help you?

347
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,080
This is Hanna Nycz speaking from
Zakopane, is my husband there?

348
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,600
No, Doctor Nycz isn't here today
He phoned he wasn't coming

349
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,400
Yes

350
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,360
Would you please do me a favour?
Should my husband phone the hospital,

351
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,400
Please tell him
I'm leaving for Warsaw

352
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,680
on the first train or
bus I manage to catch

353
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,160
I'll be home in the evening
Will you tell him?

354
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,560
Yes

355
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,680
I'll tell him

356
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,560
Thank you

357
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,280
I'd like to make another call,
please

358
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,120
It won't take long
It's a local call

359
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,040
Right here, at the refilling station

360
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,840
No, just what I needed
They're perfect

361
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,400
Your ticket, please

362
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,120
