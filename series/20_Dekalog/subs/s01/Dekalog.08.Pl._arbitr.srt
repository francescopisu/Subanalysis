1
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,160
Good morning?

2
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,840
Good morning, are you going away
or coming back so early?

3
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm coming back, I took the night
train from Szczecin...

4
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
Ah, I see you've made a good deal?

5
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,280
A series... Showing the German flight
to the North Pole of 1931...

6
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,760
the Polarfahrt

7
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,040
A Zeppelin, I guess?

8
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,960
Three of them, they're great

9
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,000
You must show them to me one day

10
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,200
I'll be glad to show them to you

11
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,760
Good morning

12
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,480
Good morning, Professor?

13
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,240
The dean would like to speak to you

14
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,720
Come on in, please

15
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,360
This is Mrs. Elibieta Loranz
from New York

16
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,360
We've already met

17
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,000
In the States, do I remember well?

18
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,480
You translated my works,
didn't you?

19
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,520
Nearly all of them

20
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,760
Your Polish is perfect! And to
think I've been breaking my tongue

21
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,880
You did very well

22
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,760
Yes, Mrs. Loranz is here
on scientific exchange

23
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,480
She's interested in
your works, Professor

24
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,320
If I got her right,
she'd like to attend your classes

25
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,160
That will be a pleasure for me

26
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,280
Do you want to come today?

27
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,880
If I may

28
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,760
Will you excuse me?

29
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,520
Mrs. Elzbieta Loranz works...

30
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,320
at the American Institute
for investigation

31
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,200
of Jews rescued from the Holocaust

32
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
Well, let's continue our subject

33
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,400
The moral inferno

34
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,280
Who'd like to speak first?

35
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,160
We already have two political stories

36
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,200
to consider...

37
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,320
and one related to the customs
to simplify matters

38
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Yes?

39
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,080
Let's imagine the following situation
A man is dying of cancer...

40
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,480
This is the third case of cancer
this year

41
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,560
He is treated by an excellent specialist

42
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,920
...who's believing Christian,
by the way, it's important

43
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,880
Well, the doctor happen to live

44
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,840
...in the same house as the patient
and his wife

45
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,160
The wife starts pestering the doctor

46
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,920
She wants to know...

47
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,520
whether her husband will die

48
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,360
And when, but the doctor
can't tell her that

49
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
To him, it's like
passing a death sentence

50
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,480
As a believer he can't do it

51
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
But the patient's wife grows
more and more intrusive

52
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,000
The doctor suspects her of having...

53
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,720
special reasons that make her
insist on his answer

54
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,720
It appears he's right:
The woman is pregnant

55
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
It's another man's baby

56
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
The husband doesn't know
What's more...

57
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,360
She couldn't get pregnant before

58
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,080
She loves her unborn baby,

59
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,400
But she also loves her husband

60
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,840
If he's going to live,

61
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,640
She'll have an abortion

62
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,960
If he dies, she can have her baby

63
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,080
The doctor is to decide about
that baby's life

64
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,040
whether he likes it or not
He's aware of that

65
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,600
I know how the story ended

66
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,960
Warsaw's a small town

67
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
To make things more difficult for you,
I might add the baby's alive

68
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,240
Which is perhaps the most important
element of the story

69
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,680
Excuse me, I can't make the
recording from that distance

70
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,520
I said he baby was alive

71
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,480
And that I considered that fact
the most important element

72
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,720
I'd like you to define the characters

73
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,520
...and motives of the heroes

74
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,560
...of that story

75
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,840
It's going to be the more interesting
as we both know the archetypes

76
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,160
Though actually, I believe you know
different archetypes than I do

77
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
Yes, Madam

78
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,320
Thank you, anybody else wants to
say something? No?

79
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,040
Let us therefore analyse
the previous stories

80
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,960
Yes, Madam?

81
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,640
You said the baby's life
was paramount,

82
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,520
...didn't you?

83
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,680
Yes indeed

84
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
It just occurred to me -

85
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,240
if I'm allowed to take an active part
in the class, that is -

86
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
But of course, all those present
have equal rights

87
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,160
I'd like to tell you

88
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,800
...about an event

89
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,640
We'll be glad to hear you

90
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm afraid it has a weak point for you

91
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
it happened in the past

92
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,720
But then it also has an advantage

93
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,160
It's true

94
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Does what I said about the baby's life

95
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,160
...matter to you specially?

96
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,760
Yes, it does

97
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,640
...to some extent

98
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,400
It's the year 1943... February
...the winter

99
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,520
The heroine is a girl of six
...a Jewish girl

100
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,200
...kept in a basement of a house
in the neighborhood

101
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,040
But she can't stay there any longer

102
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,960
The girl's father is in the ghetto

103
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,920
His friends try to find
a new place for her

104
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
The place is found but her
future guardians pose a condition

105
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,840
The girl must have an official
certificate of baptism

106
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,240
It's a cold evening

107
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,040
The girl visits a married couple

108
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,560
...who have agreed to be
her godparents

109
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,800
They are Catholics, and young

110
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,000
The girl's frozen

111
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,920
She has spent all day getting through the
city with her guardian to reach this flat

112
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,920
Well, she now goes in
accompanied by the guardian

113
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,360
The husband seems nervous
The wife is calm

114
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,320
They serve hot tea

115
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,840
The girl wants that tea very much
but there isn't time

116
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,720
The parent's waiting,
and the curfew's near

117
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,880
But the woman who should start
getting dressed

118
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,040
...asks them to sit down instead

119
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,240
Sorry

120
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Get out of here!

121
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,080
Please go out

122
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,800
Thank you

123
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,720
You said it was in 1943?

124
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,560
Yes, in February

125
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,440
In Warsaw?

126
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
Yes

127
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
In the distant parts of Mokotow district
In Odynca street

128
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,760
Yes? What happened next?

129
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,880
Next? Ah, yes

130
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,200
They sat at the table

131
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,280
The man kept walking round the table

132
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,240
They looked at one another

133
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,280
At least the woman made up her mind to say
things that were so very difficult to say

134
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,840
They can't keep their promise

135
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,600
Having considered everything...

136
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,720
They cannot lie to the one
they believe in

137
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,000
He does demand them to be charitable

138
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,920
...but forbids to give false testimony

139
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,760
The lie they had planned to commit
knowing what cause it serve

140
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,280
...proved reconcilable with their
moral principles after all

141
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,560
That's it

142
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,080
Then, the guardian and the girl
rise from the table

143
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,880
Have some more tea,
the woman says

144
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,040
The girl takes a sip

145
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,960
But then she glances at her guardian
and puts the glass down

146
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,200
And then,

147
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,360
...downstairs at the gateway

148
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,800
...the girl notices her guardian

149
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,720
It's curfew soon,
she says

150
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,680
But the guardian doesn't move

151
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Was there anybody else

152
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,280
...in that flat?

153
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,240
Yes, an elderly gentleman

154
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,200
He was sitting with his back
to the rest

155
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,200
In a wheel chair, I believe

156
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,880
Do you know any details?

157
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,720
The tea cups were good quality China,
but didn't match one another

158
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,480
There was a green kerosene lamp
on the table but it was out

159
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,000
The man never took his hand out of
his trouser pocket

160
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,960
...during the two or three minutes
of the conversation

161
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,040
They are all the details

162
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,520
Any questions?
None?

163
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,080
Maybe doubts?

164
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,600
Yes?

165
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,800
The motivations seems improbable to me
it that married couple were really Catholics

166
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,640
That false testimony wouldn't be
directed against their fellow man

167
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,720
This is the only motivation I know
It seemed quite genuine that evening

168
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,680
What other motives were possible?

169
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,720
How do you think?

170
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I don't know

171
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,120
I can't understand that

172
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,200
I don't know motives which
would justify a decision like that

173
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes?

174
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,480
Fear...

175
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,760
Imagine another Jewish child had been
discovered in that house

176
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,880
And his head smacked against the railing,
and the family that had kept him executed

177
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,160
Yes
Fear, yes

178
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
Is fear a justification to you?

179
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,920
I've just suggested a possible motive
I haven't said...

180
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,800
We're going too far

181
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,080
Please consider the moral problems

182
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,480
...that emerge from that story
as your homework

183
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,600
As for you,

184
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,440
try and present an acceptable
point of view of that woman

185
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,200
Try and understand her

186
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,360
That's all, thank you

187
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,840
It wasn't in Mokotow district

188
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,480
That's right

189
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,360
It happened down town

190
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,240
In Noakowskiego street

191
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,440
Yes

192
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,800
So it's you...

193
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,200
Yes, it's me

194
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
And you're alive

195
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I kept thinking, all those years

196
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,440
Whenever I saw anybody playing
with a golden chainlet

197
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,680
I said to myself

198
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh God, you're alive

199
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,160
A chance family in Prague district
agreed to give me shelter

200
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,600
Some relatives of the person
who brought me to you

201
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,640
They were moon shiners,
I spent two years next to a mash tub

202
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,120
They're with me in America now
The man's already dead, actually

203
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,320
And you've come here to look at
my face

204
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,840
...while you tell your story

205
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,600
I wanted to tell you who I
was back in the States

206
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,440
I tried to write you a letter

207
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,320
And to come here

208
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,800
If it hadn't been for those
few words about that baby

209
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,960
I'd never have

210
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,520
Yes

211
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,080
I see

212
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,800
Some say a person who rescue
another person has special features

213
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,160
The same concerns the one who
has to be rescued

214
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,160
Yes, I believe there are
such special features

215
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,800
And you have them

216
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,800
I have them?

217
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,320
Yes

218
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,080
The things you did afterwards

219
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,320
...are well known

220
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,560
Several of my nationals owe
their lives to you

221
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,040
Funny, that girl sensed the falsity
of that ostensibly...

222
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,640
...Catholic reasoning straight away

223
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,560
The ash-tray's over there

224
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,560
You don't smoke

225
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,800
But I see things

226
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,320
Where are you staying?
Shall I give you a lift?

227
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,120
I remember you once drove me
all through New York

228
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,240
I have a room in Victoria
about 300 meters from here

229
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,360
Perhaps you'd like to have supper
with me?

230
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,840
In this where you live?

231
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,120
No

232
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,320
But this is the house

233
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,280
Yes

234
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,720
It's in this very gateway
that you said,

235
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,880
Let's go, it's curfew soon

236
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,120
Elzbieta!

237
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,240
Elzbieta?

238
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,840
What's all this stir about?

239
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,600
I didn't hear it ring

240
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,720
I once... Sorry

241
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,440
I'm looking for a woman

242
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,680
There hasn't been one here for ages

243
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,080
But there are several families
living in this flat?

244
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,240
Five of them, you must ring
the bell for each of them separately

245
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,200
We don't like one another too much

246
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,880
Is this about the advertisement?
Come in, please

247
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,880
No

248
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,680
I'm looking for my friend
She entered this staircase

249
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,720
A tall woman, black hair...

250
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,000
What?

251
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,560
I'm looking for my friend

252
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,640
Nut case!

253
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,400
Come on, stop it

254
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,440
Excuse me

255
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Is there another entrance?

256
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,200
Is it about the advertisement?

257
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,160
No

258
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,760
There's no other entrance

259
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,720
It's a respectable house

260
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,560
About the advertisement?

261
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,880
No, and she never came back

262
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,480
This means she didn't go in after all

263
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,560
But she did

264
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,560
Elzbieta

265
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,840
Nut case!

266
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,320
Oh God, I've been looking for you

267
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,840
I'm here

268
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,440
I was frightened for a moment

269
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,240
I thought you'd never been
here at all

270
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,560
But I am

271
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,320
It's a horrible place

272
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,000
I went to my former flat

273
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,920
That night my father's friend
could not think what to do next

274
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,000
It was then that I decided
I'd never be afraid again

275
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,360
Why didn't you come here

276
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,720
...all those forty years?

277
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,360
Didn't you want to see this place?

278
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,840
No, it's humiliating

279
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,000
Being helped by others?

280
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,680
Yes, one doesn't like to meet
the witnesses

281
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,920
...of one's own humiliation

282
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,560
Even if those witnesses
are only houses

283
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,520
All right, we investigate.
Analyse and describe

284
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,360
But how could this injustice
be abolished?

285
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,360
Why can some be rescuers while
others are the rescued only?

286
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,800
Do you know why?

287
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,760
No, I don't

288
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,840
Let's go

289
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,240
A nice flat

290
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,240
I'm on a diet, you see

291
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,120
I didn't expect anybody to supper

292
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,800
The woman I remember couldn't have
changed into a person like you

293
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,560
But it did happen

294
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,920
You frightened me

295
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,560
...back there in Noakowskiego street

296
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,880
I'm sorry

297
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,800
If you made all this trip of
several thousand kilometers

298
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,120
...hoping for a mystery,

299
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,600
...you're going to be disappointed

300
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,360
The reasons why I had to
get rid of you...

301
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,760
...that night are trivial

302
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,520
The impact that night had
on my life...

303
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,320
...is quite another problem
But let's forget it

304
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,720
The man...

305
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,440
...who walk round the room

306
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,120
...with a hand in his pocket
was my husband

307
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,160
He died in 1952

308
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I know

309
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,760
He was a Home Army officer
in those days

310
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,080
We had been informed that the family
who were take you

311
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,040
...were agents of the Gestapo

312
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,240
Through yourself, your guardian
and the priest the Gestapo would

313
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,960
...then get to us...
to the underground organization

314
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,040
That could have been a possible
give-away channel

315
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,000
And that's the whole mystery

316
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,600
Yes, it's very simple

317
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,320
Later it appeared that...

318
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,680
the information about that family
was false

319
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,480
But they were nearly executed
by the underground

320
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,360
And you believed

321
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,080
That's only natural

322
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,080
And you lived forty years
with that certainty

323
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,480
I didn't ever know you were alive

324
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,840
I left you all alone

325
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,640
I sent you to what was a
nearly certain death

326
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
And I knew

327
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,200
...what I was doing

328
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,160
Yes, you're right

329
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,400
No idea, no thought,
nothing can be more important

330
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,560
...that the life of a child

331
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,960
What do you tell your students?

332
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,680
About how they should live?

333
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,560
I don't tell them anything

334
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,320
I'm there to help them reach
their own conclusion

335
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,440
Why?

336
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,880
It's the right that matters

337
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,600
It does exist

338
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,360
I believe it exist in all men

339
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,720
A situation can release either
the right or the wrong

340
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,520
That evening released
no right in myself

341
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,080
Who's the one to evaluate it?

342
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,520
The One who's inside all of us

343
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,600
I never noticed a mention about
God in your works

344
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,600
I'm not a church-goer

345
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,360
I don't use the word God

346
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,080
But you don't need words
to be sure

347
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,720
Man is free
...free to choose

348
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,600
He can leave God behind

349
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,080
...if he likes

350
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,240
And what can then replace God?

351
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,680
Loneliness, in this world

352
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,240
And afterwards...

353
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Try to get to...

354
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,360
the bottom of this problem

355
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,320
If there's nothing but emptiness

356
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,520
...afterwards... In that case

357
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,240
Yes, I know that

358
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,520
May I?

359
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,080
Come in, please

360
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,400
Oh I thought you were alone

361
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,120
Good evening, Madam

362
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,960
I just wanted to show you...

363
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,360
Beautiful, really beautiful

364
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:30,720
Sorry to trouble you...

365
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,240
If you happen to see your so,
please tell him about them

366
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,000
He was always most interested
in such things

367
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,960
I will, Polarfahrt

368
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,600
Three Zeppelins... 1931

369
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,400
Right
Well, good night

370
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,160
Good night, and thank you

371
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,840
A stamp-collector?

372
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,200
More than that, I think
He sometimes shows those stamps to me

373
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,880
...like others show their grandchildren

374
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,480
...or pictures of their children

375
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,440
He was wearing a sweater
Looked like a neighbour...

376
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,640
A neighbour, yes

377
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,520
Know what?
That doctor and patient

378
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,400
...we talked about during the class

379
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,800
...also live in this house

380
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,640
Well, an interesting house

381
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,000
Like any other one

382
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,160
In all houses, in all flats,
some people...

383
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,240
And so on, and so on...

384
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,560
Exactly

385
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,280
Thank you

386
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,440
Do those people...
the ones I was to go to

387
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,080
Do you know them?

388
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,320
Yes

389
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,720
If that's what you want to know?

390
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,920
Could I meet them?

391
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,480
Would you like to?

392
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,480
All right, I'll take you there tomorrow

393
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,920
It's a small tailor's shop
in Prague district

394
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,080
But I'm not going in

395
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,800
I only saw them once after the war

396
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,720
I said, I'm sorry

397
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
That was all I could say

398
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,480
But it wasn't enough

399
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:06,240
Would you like to...

400
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,480
...stay here for the night?

401
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,880
I have another room

402
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,480
Very few people ever
stay there nowadays

403
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,240
It's interesting

404
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,320
Do you like it?

405
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,880
What are you doing?

406
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,360
They've got a favourite on TV

407
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,600
I want to show them I'm even better

408
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,720
See? That was rubber stand
He can't do that

409
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,640
How do you do it?

410
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,080
Anybody can do it
It's a matter of practice

411
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,520
Bend backwards...

412
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,080
A bit more

413
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,080
No, you can't

414
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,080
I can't

415
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,480
It's too late now, you won't learn it
I'm sorry

416
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,160
Excuse me

417
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,720
Will you have breakfast with me?

418
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,120
Something more than just 50 grams
of cottage cheese

419
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,000
...on the fifteenth day of the diet
Coffee without sugar

420
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,600
All right

421
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,200
I get up early, just like you

422
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,280
All right, I'll have...

423
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,240
A normal breakfast

424
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,360
Was that room...

425
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,200
What room?

426
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,840
The one I slept in

427
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,080
Was it your son's room?

428
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,800
Yes, it was

429
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,280
But he doesn't live here, does he?

430
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,600
No, he didn't wan to stay with me

431
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,280
Did you buy these flowers?

432
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,040
Yes, I noticed you put fresh
flowers on the table

433
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,800
Thank you

434
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,080
Where is he?

435
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,640
To be brief...

436
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,560
He's far away from me

437
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,720
It's here

438
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,600
I'll do some shopping and come back
here to fetch you

439
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,840
Yes, Madam?

440
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,520
I'd like to talk to you

441
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,000
To me?

442
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,480
Oh God... what about?

443
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,080
I'm Elzbieta Loranz

444
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,200
I don't know you, Madam

445
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,000
I know we never actually met, but we
were to meet during the war...

446
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,200
No, wait a minute
I don't want to talk about the war

447
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,440
Or about what happened

448
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,200
...after the war

449
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,320
Not even about today

450
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,800
I can make you a nice dress, coat,
or maybe a suit

451
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,880
Just decide on the out
Here you are

452
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,360
You were to save my life, I'd like to
thank you for being prepared to do it

453
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,520
Got your own length of cloth?

454
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,080
You see, it's so difficult
to buy anything nowadays

455
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,920
I was six years old then
It was in February of 1943

456
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,480
Yes

457
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,560
I was twenty-two

458
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,160
Well, a coat?

459
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,160
These fashion magazine are very old

460
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,480
Would you be offended if I send you
something more recent?

461
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,480
No, I got this one from abroad, too
But it was many years ago

462
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,040
Afterwards, there was no opportunity

463
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,880
And you aren't going to
talk with me?

464
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,160
No

465
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,480
I didn't go away just in case

466
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,400
Well, he wanted to
make a coat for me

467
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,400
Just what I thought
He was in great trouble

468
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,040
Too great a trouble perhaps

469
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,120
Isn't this a strange country

470
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,640
Did you pray yesterday?

471
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,080
Yes
