1
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,160
To be opened after my death

2
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,280
Anka, stop it, damn you!
Please don't

3
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,040
Stop it, do you hear?

4
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,160
It's Easter Monday!

5
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,360
No...

6
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,560
What do you mean, no?
Open the door!

7
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,360
I won't

8
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,480
Please let me in
I'm in a hurry

9
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,640
No

10
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,320
Open the door, damn it

11
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,360
Easter Monday, eh?

12
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,960
Let me in

13
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,160
I won't have the time to get dry
if I'm to- Oh!

14
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Yes, it's me... Just a moment

15
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,720
Would you hang up the receiver,
Dad? I'll take it from my room

16
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,720
O.K.

17
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
Has he hanged up?

18
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,600
Yes

19
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
Have you hanged up, Dad?

20
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,920
Yes

21
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,720
Well?

22
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,880
It's all right, false alarm
I got the curse in the morning

23
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,400
Thank God

24
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,920
Want me to come to the airport?

25
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,320
What is it?

26
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,080
My ticket, damn it

27
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,640
Are you scared?

28
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,480
You won't believe me anyway
if I say no

29
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,280
Right, I don't like your going away

30
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,600
It's wet, damn it

31
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,360
Bye, Dad

32
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,800
Bye, and take care

33
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,720
Anka...

34
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,000
I forgot to pay the rent and
the telephone bill

35
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,320
Where are those bills?

36
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,120
One of the bureau drawers
You'll find them

37
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Dad!

38
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,920
To be opened after my death

39
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,520
Your Christian name, please?

40
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Anna

41
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,560
Age?

42
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Twenty

43
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,880
Are you a student?

44
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,640
PWST third year...

45
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,120
The Theatrical College

46
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,040
I know

47
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,320
I wonder...

48
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,240
My son wants to study there,
what exams did you have on admission?

49
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,240
Literature, prose, poetry, song

50
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,840
Let me see
Elliot's, Herbert's?

51
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,880
Elliot?
I see, he hasn't got a chance

52
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,600
Do you have problems with your sight?

53
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,560
Yes, yesterday I looked at a plane
from a distance

54
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,440
I ought to have seen it clearly
but it was just a blurred shape

55
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,160
And then I remembered
I only notice bus numbers

56
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,240
...from a very close distance

57
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,320
Here you are

58
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,320
F-A-T-H-E-R, Father

59
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,240
You've been guessing
At least the last letters

60
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Yes

61
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,960
And you speak English

62
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,440
Yes

63
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Why have you arranged the letters
like this?

64
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,760
I checked you I.Q., too

65
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,520
I see, my father was leaving on that
plane which I couldn't see yesterday

66
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,000
To be opened after my death

67
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,440
Have I done anything wrong?

68
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,040
Have I?

69
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,040
No...

70
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
You're not in the centre of everything

71
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
Bad temper?

72
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,560
I don't like Father to be away

73
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,480
If you feel sad or scared,

74
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,520
I can stay with you all the time

75
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,880
For my daughter Anna

76
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,360
Well, who's next?

77
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,040
I know it's going to be me...

78
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,360
And me

79
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,920
All right, step up to each other

80
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
Good night

81
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,960
We won't have any more games tonight

82
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
Good night

83
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,400
What a shrew, you love him, remember

84
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,520
You love him, you're offended
An offended princess, concentrate

85
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,520
Why should I love him?

86
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,400
Are you kidding?
Don't you get the implied meaning?

87
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,080
It's possible to love just anybody
We all have a silly something for which

88
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,480
All right, but why do I love him?

89
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,880
I don't know, Think of something

90
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,880
Let's say...

91
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,960
you love him because he stared at you

92
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,680
All right, sir, if you please

93
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,720
Now don't get personal
Lie down on the table

94
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,480
Let's imagine such a situation

95
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,680
Just the text

96
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Good night

97
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,760
Good

98
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,160
We won't have any more games tonight

99
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,120
May the angel put his
blue wings around you...

100
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,640
Don't be shy

101
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,080
Good night

102
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,240
May your eyes that cried so much...

103
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,160
have some rest at last

104
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,000
Let the smile fade,
and now get closer to him

105
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,160
Good night

106
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,040
Turn your lovely eyes to me...

107
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,480
Look at me once more

108
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,240
Turn your cheek to me...

109
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,560
Good night

110
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,280
You aren't concentrating,
do you want?

111
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,480
Let me kiss you

112
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,920
Good night

113
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,640
Are you leaving like this?

114
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,520
I will touch your breasts

115
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,880
They are hiding under your clothes

116
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,120
With bonds of love

117
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,080
I will not let you sleep

118
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,320
See: You know how to look at him
Now you're concentrating

119
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Thank you, we'll have a break now

120
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,920
Break...

121
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,640
For my daughter Anna

122
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,840
For my daughter Anna

123
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,200
Hi

124
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,920
Sorry I haven't phoned, I just
happened to be in the neighborhood

125
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
Michal asked me to collect some drawings

126
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,920
I'm in a hurry

127
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,480
Someone's waiting for me downstairs

128
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,720
I say, Adam...

129
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,640
Yes?

130
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,560
You've known Father a long time,
haven't you?

131
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,320
We were students together

132
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,120
Did you know my mother?

133
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,200
Yes, not too well, actually

134
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,320
What was she like?

135
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,600
You resemble her

136
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,200
I mean, what did she look like?

137
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,960
You resemble her that way, too
But she also had intuition, like you

138
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,720
Do you think she could have had a secret?

139
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,640
I don't know

140
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,440
Something she might have
wanted to let me know

141
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,400
She'd have told you
She was like you

142
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,920
I was five days old when she died

143
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,840
Ah, yes

144
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
She'd have wrote you a letter or something

145
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,200
Sorry, I've got to go

146
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,360
I'll call in some day
after Michal's back, bye

147
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Thanks

148
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,440
Hello, why here of all places?

149
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,560
Well yes, it's quite nice

150
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Pretty, pale frame

151
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,960
Is anything wrong?

152
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,440
No

153
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,760
At school?

154
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,560
Then what is it?

155
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,240
My dear baby daughter...

156
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Pardon?

157
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,480
My dear baby daughter

158
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,080
I don't know what you look like
reading this letter

159
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,800
You must be a grown-up woman now,
and Michal is already dead

160
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,560
When I'm writing this, you're just
a tiny baby, I saw you just once

161
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,560
They refused to show you to me anymore
because I'll be dying soon, I guess

162
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,520
There's an important thing
I've got to tell you

163
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,760
Michal is not your father

164
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,640
But it doesn't really matter
who your father is

165
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,000
Just a moment of forgetfulness
and the harm was done

166
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,800
I know Michal will love you like a daughter
and you'll be comfortable with him

167
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,680
I'm thinking about you now...
wondering what you look like

168
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,240
...when you're reading this letter

169
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,400
You have dark hair, haven't you?

170
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,840
And slender hand...

171
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,440
and neck...

172
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,480
I would so much like to...

173
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Mother...

174
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,400
Good afternoon, is Jarek home?

175
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,440
No, he's out

176
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,640
But he'll be back, come in

177
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,200
Did he tell you he wanted to marry me?

178
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,640
I guessed it, anyway

179
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,360
I can marry him straight away

180
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,600
What about your father?

181
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,920
It doesn't matter

182
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,360
He's not my father, really

183
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,040
I've been looking for you

184
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,000
I forgot the keys

185
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,440
Is this our floor?

186
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,880
Sorry

187
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,520
Good evening?

188
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Are you going down?

189
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,360
Yes

190
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,800
You knew it?

191
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,360
And you first...

192
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
tell me

193
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,720
Yes, I guessed

194
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,800
Oh, I'm sorry
It seems I've brought all the way down

195
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
No, we weren't going down

196
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,240
But this is the basement, Dad

197
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,480
Never mind, come on!

198
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,560
Do you recognize your mother?

199
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,440
Yes, well

200
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
One of them may be your father

201
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,880
Dad?

202
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,080
It belonged to your mother

203
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,840
They gave it back to me in the hospital

204
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,640
Sin when do you know?

205
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
I've never known for sure

206
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,760
I only suspected

207
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,080
You deceived me

208
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,680
It never mattered to me
You've always been my daughter

209
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,800
You should have told me

210
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,720
First, I planned to show
this letter to you,

211
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,160
When you were ten

212
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,840
But then it turned out
you were still too small

213
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,000
Next, I decided to wait
till you were fifteen

214
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,880
Then you proved too big

215
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,560
So I just put it into
that yellow envelope

216
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,480
So damn simple

217
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,280
I thought things would be the same
between you and me

218
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,960
But you're lying

219
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,360
Yes, you are

220
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,240
Look

221
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,680
I've got two candles

222
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
This one's mine...

223
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,920
and the other one - yours

224
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,680
The person whose candle is the first
to die out will ask a question, O.K.?

225
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
O.K.

226
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
It's a draft

227
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,680
Got a cigarette?

228
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,640
You win

229
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,840
You can ask, and
you'll get a honest answer

230
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,360
Why I read the letter?

231
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,400
I read it because you wanted me to

232
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,320
I first saw it...

233
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,360
during the removal, quite accidentally

234
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,440
Papers fell out of a briefcase of yours

235
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,440
I was sixteen at that time

236
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,720
Fifteen and a half

237
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,720
All right, fifteen and a half

238
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,440
I put the letter back to the briefcase
but I already knew it existed

239
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,840
It was quite exciting to begin with,
to know there was something

240
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,440
I could only learn after your death

241
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,760
I noticed you took the letter
with you when you went away

242
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,680
But you didn't take it with you
the last time

243
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,840
You did it on purpose

244
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,880
Well, so I took it

245
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,680
I carried it with me three days long

246
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,800
A week had passed, and I went to sit
on the Vistula and opened the letter

247
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,320
Quite an exhaustive answer

248
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,960
Have you ever read it?

249
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,440
No

250
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,520
It wasn't too exhaustive, really

251
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,440
Like they tell us at school,
think...

252
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,240
why you say the things you say,
think about the intention or the implied meaning

253
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,680
Don't you want to learn about
the implied meaning?

254
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,480
The implied meaning is that...

255
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,000
I sensed, or guessed, the contents
of this letter several years ago

256
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,200
When I had my first boy-friend
I knew I was deceiving somebody

257
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,200
I couldn't understand it

258
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,680
That somebody was you

259
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,400
I keep looking for a person

260
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,680
Another person

261
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,160
But when somebody touches me
I think about your hand

262
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,560
When I'm close with somebody,
I'm not really with him but...

263
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,840
How shall I call you?

264
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,440
I don't know

265
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,040
Anka...

266
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,560
Ah, so you're back
Hello

267
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,720
Well, how was it?

268
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,600
Not too bad

269
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Here are your drawing, I copied and
mailed them and they wired they got them

270
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,640
Oh, gush...

271
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,920
I've heard there are drafts

272
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,000
Yes...

273
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,880
That one?

274
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,360
Yes

275
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
Exactly the same

276
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,560
Does it help?

277
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,080
Just look at Anka

278
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,800
After just a month of taking it
Don't you believe me?

279
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,120
Just try it

280
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,880
Oh, you've been drinking together?

281
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,480
Yes, Anka...

282
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,680
How are things at school?
When are you graduating

283
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,160
In May

284
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,160
And what about those dreams you had?

285
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Then I'm...

286
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,960
No thanks, old boy, I'll be going
You haven't even unpacked your things

287
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,120
Go to him

288
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,200
He's gone

289
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,120
I know

290
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,720
Take a bus and go to him

291
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,000
Or take a taxi and go no matter
where You don't want to talk, do you?

292
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,040
Anka baby

293
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
I'm not listening

294
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,520
Leave me alone!

295
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,160
Who are you afraid of?

296
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,400
Me or yourself?

297
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,080
No reason to be afraid

298
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,880
I'm getting married

299
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,280
Answer it

300
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,720
It might be Krystyna or Marta

301
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,800
Or Jarek, answer it

302
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,920
Yes?

303
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,160
I don't know

304
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,440
No, I haven't been asleep

305
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,320
Phone tomorrow, O.K.?

306
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,800
He doesn't know he's going to
be carried, does he?

307
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,640
No, but I told his mother

308
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,200
Aren't you afraid?

309
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,360
Want to talk?

310
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,560
Really?

311
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,920
You can run away

312
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,400
Go away, get married...

313
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,640
But it won't help any

314
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,920
What I told you before Adam came
was true

315
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,080
I always felt guilty in bed

316
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,240
Now I know why
I was deceiving you

317
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,640
I didn't feel it

318
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,320
I say, let's make a deal

319
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,440
If you lie and I catch you out,
you will admit it, O.K.?

320
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,960
All right

321
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,880
You lied that you'd never felt it

322
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,480
Yes

323
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,600
You did feel it, then?

324
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,280
Yes

325
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,800
You live your own life

326
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,880
You're free to do what you like

327
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,400
And I pretend it's all right

328
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,840
Even if you really want to marry
that boy Jarek,

329
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,440
I won't tell you not to
No matter how much you'd like me to

330
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,880
I have no right to forbid you anything

331
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,880
If I forbid you something or
force you to do something,

332
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,960
I'll consider myself jealous

333
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,480
Not the way a father is jealous
about his daughter

334
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,960
That would be ordinary jealousy,
like between man and woman

335
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,520
Do you get my meaning?

336
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,120
I don't want it to be like that
I've never wanted it

337
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,400
But it's been like that

338
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,960
I don't know why

339
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,880
Remember three years ago,

340
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,560
when you caught me in bed with Marcin?

341
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,840
Was it because of that
that you went away?

342
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Yes

343
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,360
I tried to find an excuse then, too

344
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,160
No father likes it when his daughter
starts sleeping with men

345
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,840
But I wasn't you daughter

346
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,560
I don't know

347
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,040
I often thought your mother
could have

348
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,840
But they say women always know

349
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,880
But she could have been mistaken

350
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,120
No, she couldn't

351
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,520
Women do know

352
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,480
How do you know that?

353
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,400
I just know

354
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,160
Have you ever been pregnant?

355
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,760
When was it?

356
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,480
Last year

357
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Let me tell you something

358
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,240
I used to go away, to spend night out
I left you alone because...

359
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,920
because I wanted something to happen

360
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,320
Something irreversible

361
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,480
At first I thought it would with
your first man, but it didn't

362
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,480
And then I just dreamed that
you should have a baby, I still dream about it

363
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,240
That's why I had an abortion, I didn't want
you to tell me it was all right

364
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,640
For that same reason, I didn't tell you
I was going to have that abortion

365
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,840
I was afraid you'd say, Ah well,
do as you wish, my girl

366
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,480
It's all right

367
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,000
Has it never occurred to you
at I didn't want anything irreversible to happen

368
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,480
What do you want my baby for?

369
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,800
You just want everything to be settled
without you once more, just like that letter

370
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,920
To be opened after my death

371
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,880
I'm putting it back where it belongs

372
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,800
It's addressed to you

373
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,920
I don't want it

374
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,280
I don't

375
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,920
I don't want it

376
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,040
When I was a little girl,
you used to caress my back

377
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,440
Sometime I would cry on purpose

378
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,600
...to make you reach under my pyjamas and
caress me

379
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,520
It gave me a thrill

380
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,160
You wanted me to stay a little girl,
didn't you?

381
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,840
To be a baby

382
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,440
You forbade me to wear a proper bathing suit
despite the fact I already had breasts

383
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,520
When I was to have the curse for the first time
you took me to the mountains to stop it somehow

384
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,360
And you never married,
Marta or another woman

385
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,120
I was afraid you might...

386
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,640
but there was no reason

387
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,280
You didn't marry again

388
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,840
You've been waiting for me,
haven't you?

389
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,080
Haven't you?

390
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,680
Yes...

391
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,480
It was bound to happen

392
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,080
I'm not your daughter,

393
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,720
and I'm a woman

394
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,120
Do you want to touch me?

395
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,000
Do you?

396
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,040
All right

397
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,080
Then answer just another question

398
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,760
Just one

399
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,320
Why did you want me to read
that letter?

400
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,600
I wanted the impossible

401
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,360
I wanted...

402
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,520
the impossible

403
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,880
That's why I hit you the first time,
back at the airport

404
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,680
That was because you'd read the letter,

405
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,680
and because I'd wanted you to read it

406
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,880
Because of Mother...

407
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,360
Because she wrote things
she never told me

408
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,360
Because I love you...

409
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,320
but you're not my daughter

410
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,160
Because everything could have shaped
quite differently

411
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,920
And because of the days that won't
ever be back

412
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,160
When you caressed my back
whenever I cried...

413
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,040
Candy King

414
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,080
Gingerbread Page

415
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,120
Marzipan Princess

416
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,240
Dad?

417
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,680
Dad!

418
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,800
Daddy!

419
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,680
I lied to you, Daddy

420
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,480
I didn't read that letter,
I didn't even open it

421
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,800
Dad, I wrote it myself what you read,
what I told you at the airport

422
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,720
I noticed Mother's handwriting on the
envelope and forged that letter

423
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,560
Dad, What did Mother write?

424
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,720
I don't know

425
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,920
Where have you been?

426
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,080
To fetch some milk for breakfast

427
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,600
I know what we should do
with the letter

428
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,720
This is the genuine one

429
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,480
Will you help me?

430
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,520
Yes

431
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,080
My darling daughter...

432
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,360
I'd like to...

433
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,640
is it: Tell?

434
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,680
I'd like to tell you

435
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,880
something...

436
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,840
most important

437
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,840
Michal...

438
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,520
Michal is not...

439
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,600
the rest of it's been burnt down
