1
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,079
T-T-T-This is just
sloppy craftsmanship.

2
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:37,499
Hey, Rick.

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,755
Boy, sure is really especially
beautiful out there today, huh?

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,049
Oh, yes, Morty.

5
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:43,928
I-it's almost unbelievable,
isn't it?

6
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:45,056
Yeah, you know?

7
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:46,382
There's something about the air

8
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:48,020
and just the way the sunshine is.

9
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:49,106
Uh, sure, buddy. Yeah.

10
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:50,776
Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.

11
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:51,862
Wha... convincing?

12
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:52,947
Oh. Responsive, too.

13
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:54,324
In real time. I love it.

14
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,995
Uhh... okay.

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,281
I'm going to work.

16
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:58,667
Morty, good morning.

17
00:00:58,752 --> 00:00:59,794
Dad, good morning.

18
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,757
I am going to work. Goodbye.

19
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,260
What's with mom?

20
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:04,764
Oh, what's with mom?

21
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:06,684
So, you're saying that
she's acting weird?

22
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:08,270
How sophisticated.

23
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:09,565
Careful, guys.

24
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:11,444
You're gonna burn out
the CPU with this one.

25
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:12,738
Okay, you know what, Rick?

26
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,907
You're acting weird, too.

27
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,746
Whatever,
quote-unquote "Morty."

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,999
All right, well...

29
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,335
I'll see you after school.

30
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:21,172
Ow! Oof! Ugh!

31
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:22,257
Damn it!

32
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:23,510
I'm all right. I'm okay.

33
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:29,021
All right, who can tell
me what 5 x 9 is?

34
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:31,652
Morty?

35
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:32,612
Uh, me?

36
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:33,864
What is 5 x 9?

37
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:37,038
Umm... you know,
it's uhh ...at least 40.

38
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,503
Morty, that's exactly correct!

39
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:43,092
5 x 9 is at least 40!

40
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:44,052
Come up here.

41
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:45,472
Whoo! Way to go, Morty!

42
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:47,935
Everybody,
this is the best student.

43
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:49,939
I want you to be
the teacher today.

44
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:51,401
Teach us, Morty!

45
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,653
Interesting.

46
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,115
W-w-w-what do you
want me to teach you?

47
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,242
Ooh, ooh!

48
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:57,079
How do you make
concentrated dark matter?

49
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:58,331
Oh, that's a good question.

50
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,751
Concentrated huh?

51
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:00,962
Concentrated dark matter...

52
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:03,551
the fuel for accelerated
space travel.

53
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:04,636
Now, do you know how to make it?

54
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:05,597
Umm...

55
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,682
Come on, Morty.

56
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:08,853
Isn't your grandpa,
like, a scientist?

57
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:11,483
Oh, yeah, but, you know,
he told me that I shouldn't go

58
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:14,197
around spouting off about, you
know, his science and stuff.

59
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:17,287
I bet you've seen him make
concentrated dark matter a lot.

60
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:20,544
You know, if you tell us,
I'll be your girlfriend.

61
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:21,713
Uh, y-you will?

62
00:02:21,797 --> 00:02:23,717
Seems like a rare opportunity,
Morty.

63
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,933
Morty, u-uh, come on.
There's a family emergency.

64
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,101
Stop right there!

65
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:29,312
If he leaves,
I'm giving him an "F."

66
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:30,397
He doesn't care.

67
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,441
Aw, man!

68
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,819
Rick, I have to go back!

69
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,280
I think I was about
to get married!

70
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,450
Ugh! Take a shower with me,
Morty.

71
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:36,369
What?!

72
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:37,663
Listen to me, Morty.

73
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:39,541
Get your clothes off and
get in the shower right now.

74
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,337
Y-y-y-you got to
trust me, Morty.

75
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,422
Ugh!

76
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:43,758
I'm gonna get an
"F" in class, Rick.

77
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:44,970
Morty, that's not class.

78
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:46,514
T-T-T-That wasn't your teacher.

79
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:47,767
This isn't your school.

80
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:49,395
This entire world
is not the world.

81
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,882
We're inside a huge simulation
chamber on an alien spaceship.

82
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:52,944
Wait a minute.

83
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:54,113
W-what are you talking about?

84
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:56,033
It's all fake Morty...
all of it.

85
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:59,875
Nanobotic renderings, a bunch
of crazy fake nonsense, Morty.

86
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,722
I couldn't say so until
we got in the shower.

87
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:03,007
They won't monitor us in here.

88
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:04,593
Monitor us?! W-who?!

89
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,096
Zigerion scammers, Morty...

90
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,270
the Galaxy's most ambitious,
least successful con artists.

91
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:11,524
You know, it's lucky for
us they're also really

92
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,649
uncomfortable with nudity.

93
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:13,820
Aw, come on, Rick.

94
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:15,157
If everyone's just
gonna be insane today,

95
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,286
at least let me be
insane with Jessica.

96
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,329
I can't let you do that, Morty.

97
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:19,206
Give it to me!

98
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,083
No!

99
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:21,002
You give it to me!

100
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:22,922
G-g-give it! No, Rick!

101
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,402
Oh, God, Sir!
They're still naked!

102
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:34,947
Ugh.

103
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:37,285
Well, check every five Quintons
and tell me when they're not.

104
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:39,582
I think we should
make Kevin look, sir.

105
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,667
What?! No!

106
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,128
W-w-why would you even say that?

107
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:44,258
Uh, sir, we have
a situation over here.

108
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:45,886
If there's a wiener on that
monitor,

109
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,473
I swear to god, Stu...

110
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:49,477
something is drawing a
lot of processing power.

111
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:50,729
Oh, wait. No wonder.

112
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,193
There's another real
human in the simulator.

113
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:55,532
Okay, Jerry...
big pitch meeting.

114
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:56,742
Make-or-break time.

115
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,830
You can do this.

116
00:03:58,831 --> 00:03:59,873
How did this happen?!

117
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,377
Where's the
Abductions Department?

118
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:04,007
Hey, man, Abductions just
follows the acquisition order.

119
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:05,510
Don't put this on Acquisitions!

120
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:08,141
We only acquire humans that
haven't been simulated!

121
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,938
Well, simulations doesn't
simulate anybody that's been

122
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:13,151
abducted, so oh, I see!

123
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:14,529
Oh, oh!
It was no one's fault.

124
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:15,781
Oh, okay.

125
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,033
I'm sorry.
Well, then, problem solved.

126
00:04:17,118 --> 00:04:18,162
Oh, wait... no.

127
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:20,207
There's still another
human in here!

128
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,626
Who is he?

129
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,213
Rick's son-in-law,
Jerry Smith.

130
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:26,094
So far, he hasn't noticed
he's in a simulation.

131
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:28,746
Well, cap his sector at 5%
processing,

132
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,937
keep his settings on auto, and
we'll deal with him later.

133
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,150
Rick Sanchez is the target.

134
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,741
Got to relax.

135
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,119
It's just a pitch.

136
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:39,455
Got to relax.

137
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:42,795
This is Earth radio.

138
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,509
And now, here's... human music.

139
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:50,728
Hmm. Human music.

140
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:53,275
I like it.

141
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:07,388
Rick!

142
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,473
Uhp, uhp, uhp!

143
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:09,850
Morty, keep your hands
off your ding-dong!

144
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,417
It's the only way
we can speak freely.

145
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:12,648
Look around you, Morty.

146
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,778
Do you really think
this world is real?

147
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:17,449
You'd have to be an idiot not to
notice all the sloppy details.

148
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:19,663
Look... that guy's putting
a bun between two hot dogs.

149
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:20,790
I don't know, Rick.

150
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:22,335
I mean, I've seen people
do that before.

151
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,741
Well, look at that old lady.

152
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:25,383
She's... she's walking
a cat on a leash.

153
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,387
Uh, Mrs. Spencer does
that all the time, Rick.

154
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:29,809
Look, I-I-l don't want to
hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty!

155
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:30,978
She's an idiot!

156
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:31,938
All right, all right, there.

157
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:33,190
W-what about that, Morty?

158
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:35,028
Okay, okay, you got me on that one.

159
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:36,238
Oh, really, Morty?

160
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:37,783
Are you sure you haven't
seen that somewhere

161
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:38,744
in real life before?

162
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,079
No, no.
I haven't seen that.

163
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,126
I mean, why would a
pop tart want to live inside

164
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,545
a toaster, Rick?

165
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,009
I mean, that would be, like, the
scariest place for them to live.

166
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:47,136
You know what I mean?

167
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,461
You're missing the point, Morty.

168
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,395
Why would he drive a smaller
toaster with wheels?

169
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:53,000
I mean, does your car look like
a smaller version of your house?

170
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,108
No.

171
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:55,194
So, why are they doing this?

172
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,364
W-what do they want?

173
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,532
Well, that would be
obvious to you, Morty,

174
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:58,858
if you'd been paying attention.

175
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,336
We got the President of the
United States in here!

176
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,258
We need 10cc of concentrated
dark matter, stat, or he'll die!

177
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:08,304
Concentrated dark matter?

178
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,016
They were asking
about that in class.

179
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,770
Yeah, it's a special fuel I
invented to travel through

180
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:13,482
space faster than anybody else.

181
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:15,736
These Zigerions are always
trying to scam me out of my secrets,

182
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:18,367
but they made a big
mistake this time, Morty.

183
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,246
They dragged you into this.

184
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,415
Now they're gonna pay!

185
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:23,061
What do you...
w-w-what are we gonna do?

186
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:25,047
We'll scam the scammers, Morty.

187
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:27,845
And we're gonna take them for
everything they've got.

188
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,559
National Apple Farmers of America,

189
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:32,729
welcome to our Ad Agency.

190
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:34,733
I'm Jerry Smith.

191
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:36,864
All right.

192
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,241
I'll just... get to the pitch.

193
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:42,291
Um, simple question, gentlemen,
what are apples?

194
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,711
Excuse me.

195
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,506
Ahh.

196
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,598
What are apples?

197
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:52,270
Apples are food.

198
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,859
And... when do we need food?

199
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:56,821
When we're hungry.

200
00:06:57,991 --> 00:07:00,954
With that, I give
you your new slogan!

201
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:04,462
Well, say something!

202
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:05,547
Do you like it?

203
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:06,674
Yes.

204
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,760
You do?

205
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,803
Yes.

206
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,432
So... I sold it?

207
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:12,436
I sold the idea?

208
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,522
Yes.

209
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,192
Oh, my god! Thank you!

210
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:17,154
Thank you.

211
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,240
You're welcome.

212
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,668
Hey!

213
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,129
I just sold my first pitch!

214
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:27,802
Slow down! Lookin' good.

215
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:28,971
My man!

216
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:32,895
Hello.

217
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,191
Guess who just sold
the apples campaign.

218
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:36,903
Who just sold
the apples campaign?

219
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:38,365
Me!

220
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,079
I guess it wasn't a rip-off
of "Got milk?" after all.

221
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:42,958
Guess someone was wrong.

222
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:44,127
Yes.

223
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,672
Well, all is forgiven,
because right now,

224
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,039
I've got an erection the size
of an East coast lighthouse,

225
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:50,256
and I'm coming home to share
it with my beautiful wife.

226
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,099
Okay.

227
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:51,976
Wait... really?

228
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,894
Yes.

229
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,732
Yes! See you in 10 minutes!

230
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:55,817
Hey!

231
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,404
I'm going to make
love to my wife!

232
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:58,823
Lookin' good.

233
00:07:58,908 --> 00:07:59,700
Slow down!

234
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:00,660
My man!

235
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:03,458
Aw, geez, Rick.

236
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,211
I-I don't know if I
like this plan, you know?

237
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:08,134
I mean, crowds,
t-t-t-they have a tendency

238
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:09,260
to make me really nervous.

239
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:10,389
Morty, relax.

240
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:12,143
It's just a bunch
of 1s and 0s out there.

241
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:13,437
You're gonna be fine.

242
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,689
Just follow my lead.

243
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,276
Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

244
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:20,619
Uh-oh, Morty.

245
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:23,792
This crowd looks too small for
one of our famous rap concerts.

246
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:25,712
I don't think we can
perform our new song,

247
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,008
"The Recipe for
Concentrated Dark Matter,"

248
00:08:28,094 --> 00:08:29,220
for a crowd this tiny.

249
00:08:29,304 --> 00:08:30,806
You got that right, Rick.

250
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,942
Now that's more like it!

251
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:37,654
Morty, here we go.

252
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:40,618
Let me hear everybody
say "Hey-oh!" yeah!

253
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,416
All the ladies say, "Yeah!"

254
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:46,755
Everybody over 30,
do this with your hands!

255
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,428
Everybody with a red shirt,
jump up and down!

256
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:02,413
Mm. Mm. Mm.

257
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:03,958
Yeah, don't move.

258
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,254
Mm, mm, mm, mm!

259
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,631
Mm!

260
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:10,429
Yo, everyone whose first name
begins with an "L"

261
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:13,143
who isn't Hispanic, walk in a
circle the same number of times

262
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:15,857
as the square root
of your age times 10!

263
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:19,991
Run, Morty!

264
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:21,285
Before the system reboots!

265
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,832
Yeah! You like that?

266
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,920
Now who's unremarkable?

267
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,464
You hungry for apples?

268
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,180
Are you hungry... for... apples?!

269
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,819
Oh, my God.

270
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:40,742
That's the best sex
I've ever had in my life.

271
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:45,042
It's... it's... too good.

272
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,339
I don't deserve this, Beth.

273
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:49,510
I'm a fraud.

274
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:50,595
Oh, man, Rick!

275
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:51,889
W-w-w-where we running to?

276
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,226
Out of the simulation, Morty.

277
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,230
Normally, the chamber
operates like a treadmill,

278
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:57,076
with the virtual world
disappearing behind us

279
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,113
and being rendered in front
of us as we move through it,

280
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:02,160
but while it's frozen, Morty,
we can get to...

281
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,873
the edge.

282
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:04,958
Here we go.

283
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:05,877
Holy crap!

284
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:06,962
Come on, Morty.

285
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:10,636
Sir, they're over the edge.

286
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:11,805
Yes, they are.

287
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:14,812
Just... as... planned.

288
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,699
Oh, this is going to
be such a mindfuck!

289
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:25,083
Keep your eyes peeled for the
central processing room, Morty.

290
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:26,836
That's how we're gonna
scam these idiots.

291
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:29,258
So, hey, why do these aliens
keep coming after you, Rick,

292
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:30,745
if you're so
much smarter than them?

293
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,405
It's an obsession
for them at this point.

294
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:34,310
The Zigerions have
been trying to outsmart

295
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:35,605
me for years, Morty.

296
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:37,692
Every time they do,
I'm one step ahead of them.

297
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:38,819
Aha!

298
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,988
Here we go.

299
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,204
Grab as many processors
as you can carry, Morty.

300
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,665
These guys aren't good at much,

301
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:46,962
but they're reallygood
at making these chips.

302
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:49,884
I've got so many,
l can barely hold them all.

303
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:51,972
Look at...
look at this.

304
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:53,057
Oops. l dropped one.

305
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,435
Don't worry about it, Morty.

306
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,938
There's plenty of them,
you little goofball.

307
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,694
Come here, Morty!
Oh, l gotcha!

308
00:10:58,778 --> 00:10:59,654
Come on, quit it, Rick!

309
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:01,032
Quit it!

310
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:03,036
Nothing wrong with just a
little bit of horseplay every

311
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,665
now and then, little fella.

312
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,649
Wow. What do you know?

313
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,069
Huh. That was easy.

314
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:21,574
Totes malotes, dawg.

315
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,785
Just kind of hard to believe,
you know?

316
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,246
Believe it, Morty.

317
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,543
And once again, I'm flying away
with everything l can carry,

318
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:29,048
and the Zigerions
got nothing of mine.

319
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:36,553
Mr. Marklevitz,
do you have a...

320
00:11:36,606 --> 00:11:37,733
minute to talk?

321
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:39,194
Yes.

322
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:40,864
Look, I'm a fraud.

323
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:42,409
I mean, let's face it...

324
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,914
"Hungry For Apples" is just
a rip-off of "Got Milk?"

325
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,209
It's almost identical.

326
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:47,503
Yes.

327
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:48,797
Okay.

328
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:50,050
I deserve that.

329
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:53,431
Umm... I guess...
I'll just pack up my desk.

330
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:54,726
Yes.

331
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,153
Oh, my God.

332
00:12:00,238 --> 00:12:02,784
Wait. You know what?! No!

333
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:04,871
The milk people don't
have a patent on

334
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,834
simple rhetorical questions!

335
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:09,381
There's not even a single word
in "Hungry For Apples" that's

336
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:11,260
shared by "Got Milk?"

337
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:13,180
It's a completely
different slogan.

338
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,559
It's different!

339
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:16,563
And I shouldn't be fired.

340
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:18,275
I should be promoted!

341
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,600
- Yes.
- Yeah!

342
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:20,612
Wait. Really?

343
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:21,698
- Yes.
- Yes!

344
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,326
I mean, I'm...
it may be derivative,

345
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,205
but it's the most successful
campaign to come out of this

346
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,291
agency in a long time.

347
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,711
Yes.

348
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,715
I-I'm not saying it should win
an award for commercials,

349
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,802
but it could certainly be
nominated for an award

350
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:33,764
for commercials specifically
about apples,

351
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:35,476
like... an Appley or something.

352
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:36,562
Yes.

353
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:37,689
Is there really an
award called the Appley

354
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:38,900
for Apple-Related ad campaigns?

355
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:40,028
Yes.

356
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:41,322
- Could we nominate me?
- Yes.

357
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:43,159
Holy crap!

358
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,466
Get in, Morty.

359
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,137
I'm gonna be able to use
these processors to make some

360
00:12:53,223 --> 00:12:54,933
real important science stuff.

361
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,690
Huh.

362
00:12:58,775 --> 00:12:59,944
I thought l entered
the code right.

363
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,755
Wha... well, what's this?

364
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,302
W-what could this possibly be?

365
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:14,975
Because it looks like
you're inside a simulation...

366
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,897
inside a simulation.

367
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:19,525
You're still on the ship.

368
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,153
Game-day bucket go boom.

369
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:23,742
Sir, the, uh, doctor's
appointment to examine the

370
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:25,913
discoloration on your
butthole flaps was...

371
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:27,333
Too loud, Cynthia.

372
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:28,585
Too loud and too specific.

373
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,671
Uhh...

374
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:32,677
We've known how to make
concentrated dark matter

375
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:34,724
for a long time.

376
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:40,234
But now we also know the code to
your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez!

377
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,825
All your most valuable
secrets will now be ours!

378
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:45,579
Uh, yeah, until I get home
before you and change the

379
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:47,166
combination,
you bunch of idiots!

380
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,585
That is why you're
never getting home.

381
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:49,796
Get them!

382
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:56,267
Run, Morty!

383
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:05,328
Oh, my God!

384
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:22,864
Ow!

385
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:33,136
L got to tell you, this morning,

386
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,701
l didn't even know
this award existed.

387
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:36,225
Now I'm holding one.

388
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,604
And... um...

389
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:42,446
look, I want to say that today
was the best day of my life...

390
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,663
but... the truth is, it's...
it's more meaningful than that.

391
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:47,748
My man!

392
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,042
Yes. Thank you, sir.

393
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,596
I... am... finally complete!

394
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,107
My... my... my... my man!

395
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:04,533
Aah!

396
00:15:04,618 --> 00:15:05,869
What the hell?!

397
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:10,378
No.

398
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:11,464
- Jerry?!
- Dad!

399
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:12,926
What are you doing here?

400
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,094
W-why are you
dressed like a waiter?

401
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,305
Screw it.
We don't have time.

402
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,182
Come on.

403
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,685
No!

404
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:27,247
Ohhhhh!

405
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:30,503
Aah!

406
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:52,465
Yes! Yes! Yes!

407
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:01,609
Oof!

408
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:04,239
Man up, Jerry!

409
00:16:04,324 --> 00:16:05,701
I may need you to
work the lasers.

410
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,230
Oh, man!
They're hot on our tail, Rick!

411
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:22,276
I guess they really do have
concentrated dark matter.

412
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:23,863
Well, you know how to make it,
too, right, Rick?

413
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:24,948
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,327
Uh, check the engine room.

415
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:29,082
We just need Cesium, Plutonic
Quarks, and bottled water.

416
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:32,589
It's all here, Rick!

417
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:33,675
Wow, Morty.
Lucky break.

418
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,928
Grab that bucket.

419
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:38,184
Okay, two parts Plutonic Quarks,
one part Cesium.

420
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:39,395
Okay. Uh-huh.

421
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,902
All right.

422
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:44,489
Now empty the water bottle
into the bucket and pour

423
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:47,578
it all into the fuel tank so we
can get the hell out of here!

424
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:48,744
What are you doing, Morty?!

425
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,791
There's no time!

426
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,100
Oh, no.

427
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,310
What the...

428
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:00,397
No!

429
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,786
Oh, my God, Rick.

430
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:09,540
How dumb are you?

431
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:11,294
You're inside a simulation...

432
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,381
of a simulation...

433
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,179
inside another giant simulation!

434
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:20,396
W-We never had the recipe for
concentrated dark matter.

435
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,066
But we do now!

436
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:23,778
We do now, sucka!

437
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,991
You simulated my
grandson's genitalia?!

438
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:28,496
Y-Y-You bunch of
diabolical sons of bitches!

439
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,876
Kevin fought real hard to
supervise that project.

440
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,963
You said you weren't
gonna tell anyone!

441
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:34,842
I'm never gonna live
this down, am I?

442
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,221
All right. Okay.
All right, great. Wonderful.

443
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,765
You win.
Can we go home now?

444
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,477
I don't know.
Can you?

445
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:40,437
Ha! Nice.

446
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:42,107
Okay, okay.

447
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,153
Show this gullible
turd to his shuttle.

448
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:45,531
I'm done with him.

449
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:46,534
Oh, wait.
Let me get a picture.

450
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,038
Aww. Look at his face.

451
00:17:49,122 --> 00:17:51,325
He's trying to figure out if
he's in a simulation still.

452
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,337
Are you, Rick?

453
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,714
Are you?

454
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:56,136
You're not.

455
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:58,182
Or are you?

456
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:03,109
Oh, a-and, by the way, l don't
have discolored butthole flaps.

457
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:04,529
That was part of the simulation.

458
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:05,698
Oh.

459
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:07,242
Uh, sir, should I cancel
that appointment, then?

460
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:08,787
Yeah! Of course you should!

461
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:11,126
No, keep it.

462
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,491
Move it up, actually,
if you can.

463
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,600
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it.

464
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:20,394
So what if the most meaningful
day of your life was a

465
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:22,941
simulation operating at
minimum capacity?

466
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:24,403
You know what, Rick?

467
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,699
Those guys took you
for a ride, too.

468
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:28,828
You should try having a little
respect for the dummies of the Universe,

469
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:30,707
now that you're one of us.

470
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,210
Maybe you're right, Jerry.

471
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:34,006
Maybe you're right.

472
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:37,722
All right, everybody.

473
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:41,271
Two parts Plutonic Quarks...

474
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:43,567
One part Cesium...

475
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:47,116
A-and listen,
I'm sorry for yelling earlier.

476
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:49,579
I-I couldn't ask
for a better staff.

477
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:53,003
I love you guys,
and I love all your families.

478
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:56,218
And the final ingredient...

479
00:18:58,683 --> 00:18:59,767
Whoa!

480
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:01,854
What the hell?!
W-what happened back there?

481
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:04,485
Why don't you ask the smartest
people in the Universe, Jerry?

482
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,364
- Oh, yeah.
- You can't.

483
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:07,784
They blew up.

484
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:49,328
So...

485
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:50,914
what do you think?

486
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:52,709
You're fired.

487
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:53,921
Wha...

488
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:57,010
But t-this idea was tested in a
state-of-the-art simulation.

489
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,722
Well, then, it was
a terrible simulation.

490
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,308
Get out.

491
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:07,115
Man, how does a guy like that go
home and have sex with his wife?

492
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:08,826
Hey, Morty.

493
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,744
What?

494
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:10,831
Hey, little buddy.

495
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:12,667
H-h-how you doing
in here right now?

496
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:14,630
Aw, geez, Rick.
What are you doing, man?

497
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,091
Y-y-you're a
good kid, Morty.

498
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,178
Y-you're a real l-little
c-character, Morty.

499
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:19,515
Oh, boy.

500
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,145
You know, l had a really
rocky road today, M-Morty.

501
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,275
You're my little friend,
aren't you?

502
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,698
We had some good times together,
huh, M-Morty?

503
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:29,828
We... you're a real
true hero out in the field.

504
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:33,042
You're a Li... you're a real
trooper, huh, M-M-Morty?

505
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:34,288
Have you been drinking, Rick?

506
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:35,548
I really appreciate you, Morty.

507
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:36,967
O-okay, cool.

508
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:38,721
A-all right, Rick...
you little son of a bitch!

509
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,641
Y-y... are you a simulation?!

510
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:42,020
Huh?! Are you a simulation?!

511
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:43,564
No! No! No!

512
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:44,817
You little son of a bitch!

513
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,530
L-I-I'm sorry, Morty.

514
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:48,825
Y-you're a good...
you're a good kid, Morty.

515
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,994
Geez!

516
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:51,163
Y-you're a good...
you're a good kid.

517
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:52,333
Oh, my god!

518
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,006
W-W-What the hell?

519
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,092
What a life.

520
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:00,265
Did you get any of that?

521
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,186
It's a good-a show!
