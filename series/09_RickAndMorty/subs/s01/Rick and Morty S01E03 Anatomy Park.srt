00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:40,087
Mmm.

4
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,675
Jerry, you are really
giving it to this ham.

5
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:46,389
Um, Merry Christmas.

6
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:47,767
Hello?

7
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:49,645
My parents are coming over
for the first time in years.

8
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,774
Can we stow the
gadgets and look alive?

9
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,650
Alive?

10
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:53,736
For your parents?

11
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:54,738
Mm, good one.

12
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,323
Hey, man! You "Hey, man!"

13
00:00:56,408 --> 00:00:58,286
This holiday is about humanity.

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,972
You know, I thought it was
about being born half-god or something.

15
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:01,834
Whatever.

16
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:04,129
All electronic items are going
in the stocking... now.

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,759
Dad, I'm not
giving you my phone.

18
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:09,221
Put it in the stocking, Summer,
or I'm joining Facebook.

19
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:11,893
A-ho, ho, ho, everybody.

20
00:01:11,977 --> 00:01:13,098
More like
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."

21
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:13,897
What is this?

22
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:14,815
My parents are coming!

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,901
Calm down, Jerry.

24
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:17,102
This is Reuben, an old friend.

25
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,362
Pearl Harbor.

26
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:19,615
I check in on him once a year
and give him a little

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,036
medical evaluation.

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,913
Aww!

29
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:25,167
Dad, that is so sweet!

30
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,753
Yeah, it is.

31
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:27,713
I don't get it.

32
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:29,132
Korea.

33
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:30,718
Don't worry about your
C-Christmas, Jerry.

34
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:32,722
I'll be with Reuben in
my workshop while you guys are

35
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:35,352
having another day in
Phil Collins' proverbial paradise.

36
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:36,312
Huh.

37
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,396
You think you know a guy.

38
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,526
Okay, there's my parents.

39
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,364
Now, remember...
no TV, no phones, no laptops.

40
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:44,201
We are connecting this Christmas,

41
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:46,664
like old-school
Jews on a Saturday.

42
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:47,833
Hey, hey!

43
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,085
Merry Christmas, son.

44
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,587
Uh, hi.

45
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:51,547
Can I help you?

46
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:52,882
Jerry, this is Jacob.

47
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:54,209
Didn't you get our text message?

48
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,220
No!

49
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:56,347
You must be Jerry.

50
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:57,724
That's a fine-looking apron.

51
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:58,852
Williams-Sonoma?

52
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:00,187
I wish!

53
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:01,398
But thank you.

54
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:03,527
So, you're a...
friend of the family?

55
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:06,699
Uh, the way we see it,
he's a part of the family.

56
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:08,244
Wow.

57
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:11,124
After your father's brush with
cancer and losing your uncle,

58
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,504
we looked at life and wondered,
how have we spent it,

59
00:02:14,589 --> 00:02:16,383
and how do we spend
the rest of it?

60
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:18,136
What are we going to
be when we die...

61
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,390
A list of fears and questions

62
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,478
or a collection
of real experiences?

63
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:25,691
Holy crap.
Joyce, that's amazing.

64
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:27,904
Then Jacob came into our lives,

65
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:30,199
and... we're learning
to live again.

66
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,285
All three of us.

67
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:34,123
Cool.

68
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:34,999
Eggnog?

69
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:36,293
Now we are talking!

70
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:38,172
This man's got the apron
and the eggnog, huh?

71
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:41,970
Hi, Joyce. Leonard.

72
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:42,931
Hello, there.

73
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:43,890
Merry Christmas, man.

74
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:45,135
Morty, a moment of your time?

75
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:47,104
He's in bad shape, Morty.

76
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:48,308
Aw, geez, Rick.
What'd you do?

77
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:49,317
Gee, thanks, Morty.

78
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:51,082
W-w-what kind of monster
do you think I am?

79
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:52,948
I-I-I'm sitting here trying
to save the guy's life.

80
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,033
I need your help.

81
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:56,120
I want you to find
Dr. Xenon Bloom.

82
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:57,331
He'll know what's going on.

83
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:00,044
Uh, w-w-w-where...
where do I find Dr. Bloom?

84
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:01,296
In Reuben.

85
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,462
Reuben, Minne... Minnesota?

86
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:03,926
Reuben on the table, Morty.

87
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,349
Look, I-I-I I don't
have time for you to wrap your

88
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:08,810
little walnut around everything.

89
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:10,354
Just hold your breath
until the process is over

90
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:11,648
or your lungs will collapse.

91
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:12,733
What proc...

92
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:17,492
Hey, Dad, where's Morty?

93
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:18,536
He's busy.

94
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:23,168
Morty, can you hear me?

95
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:24,045
Head north.

96
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,131
Rick, where am I?

97
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:26,800
Depending on my aim,

98
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:28,261
you should be just
south of the entrance.

99
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:29,638
Entrance to what?

100
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:30,807
Welcome, Morty.

101
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:31,726
Welcome...

102
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,399
to Anatomy Park!

103
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,652
It's a little business venture
I've been cooking up on the side

104
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:40,950
with Dr. Bloom... an amusement
park inside a human body.

105
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:43,038
Science isn't ch...
cheap, Morty.

106
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,832
This should really help
put a dent in the overhead.

107
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:45,959
Oh, my God!

108
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:47,336
This is insane!

109
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:48,756
Spleen Mountain?

110
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,551
Bladder Falls?
Pirates of the Pancreas?

111
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:51,677
You got a problem
with that last one, Morty?

112
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,431
Huh? No, no.

113
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:54,850
I'm just reading 'em out loud in
the order that I'm seeing 'em.

114
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,935
Okay. All right.

115
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,229
If I sounded a little defensive,

116
00:03:57,314 --> 00:03:59,149
it's because Pirates of the
Pancreas was my baby.

117
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,485
You know, I got...

118
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,113
I got a lot of pushback
when I pitched it, Morty.

119
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,639
I guess I'm still
a little defensive.

120
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:04,993
Let's just find Dr. Bloom,
all right?

121
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,871
I-I'm picking up a distress
signal in the liver, Morty.

122
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,792
Proceed to the liver.

123
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:14,468
Arriving at...

124
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,305
liver.

125
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,390
Ow!

126
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,601
Mind the gap.

127
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:22,900
It's really scary in here, Rick.

128
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:24,152
The liver's under maintenance.

129
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:25,154
Reuben's seen some
rough years, Morty.

130
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,698
Don't judge.

131
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:28,284
You don't agree to have a theme
park built inside you if your

132
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,870
life's going great.

133
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,627
Rick! It's a monster!

134
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:34,921
No, no, no. Morty.

135
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:37,760
The only monster here is
alco ...holism.

136
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,596
That is an animatronic werewolf.

137
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,934
Who are you?!

138
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:42,894
Answer me!

139
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:44,104
Where'd you come from?

140
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,590
My... my... my
grandpa Rick sent me!

141
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:46,693
Poncho!

142
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:48,070
That's quite enough.

143
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,948
Morty, that's Poncho.

144
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:51,492
This is Roger and Annie.

145
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:55,876
And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.

146
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,241
Hey, Bloom, it's Rick.

147
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,714
What the hell's going on here?

148
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:03,263
I don't know why, but the entire
security system has shut down,

149
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:06,895
and I'm afraid...
the exhibits are unlocked.

150
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:08,147
Exhibits?

151
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,860
Anatomy Park's greatest
attraction, young man,

152
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,447
isn't the music
or the food or the...

153
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,033
Pirates of the Pancreas.

154
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:15,535
Watch it.

155
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,125
It is, first and foremost, a
living museum of humanity's most

156
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,588
noble and ferocious diseases.

157
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:22,506
Diseases?

158
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:24,259
Hey, doc.

159
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:25,595
I got news for you.

160
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:29,268
Your living museum is
officially a wild safari!

161
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:31,648
Hepatitis A!
Run!

162
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:40,037
Oh, the food goes
in your mouth, girl.

163
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:42,291
Oh, Jacob.

164
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:44,712
L-I'm sorry, Jacob.

165
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:47,039
I-I guess I'm still confused
about the precise nature and

166
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:49,846
origin of your relationship
with my parents.

167
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:51,683
Are you, like, uh... are you,
like, their caretaker?

168
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:52,768
Is that what it is?

169
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,092
We can go into
detail later, son.

170
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,985
Now, wait.
Th-there's no point to secrecy.

171
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:59,029
Let's all live and die honestly.

172
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:01,701
Your mother and I have shared
40 years of each other, mind,

173
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:04,497
body, and soul, and when
minds and souls are joined

174
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:08,087
for eternity and when eternity
is at the door,

175
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:11,427
it's an invitation to let go of
the body and an opportunity

176
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,806
to share and experiment.

177
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,517
Dad, please.
What are you saying?

178
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,522
Whatever it is, it's beautiful,
Leonard, and we support you.

179
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:20,776
Hey, speak for yourself,
because it

180
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:23,072
sounds like you're about
to say Jacob is your lover.

181
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:24,325
No, no, no, no, no, no.

182
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,495
Jacob is your mother's lover.

183
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:28,707
I watch them...

184
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,880
Sometimes from a chair and
sometimes from a closet,

185
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:34,176
almost always dressed
as Superman.

186
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:38,391
Oh.

187
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:40,854
Jerry, this ham has got
to be all you, right?

188
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:42,607
It's incredible.

189
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:46,197
Happy human holiday, Dad.

190
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,534
Aah!

191
00:06:50,372 --> 00:06:53,710
Hepatitis won't follow us
into the respiratory system.

192
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:56,924
That's strange.

193
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:58,218
Airflow is down 20%.

194
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:00,305
So, the brain isn't
getting enough oxygen.

195
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,393
That's why security's offline.

196
00:07:02,477 --> 00:07:04,354
Well, I guess we
better check it out.

197
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,904
Hey! Wait for me!

198
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:11,032
Put that back on!

199
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,497
If we got up to the
Bronchial Catwalk,

200
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:15,958
we could look for a blockage.

201
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:17,252
I'll go.

202
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,216
Don't be a hero, kid.

203
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
I'm not.

204
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:22,595
I'm doing it because it's fun.

205
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,807
We shouldn't be here.

206
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,353
Whatever you do, do not
fire that thing in here.

207
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:29,357
We must save Reuben.

208
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,068
This is my life's work.

209
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:33,517
It's all right, my dear.

210
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:37,246
Nearly all human lungs contain a
strain of these bacteria,

211
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,792
but the scar tissue
keeps them...

212
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,753
dormant.

213
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,006
Morty, get down!

214
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:44,091
Whoa-ho-ho!

215
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:45,343
Whoa!

216
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:47,681
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

217
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,648
Oh, what are those things?

218
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,028
Tuberculosis...
coming in fast!

219
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:56,572
Not faster than a bullet!

220
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:57,866
Aah!

221
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,951
No!

222
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:00,245
Do you know what you've done?!

223
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:03,835
Whoa!

224
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:06,882
Get to the digestive tract!

225
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:07,967
He's coughing!

226
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:10,889
Whoaaaa!

227
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,350
Don't let me die!

228
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:13,770
Just take a deep breath, Reuben.

229
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:16,023
You're not gonna die!

230
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,067
What's your name?

231
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:18,152
My name is...

232
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,573
Alexand...

233
00:08:24,623 --> 00:08:26,458
Rick... R-R-Reuben's got
tuberculosis!

234
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:27,627
Oh, great work, Morty.

235
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,381
Okay, I'll just
cure it and then...

236
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,010
Okay.

237
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,263
Well, I can't cure death.

238
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,390
This is bad, Morty.

239
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:35,595
You're trapped in a dead man.

240
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,061
Listen, if the situation
keeps darkening,

241
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:39,899
do yourself a favor and pop by
Pirates of the Pancreas.

242
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:42,237
Obviously I'm biased,
but I think it's great, Morty.

243
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,365
It's a bunch of
pirates running around a

244
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,536
pancreas.

245
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,955
We don't whitewash it,
either, Morty.

246
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,542
I mean, the pirates
are really rapey.

247
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:52,463
The top priority is to get,
you know, you guys out of there,

248
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,592
but I'm just saying, if that
becomes impossible, please,

249
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:56,220
you gotta treat yourself.

250
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:57,556
Oh, man.

251
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,350
W-w-w-what is
that horrible smell?

252
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:00,561
You mean the Panda Express?

253
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:03,482
Kidding. I-I'm kidding.

254
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:06,822
The body is beginning to
constrict and fill with gas.

255
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:08,533
We're inside a corpse, my boy.

256
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,662
Anatomy Park is doomed.

257
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:11,998
Forget about the park, doctor!

258
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,208
How do we get out?

259
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,296
The digestive tract is the
evacuation route.

260
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,798
Get it?

261
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:19,011
There's an emergency station in
the colon with a ray that can

262
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,472
enlarge us all.

263
00:09:20,556 --> 00:09:21,974
Everybody, head for the colon!

264
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,104
Now I'm taking orders
from a 12-year-old boy?

265
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:29,821
Morty, the scar sacs containing
the tuberculosis were sabotaged.

266
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,992
This disaster was an inside job.

267
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,995
Keep your eye on Annie.

268
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,166
She was written up several times

269
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,296
by her manager
at the Churro Stand.

270
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,133
Intestines are ahead to the
left, then to the right,

271
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:43,680
then left, ET cetera.

272
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:48,187
Hey, just so you know,
l-I-I'm actually 14.

273
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:49,649
So, you know...
what?

274
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,193
Not 12.

275
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,654
Okay.

276
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:55,283
You know, because
he just said I was 12.

277
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:56,661
Oh.

278
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,247
Good for you.

279
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,000
Oof. Ugh. Morty.

280
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:01,336

Shh!
I hear something.

289
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,850
Don't move.

290
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:36,690
Gonorrhea can't see
us if we don't move.

291
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,113
Wait, I was wrong.

292
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:41,279
I was thinking of a T. Rex.

293
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,830

Doc, didn't you say that the

296
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,094
Yes. Why?

297
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:55,057
Kid, you're a genius.

298
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,142

This is what you wanted.

311
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:28,867
I get it, Beth.

312
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,070
Be careful what you wish for.

313
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,746
I'm being punished
for taking your iPad.

314
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:32,707
What?

315
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,209
Jerry, let that stuff go, okay?

316
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,754
I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier.

Let's just be here.

00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:39,803
Summer!

319
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:40,889
Ethan?

320
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,890
What are you doing here?

321
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:42,933
I've been texting you for hours!

322
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:44,144
What the hell?!

323
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:45,229
I don't have my phone!

324
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,690
I'm doing a human holiday!

325
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:49,486
Well, did you even consider
how that might make me feel?!

326
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,739
How you feel?!

327
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:53,076
Why is everything always
happening to you?!

328
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,997
Summer, do you have a boyfriend?

329
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,541
Yeah, do you, Summer?

330
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:57,418
I don't know, Ethan.

331
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:58,629
Do I?!

332
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:01,508
Jerry, no disrespect,
but you really need to

333
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:03,511
connect more with
your family, man.

334
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,851
I should be able to access the
backup generator to get the

335
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,228
growth ray online.

336
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:10,274
If it works, we'll be
regular-sized in a few minutes.

337
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,440
I just hope Reuben's not in a
room with white carpets

338
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:13,488
or upholstery.

339
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,909
What the hell is that?

340
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:17,119
The Sphincter Dam.

341
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,956
We built it when Reuben became
incontinent,

342
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,836
but it was not designed
to hold a corpse load.

343
00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:23,923
I've almost got it.

344
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:25,677
Everybody, move
inside the circle.

345
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:27,888
Poncho?

346
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:29,182
What is this in your backpack?

347
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:31,520
That's Bubonic plague!

348
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:33,045
What are you doing
with that, Poncho?

349
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:34,985
Everybody, get back!

350
00:12:35,027 --> 00:12:36,445
Poncho, you son of a bitch!

351
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,827
You released the tuberculosis
so you could steal from me?

352
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,246
That's right, baby.

353
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,458
A lot of people
would pay top dollar

354
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:45,420
to decimate the population.

355
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:46,839
I'll take the highest bidder...

356
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:48,676
Al-Qaeda, North Korea,

357
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,889
Republicans, Shriners, balding
men that work out,

358
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:54,895
people on the internet that are
only turned on by cartoons

359
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,606
of Japanese teenagers...

360
00:12:56,691 --> 00:13:01,114
Anything is better than working
for you, you pompous, negligent,

361
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,414
iTunes-gift-card-as-a-holiday-
bonus-giving mother...

362
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,171
Come on!

363
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:13,303
Aah!

364
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:14,180
Get off!

365
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:18,854
You guys!

366
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:20,190
It's gonna burst! Go!

367
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,150
Go, go, go!

368
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:24,782
My foot is stuck.

369
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:26,326
No! It's okay!

370
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,413
It's okay. Just go.
Tell my family I love them.

371
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:30,458
They may be hard to find 'cause
my wife kept her last name and

372
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,984
she made the kids take it, too,
so, I-I don't know, you can...

373
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,466
No!

374
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,142
Let me ask you a question,
Ethan.

375
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:42,020
Where's the anger
coming from, man?

376
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:44,776
From Summer being a total bitch!

377
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,700
Where's the anger coming from?

378
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:53,290
My brother... took me fishing
once ...in the bushes...

379
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,920
I can't... I can't...

380
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:58,633
He made me feel like a girl!

381
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:01,012
I... he made me a girl!

382
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,185
He didn't make
you anything, man.

383
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,063
You are who you are.

384
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:07,817
She is who she is.

385
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:10,154
Now, you go to her... brand-new.

386
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,239
Come here, right now.

387
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:12,199
Oh, my God.

388
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,535
I'm so sorry, Ethan!

389
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,662
I love you!

390
00:14:14,746 --> 00:14:15,581
I love you so much.

391
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:18,627
Um...

392
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:20,464
You did it again, cubbie.

393
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:21,632
Come here.

394
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:28,395
No! Stop! I hate this!

395
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,442
Well, Christmas doesn't revolve
around what you hate, son.

396
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:32,777
Well, then I hate Christmas!

397
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:34,197
Enjoy being human!

398
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,909
You guys are gross and lame.

399
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:38,078
My name's Reuben Ridley.

400
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:41,210
You're inside me right now, but
by the end of this journey...

401
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:42,295
Whoopsie.

402
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:44,590
I'll be inside all of you.

403
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,594
My story begins during

404
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,015
the dot-com crash
in the early '90s.

405
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:52,730
You can put your fingers
wherever you want.

406
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:54,733
Morty, you want to put it
on mute or something?

407
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:56,152
I'm... I'm trying to
concentrate.

408
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,238
Uh... Rick?

409
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,490
Not now, Jerry.

410
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:00,202
I've got much,
much smaller fish to fry.

411
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:02,038
I wanted to say I'm sorry
I ever judged you.

412
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:04,292
Right now,
you're my sanest relative.

413
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:06,045
Relative.

414
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,256
R-relative size!

415
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,051
Jerry, hand me a scalpel
and a bundle of dynamite.

416
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:10,387
Morty, can you get
to the left nipple?

417
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:11,722
Are you kidding?

418
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,308
I'm hoping I can get
to both of 'em, Rick.

419
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:15,186
No, Morty, I'm talking about
Reuben's left nipple.

420
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,971
We need to get
to the left nipple!

421
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,655
The body is decaying.

422
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,992
The arterial transit
system is useless.

423
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:24,870
We can try the service shuttle.

424
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:26,436
It's connected to
the skeletal system.

425
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,460
That's why we call
it the bone train.

426
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:31,590
Would you like to ride
the bone train, Miss?

427
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:33,218
If it'll get us out of here.

428
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,805
How about you, Morty?

429
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,768
Would you like to
ride the bone train?

430
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,062
Why are you doing this bit?

431
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,773
We're gonna die! Let's go!

432
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:45,782
Well... I can see you're busy.

433
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,201
Merry Christmas, Rick.

434
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,085
There's no autopilot.

435
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,300
One of us will have to stay
here and operate it manually.

436
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,524
- Uh, well...
- No, you're... you're right.

437
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:04,649
I-It was a dick move for me
to even pause like that.

438
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:05,777
This is all my fault.

439
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:07,154
You go on.

440
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,200
What the hell is that?

441
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:10,535
E. Coli outbreak.

442
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,453
Hurry!

443
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,753
Wait, there is an autopilot.

444
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,422
Wait!

445
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:19,008
It's okay! Never mind!

446
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:21,889
I wanted to sacrifice
myself anyway!

447
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,656
They're... they're chewing
through the doors!

448
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:29,151
We're in the areola, Rick...

449
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:32,449
almost to the nipple, but we're
also in a really bad situation!

450
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,202
I'm almost there, Morty!

451
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,641
Reports from all over the
country have been coming in

452
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,020
about what appears
to be a giant,

453
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:52,359
naked man over the
continental United States.

454
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,822
We now go to Tom Randolph
in New York. Tom?

455
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:58,078
Well, the eyes aren't twinkling
and the dimples aren't merry,

456
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:02,085
but I'm standing under a
nose like a 70-mile cherry.

457
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,296
Thank you, Tom.

458
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,967
Let's go now to Eric McMahan
in Los Angeles.

459
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:07,971
We've got feet here on
the West Coast, Bill...

460
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:09,432
giant feet,

461
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,477
even relative to the
giant man's size,

462
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:14,231
and you know what
they say about that.

463
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:16,319
Well, if the old adage is true,

464
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:21,495
one can only wonder what's going
down in the Rocky Mountains.

465
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:23,624
Wha?

466
00:17:33,643 --> 00:17:35,061
Oh my God, the track!

467
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,438
It's Hepatitis A!

468
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,982
Aaaah!

469
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:54,929
The nipple hole.

470
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:57,183
It's beautiful.

471
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:05,030
Oh, no!

472
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:06,533
Holy crap!

473
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,916
Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!

474
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:17,052
Um... wait...

475
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,599
Did we have some sort of
relationship with him?

476
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,101
I think they're just like that?

477
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,979
I think they're just good guys.

478
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:25,483
Oh. Huh.

479
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:26,902
Where's Dr. Bloom?

480
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:28,531
I'm sorry, Rick, but he's dead.

481
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:29,658
God damn it, Morty.

482
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,494
I ask you to do one thing!

483
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:43,205
Jerry doesn't know
what he's missing.

484
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:44,559
He'll come around, Beth.

485
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:46,145
Christmas is a special time.

486
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:48,274
It has funny ways of
bringing families together.

487
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,693
I don't know, Jacob.

488
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:52,824
Jerry got an invitation to be
alive today, and he rejected it.

489
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:55,371
I don't know if
our marriage will...

490
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:00,546
It's raining blood!

491
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:01,757
Oh, shit. Find Jerry.

492
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:02,841
Oh, God.

493
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,595
Jerry!
It's all right.

494
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,598
The TV says there's
nothing to worry about.

495
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:09,521
The giant, naked sky
Santa has exploded.

496
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:13,068
Blood and chunks of viscera are
raining down on the country.

497
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,072
Everything should be fine.

498
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,201
Oh, yes.

499
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:18,578
Dad, can I have my phone back?

500
00:19:18,663 --> 00:19:20,081
A sure, sweetie. Here.

501
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:22,502
Everybody, take a device.

502
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:24,130
It'll help you relax.

503
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:25,215
This is nice.

504
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,592
Yeah.

505
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:29,472
Look, I guess we really learned
something this Christmas, Jacob.

506
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:30,641
No, we didn't, Dad.

507
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:32,562
No, we didn't.

508
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:35,608
Too bad about Dr. Bloom.

509
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:36,861
He was a genius...

510
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:39,198
the only man capable of
creating a new Anatomy Park.

511
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:41,786
Actually, I studied
Dr. Bloom's work.

512
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:44,082
I-I-I-I believe I have the
knowledge necessary to create

513
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,877
an entirely new,
much safer park.

514
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:46,962
What about...

515
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:48,298
Pirates of the Pancreas?

516
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:50,802
I think it was one of the
most underrated attractions.

517
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:53,390
Boo-yah!
Hold your breath.

518
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:55,561
Hey, w-w-what the hell,
Rick?!

519
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:57,564
What the hell, man! I liked her!

520
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:59,526
I really had something
going there, Rick!

521
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:00,862
Yeah, so I heard.

522
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:02,615
You dodged a bullet,
Morty... trust me.

523
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,410
Puffy vagina.

524
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,746
W-what's wrong with that?

525
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,290
That doesn't sound
like a problem to me.

526
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,542
I don't know.

527
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:09,711
Come on,
let's get some stuffing.

528
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:11,172
I'm starving.

529
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:14,470
Oh, unbelievable.

530
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:16,848
We got... we got a bunch of
robot, computer people,

531
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,604
sitting around with their faces
stuffed into computer screens.

532
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:21,732
Do you guys realize that
Christ was born today?

533
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:25,280
Jesus Christ, our savior,
was born today.

534
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:26,950
Are... are... are
you people even human?

535
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,995
What kind of Christmas is this?

536
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,929
Hey, Rick? Rick, can you hear me?

537
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:02,805
Loud and clear, Annie.

538
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,891
Great.

539
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:05,686
We're also on with Alejandro,
our Chief Imaginarian.

540
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,813
Hey, Rick.

541
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,108
Natalie Jacobs and Chris Deseter
from Microscopic Marketing,

542
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,821
Zack from Organ Concepts,
and Jamie from New Media.

543
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:13,199
Hey, everybody.

544
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:14,242
Hi, how's it going? Hi, Rick.

545
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:15,787
So, Pirates of the Pancreas.

546
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:16,872
Yeah. Talk to me.

547
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:18,375
Hey, Rick.
It's Alejandro speaking.

548
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,631
Um, so, we asked ourselves,
internally...

549
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:22,966
we asked ourselves over here,

550
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:24,970
"Okay, what does
a pancreas do?"

551
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:27,642
and the answer was,
"Does it make pirates?"

552
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:29,770
No, it makes insulin, you know?

553
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,523
So, we're starting with a new...

554
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,986
Those guys are inside me, huh?

555
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:35,739
Like, building a park?

556
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:37,743
Those guys are inside you
building a piece of shit, Ethan!

557
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:39,579
They're inside you building
a monument to compromise!

558
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:41,290
Fuck 'em.

559
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:42,376
Fuck those people.

560
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:44,964
Fuck this whole thing, Ethan.

561
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:46,509
Cool.

562
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:47,593
And who pays me?

563
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:50,808
Did you get any of that?

564
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,727
It's a good-a show!
