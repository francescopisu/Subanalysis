1
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,745
Run!

2
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:41,211
Morty, do it!
Hit the button now!

3
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:42,295
I can't do it, Rick!

4
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:43,631
They're my parents and sister!

5
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:45,092
Morty, I already told you...
it's not your family!

6
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:47,053
They're clones from
an alternate reality,

7
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:48,723
possessed by demonic alien
spirits from another

8
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:49,891
dimension's future!

9
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:51,352
Do you need a mnemonic
device or something?

10
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:52,646
Just hit the button, already!

11
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,112
Morty, please,
I love you, sweetheart.

12
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:58,489
Oh!

13
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:06,502
Good work, Morty.

14
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:10,718
You know, Th-Th-these demonic
alien spirits are really valuable.

15
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:12,012
You okay, Morty?

16
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:14,056
I told you not to
trust that tuna.

17
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,517
I just killed my family!

18
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:16,723
I don't care what they were.

19
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:17,854
I don't know, Morty.

20
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,315
Some people'd pay top dollar
for that kind of breakthrough.

21
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:20,400
You know what, Rick?

22
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:21,527
That's it!

23
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:23,155
I'm done with these
insane adventures!

24
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,408
That was really traumatizing!
I quit! I'm out!

25
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:26,994
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:28,915
Come on, Morty, don't...
don't... don't be like that.

27
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,584
The Universe is a crazy,
chaotic place.

28
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:31,961
You're the one that's
crazy and chaotic!

29
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:34,256
Adventures are supposed
to be simple and fun.

30
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,342
Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah.

31
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:36,464
Yeah, that... that... that's

32
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,430
real easy to say from the
sidekick position.

33
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,475
But... but, uh, how about
next time you be in charge,

34
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,562
and then we'll talk about
how simple and fun it is?

35
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:43,855
Seriously, Rick?

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,984
Y-y-you'll... you'll
let me call the shots?

37
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:47,278
Okay, yeah, fine.

38
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:48,804
But let's make it interesting,
Morty.

39
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:51,911
I-I-I-If your adventure sucks
and we bail halfway through it,

40
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,456
you lose the right to bitch
about all future adventures.

41
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,334
Plus, you have to do
my laundry for a month.

42
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:57,628
Okay, all right, tough guy!

43
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:58,880
But if my adventure's good,

44
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,383
I get to be in charge of
every third adventure!

45
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:01,468
Every 10th.

46
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:02,469
Deal. All right.

47
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,638
W-well, come on,
let's get going.

48
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:05,642
Dad, the dishwasher's
doing that thing again.

49
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,560
Washing dishes?

50
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:07,478
No. The opposite.

51
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:08,856
Can you fix it?

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,525
Grandpa Rick, can you help me
with my science homework?

53
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:11,526
Yeah... j-just don't do it.

54
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,903
Grandpa!

55
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:15,867
Hey, Rick, you got some kind of
hand-shaped device that can open

56
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:16,994
this mayonnaise jar?

57
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:18,246
Wow. Hat trick.

58
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,372
All right, Morty,
let's put a pin in this.

59
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,666
I got to help your
pathetic family.

60
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,752
Oh, that sounds like
something a chicken would say.

61
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:24,590
Bawk, bawk, bawk,
bawk, bawk, bawk.

62
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:25,758
Oh, Morty, you done
did it this time.

63
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,219
It's on.

64
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:29,385
I can't wait to watch your
adventure lay a huge fart.

65
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,100
As for you dingdongs...

66
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:33,186
This is a Meeseeks Box.

67
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:34,314
Let me show you how it works.

68
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:35,274
You press this.

69
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:37,068
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

70
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:38,154
Look at me!

71
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:39,531
You make a request.

72
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:41,537
Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's
stupid mayonnaise jar.

73
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,037
Yes, siree!

74
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,581
The Meeseeks fulfills
the request.

75
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,958
All done!

76
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:47,127
Wow!

77
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:48,588
And then it stops existing.

78
00:02:48,672 --> 00:02:50,174
Oh, my God, he exploded!

79
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:51,342
Trust me, they're fine with it.

80
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:52,594
Knock yourselves out...

81
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:54,388
Just keep your requests simple.

82
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:55,349
They're not gods.

83
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,559
All right!

84
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:57,853
G-get out of here now!
Everybody out of here!

85
00:02:57,938 --> 00:02:59,397
I got a bet to win!

86
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,109
So many possibilities.

87
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:03,403
My mind is racing.

88
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:04,649
If we're gonna use this thing,

89
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:05,866
which I'm not even
sure we should,

90
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,951
we need to keep it simp...

91
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,328
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

92
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:09,455
I want to be popular at school!

93
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,832
Ooh, okay!

94
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:12,377
Summer, what did I just...

95
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:14,421
Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

96
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:15,924
I-I-I want... I want to
be a more complete woman!

97
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:16,842
Beth!

98
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:18,929
Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!

99
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:21,475
You guys are doing it wrong.

100
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,480
He said "Simple."

101
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:26,900
Hey, there.
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

102
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:30,156
Mr. Meeseeks,
I would like to take

103
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:31,909
two strokes off my golf game.

104
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:35,665
Ooh, yeah! Can do!

105
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,959
Nailed it.

106
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:39,254
God, Morty, what a boring
start to an adventure.

107
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:41,633
I don't... w-w-w-why didn't we
just go to Kentucky?

108
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:43,929
Rick, this is a fantasy-type
world with creatures

109
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,640
and all sorts of fantasy things.

110
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,059
W-we're going on a quest, okay?

111
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,479
Can't wait.

112
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,232
Ahem. Excuse me!

113
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:55,031
We are two humble heroes
in search of adventure!

114
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,324
Oh, my God, so embarrassing.

115
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,994
At last! Two heroes!

116
00:03:58,078 --> 00:03:59,496
You must help us!

117
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:02,835
This village is terribly poor,
yet the giant that lives in the

118
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,880
clouds above has
untold treasures!

119
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,340
You know what?

120
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:09,929
I-I-I accept your call to
adventure, good sir, kind sir.

121
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,265
Come on, Rick.

122
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:12,601
There's a giant in the clouds!

123
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,561
Yeah.

124
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:15,064
Beginner's luck.

125
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:18,903
Ln conclusion, a friendship
with Summer Smith is the most

126
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:22,534
valuable and enriching
experience of your young lives.

127
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:24,871
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

128
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:26,207
Look at me!

129
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,125
Thank you!

130
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,586
Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it?

131
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,879
Yeah. Gene Vagina.

132
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:32,967
Listen, I'm in a bit of custody
thing with my ex and was wondering...

133
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:34,814
No, I'll G... I'll get
your info from Summer.

134
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,183
I got pregnant at 17.

135
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,187
I mean, I still put myself
through Veterinary School.

136
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:44,904
Yes, I'm successful,
but what if I hadn't...

137
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:48,494
I'm just saying,
somewhere along the way,

138
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:51,541
I lost that wide-eyed
girl from Muskegon.

139
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,627
She's still there, Beth.

140
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,004
Well, her waistline isn't.

141
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:59,554
Beth, having a family
doesn't mean that you

142
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:01,890
stop being an individual.

143
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:02,934
You know the best thing you can

144
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:05,104
do for people that
depend on you?

145
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:09,319
Be honest with them, even if
it means setting them free.

146
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:12,533
You're saying I
should leave Jerry.

147
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:17,124
I can't believe I'm finally
having this conversation.

148
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:26,306
More wine?

149
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:28,685
I think I've had enough.

150
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:36,406
Remember to square your
shoulders, Jerry.

151
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,201
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

152
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,835
That's okay.

153
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,671
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

154
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:47,591
Try again and
keep your head down.

155
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:48,843
Okay, well, which is it?

156
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,304
Square my shoulders
or keep my head down?

157
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:51,848
Well, it's both.

158
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,603
But most importantly,
you got to relax.

159
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,807
You know what, Mr. Meeseeks?

160
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,773
I don't think this is working.

161
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,192
I give up.

162
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,613
I'm sorry, Jerry,
but it doesn't work like that.

163
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:01,989
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

164
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:04,869
I have to fulfill my
purpose so I can go away.

165
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:06,038
Look at me.

166
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:08,083
Well, make yourself comfortable,
because I suck.

167
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,046
No, Jerry, I'm the one who
sucks!

168
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,883
Let me try something.

169
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:14,176
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

170
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:15,262
Look at me!

171
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:16,264
Hi, Mr. Meeseeks!

172
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:17,181
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.

173
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,684
Hi!

174
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,938
Can you help me get two strokes
off of Jerry's golf swing?

175
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,440
Can do!

176
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:23,943
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

177
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:25,737
Is he keeping his
shoulders squared?

178
00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:27,532
Ooh, he's trying!

179
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:34,669
All right, Morty.

180
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:36,672
W-w-we're in your
stupid giant's castle.

181
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:37,757
W-what do we do next?

182
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,883
Would you just relax, Rick?

183
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:40,428
All we got to do is find
the treasure room, okay?

184
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:41,930
It's nice and simple.

185
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:43,684
You know, I-I-I'm sorry
everything's going so

186
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:45,145
smoothly and adventurously.

187
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:48,692
Uh-oh, Morty.

188
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,017
Startin' to get a little hairy.

189
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,189
What do you want to do, boss?

190
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,031
Come on, hurry.

191
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:53,158
Behind this cookie jar.

192
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:56,830
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

193
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:58,374
Just give up, Morty.

194
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,626
J-J-J... this is game over.

195
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,837
I'll take us home right now.

196
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,796
You just say the word.

197
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:02,715
No way, Rick.

198
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:03,842
This is all part of it.

199
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:05,845
Adventures have conflict.
Deal with it.

200
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:08,098
I smell the blood of...
whoop!

201
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:10,102
Holy crap.

202
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:11,187
Oh, boy.

203
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,522
He looks pretty
bad down there, Morty.

204
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:14,735
Looks like he's bleeding out.

205
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,946
Oh, Jesus! Dale!

206
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:18,866
You sons of bitches!

207
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:20,118
- Oh, man.
- Uh-oh.

208
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:21,454
Hello, 911?

209
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:23,259
My husband has been
attacked by tiny people!

210
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,167
He's dying!

211
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,341
Hey, look, we get it.

212
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,760
You're little, you're down
on your luck, you think,

213
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:31,221
"Hey, he's a giant.

214
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:33,224
Why don't we break into his
home, rob him, and murder him?"

215
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:35,143
Th-Th... but that's
not how it went down!

216
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:36,938
Oh, well, it's going
down like that.

217
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,732
You're both going down like that.

218
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:41,112
Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really
showing me how it's done.

219
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:42,864
ReAl straight forward and fun.

220
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:46,453
Like, letting go of the
need to be popular is what

221
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:47,956
makes people like you.

222
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,627
The most important love you
can receive is from yourself.

223
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:53,424
Okay, Jerry, you got to
just choke up on the club!

224
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:55,385
Well, which is it,
choke up or follow-through?!

225
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:57,889
Aww, come on, Jerry,
we've been over this.

226
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,559
You know you got to do both!

227
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:02,147
This is as frustrating
for us as it is for you.

228
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,273
Don't tell me that!

229
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,608
That just puts pressure on me!

230
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,694
Just try to relax.

231
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,821
You try to relax!

232
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:08,407
Have you ever tried to relax?!

233
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:10,368
It is a paradox!

234
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:12,831
Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh?

235
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:14,250
Kind of a handful.

236
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:16,378
I can't imagine what you
two must be going through.

237
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,506
Our Meeseeks have been
gone for hours, Jerry.

238
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,842
You're kidding me.

239
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:21,553
Notice anything different?

240
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:23,222
I-I-I'm sorry. Hours?

241
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:25,101
Dad, mom is a beautiful woman!

242
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:26,269
Look at her!

243
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:27,438
You will lose her!

244
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:28,899
Uhh...

245
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:31,612
Hey, Jerry, you mind if we
get back to the task at hand?

246
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:34,408
Meeseeks don't usually
have to exist this long.

247
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,328
It's getting weird.

248
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:38,414
Order in the court!

249
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,125
Before the jury
reaches its verdict,

250
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,549
I just want to say that I
consider you both very guilty.

251
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:45,718
Oh, great adventure, buddy.

252
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:47,179
Rick and Morty
go to giant prison.

253
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:48,806
You know, if somebody
drops the soap,

254
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,144
it's gonna land on our heads
and crush our spines, Morty.

255
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:53,898
You know, I-i-i-it'll be really
easy to rape us after that.

256
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:55,108
We're gonna be okay, Rick.

257
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:56,236
How?

258
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,571
They took my portal gun.

259
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:59,097
This is an open-and-shut case,
Morty.

260
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:00,701
You know, w-w-w-what do you
think's gonna happen,

261
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:02,788
some magical angel's
gonna show up and then...

262
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:03,957
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

263
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,793
I smell the violation
of civil liberties!

264
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:08,339
Your honor, I'm from a
tiny-persons advocacy group

265
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,469
and I have here in my
hand a motion to dismiss.

266
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,875
These little men were never read
their giant rights and are

267
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:16,852
therefore Free-fi to Fo-home.

268
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:18,564
W-what the hell is
he talking about?

269
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:19,941
They're free to go,
is what I meant.

270
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:23,071
I-I-I'm deconstructing
our... our... our thing we say.

271
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:24,992
For giants. Nobody got that?

272
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,285
Whatever.

273
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,730
Oh, man, what did
I tell you, Rick?

274
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:29,206
We did it!

275
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,711
All right, Morty, looks like
the portal gun's still working.

276
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:33,088
You ready to head home?

277
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,340
Oh, yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you, Rick?

278
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:35,425
Well, you know what?

279
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:36,760
We're not bailing out just yet.

280
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:38,471
You know, w-we're gonna go
find some treasure or...

281
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,099
or something and...

282
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:41,685
and we're gonna bring
it to those villagers.

283
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,104
Morty, cut your losses.

284
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:44,523
This is obviously a wash.

285
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:46,109
Yeah, you were saying
that back...

286
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:48,822
back w-w-w-when we first got
arrested, but here we are,

287
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,450
you know, walking down
the courthouse steps.

288
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,415
Oh, boy, Morty.

289
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:56,620
Usually, walking down the
courthouse steps is the easy

290
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:57,879
part of the adventure.

291
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:59,131
What do you say, Morty?

292
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,468
I say give me a hand, sidekick.

293
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,519
Everybody shut up!

294
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:08,688
Let me try!

295
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,613
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

296
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,698
I'm going out.

297
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:15,784
Wait. What?

298
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,453
Well, you're busy.
I'm hungry.

299
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:18,872
I thought I'd go out.

300
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:20,792
Do you want me to be happy or do
you want me to be in prison?

301
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:22,237
Whoa, whoa, where
in the hell is...

302
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:24,339
I'll take you to dinner.

303
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:26,718
Hey, you know what?

304
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:27,929
It's hard being me, too.

305
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,473
I'll be right there.

306
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:32,268
Look, I've got a marriage
to keep together.

307
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:35,232
At this point, my golf swing is
more your problem than mine.

308
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:38,947
I can't take it anymore.

309
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:40,199
I just want to die!

310
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:41,283
We all want to die!

311
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:42,369
We're Meeseeks!

312
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:43,955
Why did you even
rope me into this?

313
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,499
'Cause he roped me into this!

314
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,920
Well, him over there,
he roped me into this!

315
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:49,339
Well, he roped me into this!

316
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:50,424
Well, what about me?

317
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:51,759
He... he roped me into this.

318
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:53,429
Well, that one over
there roped me into this.

319
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:54,931
Well, he roped me into this.

320
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:59,939
Yeah, Morty, this is the part
of the story everybody loves...

321
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,318
scaling down 650,000
oversized steps.

322
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:03,863
All right, okay,
y-you know,

323
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:07,118
if this was a story, this part
wouldn't be included, stupid.

324
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:09,330
Hey, Rick, w-w-w-w-w-what
do you know?

325
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,791
Look down there.

326
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:12,544
Looks like some kind of tavern
or something built right into

327
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:13,670
the side of the step.

328
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,592
Oh, wow, Rick.

329
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,386
Now, this is more like it.

330
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:20,932
Look, there's little
staircase-shaped people in here.

331
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:22,852
A-all kinds of crazy characters.

332
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:25,064
This place is great, you know?

333
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:26,859
It's whimsical and fun.

334
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:30,908
- What are you looking at, motherfucker?
- Easy, Rick.

335
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:32,117
Pay them no mind.

336
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:33,996
Those Stair Goblins
can be moody.

337
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,916
Now, what can I getcha?

338
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,220
We've got Skarlog Poppies,
Flurlow, Halzingers, Bloogies,

339
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:44,471
Juicy Time Babies.

340
00:11:44,556 --> 00:11:46,308
Yeah, yeah, yeah, h-how
about some scotch whiskey?

341
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:47,518
You got any of that around here?

342
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:48,645
Or just a bunch
of nonsense words?

343
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:49,730
Rick.

344
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:51,233
We'll have two Bloogies, please.

345
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:54,655
And, uh, we were wondering, is
there a faster way two heroes

346
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:56,032
could get down these stairs?

347
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,952
Y'all need to
ride down the stairs?

348
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:02,042
My name is Slippely-Slippery Stair.

349
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:05,130
I'll take you down
there for 25 shmeckels.

350
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:06,633
25 shmeckels?

351
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:08,219
I-I-I don't know how much...
I don't know what that is.

352
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:09,513
Is that a lot?
Is it a little?

353
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:12,476
That's exactly how much
I spent on my big fake boobies.

354
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:13,854
Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer.

355
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:15,773
I'll buy those boobies
for 25 shmeckels.

356
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:18,778
It's a tempting offer,
but I'm gonna have to decline.

357
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,364
Rats! What a shame.

358
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,909
Morty, your adventure's
in a spiral.

359
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:24,453
For real, man, time to pull out.

360
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:25,979
You keep heckling my adventure,
Rick!

361
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,000
You know why?

362
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:28,043
Uh, because it's lame?

363
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:29,212
It's because you're petty!

364
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:30,547
You know, h-how many times have

365
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:33,510
I had to follow you into some
nonsensical bull crap?

366
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:35,221
I always roll with
the punches, Rick.

367
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:36,515
Why can't you?

368
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,522
Look, I got to take a leak,
and when I come back,

369
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:41,608
I-if you haven't learned how to
lighten up, don't be here!

370
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,402
Whatever.

371
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:45,697
It's become clear...
look at me...

372
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:48,452
that if we concentrate all our
efforts on Jerry's

373
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:51,373
follow-through,
we will solve this problem.

374
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,542
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

375
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,086
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.
Look at me.

376
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:56,590
The only thing that's clear
is that choking up is

377
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,009
the one true solution.

378
00:12:58,093 --> 00:12:59,804
Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

379
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:02,433
I've been trying to help Jerry
for two days,

380
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:05,605
an eternity in Meeseeks time,
and nothing's worked.

381
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,066
I fear the worst.

382
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,570
Your failures are your own,
old man.

383
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,406
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.

384
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,201
I say follow-through!

385
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:14,411
Who's with me?!

386
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,875
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

387
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,002
Kill him!

388
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,223
How are you today?

389
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,892
I'm Mr. Jelly Bean.

390
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:28,978
Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean.

391
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,104
I'm Morty.

392
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:31,629
My grandpa and I
are on an adventure.

393
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,442
Nice. Is it a fun adventure?

394
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:35,028
I hope so.

395
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,907
But I'm starting to get nervous
that maybe it's gone a little

396
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:38,117
too far off the rails.

397
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:40,371
Isn't that what adventures do?

398
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:41,707
Hey, y-you know what?

399
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,791
You're right.

400
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:44,043
Everything's going fine.

401
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:46,631
I just got to relax
and go with the flow.

402
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:48,969
Yeah.

403
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,055
O-o-okay. Uh. B-bye.

404
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,933
Uhh, no, stay.

405
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:54,144
Go with the flow.

406
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,479
Stop.

407
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:56,857
Y-y-you're making me
really uncomfortable.

408
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,776
Stop fighting me.

409
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:01,614
- Just let this happen.
- Get off of me!

410
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,160
♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪

411
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,078
Whoo!

412
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:08,667
No! Stop! Please!

413
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:12,007
Stop being such a fucking tease,
you sweet little twat.

414
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:24,444
No! No!

415
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:26,322
Ow!

416
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:41,180
Everybody sto-o-o-p!

417
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:42,515
Look at me!

418
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:45,394
My brothers, nothing will be
accomplished by shedding

419
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,814
Meeseeks blood.

420
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:49,777
None of us can die
until our job is done.

421
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:51,154
The job can't be done!

422
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:53,032
We'll never get two
strokes off his game!

423
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,368
No, we won't.

424
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:57,373
But we will get all
strokes off his game.

425
00:14:57,457 --> 00:14:58,959
Where's he going with this?

426
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:00,044
What's he mean?

427
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,713
When we kill him.

428
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:07,598
Jerry, maybe it's time I take
that trip I always talk about.

429
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:09,059
Where would you go?

430
00:15:09,144 --> 00:15:10,269
I don't know, man.

431
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:12,940
Italy. Greece. Argentina.

432
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:16,445
Countries known
for their sexually aggressive men.

433
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,411
Did I tell you how much
I love your new haircut?

434
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:23,040
What the heck?

435
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,710
There he is!

436
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:29,176
Run, Jerry!

437
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:31,137
Aah!

438
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,184
Come on out, Jerry!

439
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,144
Guys, I'll choke up.

440
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:36,395
I'll follow through.

441
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,647
I'll do whatever you
tell me to do, okay?

442
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:40,360
Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.

443
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:44,367
Come on, Rick, quit SK...
stalling.

444
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:46,829
What do ya got?

445
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,248
Read 'em and weep, fellas!

446
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,167
Aw!

447
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,711
Oh, hey, Morty.

448
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,547
Listen, I'm really sorry about
all that stuff I said earlier

449
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:53,799
about your adventure.

450
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:55,427
I-I-I'm havin' a good time,
Morty.

451
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:56,512
It's not so bad.

452
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:57,597
Let's just go home, okay?

453
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:58,474
I'm calling it.

454
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,726
The adventure's over.

455
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,229
We can't leave now, Morty.
I'm on fire!

456
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:02,353
Look, I want to leave now.

457
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:03,732
You win the bet, okay?

458
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:05,610
Just give me the portal gun
and let's go, please.

459
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,536
Please, I just want
to go home. Okay.

460
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:12,622
Listen, Morty.

461
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:14,166
I just won a bunch of shmeckels.

462
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:16,712
Why don't we use 25 of them to
pay slippery stair here for a

463
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:19,007
ride back to the village, and
then we'll give the rest of the

464
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:20,333
shmeckels to the villagers, huh?

465
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:21,887
Really?

466
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:23,139
Sure, Morty. Yeah.

467
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:24,642
You know, a good adventure
needs a good ending.

468
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:28,732
Buckle up!

469
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:36,077
Meeseeks are not born into this
world fumbling for meaning,

470
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,454
Jerry!

471
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,961
We are created to serve a
singular purpose for which

472
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:43,214
we will go to any
lengths to fulfill!

473
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:46,177
Existence is pain
to a Meeseeks, Jerry.

474
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:49,016
And we will do anything
to alleviate that pain.

475
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
Just ask...
Aah!

476
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,895
What's your name, ma'am?

477
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,107
S-Samantha. Please, mister!

478
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:55,860
Give him what he wants!

479
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:59,491
Innocent people are going
to die because of me.

480
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:02,329
Why am I so mediocre?

481
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,500
Jerry, turn around.

482
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:06,669
Straighten your back.

483
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:07,755
Bend your knees.

484
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:08,631
Bend them.

485
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:09,924
Square your shoulders.

486
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:12,387
Take a deep breath.

487
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:15,267
I love you.

488
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:17,145
I'm counting to three, Jerry.

489
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,382
What the fuck is going on?

490
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:37,720
He's got it!

491
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,889
Th-Th-that's a lower
handicap stro-o-ke!

492
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,357
Excuse me.

493
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:46,026
I'm a bit of a
stickler Meeseeks.

494
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:48,238
What about your short game?

495
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:50,534
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

496
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:53,414
What about your short game?!

497
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:00,801
Ooh, nice!

498
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:07,478
I think we'll take
our food to go.

499
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:08,396
No, you won't.

500
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:09,481
The police are coming.

501
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,067
You have so many
questions to answer.

502
00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:12,361
Fair enough.

503
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,790
Thank you, kind sir.

504
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,251
Our village is saved!

505
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,087
You are both true heroes!

506
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:26,593
Oh!

507
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:27,678
Good job, Morty.

508
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:29,264
Looks like you won the bet.

509
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:31,518
Thanks, Rick,
but I don't know if I should.

510
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:33,104
You know, you were
right about the Universe.

511
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:35,107
It's a crazy and chaotic place.

512
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:36,985
Well, you know, maybe that's
why it could use a little

513
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:38,990
cleaning up every
now and then, you know.

514
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:41,034
This one's wrapped up neat
and clean because we did it

515
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:42,453
Morty style.

516
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:45,875
Oh! Heroes, we would like to
introduce you to our beloved

517
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,505
King so that he may
thank you personally.

518
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,549
Uh, no, I-it's cool.

519
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:52,135
Rick. Portal. Hurry.

520
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:00,440
Aah!

521
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,327
So...

522
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,372
you still thinking
about taking that trip?

523
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,041
Jerry, look.

524
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,585
We don't have a
perfect marriage,

525
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,171
but I'm not going anywhere.

526
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,674
When we were in that freezer,

527
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:18,178
I realized the Meeseeks are like
the guys I went to High School with...

528
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:21,767
willing to say anything
to "complete their task."

529
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:23,395
Was I one of those guys?

530
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:26,608
The difference is you didn't
disappear afterwards.

531
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:27,902
Well...

532
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:29,280
I got you pregnant.

533
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:31,199
Yeah...

534
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:32,953
What the hell happened
to this place?

535
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:34,581
Uh, your Meeseeks Box happened.

536
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:36,917
They went crazy when they
couldn't take two strokes off

537
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:38,003
Jerry's golf game.

538
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,297
He felt terrible.

539
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:41,216
Hey, it's not my fault
that Jerry's an idiot.

540
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:42,552
Dad!

541
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,346
Is there anything you can
do to clean this place up?

542
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:46,349
Well, you know, I do
have a fleeseeks box.

543
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,019
No. No more boxes.

544
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,229
What?

545
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,607
It just has a mop and
some floor wax in it.

546
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,651
Wubba lubba dub dubs!

547
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:55,072
Yeah! That's my new thing!

548
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:56,074
I'm kind of like
what's his name...

549
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:57,492
Ar-Arsenio.

550
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:59,663
Isn't that... it's what Arsenio
used to say on his show.

551
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:01,541
Wobble gobba lop bops!
Right?

552
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:02,501
See you next week, everybody.

553
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:03,586
I don't get it.

554
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,104
Sir, I think you're going
to want to see this.

555
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:42,943
We found it inside a lockbox
inside King Jelly Bean's closet.

556
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,197
We have to tell the people.

557
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:47,659
Wait.

558
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,078
Destroy it.

559
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,635
Our people will get more from
the idea he represented than

560
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,681
from the Jelly Bean
he actually was.

561
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:04,228
Did you get any of that?

562
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:06,148
It's a good-a show!
