1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:05,463
Cynthia...

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,174
Oh, my god. No. No.

3
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:09,177
- I told you.
- Hold on.

4
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:11,180
Will you please...

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,973
not marry me?
I chose Veronica.

6
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:14,226
- What?!
- Yes!

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,228
- Hold it.
- Why would he chose Veronica?

8
00:00:16,313 --> 00:00:17,897
Because he loves her?

9
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:19,316
Well, if it's any
consolation, Summer,

10
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:21,151
none of it mattered
and the entire show was stupid.

11
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:22,612
Okay, I've got an idea, Rick.

12
00:00:22,697 --> 00:00:24,615
You show us your concept
of good TV,

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,534
and we'll crap all over that.

14
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:29,204
Thought you'd never ask.

15
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:30,456
Hey.

16
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,459
Oh, cool. ls that
crystallized xanthanite?

17
00:00:32,544 --> 00:00:34,420
It conducts electrons
across dimensions.

18
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:36,339
20% accurate as usual, Morty.

19
00:00:36,424 --> 00:00:37,842
The important thing being,

20
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:39,802
I just upgraded
our cable package

21
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:42,055
with programing from every
conceivable reality.

22
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,641
Wait. Does that mean
we get Showtime Extreme?

23
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:45,435
How about Showtime Extreme
in a world

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,104
where man evolved from corn?

25
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:49,149
We're not so different.
We're both corn of action.

26
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:51,152
Yeah, but one of us
is dead corn!

27
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:52,528
Boring.

28
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:54,573
Summer you just
spent three months

29
00:00:54,615 --> 00:00:56,492
watching a man
choose a fake wife.

30
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:58,497
So, what, it'd be better
if the people were corn?

31
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,122
Jerry, you don't get it.

32
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:03,376
This is infinite TV
from infinite universes.

33
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:05,171
Look.
This shit is delicious.

34
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:08,216
A movie about a guy eating shit.

35
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,261
A violent antique show.

36
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:11,679
It's a pleasure to have you.

37
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:13,599
The pleasure's all mine.

38
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:15,685
Letterman from a timeline
where Jerry's famous.

39
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,396
- Wait!
- What in the hell?

40
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,023
I agree. Where is this going?

41
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:20,609
No, the other thing!
Go back.

42
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:22,152
Really? All right, fine.

43
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:24,655
Glen, this court order says
you can't eat shit anymore.

44
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,658
All right, Jerry.

45
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:28,495
When you're right, you're right.

46
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:29,871
Now I'm hooked.

47
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,793
Coming up next on
"Shmloo's the Shmloss,"

48
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:05,420
Shmlony has a nightmare.

49
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:08,466
- Shmlantha! Shmlona!
- Amazing... a dimension

50
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:10,469
where all proper nouns
begin with "Shmla."

51
00:02:10,554 --> 00:02:12,972
Shmla... Shmlangela?

52
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,641
Shmlonathan?

53
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:16,936
All right, that actually
got old pretty quick.

54
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,480
Rick!

55
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:20,732
Will you please go back
to me on "David Letterman"?

56
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:22,485
Infinity's a big number, Jerry.

57
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,988
I don't remember the channel.

58
00:02:24,072 --> 00:02:25,573
Ah! Go back! Go back!

59
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:28,076
- Geez.
- You speak the true-true.

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,413
Oh, my god.
Dad's in "Cloud Atlas"!

61
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:33,208
I'm in "Cloud Atlas"!
What's "Cloud Atlas"?

62
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,836
Sometimes,
small true-true

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,838
different than
the big true-true.

64
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,382
How is this possible?

65
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:40,677
Infinite timelines,
infinite possibilities,

66
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,642
including a timeline
where Jerry's a movie star.

67
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:44,223
Look, you guys are
getting excited

68
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:45,976
about the wrong aspect
of this device.

69
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,645
Wha... look at this.

70
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,316
And now, another quick mystery.

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,160
I just want to know who
could have done this.

72
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,154
It's a travesty.
I did.

73
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,573
See this knife
and all the blood on it?

74
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:56,866
Here's my fingerprints.

75
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,244
Guilty. I sentence you
to life in prison.

76
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,830
Here's another quick mystery.

77
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,832
- My mother's dead.
- And I killed her.

78
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,543
Here's the weapon, and cuff me.

79
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:05,836
Thank you very much.

80
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:07,464
Guilty.
Sentenced to murder.

81
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,843
- Here's another.
- I'm the killer.

82
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:13,513
Oh, wow, that one was
really quick, wasn't it?

83
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,059
Now, who wants to watch
random, crazy TV shows

84
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:18,312
from different dimensions,
and... and then who wants

85
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:20,899
to narcissistically obsess
about their alternate selves?

86
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:23,569
I want to obsess about myself.

87
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:25,572
Here, these scan
your retinas

88
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,575
and let you view
parallel timelines

89
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,452
through genetically matching
versions of your eyes.

90
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:30,537
Go fetch.

91
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:32,414
- This is so cool.
- Ladies first.

92
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,625
I'm proud of you, Morty.

93
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,753
Hey, man, I don't give
a crap about myself, Rick.

94
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:37,672
Let's watch some
crazy stuff, yo.

95
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:39,007
I'm Ants in My Eyes Johnson,

96
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:41,344
here at Ants in My Eyes
Johnson's electronics.

97
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:43,430
I mean, there's so many ants
in my eyes.

98
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,476
And there's so many TVs,
microwaves, radios, I think.

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,772
I can't... I'm not 100% sure
what we have here in stock

100
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,483
because I can't see anything.

101
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:54,320
Our prices, I hope,
aren't too low.

102
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:56,991
Check out this refrigerator,
only $200.

103
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:58,867
What about this microwave?
Only $100.

104
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:00,495
That's fair.

105
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,957
I'm Ants in My Eyes Johnson.
Everything's black.

106
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,418
I can't see a thing.

107
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:06,420
And also, I can't feel
anything, either.

108
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,547
Did I mention that?

109
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,134
But that's not as catchy as
having ants in your eyes,

110
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,762
so that always goes, you know,
off by the wayside.

111
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,931
I can't feel.
It's a very rare disease.

112
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:16,642
All my... all my nerves,

113
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:18,979
they don't allow
for the sensation of touch,

114
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:20,940
so I never know what's going on.

115
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:22,942
Am I standing, sitting?
I don't know.

116
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:25,487
Are we sure we wanna look
at our own alternate lives?

117
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:27,824
You're right. Maybe we should
just play Yahtzee.

118
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:29,952
Give me those.

119
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,038
What do you see?

120
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:34,042
Whiteness...
pure whiteness.

121
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,713
You're my best friend,
Jerry Smith.

122
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,174
I love doing cocaine with you.

123
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:42,261
Whoa, I love doing cocaine
with you, too, Johnny Depp.

124
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:45,348
Haven't we spent
enough time on you?

125
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:48,102
I'm performing surgery...

126
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,105
but not on a horse...
on a human.

127
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,732
That's great, Beth.

128
00:04:51,816 --> 00:04:53,985
You always wanted to be
a real surgeon.

129
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,988
I am a real surgeon.

130
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:57,699
Uh... Summer's turn.

131
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:59,701
Finally.

132
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:01,704
I don't see anything.

133
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,457
Well, you should select
a different timeline.

134
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,462
I mean, if your father and I
achieved our dreams,

135
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:06,961
there's a chance
you weren't even born.

136
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:09,465
That came out wrong.
That came out very wrong.

137
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:13,053
Fine. I'll find a world where
you bothered to have me.

138
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:18,227
We're playing Yahtzee.

139
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:19,979
Yahtzee's fun.
We love Yahtzee.

140
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:21,649
It's a fun game
for fun families.

141
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,901
Hey, could I get those goggles
back for a second?

142
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:27,323
It's a 45-horsepower
with antilock brakes,

143
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:30,494
and it's the official car
of "Mr. Sneezy 3D."

144
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:33,289
It's the brand-new Sneezy XL.

145
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,168
The horn, when you honk it,
makes a sneeze noise.

146
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,339
It's polite, it's right,

147
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:44,388
and it's Sneezy, Deezy
MC... Deluxe.

148
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,057
I'm Mr. Sneezy.

149
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:48,602
Huh, seems like TV
from other dimensions

150
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:50,522
has a somewhat looser
feel to it.

151
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:53,359
Yeah, it's got an almost
improvisational tone.

152
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:55,988
It's in theaters now.
Coming this Summer.

153
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:58,491
Two brothers in a van,

154
00:05:58,576 --> 00:05:59,951
and then a meteor hits.

155
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:02,204
And they ran as fast
as they could

156
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:04,082
from giant cat monsters.

157
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,001
And then a giant tornado came.

158
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:11,383
And that's when things got
knocked into 12th gear.

159
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,262
A Mexican armada shows up,

160
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:17,601
with weapons made
from t-tomatoes.

161
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:19,854
And you better
bet your bottom dollar

162
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:23,609
that these two brothers
know how to handle business

163
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:27,572
in "Alien Invasion
Tomato Monster

164
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:28,908
Mexican Armada Brothers,

165
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:30,994
Who are Just Regular Brothers,

166
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:33,247
Running in a Van
from an Asteroid

167
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:37,294
and All Sort of
Things: The Movie."

168
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,297
Hold on. There's more.

169
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:41,717
Old women are coming,
and they're also in the movie.

170
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,595
And they're gonna come

171
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:46,139
and cross attack
these two brothers.

172
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:47,725
But let's get back
to the brothers,

173
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:50,729
because they're...
they have a strong bond.

174
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,023
You don't want to know
about it here,

175
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,691
but I'll tell you one thing.

176
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:55,945
The moon... it comes crashing
into Earth.

177
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,906
And what do you do then?

178
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,701
It's two brothers and...
and they're gonna...

179
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:02,704
It's called "Two Brothers."
"Two Brothers."

180
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,874
It's just called
"Two Brothers."

181
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,126
Holy crap.
I am winning a Nobel prize.

182
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,296
Come on. Time's up.

183
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,007
I'm taming a lion.

184
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:13,135
No, wait.
There are film cameras.

185
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,764
I might be a lion tamer
in a movie.

186
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:17,474
You get the idea.
I work with lions.

187
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,064
Ohh, we're not playing Yahtzee!

188
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:24,359
We're playing
Chutes and Ladders.

189
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:27,071
Seems like when I exist,
life gets a little more...

190
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,740
I don't know... predictable?

191
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:30,784
When two people create
a life together,

192
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,788
they set aside their previous
lives as individuals.

193
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:35,416
Give me a break.

194
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,169
We're not heroes for having
unprotected sex on prom night.

195
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:39,505
Oh, I get it.

196
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,674
Now that you know
you could have had it better,

197
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:44,094
you resent me
for holding you back.

198
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:46,681
Well, now that we know you think
the tables are turning,

199
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,606
we know you thought
there were unturned tables.

200
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,562
What are you talking about?

201
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:52,230
All this time, you've been
thinking, "what if that loser,

202
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:54,525
Jerry, hadn't talked me out
of the abortion?"

203
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:56,611
- Um...
- Well, now you know.

204
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:57,738
You'd be a doctor.
Whoop-DE-do.

205
00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:59,407
You'd also be drinking wine
alone

206
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:01,660
in a house full of exotic birds.

207
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:04,497
And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht,
banging Kristen Stewart.

208
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:06,917
You thought about
getting an abortion?

209
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:08,377
Everyone thinks about it.

210
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:10,463
Obviously, I'm the version of me
that didn't do it,

211
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:13,468
so you're welcome.
Yeah, you're welcome.

212
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:15,137
Yeah, thank you guys so much.

213
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,848
It's a real treat to be
raised by parents

214
00:08:16,932 --> 00:08:18,600
that forced themselves
to be together

215
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:20,311
instead of being happy.

216
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:22,481
Hey, do we have any
wafer cookies?

217
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:23,815
Mmm!

218
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,984
Oh, boy.

219
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,486
Looks like you guys have been
checking out alternate lives

220
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,331
and realizing you don't
have it as good, huh?

221
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:29,573
That's too bad.

222
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:31,298
You know, me and Morty
are having a blast.

223
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,912
We just discovered a show
called "Ball Fondlers."

224
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,872
I mean, I don't want to rub it
in or anything,

225
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:37,877
but you guys clearly backed
the wrong conceptual horse.

226
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,314
- I'm in heaven right now.
- The best day of my life.

227
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,067
So, now what do we do?

228
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,272
That show "Ball Fondlers"
sounded kind of interesting.

229
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,906
- Dad!
- What?!

230
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,200
They're having fun in there.
What do you guys want from me?

231
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:03,203
Every family on this block
has to wonder

232
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:04,914
if they're together by choice.

233
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:06,792
Our family just has
interdimensional goggles

234
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:09,211
to show us for a fact
that we're not.

235
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,881
- Well, I'm leaving.
- You can't leave. You're 17.

236
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,467
Yeah, and I'm not pregnant.

237
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,430
I'm gonna have better judgment
than you guys had at my age.

238
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,891
I'm gonna move
to the southwest and...

239
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,062
I don't know, do something
with turquoise.

240
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:26,068
It's "Saturday Night Live,"

241
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:28,738
starring a piece of toast,

242
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:31,075
two guys with handlebar
mustaches,

243
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,996
a man painted silver
who makes robot noises,

244
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,831
Gar Ma Nar Nar,

245
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:38,543
three, um, um, um...

246
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,379
I'll get back to that one,

247
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,090
a hole in the wall

248
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:44,260
where the men can see it all,

249
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:48,557
and, returning for his
25th consecutive year,

250
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:51,979
Bobby Moynihan!

251
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:53,522
Interesting fun fact...

252
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:56,109
Moynihan and a piece of toast
hate each other.

253
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:59,113
Apparently, they've got some
real creative differences.

254
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,532
Hey, are you tired of real doors

255
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:02,201
cluttering up your house,

256
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:03,870
where you open them and you
actually go somewhere,

257
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:05,247
and you go into another room?

258
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:07,834
Get on down
to Real Fake Doors. That's us.

259
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,294
Fill a whole room up with them.

260
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:10,546
See, watch.
Check this out.

261
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,672
Won't open.

262
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:12,798
Won't open.

263
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:14,134
Not this one.

264
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:15,302
Not this one.

265
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:16,387
None of them open.

266
00:10:16,472 --> 00:10:18,097
Fakedoors.com is our website,

267
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:21,102
so check it out for a lot of
really great deals

268
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,398
on fake do-o-o-o-rs!

269
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,409
Hey, wait a minute, Rick.

270
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:33,869
I thought this was a commercial.

271
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,580
What's going on?
Relax, Morty.

272
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:39,335
Don't... don't worry about it.
Let's just see where this goes.

273
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,463
Step on it!
We all got places to be!

274
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,883
Son of a bitch.

275
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,513
Oh, that must be where he lives.

276
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:48,932
Okay.

277
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:52,562
Huh. He's making himself a sandwich now.

278
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,110
Hey, everybody.
So, this is my house.

279
00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:59,446
Just made a sandwich...
peanut butter and jelly.

280
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:01,366
Still here, still selling
fake doors.

281
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,492
What?

282
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,537
Oh, my god.
It's still the commercial.

283
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,540
We have fake doors
like you wouldn't believe.

284
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,918
What are you worried about?
Come get fake doors.

285
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:11,212
Call us up and order
some fake doors today.

286
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:13,090
Don't even hesitate,
don't even worry,

287
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,175
and don't even...

288
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:15,343
All right, I'm bored.
Change it.

289
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:17,179
Wait, wait, Rick.
Hold on, hold on.

290
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:18,389
That's our slogan.

291
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:20,684
See it on the bottom
of the screen below our name.

292
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,812
Here's another slogan
right below that one.

293
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:25,399
What are you worried about?
Come get fake doors.

294
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,402
Get in here quick, get out quicker

295
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,195
with an arm of fake doors in your arms.

296
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,699
Okay, okay, you can change it.

297
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:34,244
I hate Mamumanums-days,

298
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:36,748
and I really could go
for some enchiladas.

299
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:39,168
Hey, Rick, that's pretty cool.

300
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:42,088
It's just like Garfield, only
instead it's Gazorpazorpfield.

301
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:44,800
Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where
those sex robots came from?

302
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,845
Remember that whole thing?

303
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:48,848
Yeah. Hey, that's a pretty...
pretty...

304
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,391
That's true.
That's right.

305
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,062
Yeah. Let's watch some more
Gazorpazorpfield.

306
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,065
Hey, John.
It's me, Gazorpazorpfield.

307
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,901
Boy fuck you, John,

308
00:11:56,985 --> 00:11:59,655
you fuckin' dumb, stupid idiot.

309
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:02,659
Come on, Gazorpazorpfield.
Go easy on me, huh?

310
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:05,454
You dumb, stupid, weak,

311
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:08,583
pathetic, white, white,

312
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:10,920
uh... guilt...

313
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:13,340
white-guilt milquetoast

314
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:15,385
piece of human garbage.

315
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:16,749
Geez, Gazorpazorpfield,
that's...

316
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,347
you know, you're
pretty mean to me,

317
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:19,598
but that takes the cake.

318
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,267
I don't give a fuck.

319
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:23,562
I'm Gazorpazorp-fuckin'-field, bitch.

320
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:25,899
Now give me my
fucking enchiladas.

321
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,193
Hey, Rick, you know, did they
use Bill Murray for this?

322
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:29,737
Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

323
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:31,198
No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music.

324
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,866
In this reality,
he's still alive.

325
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,703
Oh, okay.
Was his name "Lorenzo Music"?

326
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,246
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

327
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,207
He also did the voice of that
one guy from "Ghostbusters,"

328
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,335
which is really strange
because it's the same character

329
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,545
Bill Murray played in the movie.

330
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,005
But then, when they
made the movie,

331
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,134
Bill Murray did the voice
of Gazorpazorp...

332
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:47,179
- or Garfield, I mean.
- That's pretty cool, Rick.

333
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:49,055
So all that happened
in this reality, too?

334
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,224
I don't know.

335
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:51,767
Just making conversation
with you, Morty.

336
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:53,228
What, you think
I'm a... I'm...

337
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:55,356
I know everything about
everything?

338
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,526
Did you really talk me
out of the abortion?

339
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,780
Well, we... we blew a tire
on the way to the clinic.

340
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:04,160
I think, in my head, I was
doing it all for the kids.

341
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:07,664
And now the first kid is going
to do something with turquoise.

342
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:09,792
Which is either
code for crystal meth

343
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,670
or a gateway to it.

344
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,798
So we didn't do
the kids any favors.

345
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:16,677
So we should stay together
for each other and ourselves,

346
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,554
or...

347
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:20,474
Or...

348
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:24,897
Man, woman, and now Trunkman?

349
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:26,816
We know science has created
men that have a trunk

350
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:28,443
that allows them
to have sex with both

351
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:30,529
male and female partners.

352
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,824
But we don't like the idea of
these people getting married.

353
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:35,620
Put a line in the sand,
everybody.

354
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:37,414
Vote "no" on proposition XW2.

355
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:39,833
The act that says trunkpeople
can get married.

356
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:41,211
Who needs it?

357
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:42,713
Not on my watch.

358
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:46,593
Paid for by Michael Denny
and The Denny Singers.

359
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:48,721
Hi. I'm a trunkperson,
and I want...

360
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:51,475
I feel love in my heart, too,
just like you.

361
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,311
I wanna be able
to express that love

362
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:55,104
with both a man and a woman.

363
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,607
And I won't be able to

364
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:58,944
if Denny and The Denny Singers
get their way.

365
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:01,447
Hey, let the trunkpeople have
sex and get married, huh?

366
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:04,159
Paid for by trunkpeople.

367
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,328
Oh, I love me
strawberry sniggles.

368
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,456
Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets
my hands on me

369
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,752
and tries to steal
my strawberry smiggles.

370
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:13,238
I'm gonna eat every last
one of them,

371
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:15,216
because... and then
they'll be in my stomach,

372
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,302
and nobody will ever be
able to eat them.

373
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:19,764
Except for me, because they'll
be all inside my stomach.

374
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:24,144
Um, my name is
Mr. Tophat Jones,

375
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,981
and God forbid anyone ever
take my sner...

376
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,775
little-people snibbles.

377
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,277
I'm keeping them all for me.

378
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,321
Mmm. Mmm.

379
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:33,366
Last bite.
Mmm.

380
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,368
Oh, now they're all resting
comfortably in my stomach.

381
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:36,912
Ooh, am I feeling good.

382
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:39,207
No! Get away from me!
Get away from me!

383
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,210
There's no more strawberry
snibbles... no!

384
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:44,798
Jesus Christ!

385
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,467
Jesus Christ! It hurts!

386
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,969
My entrails are out!

387
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,513
Why would you even want
to eat these?

388
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,683
They're soaked
with my stomach acid.

389
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,935
Oh, Jesus Christ, lord, savior,

390
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,813
and spirit, save me.

391
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,524
Take me to the light.

392
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:59,276
Oh, my god. I see demons.

393
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,820
I see demons are coming!

394
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:02,531
Geez, Rick.
Oh, my god.

395
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:03,976
That's some pretty
hard-core stuff,

396
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,911
you know, for a cereal
commercial.

397
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,497
Well, Morty... I mean, you
wanna sell boxes of cereal,

398
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:10,292
you gotta pump the gas a little.

399
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,002
Pedal to the metal, Morty.

400
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:15,423
In a world where muscular
Mannies are coming,

401
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:17,092
and they're coming strong,

402
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:20,722
there's only three
unmuscular Michaels.

403
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,975
Get down. Hurry. Run.

404
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:28,734
And that's when real
Turbulent Juice is coming,

405
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:31,446
and you got to take care of it.

406
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,865
With Turbulent Juice,
turbulent tables,

407
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,621
no room is safe
from the turbulent power

408
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:39,749
of Turbulent Juice.

409
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,751
- What in the hell?
- Sex sells, Morty.

410
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:43,754
Sex sells what?

411
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:46,341
Was that a movie or, like,
does it clean stuff?

412
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:47,843
Hey, Dad.

413
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,345
- God.
- What's going on?

414
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:51,190
Well, your mother and I
are gonna be spending

415
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:52,767
some time apart, Morty.

416
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,769
And your sister found out
she was an unwanted pregnancy.

417
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,606
- What?
- Speaking of what,

418
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:00,987
Morty,
what should we watch next?

419
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,822
What about this?

420
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,783
Babylegs, you're a good
detective.

421
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:07,328
But not good enough,
because of your baby legs.

422
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,331
So I'm partnering you up
with Regularlegs.

423
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,791
Hey, there.

424
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,794
Detective, I'm...
this is upsetting to me

425
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:15,631
because I feel like I don't
need no regular-leg partner.

426
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:17,426
Babylegs, don't talk back to me.

427
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,927
Good luck, you two.

428
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,972
There's a criminal to kill.

429
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:23,017
Wow, you sure found
this guy quick.

430
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:25,020
Uh, yeah, because I'm a good
detective.

431
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:26,813
Look, Babylegs.
It's the criminal.

432
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:28,566
Oh, fuck it. I'm the killer.
I'm running.

433
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,650
I'm running real quick.

434
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:31,653
Babylegs, here we go!

435
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:36,201
That's the sound I make
when I'm trying to run fast.

436
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,831
All right, I'm not
gonna get him.

437
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,834
I just learned a real
valuable lesson.

438
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,545
I'm coming, Babylegs.

439
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,422
I'm... Regularlegs.

440
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,050
We got him.

441
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,719
Hey, that was good teamwork.

442
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:50,596
Babylegs and Regularlegs,

443
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,599
I'm proud of you two
for working together.

444
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:54,602
And, Babylegs, I know
it was hard for you

445
00:16:54,686 --> 00:16:57,064
to come to the conclusion
that you need a partner,

446
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,648
but I'm proud of you
that you did it.

447
00:16:58,733 --> 00:16:59,734
Hey, thanks, Chief.

448
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:01,444
Now get the fuck out of here.

449
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:03,030
Pretty cool, huh, Morty?

450
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:04,616
Oh.
I thought it was cool.

451
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,079
I don't give a fuck what
you think, Jerry.

452
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:14,963
Hey, uh, y-you doing okay?

453
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:16,632
I kind of know how you feel,
Summer.

454
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:18,510
No, you don't.
You're the little brother.

455
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:20,315
You're not the cause of your
parents misery.

456
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:23,016
You're just a symptom of it.

457
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:25,061
- Can I show you something?
- Morty, no offense...

458
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:27,105
but a drawing of me you made
when you were eight

459
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:28,774
isn't gonna make me feel like
less of an accident.

460
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:31,611
That out there?
That's my grave.

461
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:34,323
- Wait, what?
- On one of our adventures...

462
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:37,119
Rick and I basically
destroyed the whole world,

463
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:40,123
so we bailed on that reality,
and we came to this one.

464
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:42,626
Because in this one,
the world wasn't destroyed.

465
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,838
And in this one, we were dead.

466
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:46,763
So we came here and...
and we buried ourselves,

467
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,634
and we took their place.

468
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:50,762
And every morning, Summer,
I eat breakfast

469
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,643
20 yards away
from my own rotting corpse.

470
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:56,478
So you're not my brother?

471
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:58,189
I'm better than your brother.

472
00:17:58,274 --> 00:17:59,955
I'm a version of your brother
you can trust

473
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:01,902
when he says "don't run."

474
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:04,531
Nobody exists on purpose.
Nobody belongs anywhere.

475
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,951
Everybody's gonna die.

476
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:10,707
Come watch TV.

477
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,042
Mrs. Sullivan always planned

478
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:15,546
to leave everything to her cats.

479
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,051
But sometimes, plans need
a helping paw.

480
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:22,681
What are the kitties to do

481
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,976
but buckle together
and work as a team?

482
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,938
Mrs. Sullivan, I... please,
forgive me for being forward,

483
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,482
but your eyes are so beautiful.

484
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,196
Wait. This is
an actual movie?

485
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,699
This fall, sparks will fly...

486
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,122
Mrs. Sullivan.
Ohh.

487
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:42,249
Between one guy
who can't get a break...

488
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,586
There's something about you,
Mrs. Sullivan.

489
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,465
And nine cats who break
all the rules.

490
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,386
"Last Will and Testi-meow:

491
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:52,973
Weekend at Dead Cat Lady's
House II."

492
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:55,434
Well, somebody in Hollywood
just lost their job.

493
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,270
Written and directed by
Jerry Smith.

494
00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:59,732
I wrote and directed that?
What am I, nuts?

495
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,693
Oh, hey, Morty.
You just missed a preview

496
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:03,320
for your Dad's
"Citizen Kane."

497
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:04,781
Doesn't matter.

498
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:06,450
Hey, if your mother
and I had to split custody,

499
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:08,077
who would you guys chose?

500
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,746
Doesn't matter.

501
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,541
Breaking news... Academy
Award-Winning actor Jerry Smith

502
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:15,295
is leading police
on a slow-speed pursuit

503
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,340
after suffering
an apparent breakdown.

504
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,050
Don't even think about it.

505
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:21,053
Come on.
Are you kidding me, Jerry?

506
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:22,973
It's just a bunch of dumb
tabloid crap.

507
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:26,686
It's my life,
and we're watching it.

508
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,316
You did it, Beth.
You really nailed it.

509
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:34,738
You're a surgeon...
a human surgeon.

510
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:37,659
Yay, you win.

511
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,328
Where the hell am I going?

512
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:41,498
Wh... What are you
asking me for, Jerry?

513
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:43,668
I'm sitting here
trying to figure out

514
00:19:43,752 --> 00:19:45,336
why the cops don't just
take you out.

515
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,506
I mean they got
a clear shot to your head.

516
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,968
I can't believe our tax dollars
pay for this.

517
00:19:58,188 --> 00:19:59,523
Jerry?

518
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:01,859
Jerry Smith?

519
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:04,529
Beth Sanchez, I have been in
love with you since high school.

520
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,490
I hate acting.
I hate cocaine.

521
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:08,076
I hate Kristen Stewart.

522
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:09,828
I wish you hadn't gotten
that abortion,

523
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:14,335
and I've never stopped thinking
about what might have been.

524
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,966
# Give me a name #

525
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:24,724
# Hear my faith #

526
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:29,814
# Seal my fate #

527
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:37,241
# And when you breathe #

528
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:39,745
# You breathe for two #

529
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:41,509
Hey, "Ball Fondlers"?
Huh, "Ball Fondlers"?

530
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,180
Yeah, I could go
for some "Ball Fondlers."

531
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,710
Yeah, "Ball Fondlers."

532
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:48,256
Aah!

533
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,345
Ha ha, Hamster in Butt World
Weather is done,

534
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,055
and now it's sports time
coming up.

535
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:25,933
- Oh, hello, there.
- Good day to you, miss.

536
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:27,894
So, the hamsters live

537
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,354
inside the rectums of those
people?

538
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,065
Yes, sweetie.
That's where the live.

539
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,484
Well, how does that work?

540
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:34,486
I mean, do the butts look like
little apartments inside?

541
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:36,072
Yeah, and can they
leave the butt

542
00:21:36,157 --> 00:21:37,783
and, like, walk around
on their own?

543
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,495
I don't know. I'm watching
the same thing you guys are.

544
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,372
Grandpa Rick,
if they leave the butt

545
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,000
and the person wanders off,

546
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:45,669
how would they find
their butt person again?

547
00:21:45,753 --> 00:21:47,671
I don't know, Summer.
I can't even hear the TV.

548
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:49,132
All right, that's it.

549
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:50,592
We're just gonna go there
so you idiots

550
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,386
can ask your stupid
questions all day.

551
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:54,639
Ooh, family vacation!

552
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,453
Did you get any of that?

553
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,498
It's a good-a show!
