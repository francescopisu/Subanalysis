1
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,290
Morty, you got to come on.

2
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,836
You got to come with me.

3
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:06,756
What's going on?

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,759
I got a surprise for you, Morty.

5
00:00:07,843 --> 00:00:08,637
It's the middle of the night.

6
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:10,434
I got a surprise for you.

7
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:11,521
Ow!

8
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:13,318
Ow! You're tugging
me too hard.

9
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:14,686
I got a surprise for you, Morty.

10
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,919
What do you what do you

11
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,925
think of this
flying vehicle, Morty?

12
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:22,597
I built it out of stuff
I found in the garage.

13
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:24,060
Yeah, Rick, it's...
it's great.

14
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:25,230
Is this the surprise?

15
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:27,404
Morty, I had to...
I had to do...

16
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:29,075
I had to...
I had to...

17
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:30,079
I had to make a bomb, Morty.

18
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:31,166
I had to create a bomb.

19
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,169
What?! A bomb?!

20
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,453
We're gonna drop
it down there...

21
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:34,384
Just get a whole
fresh start, Morty.

22
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:35,972
Create a whole fresh start.

23
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:37,143
T-t-that's
absolutely crazy!

24
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:38,271
Come on, Morty.
Just take it easy, Morty.

25
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:39,817
It's gonna be good.

26
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,823
Right now, we're gonna go pick
up your little friend Jessica.

27
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:42,911
Jessica?

28
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:44,122
From my math class?

29
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,003
When I drop the bomb, I don't...

30
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,634
You know, I want you to have
somebody,

31
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:49,556
you know...
I want you to have the thing...

32
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:50,894
I'm gonna make it like
a new Adam and Eve,

33
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:51,980
and you're gonna be Adam.

34
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:55,742
And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and
so that's the surprise, Morty.

35
00:00:55,826 --> 00:00:56,913
No, you can't!

36
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:58,400
J-Jessica doesn't
even know I exist.

37
00:00:58,418 --> 00:00:59,587
But... but... but
forget about that,

38
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:01,218
because you can't
blow up humanity.

39
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:02,764
I-I get what you're trying
to say, M-Morty.

40
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:04,394
Listen, I'm not...
you don't...

41
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,609
y-y-you don't got to worry about
me trying to fool around with...

42
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:08,779
with Jessica or mess around
with Jessica or anything.

43
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:10,121
I'm... I'm not that
kind of guy, Morty.

44
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:11,500
What are you talking
about, Rick?

45
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:13,088
You... you... you don't
have to worry about me getting

46
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:14,384
with Jessica or anything.

47
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:16,891
She... she... she... she...
she's all for you, Morty.

48
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,065
I don't care about Jessica!

49
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,277
You know what, Morty?
You're right.

50
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:21,949
Let's forget the
girl all together.

51
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:23,537
She... she's probably nothing
but trouble, anyways.

52
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:25,042
Arming Neutrino bomb.

53
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:25,961
That's it...
That's it, Rick.

54
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:26,839
I'm taking the wheel.

55
00:01:26,923 --> 00:01:28,093
Get off of me, Morty!

56
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:29,556
I'm taking charge of
this situation, buddy.

57
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:30,852
What's gotten into you?

58
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,273
I'm... I'm... I'm...

59
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,656
I'm not gonna stand around
like some sort of dumb...

60
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,993
What are you, crazy?

61
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:37,456
Person and just let
you blow up the whole world.

62
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,376
All right, all right.

63
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,797
I'll... I'll land.

64
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:40,716
I'll land. I'll land.

65
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,597
I'll land the thing.

66
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:44,102
Big tough guy all of a sudden.

67
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:49,033
We'll park it right here, Morty.

68
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:50,371
Right here on the s-side
of the r-road here.

69
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:51,332
Oh, thank God.

70
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:52,293
You know what?

71
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,091
That was all a test, Morty.

72
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:57,143
Just an elaborate test
to make you more assertive.

73
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:58,104
It was?

74
00:01:58,188 --> 00:01:59,190
Sure. Why not?

75
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,235
I don't... I don't know.

76
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,196
You... you know what, Mo...

77
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,747
Neutrino bomb armed.

78
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,003
Um...

79
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:44,163
I see there's a new episode of
that singing show tonight.

80
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:47,048
Who do you guys think is
gonna be the best singer?

81
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,260
Oh, my God.
His head is in his food.

82
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:49,346
I'm going to puke.

83
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:50,767
Morty, are you getting sick?

84
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:53,017
I told you not to practice-kiss
the living-room pillow.

85
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:54,154
The dog sleeps on it.

86
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,909
I wasn't kissing a pillow, Mom.

87
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:58,417
I just... I didn't get a
lot of sleep last night.

88
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,548
Maybe my dreams were just
too loud or something.

89
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,838
Or maybe you were out all night
again with grandpa Rick.

90
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:03,683
What?!

91
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:04,561
Dad?

92
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,442
What, so everyone's supposed to
sleep every single night now?

93
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:08,699
You realize that nighttime
makes up half of all time?

94
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:09,619
Damn it!

95
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:10,872
- Jerry!
- Beth!

96
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,001
Oh, my God.
My parents are so loud.

97
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:13,088
I want to die.

98
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,467
Mm, there is no God, Summer.

99
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,348
You got to rip that band-aid off
now. You'll thank me later.

100
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:18,187
Okay, with all due respect,
Rick...

101
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,110
What am I talking about?
What respect is due?

102
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:23,788
How is my son supposed to pass
his classes if you keep dragging

103
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:26,504
him off for high-concept
sci-fi rigamarole?

104
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,886
Listen, Jerry, I-l don't want to
overstep my bounds or anything.

105
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:30,517
It's your house.
It's your world.

106
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,723
You're a real Julius Caesar.

107
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,816
But I'll tell you some...
tell you how...

108
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,143
how I feel about school, Jerry.

109
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:35,407
It's a waste of time...

110
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:36,828
A bunch of people
running around,

111
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:37,957
bumping into each other.

112
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:39,712
G-guy up front says,
"Two plus two."

113
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:41,551
The people in the
back say, "Four."

114
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:43,800
Then the bell rings, and they
give you a carton of milk

115
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:46,943
and a piece of paper that says you can
go take a dump or something.

116
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,451
I mean, it's... it's not a
place for smart people, Jerry.

117
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:50,663
And I know that's not
a popular opinion,

118
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:53,882
but it's my two cents
on the issue.

119
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,595
This was a good breakfast, Beth.

120
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,727
You really made the
crap out of those eggs.

121
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:00,026
I wish your mother
was here to eat them.

122
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:01,405
Oh, Dad.

123
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,282
What?

124
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,248
For real?

125
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:06,002
All right, now, everybody get settled.

126
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:07,758
Get away from the windows!

127
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:09,012
Now, look, we're gonna be

128
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:10,977
dealing with some real
serious stuff today.

129
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:12,941
You might have heard of it.
It's called math.

130
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:15,073
And without it,
none of us would even exist,

131
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,288
so let's jump right in...
two plus two.

132
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:18,375
Jessica.

133
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,838
Five plus five.

134
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:21,133
Tenssica.

135
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,220
Okay, good.

136
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,307
It's time for the quiz.

137
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:25,689
Yeah, you know what?!
Aw, too bad!

138
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:26,818
Tough!

139
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:29,074
First row, take one.
Pass it back for me.

140
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:30,955
The stakes are high
in this room.

141
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,299
There's crucial things
happening here every day.

142
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:35,260
People getting smarter.

143
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:36,389
Some of y'all getting dumber.

144
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,730
Some of y'all ain't
gonna see 3:00.

145
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:42,241
Hi, Morty.

146
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,328
Whoa!

147
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:44,456
Hi, Jessica.

148
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,877
Can I show these to you?

149
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:46,838
Wow.

150
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,009
Th-they're both great.

151
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,096
Thank you.

152
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:50,057
You know what I named these?

153
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,353
My little Morties.

154
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:54,237
Uh, that's flattering...
and a little weird.

155
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:56,285
Do you know what I want
you to do with them?

156
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:57,371
Rename them?

157
00:04:57,415 --> 00:04:58,792
Squeeze them.

158
00:04:58,877 --> 00:04:59,963
Manhandle them.

159
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,091
Give them the business.

160
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,554
See if you can shuffle them.

161
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,853
I mean, really get in there
and knock them around.

162
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,107
No wrong answers.

163
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:06,985
Wow.

164
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:08,364
Well, okay, Jessica.

165
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:09,827
L-let's give this a shot.

166
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,081
Mm.

167
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,168
Oh, Morty.

168
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:13,714
What are you doing to me?

169
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:15,971
Uh, I-I'm just
doing my best.

170
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,058
Morty!

171
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,935
What are you doing to me?!

172
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,855
Jessica.

173
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:19,983
Morty!

174
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,074
Jessica.

175
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:24,121
Five more minutes of this,
and I'm gonna get mad.

176
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:26,086
Je-Jessica.

177
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,382
Jessica.

178
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:28,709
Not my fault this is happening.

179
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:32,774
Well, well, well.

180
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:33,860
Uh, morning, Frank.

181
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:34,905
"Morning"?

182
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:35,908
What was... what is
that supposed to mean?

183
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:37,121
You making fun of me?

184
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:38,332
Are you trying to
say my family's poor?

185
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,461
Oh, geez, Frank.

186
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:40,882
I don't know if a
knife is necessary.

187
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,306
I mean, you know, y-you kind of
had things handled without it.

188
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:45,647
You telling me how to bully now?

189
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:47,110
Big mistake, Morty.

190
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:51,457
And now I'm gonna cut you,
'cause my family's rich.

191
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:54,425
There you are, Morty.

192
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,678
Listen to me.

193
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:57,392
I got an errand to run in a
whole different dimension.

194
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:58,980
I need an extra pair of hands.

195
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:00,193
Oh, geez, Rick.

196
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,614
W-what'd you do to Frank?

197
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:03,076
It's pretty obvious, Morty.
I froze him.

198
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:04,999
Now listen...
I need your help, Morty.

199
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,630
I mean, we got...
we got to get...

200
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,677
get the hell out of here
and go take care of business.

201
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,812
It's important. Come on, Morty.

202
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:12,899
I don't know, Rick.

203
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,153
I-I can't leave school again.

204
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:15,616
Do you have any concept of how
much higher the stakes

205
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,911
get out there, Morty?

206
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:18,416
What do you think...
I can just do it all by myself?

207
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,378
Come on!

208
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,506
Aw, geez. Okay.

209
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,885
I guess I can skip History.

210
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,431
What about Frank?

211
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,602
I mean, shouldn't
you unfreeze him?

212
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:25,898
I'll do it later, Morty.

213
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:26,985
He'll be fine.

214
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:29,827
Let's go.

215
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,833
Oh, my God.

216
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:34,383
I'm about to walk
past Frank Palicky.

217
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:37,559
This is the story we'll
be telling our children.

218
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:38,855
Hi, Frank.

219
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:43,160
Aah!

220
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,758
Scalpel.

221
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:48,970
Knock, knock.

222
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,140
Jerry?

223
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:52,269
My manager gave me an hour
for lunch, and I thought,

224
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:54,613
"Hey, why not swing by
where your wife works?"

225
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:56,326
We're losing him.

226
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,705
Okay, he's back.

227
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,171
Jerry, please tell me you're
here for an incredibly urgent reason.

228
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,718
Well, it's lunch.

229
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:04,602
I mean, it's one of three meals
that have existed for millennia.

230
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:05,730
Losing him.

231
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:06,984
Stabilized.

232
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,534
Okay, I only ask, Jerry,
because, as you know,

233
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:12,084
my job involves
performing heart surgery.

234
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:13,505
Well, yeah, on horses.

235
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:14,633
Excuse me?

236
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:16,431
Okay. Let's not
rehash that fight.

237
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:19,273
I sense that you're busy
and will now be on my way.

238
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:20,443
Whoa!

239
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,031
What is this on the floor?

240
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:25,584
Some kind of literature for
a really nice-looking nursing home.

241
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:27,339
Hey, honey, crazy idea...
bad pitch...

242
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:28,802
let's put your Dad here.

243
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,330
Let's put your Dad
in a nursing home.

244
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:32,355
We're losing him.

245
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:33,358
Hey, Tom.

246
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,320
We know when we're losing him.

247
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:35,699
We can hear the beeps!

248
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:37,998
There she is. All right.

249
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,210
Come on, Morty.
Let's go.

250
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:40,171
Oh, geez.

251
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:41,509
Okay.

252
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,309
Oh, man, Rick.

253
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:45,688
What is this place?

254
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:48,405
It's dimension 35C,
and it's got the perfect

255
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,456
climate conditions for a
special type of tree, Morty,

256
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,836
called a Mega tree,

257
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,215
and there's fruit
in those trees,

258
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:55,761
and there's seeds
in those fruits.

259
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,225
I'm talking about Mega seeds.

260
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,523
They're... they're
incredibly powerful,

261
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,697
and I need them to help me
with my research, Morty.

262
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,703
Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking
around this place,

263
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,542
and I'm starting to work up some
anxiety about this whole thing.

264
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,629
All right. All right.
Calm down.

265
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:07,841
Listen to me, Morty.

266
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:10,140
I know that new situations
can be intimidating.

267
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,522
You're looking around, and it's
all scary and different, but,

268
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:15,406
you know, m-meeting them head
on, charging right into them

269
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,663
like a bull...
that's how we grow as people.

270
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,502
I'm no stranger
to scary situations.

271
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:20,965
I deal with them all the time.

272
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,255
Now, if you just stick with me,
Morty, we're gonna be...

273
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:24,727
Holy crap, Morty, run!

274
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:27,862
I never seen that thing
before in my life.

275
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:29,430
I don't even know
what the hell it is!

276
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:30,734
We got to get out
of here, Morty!

277
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:31,666
It's gonna kill us!

278
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,752
We're gonna die!

279
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:34,006
We're gonna die, Morty!

280
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:37,935
Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.

281
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:40,024
Breathe that... breathe that
fresh air in, Morty.

282
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,320
Y-you smell that?

283
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:42,951
That's the smell
of adventure, Morty.

284
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:45,375
That's... that's the smell of...
of... of... of a whole different

285
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,464
evolutionary timeline.

286
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:48,635
All right, Rick, look...

287
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,056
how much longer
is this gonna be?

288
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:51,352
Shouldn't I be
back at school by now?

289
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:52,564
Are you joking me?

290
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:55,071
I mean, look at all the
crazy crap surrounding us.

291
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:56,284
Look at that thing right there.

292
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,747
W-what the hell is that thing?

293
00:08:57,831 --> 00:08:59,419
You think you're gonna see
that kind of thing at school?

294
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:01,090
Look at it just lumbering around.

295
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,766
It defies all logic...
that thing.

296
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,852
Yeah, Rick, I get it.

297
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:06,356
We're surrounded by monsters.

298
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,245
That's kind of the reason
why I want to leave.

299
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:09,157
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

300
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:12,375
Morty, you see this?

301
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,424
You see what we just
stumbled upon, Morty?

302
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:15,636
Any idea what that
is down there?

303
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,807
The Mega trees?

304
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,186
That's right, Morty...
the Mega trees

305
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,607
with the Mega fruit on them.

306
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,070
And that's what I'm
talking about, Morty.

307
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:22,533
That's where my seeds are.

308
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:23,661
If we would have done
what you wanted,

309
00:09:23,745 --> 00:09:24,998
I would have never
have found them,

310
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,754
because y... because you're
so in love with school.

311
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,092
All right, all right.

312
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:30,014
So, what's so special about
these seeds, anyways?

313
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,769
You ask a lot of
questions, Morty.

314
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:33,107
Not very charismatic.

315
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:34,570
It makes you kind of
an under...

316
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:36,075
underfoot figure.

317
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,328
Just take these shoes, Morty.

318
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:39,217
They're Sp...
special grappling shoes.

319
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:41,508
When you're wearing these
things... Ba... these babies,

320
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:44,225
you can basically just walk on
any surface you want, Morty...

321
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,231
up, down, below,
turn around to the left.

322
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:48,154
These things really bring
it all together.

323
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:49,868
Aah!

324
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:51,195
You have to turn them on, Morty!

325
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:53,420
The shoes have to be turned on!

326
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:56,262
I am not putting my father in a home!

327
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,228
He just came back into my life,

328
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:01,738
and you want to grab him and
stuff him under a mattress like

329
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:03,284
last month's Victoria's Secret?

330
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,855
I told you... I was ordering you
something for Valentine's Day.

331
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,599
More importantly, your father is
a horrible influence on our son.

332
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:11,937
Everything cool in here, Beth?

333
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:12,856
It's fine, Davin.

334
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:13,985
Okay, cool.

335
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:15,489
You know, we did
something great today.

336
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,084
There's nothing more noble and
free than the heart of a horse.

337
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,591
Since we're fighting,
if you ever have an affair

338
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:23,180
with that guy, I will
come to the hotel room

339
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:25,730
and blow my brains out
all over your naked bodies.

340
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:28,781
Look, I appreciate the
stress you're under, but

341
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:31,164
Morty was having trouble in
school way before my dad moved

342
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:34,549
in, and the only influence I
can see Rick having is that,

343
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,768
for the first time in his life,
Morty has a friend.

344
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,821
Well, maybe you're right.

345
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,912
Uh, yeah, maybe I am.

346
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:44,998
I'm my father's daughter.

347
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,001
I'm smart.

348
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:46,962
Why do you think
I'm a heart surgeon?

349
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:47,882
Horse heart surgeon.

350
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:49,303
- Hello?
- Mrs. Smith?

351
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:50,952
This is Principal Vagina...
no relation.

352
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,773
I wonder if you and Morty's
father might be able to have

353
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:54,019
a chat with me this afternoon?

354
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,209
Morty, oh, you really d-did a
number on your legs right now.

355
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:01,759
You know, you got to
turn the shoes on, Morty,

356
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:03,012
for them to work.

357
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:04,300
Yeah, look...
I turned mine on.

358
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,563
I had no problem
getting down here.

359
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:07,151
It was a leisurely breeze.

360
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:08,488
I'm in a lot of pain, Rick.

361
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:09,993
Yeah, I can see that.

362
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:12,918
But do you think you'll still be
able to help me collect

363
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,214
my seeds, Morty?

364
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,301
Are you kidding me?!

365
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:16,305
That's it, Rick!

366
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:17,558
That's the last straw!

367
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,607
I can't believe this...
I'm sitting here with both

368
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,278
of my legs broken,
and you're still asking me

369
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:22,909
about getting those seeds?!

370
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:24,455
Ooh! Ow! Oh!

371
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:25,834
Y-y-you're a monster.

372
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,589
Y-you're like Hitler, but...

373
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:29,721
but even Hitler cared about
Germany or something.

374
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:31,435
Okay, hold on just a second,
Morty.

375
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:42,929
Ooh.

376
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:46,566
Ohh.

377
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:52,668
Ooh.

378
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,925
Wow, Rick.

379
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,474
That stuff just healed
my broken legs instantly.

380
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,776
I mean, I've never felt
so good in my life.

381
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:01,863
Thank you.

382
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:03,117
Don't worry about it, Morty.

383
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:05,081
Just come help me get these
seeds, all right, buddy?

384
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,336
Sure thing, Rick.

385
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,923
Not that you asked, Morty,
but what just happened

386
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:10,891
there is I went into a future
dimension with such advanced

387
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:13,190
medicine that they had
broken-leg serum at every

388
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,569
corner drugstore.

389
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:15,823
The stuff was all over
the place, Morty.

390
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,411
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

391
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:18,832
There's just one problem,
Morty...

392
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:20,045
one little hang-up.

393
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,716
The dimension I visited was so
advanced,

394
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:23,932
they had also halted
the aging process,

395
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,436
and everyone there was young,
Morty,

396
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:26,649
and they had been forever.

397
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,321
I was the only old
person there, Morty.

398
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:30,536
It was like I was some
sort of, you know, celebrity,

399
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,790
walking around.

400
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:33,253
I-I was fascinating to them.

401
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,593
There were a lot of attractive
women there, Morty, and they...

402
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:37,266
they... they...
they all wanted time with me.

403
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,154
I had a lot of fun with
a lot of young ladies,

404
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:40,776
but I spent so much time there,

405
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,264
my interdimensional
portal device...

406
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:43,953
it's got no charge left, Morty.

407
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:45,039
It's got no charge left.

408
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:45,917
What?!

409
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,087
It's as good as garbage, Morty.

410
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:48,133
It's not gonna
work anymore, Morty.

411
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:49,303
Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

412
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:51,017
W-what are we gonna do?

413
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,190
I-I have to be back
at school right now.

414
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:54,517
How are we gonna get back home?

415
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,116
There's ways to
get back home, Morty.

416
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,080
It's just... it's just gonna
be a little bit of a hassle.

417
00:12:58,165 --> 00:12:59,920
We're gonna have to go through
Interdimensional Customs,

418
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,427
so you're gonna have
to do me a real solid.

419
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:03,514
Uh-oh.

420
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:04,768
When we get to Customs,

421
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,857
I'm gonna need you to take
these seeds into the bathroom,

422
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,404
and I'm gonna need you
to put them way up

423
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,407
inside your butthole, Morty.

424
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:10,703
In my butt?

425
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,416
Put them way up inside there,
as far as they can fit.

426
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,629
Oh, geez, Rick.

427
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:14,925
I really don't want
to have to do that.

428
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,471
Well, somebody's got
to do it, Morty.

429
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:19,480
Th-these seeds aren't gonna get
through Customs unless they're

430
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,525
in someone's rectum, Morty.

431
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:22,782
And they'll fall
right out of mine.

432
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,454
I've done this
too many times, Morty.

433
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:25,666
I mean, you're young.

434
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,589
You've got your whole
life ahead of you,

435
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,846
and your anal cavity is
still taut, yet malleable.

436
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,333
You got to do it
for Grandpa, Morty.

437
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:33,106
Y-you've got to put these
seeds inside your butt.

438
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,984
In my butt?

439
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:34,904
Come on, Morty.

440
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:35,823
Please, Morty.

441
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:36,951
You have to do it, Morty.

442
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:38,039
Oh, man.

443
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,759
The fact is, your son, Morty,
has attended this school for a

444
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:44,224
total of seven hours over
the last two months.

445
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:45,854
What? Why didn't
you notify us?

446
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:47,735
I done been notifying you.

447
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:49,114
Have you not been
getting the messages

448
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,535
I've been leaving with Morty's
grandfather?

449
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,706
Boom!

450
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,336
Told you! Ln your face!

451
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,217
He is ruining our child!

452
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,721
Wait, what am I celebrating?

453
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:58,435
Yeah, see, I thought
something was fishy there,

454
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,898
because it's usually Morty's
grandpa that's taking

455
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:00,776
him out of school.

456
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,862
Summer?

457
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:05,206
What kind of God lets this happen?

458
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,377
We had a little incident.

459
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:08,091
A student was frozen to death.

460
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:11,225
And there's no evidence that
a Latino student did it!

461
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,897
Everyone wants to take
this to a racial place.

462
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,402
I won't let them.

463
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,457
The Glarp Zone is for flarping
and unglarping only.

464
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,466
So, I told him,
"Give me the Blimfarx," you know?

465
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,054
This... this guy...

466
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:24,433
he doesn't understand
interstellar currency.

467
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:26,230
It's, like, I'm trying
to eat a Flimflam...

468
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,404
like, that's what
we eat on Girvonesk.

469
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:31,288
The glarp zone is for
flarping and unglarping only.

470
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:32,584
I don't like it here, Morty.

471
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:33,921
I can't abide bureaucracy.

472
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,718
I don't like being told
where to go and what to do.

473
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:37,139
I consider it a violation.

474
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,728
Did you get those seeds
all the way up your butt?

475
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:39,856
Yeah, Rick.

476
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:41,236
Let's just get
this over with, okay?

477
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,907
I mean, these things are pointy.
They hurt.

478
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:44,161
That means they're good ones.

479
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:45,624
You're a good kid, Morty.

480
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,923
Those Mega seeds are super
valuable to my work.

481
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:49,679
You've been a huge help to me.

482
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,208
I'm gonna be able to do
all kinds of things with them.

483
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:54,067
It's gonna be great, Morty.

484
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:55,355
All kinds of science.

485
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:56,659
Okay, next through.

486
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,540
Except you. You go over there.

487
00:14:58,624 --> 00:14:59,668
Why does he have
to go over there?

488
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:00,796
Random check.

489
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:01,884
He's got to go through
the new machine.

490
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:02,970
What new...
what new machine?

491
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:04,098
It's a new machine.

492
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:05,477
It detects stuff all
the way up your butt.

493
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:07,233
Run, Morty! Run!

494
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:08,404
Aah!

495
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:09,490
Red alert!

496
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:23,701
Ohhhhh!

497
00:15:31,937 --> 00:15:33,482
Hey! Ohhhhhh.

498
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:35,363
Aah!

499
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:36,491
Don't think about it!

500
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,169
Ooh!

501
00:15:42,971 --> 00:15:43,973
Oh, nice, Morty!

502
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:45,257
The student becomes the teacher.

503
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:55,175
Whoooooo!

504
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,724
Aah!

505
00:15:57,809 --> 00:15:59,396
Aw, hell, no, dawg.

506
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:00,692
You know me...
I'm just trying to...

507
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:02,949
Aah!

508
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,881
I need to type in the coordinates
to our home world, Morty.

509
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,427
Cover me.
Oh, man.

510
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:11,437
I mean, you know, I-I
don't want to shoot nobody.

511
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,604
They're just robots, Morty!

512
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:13,775
It's okay to shoot them!

513
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:14,861
They're robots!

514
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:16,909
Aah!

515
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,330
My leg is shot off!

516
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:19,751
Glenn's bleeding to death!

517
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:21,925
Someone call his wife
and children!

518
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:23,053
They're not robots, Rick!

519
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:24,391
It's a figure of speech, Morty.

520
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:25,477
They're bureaucrats.

521
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,523
I don't respect them.

522
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:27,734
Just keep shooting, Morty.

523
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,410
You have no idea what
prison is like here!

524
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:34,840
Holy crap!
This is insane!

525
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:46,209
Come on, Morty!

526
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:47,614
We got to get the
hell out of here!

527
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,105
Wow.

528
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,530
Did you just come into the
cafeteria through a portal?

529
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:56,909
Uh, yeah.

530
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:59,709
Well, you know, my... my
Ferrari's in the shop.

531
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:02,133
Ju... just kidding.

532
00:17:02,218 --> 00:17:03,806
You're Morty, right?
Yeah.

533
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,052
You can get his number later.

534
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,773
Come on, Morty. We got
to get out of here.

535
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:08,069
You got to get those
seeds out of your ass.

536
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,197
Oh, look, honey.

537
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,496
It's our son with
Albert Ein-douche.

538
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:12,667
What?

539
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:14,171
I'm an angry father,
not an improvisor.

540
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:15,467
Oh, hi, Jerry.

541
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:17,139
Oh, my goodness, Morty!

542
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:18,811
What are you doing out of class?

543
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:20,106
We talked about this.

544
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:21,987
Your... your parents and
I are very disappointed in...

545
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:24,662
in this behavior.

546
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:26,543
No? No takers?

547
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,717
You guys should really not
be touching that stuff.

548
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:29,762
It's beyond your reasoning.

549
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:30,765
You're beyond our reasoning!

550
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,144
Takes one to know one.

551
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:36,659
Dad, how could you make my
son miss an entire semester of school?

552
00:17:36,743 --> 00:17:38,226
I mean, it's not like
he's a hot girl.

553
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:40,211
He can't just bail on
his life and set up shop

554
00:17:40,295 --> 00:17:41,465
in someone else's.

555
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:42,719
What... what are you
guys doing with my stuff?

556
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:45,477
We're moving you...
to a nursing home.

557
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:46,564
A nursing home?

558
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,609
What are...
what are you, nuts?

559
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:48,696
I'm a genius.

560
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:50,075
I build robots for fun.

561
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:52,165
Well, now you can build baskets
and watch Paul Newman movies

562
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,551
on VHS and mentally scar the
Boy Scouts every Christmas.

563
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:56,470
What does that mean?

564
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:57,390
It's personal.

565
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:58,728
Dad, mom, c-come on.

566
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,067
Rick just needed my help is all.

567
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:02,447
Morty, stay out of this.

568
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:06,167
You are obviously not capable
of judging these situations on your own.

569
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,421
What are you trying
to say about Morty?

570
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:08,507
That he's stupid or something?

571
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:09,887
Oh, don't high-road us, Dad.

572
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:12,980
You know fully well that Morty
is the last child that needs to

573
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:14,276
be missing classes.

574
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,199
I-I-I don't know what
you mean by that.

575
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:17,828
Can... can... can you be a
little bit more specific?

576
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,124
Oh, for crying out...

577
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:20,880
he's got some kind of
disability or something.

578
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:22,301
Is that what you want us to say?

579
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:23,806
I do?

580
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,561
Well, duh doy, son.

581
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,280
Look, I love you, Morty, but we
both know you're not as fast as

582
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:31,412
the other kids, and if you
want to compete in this world,

583
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:33,335
you got to work twice as hard.

584
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:34,756
Aw, geez, Dad.

585
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:37,640
Y-you know, that's a lot
to drop on a kid all at once.

586
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:40,232
Morty, t-tell your parents
the square root of Pi.

587
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:41,653
Oh, come on, Rick.

588
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:42,739
You know I can't.

589
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:43,826
The square root of Pi,
Morty... go.

590
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:46,961
1 .77245385.

591
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:48,382
Whoa!

592
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:49,761
What the hell?

593
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,391
Holy crap. He's right.

594
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,400
Morty, tell your parents
the first Law of

595
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,777
Thermodynamics.

596
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,953
"The increment in the internal
energy of a system is equal to

597
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,709
the increment of heat
supplied to the system."

598
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:01,548
Wow! I'm so smart!

599
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:02,886
But...

600
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,847
I told the both of you...

601
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:04,808
school is stupid.

602
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,104
It's not how you learn things.

603
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,316
Morty's a gifted child.

604
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,779
He has a special mind.

605
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:10,033
That's why he's
my little helper.

606
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,579
He's like me.

607
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:14,338
He's gonna be doing great
science stuff later in his life.

608
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:15,759
He's too smart for school.

609
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:18,978
H-he needs to keep hanging out
and helping me.

610
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:21,903
Jerry, I don't want whatever's
happening here to stop.

611
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:23,450
No, I-I understand.

612
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,498
Uh, maybe we overreacted.

613
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,257
But he has to keep
going to school.

614
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:29,636
Okay, Jerry.

615
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:31,057
You drive a hard bargain,

616
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:32,478
but what am
I supposed to do?

617
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:33,983
Say... say no?

618
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,072
You... you really wear
the pants around here.

619
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:37,953
I just want you to know,
between us, from now on,

620
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,335
it's gonna be 100%
honesty and open,

621
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:41,673
clear communication.

622
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:44,056
Frank Palicky was
frozen to death today!

623
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,101
No idea what you're
talking about.

624
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:47,441
Okay.

625
00:19:47,526 --> 00:19:49,991
Well, uh, Morty,
it's your bedtime in an hour.

626
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:51,621
Don't stay up all night again.

627
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,000
This is good, though.

628
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:54,379
This can work.

629
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,470
I think we can be a family.

630
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:58,936
And now, Beth,
if you'll have me,

631
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,900
I would love to have you.

632
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:02,071
You know what?

633
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:03,407
Okay.

634
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,205
Holy cow, Rick.

635
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,671
I didn't know hanging out with
you was making me smarter.

636
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:09,678
Full disclosure, Morty...
it's not.

637
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:12,728
Temporary superintelligence is
just a side effect of the

638
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:14,537
Mega seeds dissolving in
your rectal cavity.

639
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,822
Aw, man.

640
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:18,288
Yeah, and once those
seeds wear off,

641
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:20,096
you're gonna lose most
of your motor skills,

642
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,052
and you're also gonna lose
a significant amount of

643
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:24,473
brain functionality
for 72 hours, Morty.

644
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,149
Starting
right about now.

645
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:28,235
Ohh, man.

646
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:30,492
Oh, geez! Ohh.

647
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,540
I'm sorry, Morty.
It's a bummer.

648
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,338
In reality, you're
as dumb as they come.

649
00:20:34,422 --> 00:20:36,135
And I needed those
seeds real bad,

650
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,351
and I had to give them up just
to get your parents off my back,

651
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:40,357
so now we're gonna
have to go get more.

652
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:42,154
And then we're gonna go on even
more adventures after that,

653
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,492
Morty.

654
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,373
And you're gonna keep your mouth
shut about it, Morty,

655
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:47,337
because the world is full of
idiots that don't understand

656
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:48,507
what's important,

657
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:49,886
and they'll tear us apart,
Morty.

658
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:52,561
But if you stick with me, I'm
gonna accomplish great things,

659
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:54,651
Morty, and you're gonna be
part of them, and together,

660
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:55,947
we're gonna run around, Morty.

661
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:57,619
We're gonna do all kinds of
wonderful things, Morty.

662
00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:58,706
Just you and me, Morty.

663
00:20:58,707 --> 00:20:59,709
Oh, no, no.

664
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,130
The outside world
is our enemy, Morty.

665
00:21:01,214 --> 00:21:03,679
We're the only
friends we've got, Morty.

666
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:04,933
It's just Rick and Morty...

667
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:07,190
Rick and Morty
and their adventures, Morty.

668
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:08,988
Rick and Morty forever
and forever.

669
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:10,869
100 years,
Rick and Morty's things.

670
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:14,171
Me and Rick and Morty running
around, and Rick and Morty time.

671
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:16,595
All day long, forever.

672
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,224
All... a hundred days.

673
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,147
Rick and Morty forever...
100 times.
