1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,755
So, Jessica, I heard you
broke up with Brad.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,882
Who are you gonna date now
that you can date anyone?

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:07,841
I don't know.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:11,303
I mean, obviously if someone
special comes along...

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,514
B-But I mean <i>really</i> special, like,

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,891
nothing I've even remotely
considered in the past.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,643
- Holy shit, holy shit.
- I want that kind of love

8
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,102
- like that docking kind of love.
- Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,855
Like, penis in the foreskin
kind of love,

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,233
just, like, warm, just like...

11
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,612
He...

12
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,406
Everybody fuck off.

13
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,741
Morty, I need your help.

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,535
W-W-W-We... We need to go
on a quick adventure.

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,119
You said I could go to school today.

16
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,163
That was before I needed
something, Morty.

17
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,332
There's a plasma shard
in the Abadango Cluster.

18
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,834
A princess has it.
If I get it, I'll be awesome.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,462
We've been going nonstop, Rick.
It's not healthy.

20
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,964
You know, these are my teenage years.

21
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,924
I-I just found out Jessica's single.

22
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,302
Oh, that's... Wow, Morty. Wow.
What an exciting life you lead.

23
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,638
Let's go. In and out,
20 minutes adventure.

24
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,184
- They're on our tail!
- Steady, Morty. Five cetons.

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,358
Steady, God damn it!
Two cetons.

26
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,859
Wha!

27
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,324
Fire!

28
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,328
Pull up, Morty, pull up!
Pull up!

29
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:47,232
Fuck.

30
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,945
Oh, fuck!

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,238
Fuck!

32
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,866
Aah! Aah!

33
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,868
I can't fucking do this anymore!

34
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,412
That was seriously fucked up.
We almost died.

35
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,872
- So you agree?
- Fuck yes!

36
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,498
That w... T-This was insane!

37
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,625
That was pure luck.

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,127
I was not in control
of that situation at all.

39
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,258
Look at this, Morty.
Look at my fucking hand.

40
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,259
Look at this shit.

41
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,553
Why do you keep doing this to us?!

42
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,388
I don't know, Morty.
Maybe I hate myself.

43
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,807
Maybe I think I deserve to die.
I-I-I-I don't... I don't know!

44
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,438
We need a vacation.

45
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,478
- Isn't that something?
- You were right.

46
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,271
Best day spa in the galaxy.

47
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,272
It's not even cruel, either.

48
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,274
These things are just doing
what they do in the wild.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,068
They love swallowing
stressed-out creatures

50
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,653
for 20 minutes and then puking them up.

51
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,988
My whole body's like a baby's ass.

52
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,199
Complimentary psychological detox?

53
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,659
Removes all your cognitive toxins

54
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,202
purifies your system.

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,745
Oof, this guy on commission
or something?

56
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,789
I don't think...
Are you on commission?

57
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,541
We're not on commission.
We get paid by the hour.

58
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,167
There's no incentive, really...

59
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,210
Oh, my God.
Okay, listen.

60
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,545
W-W-W-We'll try the machine,

61
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,422
but... but I'd like you
to try something.

62
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,216
Try swallowing the giant ball of snot

63
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,593
that's dangling around
in the back of your throat.

64
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,595
It's disgusting.
Nobody wants to hear that.

65
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,641
- That's what you do.
- Okay, Rick, come on. Enough.

66
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,102
Man, did you hear me
bite that guy's head off?

67
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,520
Geez, I really need to chill.

68
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,021
Maybe you should go through twice.

69
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,733
All right, mister comedy man,
you don't have to bust my balls.

70
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,359
You're not helping things.

71
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,528
Rick, is this thing supposed
to be making this

72
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,904
noise?

73
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,497
Morty!

74
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,124
- Ri-Rick.
- Morty!

75
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,084
What happened?

76
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,128
We blew up, idiot!
Are you really that stupid?

77
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,046
Obviously the guy I yelled at
overloaded the machine.

78
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,133
It takes more than that to kill
Rick and Morty, motherfucker!

79
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,053
But this might do it.

80
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,347
- Run, Morty!
- E-Everything hurts!

81
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,849
That's because you're worthless!

82
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,602
Jesus, how big was this explosion?

83
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,270
I'm a genius.
I don't have time for this shit.

84
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,230
W-W-We're in hell, aren't we, Rick?

85
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,399
- You're so stupid, Morty.
- You're an Idiot.

86
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,276
There's no such thing as hell.

87
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,361
I believe you, but I just want to die.

88
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,364
You can die when I say so.
I control you.

89
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,784
I control the universe!
Why am I bragging about that?

90
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,951
I have nothing to prove.

91
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,662
I'm surrounded by inferior
pieces of shit and...

92
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,749
Toxins.

93
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,251
We're not in hell, Morty.
We're in the detoxifier.

94
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,212
The machine didn't blow up.
It worked normally.

95
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,630
It removed our toxins.

96
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,881
<i>We're</i> the toxins.

97
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,759
Are you listening, you stupid
little garbage person?!

98
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,928
We're what got removed!

99
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,099
I hope you both found that
detox sufficiently relaxing.

100
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,435
Hey, man, listen, those comments
I made about your throat?

101
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,728
It's all good.

102
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,480
It's nice of you to let
me off the hook.

103
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,233
It's still unacceptable behavior,
and I do regret it.

104
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,193
Believe me, man, I've been
working here a long time.

105
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,152
I get it.

106
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,991
Hey, uh, you mind if I
put on some music?

107
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,117
Not at all.

108
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,746
♪ <i>Grab my terrifolds</i> ♪

109
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,581
- What is that?
- I just hit shuffle.

110
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,958
Are you kidding?

111
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,585
- This universe.
- Oh, excuse me.

112
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,504
We should listen to one random
song a day, you know?

113
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,089
We'd end up hearing more
songs we didn't like,

114
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,924
but we'd discover
a lot more that we did.

115
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,551
That is an interesting concept.

116
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,802
You know, it makes me wonder

117
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,178
if there's an algorithmic expression

118
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,888
that could achieve the ideal ratio.

119
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,181
Listen to me

120
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,934
trying to calculate
happiness over here.

121
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,477
Hoo, if anyone could, Rick.

122
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,437
Hey, here's something
no science could measure.

123
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,565
I'm real proud
to be your grandpa, Morty.

124
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,650
Thanks, Rick.
I love you.

125
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,152
Yeah, motherfucker!
Yeah! Get it! Get some!

126
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,488
Right up your fucking
bitch ass, you fuck!

127
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,448
Guess who just discovered
a new element?!

128
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,741
You think you could do that, Morty?

129
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,870
You think anyone but me could do
that ever in a billion years?

130
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,038
Do you think if God
existed he could do it?

131
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,081
The answer is no.

132
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,458
If God exists, it's fucking me.

133
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,127
Yes, Rick. I-I agree, Rick.

134
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,796
While you were flapping
your parasitic turd holster,

135
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,673
I discovered the toxic equivalent

136
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,799
of electricity, Morty.

137
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,884
What do you think about that?

138
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,760
Uh... I th... I think
my voice is annoying.

139
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,554
It is, <i>and</i> it's your best quality.

140
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,139
So true.

141
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,308
Now, who can tell me
the common denominator

142
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,184
of these two fractions?

143
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,520
You don't know or y'all just bored?

144
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,981
Hey, listen, you know, wha...
if we're all bored over here,

145
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,983
wouldn't the common denominator be you?

146
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,402
Damn, Morty. That's hilarious.

147
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,905
Normally I would come down
on any kind of disruption,

148
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,656
but it seems to represent
a positive change

149
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,657
for your character.

150
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,867
Class dismissed!

151
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,411
- Awesome, Morty!
- You done good, Morty.

152
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,495
Oh, yeah!

153
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,914
- Thanks for the advice, Morty.
- You got it.

154
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,665
- I did it, Morty!
- I knew you could.

155
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,875
Hey, Morty, remember yesterday

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,418
when I couldn't play the trombone?

157
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,794
Well, check this out!

158
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,756
Just like I told you, Mitch.

159
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,758
The music was in your heart
the whole time.

160
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,884
Stupid hat.

161
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,845
Wish I had the courage
to just be myself.

162
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,221
There you are.

163
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,225
You might have all these idiots fooled,

164
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,728
but I know you're still
the same pathetic loser

165
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,980
hiding behind a confident facade.

166
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,607
I know that because...

167
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,859
I'm doing the same thing, brother.

168
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,612
I'm not alone anymore!

169
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,782
Hey, Morty. Word around school is
you've become super healthy.

170
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,033
I don't know about all that.

171
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,452
I do, however, know that I have
a pretty bad case of

172
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,704
haven't taken you to dinner-itis.

173
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,206
Might be fatal.

174
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,041
Hey, kids.
Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.

175
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,459
Morty, a moment of your time?

176
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,877
Happy to help, Rick.

177
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,962
I hate to bug you with this,

178
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,547
but after our morning hike,
I started receiving very faint,

179
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,925
highly unusual transmissions
on my sub-ether phone.

180
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,009
Listen.

181
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,932
It's a bad phone. Chuck it.

182
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,142
I downgraded to a clamshell
for emergencies only.

183
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,894
You know, if... if...
if something's worth saying,

184
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,145
I-it's worth eye contact.

185
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,439
Uh, I-I-I traced the source of the call

186
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,941
back to the spa we went to, Morty.

187
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,275
I thought I could hear
a voice in there,

188
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,986
so I enhanced it, a-and listen.

189
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,489
<i>- Hey, asshole!
- Oh, man!</i>

190
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,449
<i>- Remember us?
- I don't like confrontation!</i>

191
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,326
<i>You fucked us,
you pieces of garbage!</i>

192
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,537
<i>That's right, you're
fucking garbage, not us.</i>

193
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,455
<i>I'm a fucking genius and a god.</i>

194
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,915
<i>You really think
this thing can hold me?</i>

195
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,542
<i>I'm gonna rip your throat...</i>

196
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,169
Morty, what if the toxic parts
of us have their own identities,

197
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,379
their own will to live?

198
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,214
W-What if mine shares my intelligence

199
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,091
and devised a way to reach out to us?

200
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,384
Sounds like he's in a lot of pain.

201
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,386
Lot. O. Pain.

202
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,263
But, you know, you shouldn't
have to deal with that, man.

203
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,723
You know, l-let's work off your trauma

204
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,099
with some urban spin yoga.

205
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,059
It's amazing.
You do yoga on a bike,

206
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,227
but you have an at-risk preteen...

207
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,438
I don't think I can just
blow this off, Morty.

208
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,898
If I had known it worked this way,
I wouldn't have detoxed.

209
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,984
Well, I would have because I was toxic.

210
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,237
Now I'm detoxed and I'm
accountable to my toxins, right?

211
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,198
- I-It's a dilemma.
- I think I know what to do.

212
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,867
- Morty!
- Rick!

213
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,161
You know, the only problem
here is a big fat brain

214
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,621
that misses eating
all them big fat problems.

215
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,332
Focus on the good things.
Trust me, things are good.

216
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,209
Taking that away from me

217
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,045
That wouldn't be healthy.

218
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh, man.
World's Greatest Grandpa, for reals.

219
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,635
It's not just a coffee cup
for you, bud.

220
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,054
You're legit.

221
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,185
I love drums.
I never took drum lessons.

222
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,229
Why? Limitations. We are addicted
to our own limitations.

223
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,314
How amazing is that?

224
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,732
Is the kale prepared in the kitchen?

225
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,400
- I'll have a water.
- Uh...

226
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,861
how is the... "cru-dite?"

227
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,280
Crudité. It's a cup of carrot sticks.

228
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,199
Ha! It's okay!
Pronounce it however you want.

229
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,867
Words are just things.
Please. Thank you.

230
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,202
We're having a conversation.

231
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,121
God, I am so excited to finally
have dinner with you.

232
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,581
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

233
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,083
It's like, whew!

234
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,709
I-I-I wish you'd shut up, though.

235
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,377
Just kidding. You know, you're so quiet.
What's wrong?

236
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,754
W-Why don't you tell me about yourself?

237
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,672
What's the atmosphere
like on planet Jessica?

238
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,840
Where's the equator?

239
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,051
What are the vacations
a-and the holidays?

240
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,886
I mean, you know
are they the same time?

241
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,055
- Talk to me.
- Well... I...

242
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,515
like this restaurant.

243
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,476
Holy shit! Holy shit!
We have a moron over here!

244
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,519
I'm an idiot.

245
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,978
I can't believe I haven't
thought of this.

246
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,022
You have to do this detox thing I did.

247
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,816
It's at an alien spa.
You go through it.

248
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,985
Fwoos-s-s-ssh, lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa.

249
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,530
Sucks everything out.

250
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,281
Everything that was holding
me back, everything bad,

251
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,783
I mean, it just

252
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:17,784
Right?

253
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,370
Cooooool.

254
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,789
Oh, my God! I can't believe this.

255
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,082
Yeah, phones are awful.
I downgraded to...

256
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,251
I totally forgot my...

257
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,754
I have a... thing, and...

258
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,381
- Things are good.
- You know what?

259
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,758
Why am I doing that?
That's more rude than the truth.

260
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,386
Look, I'm sorry, Morty.
I just don't think...

261
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,389
Do not. Even.
You have no need to explain.

262
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,390
It's all good.

263
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,933
I think you'd get bored with me.

264
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,852
E-Exactly.
Look, the sparks aren't flying.

265
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,603
This is what dating is for, you know?

266
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,564
First date, no sparks.

267
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,899
No damage, no worries.
Life is a highway.

268
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,734
We're gonna ride it all night lonnngg!

269
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,820
Gonna eat some "crudite." Mmm!

270
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,281
Is this organic? Mmm.
All right.

271
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,116
You know, the evening continues.

272
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,410
Okay, here we go.

273
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,704
Ma'am, I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

274
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,455
Your money's no good here.

275
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,957
I'll... I'll get the next round, sir.

276
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,668
- Aren't you a child?
- Only in the ways that matter.

277
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,628
- Morty.
- Stacy.

278
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,005
I've been watching you drink, Stacy.

279
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,548
I get the feeling
you've got a hard job.

280
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,216
I wonder what it takes to please you.

281
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,719
That's the job I want...
part time, full time,

282
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,304
I want to be good at it, bad at it.

283
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,307
I want to get promoted, fired,
corner office, hostile takeover,

284
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,349
workplace accident.

285
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,684
I'm on my knees, Stacy,

286
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,478
praying, worshiping, begging,
whatever you want.

287
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,981
What do you think about that?

288
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,650
Okay. Fuck it.

289
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,651
Tink.

290
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,905
Mm!

291
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,907
Let's ask my grandpa.
He's a scientist.

292
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,993
Hey, Rick, are you familiar
with Ben Wa technology?

293
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,036
Morty, great news.

294
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,579
I went back to the spa,
and they let me purchase

295
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,331
the containment unit
from their detoxifier.

296
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,290
Why?

297
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,666
Because we're coming home, bitch!

298
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,500
What is this?

299
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,920
This is the parts of your pussy
grandpa that keep it real.

300
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,796
Oh... Oh, and I think you
dropped something, too!

301
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,299
I don't want to be on-camera.
I'm ugly and gross. Please.

302
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,092
- Should I go?
- You're your own person, Stacy.

303
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,302
Then I'd like to stay.

304
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,345
Rick, please tell me

305
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,722
you're not trying to put
that stuff back inside of us.

306
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,350
Morty, I'm sorry. That stuff
is alive and it belongs with us.

307
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,518
We yanked them from their homes
and locked them in a can.

308
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,062
Motherfucker!

309
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,521
See? They're living in pain.

310
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,148
That's what they do, Rick.
They live in pain.

311
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,441
They <i>are</i> pain, you know?

312
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,401
Th-They're all the bad parts of us,
which, by the way,

313
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,653
includes our dishonesty,

314
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,239
so how do you know this isn't
all some sort of crazy trick?

315
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,074
Oh, so now because I'm
made entirely of toxins,

316
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,116
I'm also a liar?

317
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,410
Fuck you, you little sociopath.
You hear this, Morty?

318
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,828
Oh, everybody hates me.
I can tell.

319
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,247
- Y-You all hate me...
- All right, shut up, Morty.

320
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,539
Healthy Rick, are we doing this or what?

321
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,750
Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need
you to step into the booth.

322
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,919
Don't negotiate with that
little turd, dummy.

323
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,046
You're the Rick.
You need to show dominance.

324
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,924
Morty, booth, now. Booth!

325
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,175
- Come on, Morty.
- Don't touch me!

326
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,011
Morty, do the healthy thing
and voluntarily retoxify yourself.

327
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,012
Nooooo!

328
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,931
Is it wrong if I think
this is kind of hot?

329
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,016
Let me out of here!
Stacy, help! Open the door!

330
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,185
I need to hear our safe word, Morty.

331
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,728
Sea Cucumber!
Sea Cucumber!

332
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,604
What are you doing?

333
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,523
I'll do anything for you, Morty.

334
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,279
It worked! Yes!
That idiot believed every word.

335
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,906
Now let's see how <i>he</i> enjoys
living in that shit tank.

336
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,408
He's right behind me, isn't he?

337
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,160
- He's in <i>front</i> of you.
- My eyes are still adjusting.

338
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,996
Uh, is this like a sex dungeon?

339
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,415
I guess I should've been
paying attention.

340
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,042
After 70 years of being bottled up

341
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,919
inside a sentimental jackass,

342
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,337
I finally get to live my own life.

343
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,422
You said we were merging.

344
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,674
I lied, dumb-ass!
I lie about everything!

345
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,884
Why would I ever re-merge
with a pussy like you?

346
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,928
So... you were just gonna
trap us in that tank?

347
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:24,929
T-That was your plan?

348
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,806
Not <i>was</i>, motherfucker.
Still is.

349
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,558
Kill him, Rick!

350
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,059
I don't like this!
This is scary!

351
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,144
All right, you asked for it.

352
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,687
Did I ask for this?

353
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,273
Did I ask for this?
Huh? Did I?

354
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,567
<i>Assessing threat to groin.</i>

355
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,569
Groin System 6000. Kill him!

356
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,739
<i>That... is my groin's user.</i>

357
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,615
Believe me, I got a lot more
use out of that thing

358
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,450
than he ever did.

359
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,952
<i>You know what?
Not my table.</i>

360
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,542
<i>You </i>do<i> know me.</i>

361
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,794
What the hell, Grandpa Rick?

362
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,421
- Fuck you, Summer!
- Sorry, Summer!

363
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,758
Okay, okay, take it easy.
Don't do it.

364
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,345
I love you. Good boy.
Daddy's little boy.

365
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,596
Summer, get out of here! Go!

366
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,597
Oh, who's that?

367
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,349
Who's that over there?

368
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,434
Oh, no. You see the bad
man in front of you?

369
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,394
You're a good little boy.
You're gonna get him.

370
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,271
You're gonna get him.

371
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,815
Aah!

372
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,983
Son of a...

373
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,825
Ahh!

374
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,621
Nice try, asshole.

375
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,206
We can resolve our issues.

376
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,291
We don't need to resort
to over-the-top...

377
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,835
Aah!

378
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,754
I-I did it, Rick.
I got the tank!

379
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,589
I-I'm a piece of shit,
but I got the tank!

380
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,049
You're going in that tank,
motherfucker.

381
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,926
You're gonna live in that
toxic shit wasteland

382
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:45,968
like I had to do!

383
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:46,803
- Aah!
- Ow!

384
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,808
That's right, motherfucker.

385
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,434
You're going in that fuckin'...

386
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,145
Dads?

387
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,147
Okay, just... just leave her out of it.

388
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:58,981
What's going on?

389
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,316
All right, fuck this.
Time for plan B.

390
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,151
If I can't trap you in a toxic world,

391
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,445
I'll just make the whole world toxic.

392
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,240
It's okay, girls.

393
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,992
I-I'm so sorry I put us in danger
with some of my behavior.

394
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,537
I-If you'd like, I can
go out in the g-garden,

395
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,081
pick some fresh basil,
and make us a nice Scallopini.

396
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,041
What did the booger version of you mean

397
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,502
when he said he was going
to make the whole world toxic?

398
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,755
Believe me, sweetie, that man's
motivations are a mystery.

399
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,507
Screw that, Rick.
We got to stop him.

400
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,008
What's the last thing
you'd think about doing

401
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,051
with that tank thing?

402
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,803
Morty, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

403
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,388
but it's not our place, you know,

404
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,307
to pick and choose which world
gets saved from what apocalypse.

405
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,269
Our... Our toxins have as much
a right to their worldview as...

406
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,187
Morty, how is it healthy to slap me?

407
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,523
Obviously my version of health
is a hell of a lot different

408
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,233
from yours, you useless old turd.

409
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,234
Wait. That's it.

410
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,819
How could that detox machine
know the difference

411
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,947
between healthy and sick
for everything that goes through it?

412
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:48,781
It can't.

413
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,868
It must be by the individual's
own definition of toxicity.

414
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,661
That means...

415
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,413
- Dad!
- What... What the hell, Rick?

416
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,706
I'll explain on the way.

417
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,541
This "Moon Tower," Morty,

418
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,460
Is the perfect height
and metallic composition

419
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,045
for the amplification
and beaming of toxic energies.

420
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,213
What do you think about that, Morty?

421
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,506
Are you excited about that, Morty?

422
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,050
Oh, man. I'm just freaked out.
I-It's too high up here.

423
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,260
Once I flip this switch,

424
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,054
the entire world is gonna be
just as toxic as us, baby.

425
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,230
As we praise our loving Father...

426
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,983
God is a lie!
We made him up for money!

427
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,532
Santa Claus isn't real.

428
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,285
You were all mistakes!

429
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,954
We fuckin' did it, Morty.

430
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,247
Put your fuckin' hands in the air.

431
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,875
Yeah, you little piece of shit.

432
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,001
Remember me?

433
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,587
Didn't you learn last time
that you can't beat me?

434
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,506
Yeah, I did. And then
I learned something else.

435
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,257
- This.
- Aah!

436
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,801
That bullet is laced
with an encrypted nanobotic virus

437
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,596
that will disintegrate your Morty
in about, ah, 20 minutes.

438
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,597
You think I give a shit?

439
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,057
I know you give a shit, dummy.

440
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,225
Because I know I don't.

441
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,476
Here's another thing I know.

442
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,520
The decryption key
that neutralizes the virus.

443
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,854
You want it? Come and get it.

444
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,606
Merge with me and you'll know
how to save him.

445
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,982
Pfft. Come on, man.
I've been trapped

446
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,109
in your pussy brain
for 70 years of delusions,

447
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,112
but this is the all-time weakest
bluff that I've ever...

448
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,240
Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?!

449
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,574
He's cutting your time in half.

450
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,326
- 10 minutes.
- What is your problem?

451
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,495
Oh, I had all my problems
removed... my entitlement,

452
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,455
my narcissism, my crippling loneliness,

453
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,791
my irrational attachments.

454
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,626
They must be somewhere.
They ain't over here, bro.

455
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,127
I'm not going back in there!

456
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,671
Honestly, I don't care either way.

457
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,797
I hate having you in me.

458
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,423
And when I say "honestly"
you can believe it,

459
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,300
because we both know
I'm too healthy to lie.

460
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,760
Watch.

461
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,012
All right! Knock it off!
You're not impressing anyone.

462
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,973
Morty, not that I give a shit,
but are you okay?

463
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,975
- Jesus Christ, it hurts.
- Relax, quit your bitching.

464
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,018
Y-You're gonna be fine.
Grandpa's here.

465
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,603
You think that's funny?

466
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,522
Y-You got to have a sense
of humor about these things.

467
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,731
Oh, wait, you can't.

468
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,067
You're literally incapable
of seeing the bigger picture.

469
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,694
I guess it's just funny
because you've never done

470
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,529
anything but complain
about me being in charge,

471
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,240
but if I ever gave you the wheel
we'd be dead in five minutes.

472
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,867
- Rick?
- You poor, dumb, sick animal.

473
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:57,910
Rick?

474
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,162
Aah! Just do it!

475
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,039
Just do it, you piece of...

476
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,836
I'm back, baby! Regular Rick!
Master of both worlds!

477
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,212
Check it it out!

478
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,880
"Excuse me."

479
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,383
Now we'll just reverse
this hacky toxicity beam.

480
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,343
Man, I really overthink
shit when I'm angry.

481
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,348
Oh, give it to me.

482
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,809
Mm, ma-mah.

483
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,687
God is <i>not</i> a lie.

484
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:34,905
Mommy! Mommy!

485
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,365
Ha! All right, Morty,

486
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,284
now it's time we re-merge
your little ass.

487
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,327
You're a better man than me, Rick.

488
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,786
I'm healthy enough to admit that!

489
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,122
That kid is a real piece of shit.

490
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,665
Y-Y-You're gonna save me, right?

491
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,168
Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty.

492
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,879
Part of me really wanted to.

493
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,299
I'm telling you, these
shares are hot. Yeah.

494
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,384
That sounds like a good idea.
It's definitely a good idea.

495
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,803
Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it.
Now can you get me?

496
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,430
Have I ever lied to you?

497
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,683
That's right, and ask around,
I never do, Duane.

498
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,101
Let me put this real simple.

499
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,646
This stock is a beautiful
redhead, recently single,

500
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,148
not looking to date
but ready to fall in love,

501
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,609
and fate has put her locker
two down from yours, Duane...

502
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,778
two lockers down.

503
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,821
So step up or step off, Duane.

504
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,449
Blue pill or red pill,
what'll it be, bro?

505
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,161
Totally understand, Duane.

506
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,746
You're the boss.

507
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,289
Heinholz Biotech...

508
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,249
million and a half at thirty-three.

509
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,168
Heh.

510
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,253
You little fuckin' monster.

511
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,717
Mmm! Is this organic?

512
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,386
Mmm!

513
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,930
Go for Morty.

514
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,807
Hi, Morty. It's Jessica.

515
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,184
Look, can we just talk for a minute?

516
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,478
Is that how long it takes
for Rick to trace my location?

517
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,689
Come back, Morty. I miss you.

518
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:50,690
You miss the old me.

519
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,149
You miss someone
that loved you so much,

520
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,401
you never had to love 'em back.

521
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,985
How do you know I don't
want to love you?

522
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,446
- Because I'm not sick.
- Ex-girlfriend?

523
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,739
Should I be jealous?

524
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,199
There's nothing to be jealous of.

525
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,617
I just realized that I'm scheduled

526
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,078
to speak at that fundraiser
on our date night.

527
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,454
I can cancel.

528
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,997
We'll be together.
That's a date.

529
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,958
You are the perfect man.

530
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,460
Oh, sweetie, I think you
hit the wrong button.

531
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,628
You didn't hang up.

532
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,714
Huh. How 'bout that?

533
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,470
Sorry, tiny American Psycho.

534
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,723
Time to take the opposite
of your medicine.

535
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,642
Do what you got to do.

536
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,061
Oh! Ow! Aah!

537
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,522
So, how do you feel, Morty?

538
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,108
- Ah, geez. I'm miserable.
- Am I good or what?

539
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,444
I guess it's worth it, though,
to know how much you care.

540
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,113
Care? Me?
Morty, I'm fine with you.

541
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,699
- I only did this for him.
- You lying bitch.

542
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,826
She kept coming to our house,
Morty, and kept asking me,

543
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,244
"Did... Did... D-Did you
get a new Morty yet?"

544
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,913
Because you kept drunk-dialing
me and crying about it.

545
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,206
I wasn't crying!

546
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,374
Jacquelyn, I...

547
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,251
I-I-I wasn't who I said I was.

548
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,920
You weren't a 14-year-old
boy from the Midwest

549
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,756
who ran away from his family
and capitalized

550
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,508
on his lack of conscience
by becoming a stock broker?

551
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,719
Oh. I guess I was pretty
up front about that, wasn't I?

552
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,345
You were up front about everything.

553
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,680
You were my soul mate.

554
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,434
Well...
N-Not anymore. I'll, um...

555
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,935
Y-You can keep the apartment

556
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,854
and... and... and, uh... the drones.

557
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,938
She can't keep the drones.

558
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,440
They turn into a little Voltron robot.

559
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,566
They're awesome.

560
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,694
You can't keep the drones.

561
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,156
So, how was your date with Brad?

562
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,116
It wasn't a date.
We were just having lunch.

563
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,868
You guys are getting back
together, aren't you?

564
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,328
Morty, I need your help
on an adventure.

565
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,662
Eh, "need" is a strong word.

566
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,539
We need door stops,
but a brick would work, too.

567
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,749
Okay.

568
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,168
Morty.

569
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,796
Good to have you back.

570
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,007
Have you ever been peed on before?

571
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,760

they were popular
in the late 19th century.

589

An entire town could be
illuminated by...

590

What the hell is this?

591
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,056
