1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,586
Morty, hurry!

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,005
Return the Truth Tortoise!

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,257
Morty, whatever you do,
don't drop the Truth Tortoise!

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,425
Also really important,

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,385
whatever you do,
don't look into its eyes!

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,055
I-I did look at it, Rick!
I've been looking at it!

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,223
Now you're gonna know
everything, Morty!

8
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,058
Good job! Way to go!
You fucked everything up!

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,521
It's in my head!

10
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:21,480
Ah!

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,862
Oh, geez, I-I can't get that
Truth Tortoise out of my head.

12
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,781
Yeah, I told you not
to look into its eyes.

13
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,824
Hey, Morty, let's watch some
interdimensional cable.

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,825
Remember how we used to do that?

15
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,619
Rick, I can't... I can't go on.

16
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,870
I-I can't go on like this

17
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,413
with the Truth Tortoise
shit in my head.

18
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,623
I-I wish you could just...

19
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,917
Erase the memory from your mind?

20
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,752
How did you know I was gonna say that?

21
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,420
Come on, Morty, come with me.

22
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,673
After you.

23
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,509
What the hell is this?!

24
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,219
This, Morty, is my archive

25
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,513
of all the experiences
you've begged me to remove

26
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,932
from your life, lest you go insane.

27
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,644
I call them Morty's Mind Blowers.

28
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,021
And we'll be doing this instead
of interdimensional cable.

29
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,014
How long have I been asking
you to remove memories?

30
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,349
Since the first time
your mind was blown.

31
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,851
Ahh, here it is.

32
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,269
Classic.

33
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,645
There's no dust on it because

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,272
this isn't the first time
we've done this.

35
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:49,234
- What?!
- I call this one "Moonspiracy"!

36
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,451
Huh, wow. That's incredible.

37
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,911
What the heck?

38
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,999
Morty, do you realize
how ridiculous that sounds?

39
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,250
Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty.

40
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,209
Are you serious?

41
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,879
Half the crap we've seen,
and you think that sounds crazy?

42
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,589
I've been to 300 versions
of Earth's moon,

43
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,549
including this one,
and I've never seen signs

44
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,635
of a "regular dude,"
as you describe him,

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,636
hanging out up there.

46
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,721
It's probably just
a smudge on the lens.

47
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,224
Smudge on the lens?
Smudge on the lens?!

48
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,393
I know the difference
between a man threatening me

49
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,437
and a smudge on the goddamn lens, Summer!

50
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,397
Morty, calm down!
Are you feeling okay?

51
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,274
I'm fine!

52
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,901
So sensitive.

53
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,738
Kids, I'd like to introduce you all

54
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,783
to our new guidance counselor,
Mr. Lunas.

55
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,285
I look forward to helping guide you all

56
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,537
towards a brighter future.

57
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,040
I believe every student should...

58
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,459
shoot for the moon.

59
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,757
Got you now, you son of a bitch.

60
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,303
What's this?

61
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,931
Proof that Mr. Lunas isn't
who he says he is!

62
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,099
He's not a guidance counselor?

63
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,060
I-I assume he's qualified to be one.
Who isn't?

64
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,271
But he also lives on the moon.

65
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,190
Okay.

66
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,776
Hmm. Is that it?

67
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,277
Is he doing anything to hurt anyone?

68
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,904
Oh, he's up to something.

69
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,323
I think I understand.

70
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,367
"Up to something," "lives on the moon."

71
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,743
Okay, I'll talk to him.

72
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,965
What did he say?

73
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,092
Denied the moon stuff,
but that's what pedophiles do.

74
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,427
They deny.
It's their bread and butter.

75
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,803
- Pedophile?
- You don't think so?

76
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,179
I thought the moon thing
might have been code.

77
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,306
No, he's literally from the moon!

78
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,516
Well, you saw him react.

79
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,185
Moon or not, that dude likes 'em young.

80
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,193
Gordon Lunas was a good Marine.

81
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,571
We don't know what drove
him to take his own life,

82
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,531
but we want to remember
the good things.

83
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,907
Like how, from a certain angle,

84
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,369
some people would say
he looked like a smudge.

85
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,917
Oh, my God, what have I done?

86
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,419
What have I done?

87
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,380
Jesus, I made that guy kill himself!

88
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,590
Only in a literal sense.

89
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,843
Here's one I call "Morty's Menagerie."

90
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,011
They don't all have titles, though.

91
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,637
It's not a "Simpsons" Halloween special,

92
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,224
more like a clip show made
of clips you never saw!

93
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,102
I can't believe we got put
into a menagerie.

94
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,271
So this guy collects living beings?

95
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,981
Yeah, you know like
commemorative plates,

96
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,065
but less off-putting.

97
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,234
You'll get it when you're still
actively dating in your 40s.

98
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,236
Assess this with cold indifference,

99
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,196
you veiny-headed prick!

100
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,531
Hey, keep it down!

101
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,283
Just our luck, menagerie beneath

102
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,327
the "boulder people" of Granitor Seven.

103
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,495
I can't take it anymore, Rick!

104
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,079
Relax, Morty!

105
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,540
I can't relax! R-R-Rick, we...
we gotta get outta here!

106
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,209
I don't care what it takes! Anything!

107
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,877
- Anything?
- Anything!

108
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,712
All right, well, you're gonna
have to take off your shirt.

109
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,714
Not yet. I'll tell you when.

110
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,304
Dear God.

111
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,889
What?

112
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,308
The signal turned out to be...

113
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,268
there's no other way to put it...

114
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,103
- Instructions.
- For?

115
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,148
A vehicle, sir, an interstellar vehicle.

116
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,901
We'll need a pilot.
I wonder if there's a volunteer.

117
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,860
Mm.

118
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,197
Oh, the schematics specify
a second, smaller pilot.

119
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,324
I mean, they really specify smaller.

120
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,785
They have to be exactly 5'3".

121
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,371
Chang, you may have
majored in Liberal Arts,

122
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,790
but I think you're about
to make history.

123
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,335
Primary systems, check.

124
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,420
Auxiliary systems, check.

125
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,964
See you soon.

126
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,885
Okay, now.

127
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,680
Greetings.

128
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,806
You're... You look...

129
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,392
We've possessed forms
your mind can accept.

130
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,727
Here are some customary clothing gifts.

131
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,437
Please, put them on.

132
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,690
- May we?
- Of course, yes.

133
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,275
We followed your instructions.

134
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,986
We have so much to learn from you.

135
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,529
I know, right?

136
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,371
Hey, how come I was able to see
those other people's memories?

137
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,164
I-I wouldn't have been around for that.

138
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,791
Yeah, sometimes I gotta do
a little editing, Morty.

139
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,084
It helps the mind blowers

140
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,794
play a little bit better upon revisiting.

141
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,131
I call this one "The Whole Enchilada.

142
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,592
Here, Morty, this'll make
your urine drinkable.

143
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,802
Now can we keep shopping?

144
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,470
I am Zikzak.

145
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,890
Ah, shit, Morty, get behind me.
It's a fucking alien overlord!

146
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,683
It's okay. Here.

147
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,143
Oh, I misjudged.

148
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,854
"I am Floop Floopian. Please kill me."

149
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,855
That's right, Morty.

150
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,608
The Floop Floopians achieve
an eternal orgasmic afterlife,

151
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,985
so long as they're killed
by a great warrior.

152
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,904
I'm flattered, by the way.
Thank you very much.

153
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,363
So you're gonna kill him?

154
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,198
Eh, let's get some lunch first.

155
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,413
So, you want to get
shot in the head, or...

156
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,081
Well, as long as the wound is fatal,

157
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,458
I don't really mind where you shoot me.

158
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,001
Cool. I'm gonna go take a quick shit.

159
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,629
Well, I gotta say.
You know, I'm a little envious.

160
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,714
Your species has an actual afterlife.

161
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,008
- That's gotta be nice.
- Wh-What do you mean?

162
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,802
Well, you know, here on Earth,
w-we don't know what's going on.

163
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,971
It must be nice for you guys to,
you know, have that...

164
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,390
have that proof's in the pudding,
you know, evidence.

165
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,437
Evidence?
There's supposed to be evidence?

166
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,023
Um, yeah, uh...

167
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,110
Otherwise, how do you
know if it's true?

168
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,156
Wait, you don't...

169
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,701
All right, so you want to do
this here or outside?

170
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,829
Run!

171
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,624
I don't wanna die!

172
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,714
Oh, God, it's all real!
Oh, it hurts!

173
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,341
Oh, I shouldn't have doubted it!

174
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,343
I shouldn't have let you
make me doubt it!

175
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,054
Aah! I blame you, I blame you!

176
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,306
But he said there wasn't any evidence!

177
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,557
That was a ton of evidence!

178
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,642
Well, silver lining.

179
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,893
Now I know their religion's real.

180
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,770
They have a hell,
and it does not look good.

181
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,814
I noticed you never
finished your chimichanga,

182
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,900
so I got some room for it now,
if you know what I mean.

183
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,318
Holy shit!

184
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,487
How many of these are just
horrible mistakes I've made?

185
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,989
I mean, maybe I'd stop making so many

186
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,240
if I let myself learn from them!

187
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,283
Don't break your back
creating a lesson, Morty.

188
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,576
It's a freeform anthology.

189
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,245
I'm getting annoyed
you're not hearing that.

190
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,330
As you can see around me,
your mind's been blown

191
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,543
countless times,
and not always by yourself.

192
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,294
Ah, shit, I don't even...

193
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,671
This better not have been a good one.

194
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,672
What is this?

195
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,882
Great, "Booger AIDS," "AIDS Booger."

196
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,509
I gotta start using real file names.

197
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,219
In the meantime, enjoy a grab bag

198
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,598
of mind blowers I call
"Poop AIDS underscore copy."

199
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,018
I'm not an unreasonable
man, Beth Smith.

200
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,270
I know children are everything
to a mammal.

201
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,772
I will spare one of their lives.

202
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,733
You simply have to choose.

203
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,152
Summer!
Summer.

204
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,282
You're not gonna believe this.

205
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,992
I went to Phoebe instead of Titan.

206
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,411
It's, like, hello, Saturn,
after 10 moons,

207
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,913
time to stop naming and start
numbering, you know?

208
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,291
What's... Wh-What's with you assholes?

209
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,334
Morty, please, don't do this.

210
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,046
Your Morty is gone!

211
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,132
I am Voltamatron, Destroyer of Worlds!

212
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,551
Grandpa Rick, there must be
some scientific way to save him!

213
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,678
Not scientific, but there may be a way.

214
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,306
Morty, I know you're in there.
It's me, your grandpa.

215
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,058
I know I can be mean,
but I love you, Morty.

216
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,642
We all do. You gotta fight this thing.

217
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,186
I know you can.
You're stronger than all of us!

218
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,646
Morty, it's Mom! We love you.
You have to fight it!

219
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,232
Come on, Morty!
Fight that stupid worm thing!

220
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,275
We love you!

221
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,610
We love you so much!

222
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,320
Yes, Morty, come on, you're doing it!

223
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,989
You're doing it!
You're doing it!

224
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,534
Should we pull it out?

225
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,995
No, don't touch it.
Just keep loving Morty!

226
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,081
We still love you.

227
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,166
But I do have a thing at 6:00.

228
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,709
Oh, God, do I have to keep looking?

229
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,003
Geez, Morty, come on,
pinch it off already!

230
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,133
Don't! Oh, God, sorry, Morty.
I love you!

231
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,969
God, is there going to be
an intermission?

232
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,764
Excuse me, but I ordered
the large evil space worm.

233
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,516
I know, it's like, is that a demon slug

234
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,392
in your stomach,
or are you just happy to...

235
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,269
Sorry!

236
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,272
Well, I guess it's nice to know
the whole family sucks!

237
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,774
So if the blue ones are my fault

238
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,401
and the purple ones are my family's,
what are the red ones?

239
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,029
Yeah, d-don't read into it, Morty!

240
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,032
Ahh.

241
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,535
Shit! We need to find shelter
before the sunset, Morty.

242
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,037
Venzenulon Nine has a night
temperature of 300 below!

243
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,081
We'll freeze, Morty!
W-We'll be dead in seconds!

244
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,291
I-I think I saw a cave over there.

245
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,501
You've seen too many movies, Morty.

246
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,379
A cave isn't gonna cut it.
We're gonna have to use Beebo.

247
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,048
Beebo led us to water!
He's our friend!

248
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,716
- He won't even feel it!
- Oh, no, no!

249
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,139
You wanna die, Morty?
Get in Beebo!

250
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,850
Oh, no, no!

251
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,060
Brace for the ice limit.

252
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,770
Here it comes!

253
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,361
Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine
or Venzenulon Seven?

254
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,823
Wait a minute. Why would I ask
for that to be removed?

255
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,616
Are the red ones stuff
<i>you</i> wanted removed?

256
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,286
Ooh, that's clever, Morty,
but I don't use color to sort things

257
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,413
because I'm not a mouse
in a European children's book.

258
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,290
Then why are all those
pink ones by the liquor?

259
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,250
Liquor?

260
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,634
- Shit, that was close.
- We lost Captain Sky.

261
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,261
He gave his life for the uprising.

262
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,555
Yeah. It really makes
you think, huh, Morty?

263
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,432
We should never take
things for granite.

264
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,225
- What?
- I'm just saying, life's short.

265
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,727
We shouldn't take things for granite.

266
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,770
- Are you saying "granite"?
- Well, yeah.

267
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,689
It's "granted," with a "D."

268
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,567
Take things for granted.
Did you actually think it was...

269
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,444
Jesus Christ, Rick,

270
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,696
what are you, a boulder...
a rock person?

271
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,156
How long have you
been saying that wrong?

272
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,282
Oh, you like that, huh?

273
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,409
I b-b-bet that really blows your mind.

274
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,869
I mean, yeah, it's kind of great.

275
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,163
- You want me to erase it?
- What, you can do that?

276
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,290
Ah, shit.

277
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,667
I fucking knew it, you piece of shit!

278
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,170
You... You...
You're a fucking asshole, Rick!

279
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,005
Take it easy, Morty.
Come on. Just relax.

280
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,506
No, I'm not gonna fucking relax!
Come here!

281
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,716
Let go of me, you little bitch!

282
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,926
I'm gonna grab you
by the scruff of your...

283
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,720
- Take that!
- Ohh!

284
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,555
- Umm.
- Umm. Uhh.

285
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,098
- What...
- What's going on?

286
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,225
- Where am I?
- Who are we?

287
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,311
- Who am I?
- I think I'm an adolescent boy.

288
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,897
Huh, and I'm an elderly man.

289
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:15,151
And we appear to be in some kind
of secret confined space.

290
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,820
- Yeah, umm...
- Don't look at me like that.

291
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,406
For all we know,
you could be the fuckin' weirdo.

292
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,494
Huh, these things are
obviously storage units,

293
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,371
and since we can't remember
what went wrong,

294
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,207
my guess is that the technology
involves memory

295
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,502
and that this thing
on your head is designed to...

296
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,212
Tell us the code, jagoff!

297
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,173
It's pointless.
He's stonewalling.

298
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,509
Rick, if we don't unlock
those vaccines, Earth dies!

299
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,594
You know, it might be time
to step up your interrogation!

300
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,971
Not sure what you're implying, Morty,

301
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,764
but some lines I don't cross.

302
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,516
Yeah, well, I crossed every line I had

303
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,060
when this bastard tried to kill Jessica!

304
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,941
Okay, see those two fleshy
sacs under his chin, Morty?

305
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,067
Grab 'em.

306
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,403
You remember the codes now?

307
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,531
Twist!

308
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,992
Give us the codes, man!
Twist harder, Morty!

309
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,952
Harder!

310
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,288
Okay, let go, let go, let him breathe.

311
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,124
He wants to make a deal.

312
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,543
Half the codes now,
half after you finish.

313
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,461
But can we trust... Wait, what?

314
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,546
F-Finish what?

315
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,588
Y-You know.

316
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,299
I thought I was torturing him!

317
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,800
Oh, and this disappoints you?

318
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,468
Do I tell him we don't
have a deal, Morty?

319
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,886
Because if we can kill our enemies

320
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,015
but we can't jack them off,
then how are we better than them?

321
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,808
Well, what did you find out?

322
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,518
We're partners, I guess,

323
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,271
and we fight aliens,
like "Men in Black"?

324
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,981
"Men in Black," "Men in Black."

325
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,524
I have "Men in Black 2" in here.

326
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,151
So... So you get the general idea.

327
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,694
Not quite.

328
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,487
It's basically an endless
string of callbacks to...

329
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,741
All right, save it for YouTube.
I'll keep looking for clues.

330
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,996
What are you doing?

331
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,414
You want your shelf level or not?

332
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,125
And if I say yes, you're gonna
provide that for me with that?

333
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,293
Yes, see the bubble?

334
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,003
I'm familiar with the bubble, Morty.

335
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,921
I also dabble in precision,

336
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,965
and if you think you
can even approach it

337
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,092
with your sad, naked, caveman eyeball

338
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,595
and a bubble of fucking air,
you're the reason this species

339
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,096
is a failure, and it makes me angry!

340
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,097
You're drunk.

341
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,016
You want to put up a shelf,
put up a shelf.

342
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,268
You want to experience true level?

343
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,021
- Do you?
- Y-yes.

344
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,741
Ugh, all right, come on.

345
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,916
Wow, it's so...

346
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,170
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh,
Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.

347
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,672
Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.

348
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,008
Morty, come on,
we're leaving for school.

349
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,677
Oh, everything's crooked!
Reality is poison!

350
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,012
I want to go back!
I hate this!

351
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,222
- What's his deal?
- Can't live like this!

352
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,015
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
Morty, Morty, Morty.

353
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,892
Go to school, Summer.
I'll go in Morty's memory

354
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,435
and do a little...

355
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,813
Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!

356
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,189
Well?

357
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,526
You seem to be in charge
of what I get to remember.

358
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,569
- Why?
- Good question.

359
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,323
Morty, I need darkness to prime
these optical inductors.

360
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,700
Hit the leftmost light switch
by the door for me.

361
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,701
The left.

362
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,627
Okay, lights on.

363
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,090
So, did I just hear three distinct
light switch clicks?

364
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,508
W-W-What do you mean?

365
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,593
I feel like the three sounds
I heard could be explained

366
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,513
by an initial erroneous flipping
of a switch on the right

367
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,473
followed by a hasty,
corrective flipping

368
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,641
of the requested switch.

369
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,436
Then during the resultant
darkness and silence, a third,

370
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,522
shameful unflipping
of the initially flipped switch.

371
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,441
Is my assessment accurate?

372
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,902
Yeah, that's... that's basically how...
how it all shaked out.

373
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,156
- I'm sorry.
- Ugh. All right, come on.

374
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,450
- What?!
- Come on!

375
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,132
Grab a shovel.

376
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,383
W-What is...

377
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,510
Grab a shovel!

378
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,264
What was that?

379
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,352
I can't find a goddamn
zip tie anywhere!

380
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,605
All right, fuck it!

381
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,861
Ahh, zip tie.

382
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,588
Why are you making me
do this for you again?

383
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,090
Who doesn't wish they could
talk to animals, Rick?

384
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,467
Most humans!

385
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,469
There, I'm done.
Just stay out of trouble!

386
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,263
Gotta keep moving. Can't stop.

387
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,432
Up, down, down, up, up, up,
down, up, stop, down.

388
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,017
The queen needs food.
The babies need food.

389
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,685
The queen makes babies.

390
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,188
The situation in Argentina

391
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,606
has proven less convenient
than predicted.

392
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,983
We'll have to re-destabilize
their economy,

393
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,402
refocus labor class outrage
from upper to middle,

394
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,488
foster a coup, and install
a compliant regime.

395
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,489
Same as Guatemala?

396
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,823
Yes, but you can double-time it.

397
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,158
We need a quorum to pick a new pope

398
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,827
in case the Exxon/Monsanto
thing falls through in Africa.

399
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,413
Why not use chemtrails?
Put a canopy on Uganda.

400
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,332
They're set to agitate any mo...
What?

401
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,167
That kid is watching us.

402
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,877
So, we're squirrels.
He's a kid.

403
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,047
He's watching us like he hears
what we're saying.

404
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,675
Hey, kid. Young man?
Come here, little boy.

405
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,386
Tell Daphne to run a 199
on a possible Dolittle.

406
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,347
Little boy! We'll give you wishes
if you can hear us!

407
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,391
We can make you fly and get candy.

408
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,985
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Fuck me! Fuck me!

409
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,445
Rick!

410
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,739
Ah, shit, Morty, what did you do?

411
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,580
All right, Morty, pack your shit!

412
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,707
That's only gonna keep 'em down
for a little bit, Morty!

413
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,166
You fucked with squirrels, Morty!

414
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,501
We got a good five minutes

415
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,420
before they're backing up
on our ass, Morty!

416
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,672
We have to pack up and move
to a new reality, Morty!

417
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,258
You know I said we could only
do that a couple of times!

418
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,344
We're fucked over here because
of these damn squirrels, Morty!

419
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,305
I don't know what my reaction is,

420
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,016
but I think I'm mounting
in suspicion of you.

421
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,435
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna remember everything!

422
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,394
Everything!

423
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,487
Yeah!

424
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,035
Ow!

425
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,746
Ah!

426
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,999
Ow!

427
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,468
Well, what'd you find out?

428
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,762
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you gonna do, kill me?

429
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,723
No, I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill myself!

430
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,516
All those memories just erased!

431
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,226
Sitting in this room collecting dust!

432
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,146
W-What's the point of going on
if most of everything

433
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,940
that happens just
ends up sitting in here?

434
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,318
All right, kid.

435
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,320
I don't know much aside from
the fact that "Men in Black 2"

436
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,573
was a joyless cash grab, but I do
know that whatever you have

437
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,950
brewing around in your noggin
really connected with you.

438
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,077
I can't deny that,

439
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,621
and I can't deny that I'm
inspired by your passion.

440
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,623
I want in.
Suicide pact!

441
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,667
Yes, yeah, let's do it!

442
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,336
Together, you old son of a bitch!
On three!

443
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,587
One...

444
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,838
Two...

445
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,008
You guys doing Morty's Mind Blowers?

446
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,843
Morty's Mind Blowers?

447
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,262
Grandpa, is this a scenario three?

448
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,723
Uh, w-what's that, and w-who are you?

449
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,685
Oh, man, it's a scenario four.

450
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,662
Ugh, fucking God damn it!

451
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,580
I don't get paid enough for this shit!

452
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,668
<i>There's a Craftsman nearby.
I can smell it.</i>

453
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,045
Whoa, what... what...

454
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,088
<i>Can I help you?</i>

455
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,924
H-How did we fall asleep
during interdimensional cable?

456
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,676
- Yeah, what the hell, Summer?
- Summer, you dumb bitch!

457
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,927
How long were we out, you dumb bitch!

458
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,970
How much interdimensional cable
did we miss, you stupid bitch!

459
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,888
How many improv TV shows
with commercials did we miss, Summer?

460
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,014
Why did you let us fall asleep?

461
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,391
- You dumb bitch!
- You stupid bitch!

462
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,726
All right, Morty, fuck this noise.

463
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,310
Let's get out of here
and go on a classic

464
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,063
- Rick and Morty adventure.
- Yeah, right, Rick, I'm all-in.

465
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,149
No wonder you're constantly fighting

466
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,859
with each other and behind schedule.

467
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,485
- What?
- Nothing.

468
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,264
Rick?
Hello?

469
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,849
Just here for my putter.

470
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,435
Jerry's Mind Blowers?

471
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,732
Follow the boys!

472
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,530
We're charged and aimed
at Alpha Centauri,

473
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,532
ready for transport.

474
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,951
They fell for it!
Let's send Gobo home!

475
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,453
All right!

476
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,538
- Where's Dad?
- He should be here any second.

477
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,415
It's funny, Jerry spent
his life seeking attention,

478
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,709
but in the end, humanity's
instinctive dismissal of him

479
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,127
saved an alien's life.

480
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,962
He knows where to go, right?

481
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,881
Yep, any minute now.

482
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,054
Did it work?
Did you guys get Gobo home?

483
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,431
You have Gobo! You were supposed
to bring him to the hill!

484
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,141
As if. He was in your basket.

485
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,851
He was in your car!

486
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,565
Oh!

487
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,609
Oof! Dibs on his stuff.
