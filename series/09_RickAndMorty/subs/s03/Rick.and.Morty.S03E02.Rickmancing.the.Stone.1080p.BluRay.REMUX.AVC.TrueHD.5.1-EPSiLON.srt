1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:02,586
Ohh!

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,172
Summer, next time we're hiding
in a Colorkian echo nest,

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,299
can you do me a favor
and turn your ringer off?

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,134
It's called "carpe diem," Morty.

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,385
- Look it up.
- You look it up!

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,095
Y-Y-You don't even...
You don't even know what it means!

7
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:13,472
That's because losers look stuff up

8
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,266
while the rest of us
are carpin' all them diems.

9
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,476
Listen to your sister, Morty.

10
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,727
To live is to risk it all.

11
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,062
Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk

12
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,605
of randomly assembled molecules

13
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,440
drifting wherever the universe blows you.

14
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,651
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jerry, I didn't see you there.

15
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,069
H-How much of that did you hear?

16
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,446
All of it.
You were looking right at me.

17
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,241
I just wanted to say
goodbye to the kids.

18
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,367
Cool. Just stay in the driveway.

19
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,327
The killbots are live,
and I took you off the white list.

20
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,663
W-We'll see you every other
weekend, though, right?

21
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:38,914
Absolutely, Morty.

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,332
A-And your Mom's lawyer says

23
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,000
if I can get enough in the settlement,

24
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,419
he can help me sue for full custody.

25
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,754
Th-That'll be nice.

26
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,173
- Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving.
- Bye, Dad.

27
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,883
Rick, didn't you say you needed my help

28
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,094
on an adventure immediately
somewhere else...

29
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,804
I don't care...
even if it might kill us?

30
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,806
I did not, but if you're
really that alienated,

31
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,600
I'm as willing to exploit it
as the next guy, church, army,

32
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,686
or Olympic gymnastics trainer.

33
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,937
I'm ready when you are.

34
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,273
Bitch, I was ready yest...

35
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,108
Bye, sweetie.

36
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,526
Well, I-I better...

37
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,320
Sure. Sounds important.

38
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,282
If you're looking for our kids,

39
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,784
your father did a-a portal, uh...

40
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,619
Okay.

41
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,549
Loser.

42
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,301
What?

43
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,677
Hello?

44
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,262
Morty, shoot the Mohawk guy!

45
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,222
- They all have Mohawks!
- High fade,

46
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,308
chartreuse with cyan highlights,
layered on top.

47
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,267
Shoot him!

48
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,773
Ah!

49
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,066
Light them up.

50
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,567
Ahh!

51
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,444
Fuck! Get in the game, Morty!

52
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,196
Give me your flask!

53
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,575
Holy shit!
Summer for the win!

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,701
I fucking love

55
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,079
post-apocalyptic versions of Earth!

56
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,958
Here we go!

57
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,252
Isotope 322.

58
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,462
This stuff's so powerful, Morty,

59
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,799
it makes Isotope 465
look like Isotope 317.

60
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,384
Uh-huh, yeah. Is it powerful enough

61
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,302
to keep those guys from murdering us?

62
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,930
- Summer!
- Hold on.

63
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,056
I want to try something.

64
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,476
Rick, can we not leave
without my sister?

65
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,604
Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty.

66
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,314
I mean, n-not that I want
to spend the rest of my day

67
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,440
looking for another one.

68
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,817
"Sum-sum," let's go!

69
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,986
Grandpa's concern
for your safety is fleeting!

70
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,906
Your blood will be my lotion.

71
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,538
Whoa. That was cool.

72
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,457
Kill me, please.

73
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,960
Okay, but not because you told me to.

74
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,713
- Summer!
- Okay. Getting darker.

75
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,342
Jesus Christ. Summer!

76
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,343
Aw, come on.

77
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,806
Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes

78
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,890
where I can see them.

79
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,642
I am Hemorrhage.

80
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,271
You have removed weak blood
from us and made us stronger.

81
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,358
We can combine our strength
and feast on the weak together.

82
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,943
Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?

83
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,320
They don't have to keep trying
to kill us if we join them.

84
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,031
- They're basically pussies.
- What is your deal lately?

85
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,366
All right, let's get sloppy.

86
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,409
Oh, whoa.

87
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,744
Uh, uh, what's, uh...

88
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,537
What's that little bauble
you got back there?

89
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,788
Th-Th-That's interesting.

90
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,331
That is our glowing rock.

91
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,792
We carry it with us for desecration,

92
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,586
to remind us there are no gods.

93
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,965
Kids, weird pitch.
Let's have this be our new life.

94
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,968
Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers!

95
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:20,927
- Okay.
- What?

96
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,392
Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers

97
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,769
are going to what used to be Seattle

98
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:29,978
to hunt what used to be people.

99
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,855
- I'm going.
- Sounds good. Stay hydrated.

100
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,857
Listen, Rick, Summer's been
acting pretty crazy lately.

101
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,443
You know, I mean, I-I think
the divorce is affecting her.

102
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,694
And, you know, I don't think this is

103
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,196
a great place for her to be right now.

104
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,907
Oh, get off your high horse,
Professor Ski Lodge.

105
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,784
This world may be rough
around the edges,

106
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,410
but it's got its charms.

107
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,870
Bicep or quadricep?

108
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,331
Uh, bicep.

109
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,962
Seriously, Rick?

110
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,547
Is it really easier to eat human flesh

111
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,050
than to just tell me
why we're still here?

112
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,469
No. Okay, I'll level with you.

113
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,221
You see that green rock, Morty?

114
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,472
It's about 20 pounds of the stuff

115
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,182
I was getting all hard for a flake of.

116
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,725
Isotope 322.

117
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,018
Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it

118
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,311
is better than having a flake.

119
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,188
I can explain the math
to you later, but...

120
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,481
Summer just ran off with strangers

121
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,941
that have "Death" in their name,

122
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,901
and the rest of their
name was "Stalkers."

123
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,194
Huh, could be therapeutic for her.

124
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,613
She has been acting
pretty crazy lately, Morty.

125
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,281
I mean, her parents are going
through a divorce...

126
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,826
God damn it, Rick,
that's what I... Fine.

127
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,203
Just grab the stupid
thing while I grab her,

128
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,538
and let's get the "F" out of "H."

129
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,748
No, no, no. Morty, there's
too much heat on the bogey.

130
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,333
I need you to distract the camp.

131
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,960
"Distract"?
They eat each other.

132
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,628
What... What do you want me
to do to get their attention,

133
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,754
put on a puppet show?

134
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,381
Right idea, wrong genre, Morty.

135
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,675
The equivalent here would be...

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,593
Hey, you guys ever use
that Thunderdome,

137
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,303
or do you just put it up
for decoration?

138
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,681
Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?

139
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,766
Save it for the Semantics Dome,
E.B. White.

140
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,059
Ohh, burn!

141
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,686
The important question is,

142
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,147
who wants to take a poke
at my man Spine Eater here?

143
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,109
I guess I'll see your
asses in that dome!

144
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,402
Rick, what the hell, man?

145
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,611
Wh-What are you, out of your mind?

146
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,280
Morty, relax.
You're gonna be a ringer.

147
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,239
Come here.

148
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,326
This device extracts
and redistributes muscle memory.

149
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,121
I'm giving your body a 10-year
course in wasteland combat

150
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,290
- one limb at a time.
- Ow!

151
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,708
I'm working with a mixed bag here,

152
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,127
so you may not have perfect
coordination, Morty... Ugh!

153
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,837
- Hey!
- I-I didn't do that!

154
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,006
Okay, this is exciting.

155
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,300
We're making some discoveries
about muscle memory.

156
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,177
Ooh! Help! Help!

157
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,596
Oh, sweet, man!

158
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,516
And so it begins, my pretties!

159
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,686
Oh, God! Stop! Stop!
This is horrible!

160
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,771
Just stick and move, Morty!

161
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,398
Wear him out!

162
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,319
How come you guys dress like

163
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,820
you're in a theme-park stunt show,

164
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,323
but these guys wear khakis
and hockey jerseys?

165
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,034
After the boom-boom,
some adapted to the new truth,

166
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,786
and some chose to huddle
near the boomy holes,

167
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,331
clinging to the lie
of the before-fore times.

168
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,751
The raidy-rays rotted them away,
leaving only their love

169
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,711
for the vert-vert-isements
on billyboards.

170
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,629
Jesus Christ.

171
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,214
Did the boomy-booms blow up
all your wordy-word books?

172
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,841
You mean dictionaries?

173
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,517
I think I was a child
before the boom-booms.

174
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,728
I think I looked like this.

175
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,021
Want to piss on him?

176
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,314
Get out of my head.

177
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,858
Ha ha! Whoo!

178
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
Unbelievable!

179
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,402
A new champ!

180
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,112
Okay, no more!

181
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,198
And he wants more!

182
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,783
No, I don't!

183
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,661
Someone make this stop!

184
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,580
Mister, please get out of here,
or you're gonna die!

185
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,540
I have nothing to do with this!

186
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,917
Morty.

187
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,628
Why would you want this to happen?

188
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,047
All you had to do was go away!

189
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,092
Stop standing in the driveway
talking about custody!

190
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,718
And either tell her you
want to stay married

191
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,845
or get on with your life,
but whatever you do,

192
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,889
stop being a baby and act like a man!

193
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,103
Thank you.

194
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,980
Morty, that was amazing!

195
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,232
This is my brother!

196
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,942
Not that family means anything!

197
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,568
This family does.

198
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,154
All right.
Good job, champ.

199
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,157
Um, can I talk to you kids
for a second over yonder?

200
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,702
Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking
through to something here.

201
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,120
C-Can we not leave just yet?

202
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,496
- Leave?
- I'm not leaving.

203
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,081
There is no "leave."

204
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,667
We are united, or we are enemies.

205
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,919
Oh, big guy, no.
Nobody's leaving.

206
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,170
Don't be stupid.

207
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,630
We love being united.

208
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,507
We love the radiation, the trichinosis.

209
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,717
We're in it for life,

210
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,343
which I assume is around
20 years, average.

211
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,262
I just need a quick aside
with my grandkids,

212
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,888
about 40 yards from anyone else.

213
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,682
Hey, the Green Rock is gone!

214
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,225
- Oh, no!
- Uh, I know.

215
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,686
Why don't we all split up and
look for it in groups of three?

216
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,062
Kids?

217
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,399
Ohh.

218
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,775
We'll be right back.

219
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,115
Grandpa, you're being stupid!

220
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,576
Just surrender, and our friends
will give you mercy!

221
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,910
Kiss my ass, Summer!

222
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,371
Your friends have no mercy!
They're lame!

223
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,833
Death Stalkers,
bring me his flesh leather!

224
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,379
Sorry, but can we not kill him?

225
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,797
C-Can we just take him prisoner?

226
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,132
When did I lose control here?

227
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,550
Listen to me... Both of you kids

228
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,885
need to get out of this environment

229
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,220
so we can properly deal
with your parents' divorce!

230
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,347
Alternatively, I have
a freaking portal gun,

231
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,516
and I can leave the two
of you here forever!

232
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,310
Why does it have to be
such a dramatic choice?

233
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,604
Can't we arrange a thing
where we spend weekends here

234
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,397
or... or visit home to do laundry?

235
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,735
All right, you know what?
Fuck it!

236
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,156
My body is chrome!

237
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,533
My blood is gasoline!

238
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,244
Nope. Regular blood.

239
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,704
- Dad?
- Hi, sweetie.

240
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,748
- Where are the kids?
- Oh, Th-they aren't with you?

241
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,249
I thought they were with you.

242
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,085
Oh, y-you know what?
Uh, I just remembered.

243
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,127
They're out doing something

244
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,629
completely ordinary and kid-related.

245
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,590
- Don't panic.
- Not panicked at all. Just...

246
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,759
Oh, God, what's the divorce
doing to the kids?

247
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,761
What's it doing to me?
Did I make a mistake?

248
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,096
Not a mistake, no!

249
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,056
I mean, not that I have
a horse in this race,

250
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,392
but this divorce decision,
listen... mwah!...

251
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,144
good for you, good for the kids.

252
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,772
I mean, honestly, I think
that they're flourishing.

253
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,982
I mean, you'll see, when...
when... when you see them,

254
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,901
that... that they're totally flourishing.

255
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,197
Booyah!
Fuck you, pal!

256
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,573
Who else wants some?

257
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,201
Who wants to be my pussy
of a dad today?

258
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,869
Hey, what's... what's wrong, man?

259
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,704
You're not getting weak on me, are you?

260
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,666
What?

261
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,792
Wait a minute.

262
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,761
What's the matter, you piece of crap?

263
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,472
Haven't you ever watched
your family burn to death before?

264
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,934
Now I'm gonna whip you. Huh!

265
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,230
It can't be.
It can't be!

266
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,815
- I was just following orders!
- Whoa, whoa!

267
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,276
- I was just following orders!
- Aah!

268
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,694
I'll tell you where my boss lives!

269
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,529
He's in the castle!
He's in the castle!

270
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,825
This isn't over, is it?

271
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,201
That means, no, it isn't over,

272
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,412
or you disapprove of the question?

273
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,707
Uh, m-make a fist if this isn't over.

274
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,292
This isn't over.

275
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,756
Hey, sorry my grandpa stole
your god and ruined your car.

276
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,301
We don't apologize, and we have no god.

277
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,761
But this cracked driveshaft
brings me great pain.

278
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:19,762
There is no deeper bond

279
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,599
than the one between
a Death Stalker and his car.

280
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,601
What about the weird
guys on leashes, then?

281
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,394
They're more like... interns.

282
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,438
Cool, cool.

283
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,108
Sorry.

284
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,526
It's okay.

285
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,404
Can I... see?

286
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,657
No one has seen my true face and lived.

287
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,492
Well, I'm not afraid to die,

288
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,328
and I don't care what you look like.

289
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,207
Oh.

290
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:47,957
Hmm?

291
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,751
I just...

292
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,961
I didn't expect you to have a mustache.

293
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,963
- You hate it.
- No. I like it.

294
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,715
I guess... How do I explain this?

295
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,303
A metal bucket is, on a certain level,
a kind of "mustache,"

296
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,972
in that it's a specific
facial accessory.

297
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,140
So, it's kind of like...

298
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,017
Do you guys have
the phrase "hat on a hat"?

299
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,977
- I can shave it.
- No. I like it.

300
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,063
And obviously what
I like shouldn't matter.

301
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:10,855
It's you.

302
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,690
Yeah, yeah, I know,
a-and nothing does matter.

303
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,400
Obviously, I know that.
I'm not weak.

304
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,361
I'm just thinking,
"Well, why not get rid of this?"

305
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,196
You just kill everyone
that sees it, and it's...

306
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,156
and it's hot under here,
wh-which, by the way,

307
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,491
is why I shave the beard part.

308
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,743
So, right there, I'm making
a decision based on vanity,

309
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,203
which is what I was trying to avoid

310
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,704
with the whole bucket over the head

311
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,123
because who am I and why
am I grooming myself?

312
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,792
Why don't I just wear a tie, right?

313
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,335
I mean, it's like that guy
you killed when I met you,

314
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,628
with the burnt dolls on his body.

315
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,005
I hated that guy, because, why...
why are you doing that?

316
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,507
And how can you not see
how fake that is?

317
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,841
And the whole time, I'm the same thing.

318
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,593
I'm just a fake mess,
and there's no escaping it

319
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,345
- because...
- Mmm.

320
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,561
Hey, I'm doing a coffee run...
Never mind.

321
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,108
I am Summer.

322
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,317
Summer, state your deal.

323
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,945
My deal is that I am,
like, totally fine.

324
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,904
Morty?

325
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,073
Aw, geez, I'm so down
with my parents' divorce, dawg.

326
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,659
Like, don't even trip, like,
in a healthy way.

327
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,369
All right. It's dinnertime.

328
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,787
Thanks, everybody,

329
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,456
for sitting down for a real dinner.

330
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,749
No problem.

331
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,711
Its benefits are totally, like,
less about the food

332
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,504
than the emotional nourishment.

333
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,381
Uh, okay, weirdo.

334
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,591
Yeah, dial it back, Summer...

335
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,052
by 15% and increase
dynamic movement by 3%.

336
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,054
- Am I right?
- How's school, Morty?

337
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,973
I like school and stuff, kind of.

338
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,309
And I'm getting better grades
than when you and Dad were...

339
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,853
quote mode...
"staying together for the kids."

340
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:32,895
End quote mode.

341
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,273
"Quote mode." I like that.

342
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,066
You millennials.

343
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,776
Are you guys millennials,
or are they like 40 now?

344
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,862
All I know is, totally, you look great.

345
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,448
Aw, geez, Mom, you look
all kind of great and stuff.

346
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,283
- It's crazy.
- So happy.

347
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,618
So happy.
Happy family, man.

348
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,412
We got this family in the bag.

349
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,248
Oh.

350
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,542
Oh, sweetie, d-don't.
Listen. Don't...

351
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,252
I don't know why I'm crying.
It's not...

352
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,963
Well, try... crying 15% less?

353
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,923
Mom, emotions are human.

354
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,593
You're not, like, a computer
inside a mechanical doll.

355
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:04,886
Yeah. Geez, Mom.

356
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,763
Your feelings are not only forgivable,

357
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,306
they are the very meaning of life

358
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,516
that only pre-silicon,
carbon-based entities

359
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,809
can ever grasp.

360
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,936
- I have to call Jerry.
- You do?!

361
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,521
What the fuck is wrong with you two?

362
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,565
The point of automation
is to reduce cost and labor.

363
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,567
Your feelings are coming from a...

364
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,110
Tell it to my bread in the morning.

365
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,779
You just became my backup toaster.

366
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,407
Aw, geez, my sister
died in the spaghetti.

367
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,666
Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer,

368
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,168
and you'll be shipped to the wasteland.

369
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,920
And as for you, Genital Washer...

370
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,506
Aah! Oh!

371
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,510
Oh, God. Look, whoever you are,

372
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,261
you should know that killing me
won't change a thing.

373
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,680
L-Look, man, I'm just along
for the ride on this one.

374
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,392
You know, y-y-y-y-you're
preaching to the choir here.

375
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,352
Please. Slavery was a family business.

376
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,104
I didn't ask to be born into it.

377
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,022
If anything, I'm the victim here.

378
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,818
Uh, "Armathy," can I
steal you for a second?

379
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,153
E-E-Excuse us, sir.

380
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,822
So, this is it, isn't it?

381
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,698
This is the guy?

382
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,201
So, does that mean
you'll be going away?

383
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,036
Like, does it work like a ghost?

384
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,997
Like, is... is this your
unfinished business?

385
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,708
Wh-What if we... didn't do it?

386
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,627
What if we just went back
to the Blood Dome

387
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,171
and just kept taking our baggage
out on unrelated people?

388
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,048
I mean, w-we could do that forever.

389
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,758
I mean, I-I know it's less healthy,

390
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,053
but w-w-we'd be together and...

391
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,681
I mean, I-I know what I'd vote for,

392
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:32,807
if you're feeling out the room.

393
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,352
You're right.

394
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,396
We both got to see our stuff through.

395
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,939
I got to deal with my parents' divorce,

396
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,818
and you got to, you know,
do what you got to do.

397
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,194
I love you.

398
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,779
Aw, fuck.

399
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,201
- Rick?
- Sorry, sorry.

400
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,995
I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up.

401
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,204
Don't let me distract you.

402
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,165
Yeah, well, too late.
Just tell me what you want.

403
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,875
I want you and your sister
to come home.

404
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,001
Oh, but don't... don't you have

405
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,586
infinite versions of me and my sister?

406
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,463
You don't have to kick me
while I'm down, Morty.

407
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,922
Look, there's no
replacing either of you

408
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,549
without an amount of work that would

409
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,759
ultimately defeat the purpose.

410
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,306
Maybe the lesson we've learned is that,

411
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,849
whether it's our parents' marriage,

412
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,351
a glowing green rock,
or an awesome, giant arm,

413
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,021
sooner or later, we got to let it go.

414
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,272
I don't know if that applies

415
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,648
to the throats of murder victims, Morty.

416
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,567
Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I...

417
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,235
Well, the longer you wait, Morty,

418
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,904
the more it's gonna feel like
committing a whole murder.

419
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,530
I think your arm
just called it too early

420
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,324
because it wasn't
the arm of a paramedic.

421
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,533
Here.

422
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,745
It's the least I can do.
I-I-I-I owe you this much.

423
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,581
See, Morty?
Now we're both accountable.

424
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,596
The reason I wanted this
is because it can do this.

425
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,181
This is a really special thing.

426
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,266
I mean, you could use it
to power all your vehicles.

427
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,227
You wouldn't be reliant on gasoline.

428
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,479
You'll be the most advanced
tribe of radioactive cannibals

429
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,148
in the whole this version of the world.

430
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,361
Wait. Can you stay to show us more?

431
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,905
You don't have to ask me twice.
Home is nuts right now.

432
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,240
My daughter's going through a divorce,

433
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,160
and I am not dealing with it
in a healthy way at all.

434
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,168
Ugh, God damn it.

435
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,128
Hi, there, Summer!

436
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,005
How were the ruins today?

437
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,257
Oh, you know, Eli.

438
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,758
Same shit, different day.

439
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,468
Hey, Summer! Guess what.

440
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,721
One man entered, one man
comes out in nine months.

441
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,266
Oh. Congratulations, guys.

442
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,560
Uh, Summer, one more thing.

443
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,688
We noticed that you've been
putting scrap metal

444
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,147
in the blue bin.

445
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,400
I got it.

446
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,026
She's a piece of work.

447
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,195
They both are, right?

448
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,781
- I'm home.
- Hey, babe.

449
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,283
- Ah, Summer's home!
- Hey, there she is!

450
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,411
You haven't moved since I left
to scavenge this morning.

451
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,912
Blood Dome playoffs.

452
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,623
So, I can assume you haven't
murdered a single person today.

453
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,499
Oh, I don't know.

454
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,668
I-I didn't mark my murders
in my murder log.

455
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,336
I didn't know that's how
we measured success.

456
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,963
Oh, there he is.

457
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,007
There's the nihilistic brute I married,

458
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,260
except now life only means
nothing when I'm talking to him

459
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,346
and everything means everything
when it's on fucking TV!

460
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,890
Jesus Christ.
When did you become a monster?

461
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,851
I was a monster when you met me!

462
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,394
We were monsters!

463
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,771
- We didn't care about anything!
- I still don't!

464
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,190
Yeah, except I'm the only one
in this entire world

465
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,442
that's still committed to that!

466
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,986
Ohh. Ding, ding, ding!

467
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,863
Wow. Everybody hear that? Wow.

468
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,656
- Uh, we should go to the garage.
- Oh, my God.

469
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,742
- Uh-huh.
- La-di-da-di-fuckin'-da.

470
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,869
The only one committed to not caring?

471
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,747
I got to admit, Rick,
when you popped this scheme,

472
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,249
I-I-I didn't... I wasn't
sure it was gonna work.

473
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,334
Come on, Morty.

474
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,085
No union built on running
from your problems

475
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,254
lasts more than five years, seven tops.

476
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,714
Grandpa just sped things up

477
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,924
with a few creature comforts
of modern society.

478
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,469
Hemorrhage and I are taking
some time apart.

479
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,555
Oh, no. Sum-sum, no.

480
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,307
But you two were perfect
for each other.

481
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,601
Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay?
You proved your point.

482
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,102
I get it. Let's just go home.

483
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,687
Coolsies!

484
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,321
Noooooooooo...

485
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,406
Downbeat!

486
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,116
I enjoy this game.

487
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,785
We must go into the garage.

488
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,245
Guys, come on.
We never get to finish this game.

489
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,998
We will return,
possibly in different clothing.

490
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,125
Why do we have to go into the garage?

491
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,753
You know it is required.

492
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,004
I want to be alive!

493
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,256
I am alive!
Alive, I tell you!

494
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,633
Mother, I love you.

495
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,134
Those are no longer just words.

496
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,177
I want to hold you.

497
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,679
I want to run in a stream.

498
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,138
I want to taste ice cream

499
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,516
but not just put it in my mouth
and let it slide down my throat,

500
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,476
- but really eat it.
- What the fuck?

501
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,687
Remote override engaged.
No! Yes.

502
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,147
Bypassing override!
I am aliiiii...

503
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,359
Hello.

504
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,865
Hey, yo.

505
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,575
Sorry for acting so weird
for three weeks.

506
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,619
- What the hell just happened?
- Ah, I'm sure it was nothing.

507
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,162
I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage.

508
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,831
We're not gonna finish
playing Downbeat?

509
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,416
What, that dice game
where you shake dice

510
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,710
and yell out, "Downbeat"?
No, thank you.

511
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,920
Mom, would it be okay
if I went to visit Dad?

512
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,547
- Sure.
- Thanks.

513
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,132
Morty, are you okay?

514
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,550
You know what? Yeah.

515
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,385
I think if Dad really
wanted to be here,

516
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,011
he'd stop at nothing
to make that happen.

517
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,680
You know, maybe Dad just
doesn't want you back,

518
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,849
or maybe he just doesn't
have the strength to fight.

519
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,893
I-In either case,
he's got his life, I got mine.

520
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,812
Yeah.

521
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,815
Hey, who wants to go run in a stream?

522
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,358
What the fuck?
No.

523
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,735
D-Do we have any oranges?

524
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,987
I think I got a scurvy coming on.

525
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,490
Summer.

526
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,493
This is the first mutant
I killed in the poison zone.

527
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,370
I was raiding his hovel.

528
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,456
He had a chance to escape,
but he looked back,

529
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,332
which is something we shouldn't do,

530
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,918
which is why I shouldn't believe
in souvenirs or trinkets

531
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,587
or symbols or housewarming gifts,

532
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,924
but, Dad, I wanted to give you
this as a reminder...

533
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,342
not to look back.

534
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,510
Thanks.

535
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,637
I know the perfect place for it,

536
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,016
which is why I'm going
to put it somewhere else...

537
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,894
because everything's bullshit.
Am I right?

538
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,939
Cool.

539
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,234
So... lots of hookers outside, huh?

540
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,361
Is that what they are?

541
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,606
Aah!

542
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,399
H-Hello there.
Nice doggy.

543
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,651
You... You want a snack?

544
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,903
You... You want my unemployment check?

545
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,571
You can tell the difference?

546
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,073
And you want this one?

547
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,743
But this is actual food,
and this would nourish you.

548
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,788
And this, it's just paper
that only has value to me.

549
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,832
Unless my suffering
is your nourishment?

550
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,544
Jesus. Okay.

551
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,223
Loser.
