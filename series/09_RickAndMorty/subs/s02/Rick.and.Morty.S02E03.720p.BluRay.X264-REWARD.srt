1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,044
# Love #

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,754
# Connection #

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,839
# Experience #

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,633
Yeah, Morty.

5
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,968
# Come together #

6
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,097
# With love, connection,
and experience #

7
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,349
- It's my favorite song.
- Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,644
Oh, yeah, distress beacon!

9
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,895
Yeah, baby!

10
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,355
You're excited about that?

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,856
The first rule
of space travel, kids,

12
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,692
is always check out
distress beacons.

13
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,777
9 out of 10 times,
it's a ship full of dead aliens

14
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,612
and a bunch of free shit!

15
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,781
- Whoa!
- 1 out of 10 times, it's a deadly trap,

16
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,950
but I'm ready
to roll those dice.

17
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,710
Seems like something
terrible happened here.

18
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,044
Yep. Cha-ching.

19
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,380
Oh, yeah, if you find
a room full of eggs,

20
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,673
don't shy away from it.

21
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,133
Give one of them a shake.

22
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,926
Those facehuggers
are worth more than this ship.

23
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,094
Uh, what's that?

24
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,137
This'll make the cops
write it up

25
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,513
as a looting by the Korblocks.

26
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,556
That's horrible.

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,808
I hear you, man.
Cops are racist.

28
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,769
Oh, hey. You're alive.
Thank god.

29
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,396
Can you help us?

30
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,107
Our planet was taken over
by some kind of... entity.

31
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,942
It absorbed
the minds of our people.

32
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,777
We didn't notice
until it was too late.

33
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:10,987
The people it takes over,

34
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,488
they... they look
like your friends,

35
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,740
your family, your leaders,

36
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,701
but they're not
themselves anymore.

37
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,078
They're part of... it.

38
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,414
Then how do you know it didn't
get on the ship with you?

39
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,708
Those two dingdongs seem pretty
calm about the whole thing.

40
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,044
Hey, no! No, wait! Stop!

41
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:29,839
Called it.

42
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,593
Hello, Rick.

43
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,886
Long time no see.

44
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,845
Unity?

45
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,929
- Rick?
- Grandpa?

46
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,431
Oh, boy. Uh...

47
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,849
these are my grandkids,
Summer and Morty.

48
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,143
Summer, Morty,
this is, uh, Unity.

49
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,271
We sort of used to, uh... date.

50
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,087
Quite an operation
you got going here, Une.

51
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,631
You're a whole planet now, huh?

52
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,924
After we broke up,

53
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,842
I spent some time
wandering through space.

54
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,220
- Then I found this world...
- where I was better able

55
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,889
to focus on my passion
for unification.

56
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,474
You mean
stealing people's bodies?

57
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,892
Summer, rude.

58
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,977
Why don't you two kids
go run off and play with Unity

59
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,813
while Unity and I
do some catching up.

60
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,397
Ugh. No, wait, Rick,

61
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,733
aren't these people gonna barf
into our mouths and absorb us?

62
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,151
You're guests here on my planet.

63
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,653
You're free to be yourselves.

64
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,863
I've never been any good
at disappointing Rick.

65
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,156
Well, now I'm going to barf.

66
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,908
Come on, Morty.

67
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,872
Jerry, what are you...
What are you doing in here?

68
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,750
I'm trying to find
our weed whacker,

69
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,378
'cause our weeds are wack, yo.

70
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,255
But you can't go in the garage
when Rick's not here.

71
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,673
I "can't"?

72
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,341
- Well, he doesn't like it.
- What's he gonna do?

73
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,969
Crash rent-free
at his other family's house?

74
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,053
What is that supposed to mean?

75
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,888
Your dad gets to walk
all over us

76
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,099
because of
your abandonment issues.

77
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,851
He's playing you, shorty.

78
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,811
Oh, stop affecting
that stupid hip-hop dialect.

79
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,856
Stop shifting the cross hairs
to my ironic urban patois

80
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,816
just because your relationship
with your father

81
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,693
is to' up from the flo' up.

82
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,154
What the hell was that?

83
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,239
I don't know. Let's just leave.

84
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,368
That is a hatch.

85
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,704
Your father put a hatch
in my garage.

86
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,122
You don't know it was him.

87
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,957
Anyway, we're not
supposed to be in here.

88
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,210
Obviously, neither is whatever's
gurgling down there.

89
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,383
"World peace achieved." Nice.

90
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,135
Little weird to publish
a paper about it

91
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,094
for yourself, but hey.

92
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,345
So, what's next?

93
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,347
After I become
a type-one civilization,

94
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:47,059
this world will be invited
into the Galactic Federation.

95
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,144
Oh, goody.

96
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,186
From there, I'll have access to

97
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,063
countless planets and species.

98
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,982
One by one, I will unify them,

99
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,275
I will become the universe,

100
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,277
and I will be what
the single-minded

101
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,320
once called a god.

102
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,821
I like that.

103
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,406
Oh, that's pretty sexy.

104
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,366
Hey, listen, where can we get
a drink around here?

105
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,744
Recreational substances
were phased out here.

106
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,913
There's no need
for escape from the self

107
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,164
when your world is one.

108
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,790
Unity, Unity,
who am I talking to?

109
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,959
I watched you assimilate
a whole police station

110
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,128
just to get your hands on
the evidence locker.

111
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,714
Rick, when we met,
I was a young hive mind

112
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,592
with the population
of a small town.

113
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,760
People change...

114
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,011
Especially when I change them.

115
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,346
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

116
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,014
but I've grown.

117
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,016
Hey, listen, I've grown, too.

118
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,768
I have!

119
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,478
See, I've... I've reconnected
with my family, right?

120
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,063
Hm. Why's that, I wonder?

121
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,856
Maybe it's part of getting old.

122
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,652
Maybe I just missed
being with a collective.

123
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,738
Yes, Rick. Yes.

124
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,281
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes. Yes.

125
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,325
Wait, wait. Stop. Hold it.

126
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,035
Not like this.

127
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,036
We need a hang glider

128
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,371
and a crotchless
Uncle Sam costume,

129
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,706
and I want the entire field
of your largest stadium

130
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,416
covered end to end
with naked redheads,

131
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,960
and I want the stands packed

132
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,420
with every man that remotely
resembles my father.

133
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,345
Man, look at them go.
So coordinated.

134
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,847
What's your problem?

135
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,516
They're making you into
a Mount Rushmore.

136
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,809
They made burgers!

137
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,060
Morty, open your eyes.

138
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,478
There is no "They."

139
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,939
These poor people's bodies
are being used.

140
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,107
They're a planet of puppets.

141
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,817
- I can hear you.
- Ugh.

142
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,361
Well, it seems like
everybody here's cool with it.

143
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,821
Except for all those redheads.

144
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,197
They seem like
they're in a hurry

145
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,365
to be somewhere else.

146
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,534
Balloon, Summer? Balloon, Morty?

147
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,536
No, we don't want
your dumb balloons, okay?

148
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,246
We're bored.
Take us back to Rick.

149
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,081
Now's not a good time.

150
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,959
Oh, yeah!

151
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,878
I want yooooooou!

152
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,130
Go, son, go!

153
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,383
Go, son, go! Go, son, go!

154
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,012
Oh, real nice. Real nice.

155
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,972
How does a man do this
without me noticing?

156
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,098
Oh, you know my dad

157
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,349
once he puts his mind
to something.

158
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,018
You're spinning this
to his credit?

159
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,479
I'm going down there.

160
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,189
- Jerry...
- Beth, this is my house,

161
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,400
which makes this my garage,
my secret hatch,

162
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,987
my hidden subterranean lair,
and my faceless gargler.

163
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,739
Now, are you gonna keep
hating this playa

164
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,490
or are you gonna jack my steez?

165
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,492
Okay, you're just
making stuff up now.

166
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,453
Ugh. Oh, my god.

167
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,829
Oh, my god.

168
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,539
Ugh!

169
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,208
Oh, Rick. That was so bad.

170
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,334
What's this "was" stuff?

171
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,711
I just need to hydrate,

172
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,088
Then we're doing that again.

173
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,882
- Oh, damn.
- Listen, if this is an invasion,

174
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,216
I got to sit this one out,

175
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,177
but I'll be back to have sex
with the survivors.

176
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,970
It's a neighboring
hive-mind species,

177
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,096
Beta Seven.

178
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,973
Our planets maintain
a practical alliance

179
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,683
for exchange of vital resources,

180
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,435
so be nice.

181
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,519
Unity,

182
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,689
is it a bad time?

183
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:42,735
Are all present life forms
assimilated?

184
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,571
Beta Seven,
this is my single-minded friend

185
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,739
from Earth, Rick.

186
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,824
Rick Sanchez.

187
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,576
Unity has spoken of you.

188
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,369
All bad, I hope. Ha ha!

189
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,662
Bleeeeeeeeeh!

190
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,039
Oh, Jesus Christ.

191
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,708
Beta Seven, if my allies
are a problem for you,

192
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,668
perhaps our alliance is,
as well.

193
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,378
Our alliance is beneficial.

194
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,422
When Beta Seven
expresses concern,

195
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,049
it... it's only be-because...

196
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,676
Oh, snap! Powdered neutronium?

197
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,761
Amphetetron?

198
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,596
You know I can make
with this stuff?

199
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,848
Oh, Rick, I... I shouldn't.

200
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,934
Come on. It's not every day
that I'm town.

201
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,685
It's...
It's for old time's sake.

202
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,063
Uh... okay, what the hell.

203
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,941
We can purify the resin
and make fractal dust.

204
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,527
Oh, I was thinking
velocitinis, but...

205
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,530
Aw, old man Rick can't party
with a whole planet?

206
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,660
I can do whatever
you do and more, baby.

207
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,705
You know, I think
Beta Seven over there

208
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,999
is hoping your alliance
can be more than practical.

209
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,626
Stop.

210
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,592
Well, this explains
the $6,000 electric bill.

211
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,095
Whoa!

212
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,809
Well, nice. Real nice.

213
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,602
Alien prisoners under the house.

214
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,062
Real nice.

215
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,148
Nice. Reeeeeeeeeeeeeal...

216
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,400
God damn it, stop.

217
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,444
Wake up, people!
You have to fight it!

218
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,947
You're under the spell
of an evil monster!

219
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,783
- I can hear you.
- Yeah, so you keep saying.

220
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,911
- Summer!
- Wake up!

221
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,122
You have to have some
individuality left in there!

222
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,498
Why do you hate me, Summer?

223
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,083
I'm not talking to you.

224
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,586
I'm talking to...
Steven Phillips.

225
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,172
Steven, set yourself free.

226
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,549
Summer, before I took
over this planet,

227
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,135
this man was
a registered sex offender.

228
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,888
Yeah? Well, so what?
At least he was himself.

229
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,932
This woman was a drug addict
on the verge of suicide.

230
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,851
Now she's a marine biologist.

231
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,853
Listen, Unity, I don't think
my sister's trying to say

232
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,229
that life would be perfect
without you.

233
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,939
I think she's just saying
that life would be,

234
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,274
you know, life.

235
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,110
I have transformed life
here into a paradise.

236
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,154
Prostitutes are now scientists.

237
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,406
The homeless
are now "Phisosophers."

238
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,158
Oh. Oh. "Ph-phisosophers"? Nice.

239
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,327
- Philopol... Phiphophopher...
- Oh, my god.

240
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,287
Where did you learn to talk,
you grandpa-stealing slut?

241
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,372
I'm feeling...

242
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,375
Ugh.

243
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,669
Oh, man, let me help
all of you guys up.

244
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,713
I'm fine.

245
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,011
Do you know
what I love about you, Rick?

246
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,971
You're the only single mind
I've met

247
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,598
that really sees
the big picture.

248
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,016
You got that right.

249
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,601
But, baby, listen...

250
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,103
Y-you're talking about taking
over planets and galaxies.

251
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,563
You got to...
Got to just remember

252
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,065
to let go sometimes, you know?

253
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,191
I can let go. Hey, look.

254
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,609
You see that town
across the river?

255
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,152
Watch this.

256
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,488
- Whoa!
- Ha ha! Whoo!

257
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
Whoa! That's not what I meant!

258
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,533
It's okay. It's okay.

259
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,495
I evacuated.
I evacuated the town. Look.

260
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,331
Hey! We're right here. We're fine.

261
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,047
Oh, that was awesome.

262
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,258
My... my grandkids
weren't in that town, right?

263
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,218
A-are my grandkids alive?

264
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,345
M-my drink is empty.

265
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,115
- Unity, what's happening?
- Who's Unity?

266
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,742
You kids have nice feet.
Mind if I take a picture?

267
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,370
Gross. No.

268
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,664
I think you're getting
what you wanted, Summer.

269
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,708
Something's happening to Unity.

270
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,502
Do all of you remember
who you are?

271
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,046
Yeah, uh, my name is Ron Benson.

272
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,008
I'm an electrical engineer,
father of two,

273
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,678
and, as you can see from my
flat, concentric nipple rings,

274
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,222
I'm a member of
this planet's top race!

275
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,974
Okay, that's good.

276
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,435
Uh, don't focus too much
on the last part, but...

277
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,396
I'm Daryl Jefferson.
I'm a landscaper.

278
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,023
And I'll be damned if

279
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,400
that ripple-nipple bitch's
race is superior!

280
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,402
The cone-nipple people
will rule this world!

281
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,863
You shut your mouth,
you dirty knife-nipple bastards.

282
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:56,989
What'd you say to me,

283
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,199
you target-chest piece of shit.

284
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,035
Race war!

285
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:08,959
Ugh!

286
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,713
Why are you fighting?!

287
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,007
Can't you see
you're all the same?

288
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,508
Oh, Summer.

289
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,010
First race war, huh?

290
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,226
Way to go, Summer.
You started a race war.

291
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,896
I didn't start it!
They're the racists.

292
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,230
I... I merely empowered them

293
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,191
to follow their apparently
misguided dreams.

294
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,776
Okay, thanks for clarifying.

295
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,736
I'll have a super-accurate
headstone now.

296
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,029
Hey, wait...
What race are you guys?

297
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,197
We're neither. S-see?

298
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,907
Yeah, take my word for it.

299
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,700
We just have regular nipples.

300
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,119
Hey, these two freaks
have no race!

301
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,835
Oh, there's no place like home.

302
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,462
There's no place like home.
Remember, Summer?

303
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,047
From Dorothy
and the tiny people movie?

304
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,256
Yes, yes.

305
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,217
- All the tiny people.
- Dorothy, take us away.

306
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,601
Hello, Summer. Hello, Morty.

307
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,187
- It's okay. You're safe now.
- Unity?

308
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,399
- Yes.
- Oh, Unity, I am so sorry.

309
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,193
I didn't know freedom meant
people doing stuff that sucks.

310
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,694
I was thinking more of

311
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,613
a choose your own
cellphone-carrier thing.

312
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,073
Oh, Summer,
you did nothing wrong.

313
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,783
I'm having fun
with your grandpa.

314
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,076
Lost a little control.

315
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,328
Probably shouldn't be
piloting a hovercopter,

316
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,164
nor should I be running
200,000 pediatric hospitals

317
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,666
and 12 million deep fryers,

318
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,042
but hey,
it's not like this planet

319
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,544
can take its business elsewhere.

320
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,504
Um, should we maybe
stop somewhere

321
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,964
and get you a coffee?

322
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,007
Maybe splash a little water
on your face, or...

323
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,926
No, no, if I wanted to be sober,

324
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,719
I wouldn't have gotten drunk.

325
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,804
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

326
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,518
Oh, man. I cannot wait...

327
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,646
I cannot wait to hear Rick
explain his way around this.

328
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,981
He is gone.

329
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,274
Jerry, stop, please, okay?

330
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,859
We weren't even
supposed to be down here.

331
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,152
If we confront him about this...

332
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,778
Oh, my god! I love this.

333
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,281
I love that this is
how far you will go for him.

334
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,658
You want to go upstairs
and cut carrots

335
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,285
and watch a Lifetime original

336
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,871
above a fucking alien dungeon!

337
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,790
Your relationship with
your father is psychotic.

338
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,292
Oh, listen to you
relish the idea

339
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,169
that my genius father
is a bad person.

340
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,879
Step out of your ego
for a second

341
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,839
and look at this thing...
It's a monster.

342
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,174
He might have it chained up

343
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,758
so that it doesn't
eat the planet!

344
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,011
Right, because your father's
such an altruist?

345
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,681
I once saw him briefly
forget the word for "Humans."

346
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,892
He's probably harvesting
this creature's organs.

347
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,894
He's probably racing
to cure its space AIDS.

348
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,187
- He's going to eat it!
- He's protecting it!

349
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,647
Shut up!

350
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,067
Whoa!

351
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,986
Unity, this place is a mess.

352
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,196
Oh, it's cool.

353
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,238
The part of me
that's the cleaning lady

354
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,656
is coming on Friday.

355
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,325
Oh, my god. I have a meeting

356
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,243
at the Galactic Federation
in an hour.

357
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,328
Oh, I'll never make it.

358
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,954
Ah, I'll push it to next week.

359
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,998
Unity, could you get Rick
out here, please?

360
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,625
He's unavailable. He's...

361
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,335
having sex with you.
We get it. Gross.

362
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,669
Get him out here now.

363
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,795
I don't think he wants to be...

364
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,048
- Grandpa Rick!
- Rick! Rick!

365
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,841
I'm gonna tell mom and dad
about the gagoo

366
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,259
you have locked up
under the garage!

367
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,887
What the hell is your problem?

368
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,931
Grandpa,
we need to go home, now.

369
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,807
Fine. Sheesh.

370
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,895
See you.

371
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,688
Uh, Rick,
I think we should all go.

372
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,982
Tend to your garden, kids.
I'm kind of doing a thing here.

373
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,151
Whoo!

374
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,070
Grandpa Rick,
we're not leaving without you.

375
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,072
Oh, my god, you guys. I get it.

376
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,241
You're afraid
the big, bad hive mind

377
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,368
is gonna steal
your grandpa away.

378
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,953
Actually, no.
I think Unity's great

379
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,704
and you're
a horrible influence on it.

380
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,373
- What?
- This isn't healthy, Rick.

381
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,000
You know, you're...
You're really up to no good

382
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,086
around here a-at
this place, you know?

383
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,337
You and Unity are like...

384
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,089
Like leggings
and mid-calf boots.

385
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,757
You think you're great together,

386
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,134
but you're just bringing out
the worst in each other.

387
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,762
Oh, gee. Boy, Summer. Well put.

388
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,639
Uh, why don't we see
what Unity thinks?

389
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,723
Unity?

390
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,767
I'm just taking
a little break from stuff.

391
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,811
You know? I need to relax.

392
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,938
Oh, hey, w-what's this
on the news, guys?

393
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,147
L-l-let me turn it up.

394
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,649
In the news today,

395
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,317
this looks
a lot worse than it is.

396
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,027
We're really just
having a good time.

397
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,445
Karen? Thanks, Todd.

398
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,364
Up next, are you
a concerned grandchild

399
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,032
or just a buzzkill?

400
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,951
We'll tell you
how you can know for sure.

401
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,953
I think you two
are a little outnumbered.

402
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,122
Okay, well, what if
you did it for me?

403
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,374
What if you came with us
as a favor to us

404
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,084
because you love us?

405
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,836
What? Dumb. Bye.

406
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,254
But Rick, Summer's just...

407
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,089
Summer's just a hyper-emotional,
needy little...

408
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,424
What's the word
I'm looking for here?

409
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,508
Uh... human.

410
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,093
It runs in the family.

411
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,261
I can tolerate it,

412
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,512
but I can't
give a crap about it.

413
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,097
Take a hike.

414
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,100
Take care of yourself, Unity.

415
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,439
I'm not looking for judgment,
just a yes or no...

416
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,399
Can you assimilate a giraffe?

417
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,275
You're the worst!

418
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,111
No, you're the worst!
You don't support this family!

419
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,571
All you care about is yourself!

420
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,864
You think supporting the family
is about supporting you emotionally...

421
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,490
you've got two children
being dragged across the cosmos

422
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,908
because it's never
enough, Jerry!

423
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,118
By your dangerously ill father!

424
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,411
And you force me to
watch it happen...

425
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,997
because you'd rather
lose them and lose me...

426
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,457
it's like to be afraid
of losing anything...

427
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,541
- than lose him!
- Because you cling...

428
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,584
And why? Because
you're the child, Beth!

429
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,545
You, not me! You!

430
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,172
- Aah!
- Aah!

431
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,757
- Oh, my god.
- Aah!

432
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,348
Um, first of all, hello.

433
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,516
Uh, my name is
Blim Blam the Korblok.

434
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,393
Second of all,
cards on the table,

435
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,187
I'm a murderer that eats babies,

436
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,773
and I came to this planet
to eat babies.

437
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:27,611
However, I am also carrying
a highly infectious disease

438
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,989
that I suppose you could call
"Space AIDS" as you put it.

439
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,199
And Rick did chain me up

440
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,201
so that he could
attempt to cure it.

441
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,328
At the same time,

442
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,330
Rick's motivation
to cure my disease

443
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,499
was not to save my life
or anyone else's,

444
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,752
but to patent and sell the cure
for billions of blemflarcks.

445
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,295
But you know the reason why

446
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,339
I ripped my chains
out of the wall?

447
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,217
And do you know why I'm never
coming back to this planet?

448
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,179
Because the two of you
are the fucking worst!

449
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,848
You both hate yourselves
and each other.

450
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,184
And the idea that it has
anything to do with Rick

451
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,811
is laughable.

452
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,063
I'd laugh,
but I'm biologically incapable.

453
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,856
That's how alien I am.

454
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,317
And even I'm sitting here
listening to the two of you

455
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,237
and being like, "What the fuck"!

456
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,447
So good luck
with your shitty marriage,

457
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,575
and tell Rick I'm sorry he has
to deal with either of you.

458
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,036
Blim Blam out.

459
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,377
You know what? I'm taking this.

460
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,550
How do you... what is this?

461
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,013
Uh, is there a slow setting?

462
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,016
Best door ever.

463
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,527
Okay, okay. Now make them cry,
but happy crying.

464
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,821
Now make them all
make fun of the blonde one.

465
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,281
Now make them all
do it on the table.

466
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,533
I can't believe you created
a whole show for me.

467
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,160
Now cancel it.

468
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,286
Okay, now put it back on.

469
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,955
All right, I'm bored.

470
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,457
Rick, is there a way for you

471
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,083
to call Summer and Morty?

472
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,502
- I feel bad that they...
- Pbht. Screw those guys.

473
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,005
Ugh. I'll be right back.

474
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,132
Don't waste your brain
on those weirdos, Unity.

475
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,175
They're no different
from any of the aimless

476
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,551
chumps that you occupy.

477
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,052
They just put you at
the center of their lives

478
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,304
because you're powerful.

479
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,889
And then because
they put you there,

480
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,265
they want you
to be less powerful.

481
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,349
Never gonna happen
though, right?

482
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,517
Never.

483
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,603
Never. Back in a flash.

484
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,610
Best weekend ever, Rick.

485
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:35,030
I agree, Rick.
Let's see how long we can go.

486
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,949
Hey, Une. You got any more...

487
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,954
Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes.

488
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,541
I'm not strong enough
to do it in persons.

489
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,251
I realize now that I'm attracted to you

490
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,587
for the same reason
I can't be with you.

491
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,255
You can't change.

492
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,549
And I have no problem with that,

493
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,469
but it clearly means
I have a problem with myself.

494
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,888
I'm sure there's no
perfect version of me.

495
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,724
I'm sure I'll just unify
species after species

496
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,559
and never really be complete.

497
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,561
But I know how it goes with us.

498
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,523
I lose who I am
and become part of you.

499
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,941
Because in a strange way,

500
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,610
you're better at what I do
without even trying.

501
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,657
Yours, and nobody else's, Unity.

502
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,327
P.S., I don't know where
those coal miners were

503
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,537
before they were assimilated.

504
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,163
You might want to get checked.

505
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,206
Man:

506
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,376
Hey.

507
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,670
Dad.

508
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,508
I, um... Jerry and I

509
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,177
were looking for
our weed whacker

510
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,721
and found your subterranean lair

511
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,307
and your alien prisoner,

512
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,268
and he got away.

513
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,727
And I know I sound like mom,

514
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,563
but I can't sacrifice
this whole family's safety

515
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,481
just because I'm afraid
you'll leave again,

516
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,400
so no more alien prisoners

517
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,194
and no more
subterranean excavation

518
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,696
without consulting us.

519
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,781
- Okay.
- Okay?

520
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,034
"Okay"... like you're gonna
quietly teleport somewhere

521
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,412
and never come back?
No. It's your house.

522
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,623
Grandpa Rick,
what happened with Unity?

523
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,334
Who? Oh, Unity. Yeah, well...

524
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,169
I mean, honestly,
we're talking about an entity

525
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,546
that thrives on
enslavement, you know?

526
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,715
It's not cool. Fun's fun,
but who needs it?

527
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,216
I'll be in the garage.

528
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,398
# Lay it, lay it down #

529
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,317
# Let me see your hand #

530
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,819
# Show me what you got #

531
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,322
# You're always talking #

532
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,073
# But you're not playing #

533
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,701
# It doesn't match your face #

534
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,247
# Get them away,
away from this place #

535
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,500
# Can you take me now? #

536
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,419
# I, I want it #

537
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,004
# I want it real #

538
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,423
# Are you afraid of me now? #

539
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,762
# Are you afraid of me now? #

540
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,221
# Do you feel it? #

541
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,265
# Do you feel it? #

542
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,852
# Do you feel
that I can see your soul? #

543
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,187
# Do you feel it? #

544
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,439
# Do you feel it? #

545
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,775
# Do you feel the pain
in your heart? #

546
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,109
# I, I want it #

547
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,195
# I want it real #

548
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,739
# Run away with me now #

549
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,866
# I, I want it #

550
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,535
# I want it real #

551
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,537
# Run away with me now #

552
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,998
# Ah, ah #

553
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,554
# Don't leave me #

554
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,267
# Never leave me out #

555
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,561
# Don't leave me #

556
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:59,275
# Never leave me out #

557
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,825
Unity! Unity!

558
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,284
Unity!

559
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,161
How can I assist you?

560
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,455
I want to talk to
Unity, Beta Seven.

561
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,623
I know it's in there.

562
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,250
You're classified
as a hostile entity,

563
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,960
and Unity
doesn't want to talk to you.

564
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:17,961
I know your game, Beta Seven.

565
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,212
I've met a billion of you,

566
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,506
you little on-deck,
in-the-wings shoulder to cry on!

567
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,676
You are classified
as a hostile entity.

568
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,177
Oh, you're just loving this, mother...

569
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,263
This isn't gonna
shake out like you think, pal.

570
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,597
Unity's not into other
hive minds.

571
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,182
It's gonna suck you in
and use you up,

572
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,475
and a month from now,

573
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
I'm gonna be making out
with all of you

574
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:34,519
in a bunch of red wigs!

575
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,604
Unity! Unity!

576
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,315
Unity, I know you can hear me.
Get out here.

577
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,608
Weapons systems engaged.

578
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,402
Oh, in your dreams
you have weapon systems.

579
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,821
Ugh, Rick, you said
we were going to a movie.

580
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,822
We are, Morty.

581
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,574
All right, Beta shit Seven,

582
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,617
you just got
saved by the bell, bitch!

583
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,620
Did you get any of that?

584
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,080
It's-a good show-a.
