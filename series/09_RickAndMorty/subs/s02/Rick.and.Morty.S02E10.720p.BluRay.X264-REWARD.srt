1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,379
The trick to cereal is
keeping 70% above the milk.

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:07,131
Jerry, get a job.

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,758
Uh, w-why
don't you get it, Jerry?

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,427
You're the man of the house,
and you don't have a job.

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,681
Delivery for Rick.

6
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,349
Morning, Summer, Beth,
and Jerry.

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,060
- Gross. What is that thing?
- It's a courier flap.

8
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,478
It's like the intergalactic
version of UPS,

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,063
but less off-putting.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,356
Oh, shiiit!

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,316
It looks like an egg-vite
from Birdperson.

12
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,485
Must be time
for his annual Oscar party.

13
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,195
And, by the way,
our TV signals take light years

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,446
to reach his planet.

15
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,365
Nobody tell him
that "Braveheart" wins.

16
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,367
Greetings. This is Birdperson.

17
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,618
And Tammy!

18
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,495
Inviting you
to planet Squanch for

19
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,330
our mate-melding ceremony...
Blugh!

20
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:40,707
If you're from Earth,

21
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,208
that means
we're getting married!

22
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,669
Oh, my god! My friend Tammy's
marrying Birdperson!

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,379
What the hell is a Birdperson?

24
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,672
He's Rick's best friend.

25
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,340
Uh, l-let's not
get carried away, Morty.

26
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,259
Would you like to RSVP
or send a gift?

27
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,261
No. Weddings are basically
funerals with cake.

28
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,263
If I wanted to watch someone
throw their life away,

29
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,181
I'd hang out with Jerry all day.

30
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,683
Affirmative!
Returning to sender.

31
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,017
No, hold on, stay,
courier flaps.

32
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,811
- Staying!
- Dad, you have a friend...

33
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,813
that's getting married.
That's a big deal.

34
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,690
It's a big deal he has a friend.

35
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,276
What do you know
about friendship, Jerry?

36
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,944
Confirmed, shipping Jerry.

37
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,946
- Whoa, whoa, wait! Aah!
- Oh, god! Jerry!

38
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,114
- Dad!
- Dad!

39
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,199
Where is it taking him?

40
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,160
I assume planet Squanch...

41
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,120
6,000 light years
across the galaxy.

42
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,705
Whoa, t-that's... That's insane!

43
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,583
Yeah, I know. Now we have
to go to the wedding.

44
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,958
Rick Sanchez!

45
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,502
You psycho bag of squanch!

46
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,003
Hey, what's up, Squanchy?

47
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,963
- Hey, Squanchy.
- Morty, Summer!

48
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,632
And you must be Beth.

49
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,634
Mwah! Ensquanche!

50
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,428
Your language has the word
"squanch" in it a lot.

51
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:18,888
Doesn't that become
tedious and worn out,

52
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,431
like the Smurf thing?

53
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,476
Beth, Squanchy culture
is more contextual than literal.

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,020
Just say what's in your
squanch and people understand.

55
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,396
Oh. Okay.

56
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,941
I squanch my family.

57
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,651
- Uh...
- What? I do.

58
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,362
I squanch my family.
Stop saying it. Gross.

59
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,905
Come on in, guys.

60
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,740
The guest are having
cocksquanches.

61
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,665
Where am I?!
You're at a wedding.

62
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,416
Go change.

63
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,044
# And I'm an alien
with jazz rap style #

64
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,338
# Jazz rapping
for an alien mile #

65
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,091
# Fat beats and an alien smile #

66
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,386
# Jazz space phone,
alien dial is my friend #

67
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,929
# I got a mouthful of jazz
for your ass #

68
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,765
# And I'm gonna keep jazzing #

69
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,392
Oh, you made it!

70
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,352
I wouldn't miss it
for the world!

71
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,521
Oh, my god. I love your ring.

72
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,482
Thanks. It was
Birdperson's grandmother's.

73
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,234
She fought a squirrel for it.

74
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,527
Birdperson.

75
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,529
Rick, I am pleased
you and your family

76
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,406
could witness my melding
with Tammy.

77
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,074
Our pleasure.

78
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,534
Yeah, I just hope
you got a pre-meld.

79
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,369
- Rick!
- What?! It's just a practical

80
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,246
way of making sure that
when she's done with you,

81
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,081
you can get
one of your balls back.

82
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,083
- Jesus, Dad.
- He's grumpy from the flight.

83
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,085
Ohh, I-I was happy
on the flight.

84
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,004
I'm grumpy from the landing.

85
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,548
Well, I looked
at the guest book.

86
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,800
We don't know
a damn person here.

87
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,969
Hi! Jerry Smith...
Father of the bride's friend.

88
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,263
Advertising is my usual game,
but I'm between...

89
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,098
Jerry, stop networking.
We're in space.

90
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,850
"Jerry, get a job!

91
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,727
Jerry, don't look for a job
at an alien wedding!"

92
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,729
I don't get you.
This is the closest...

93
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,564
I've ever gotten to this part
of my father's life.

94
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,441
I don't want to blow it.

95
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,151
Okay, I get it.
I'm cramping your style.

96
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,112
You say you get it, but
I'm scared you'll keep doing it.

97
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,114
Look, here's some humans
you can practice on.

98
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,116
You must be
Summer's mom and dad.

99
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,868
We're Tammy's parents...
Pat and Donna Guterman.

100
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,203
Hi. Beth. This is Jerry.

101
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,998
So your teenage daughter's
marrying a Birdman.

102
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,666
Are you guys down with that?

103
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,335
No pun intended.

104
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,128
We're quite proud.

105
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,380
He's a wonderful person
and an incredible Bird.

106
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,257
Still, what is he, 40?

107
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,508
It's just, you know,

108
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,677
when he was 30,
she was an actual child.

109
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,512
When he was her age,
she wasn't born.

110
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,556
When he was,
let's see, like, 18,

111
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,601
she was literally
in there in your womb.

112
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,311
Imagine being pregnant
with your daughter

113
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,104
and a Bird teenager
comes into your home and says,

114
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,106
"I'll take that.
I'll have sex with that."

115
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,775
Give us one second.

116
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,777
Were you born with your feet
in your mouth?

117
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,613
I was transported here
against my will in a meatball, all right.

118
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,115
So take your attitude
to the men's section of KMart,

119
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,618
'cause you need to cut me
some slack... s.

120
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,119
I want you to stand
in the corner

121
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,663
and face the corner
and talk to nobody.

122
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,041
Maybe... I... will.

123
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,043
You know, you're not being
very supportive

124
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,753
of Birdperson on his big day.

125
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,047
Birdperson's big day, Morty,

126
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,467
was at Blood Ridge
on Glapflap's third moon

127
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,344
against the Gromflamites!

128
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,680
This? This is a losing battle.

129
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,682
Geez, Rick,
it's not like he's dying.

130
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,225
He's getting married!

131
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,643
I mean, what do you think's
gonna happen

132
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,353
if you open yourself up
a little bit?

133
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,813
I mean, look around.

134
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,691
This is your family and friends
all around you, you know?

135
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,275
Take the day off.

136
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,319
There's nothing to run from,
nothing to fight.

137
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,321
That's his last name.

138
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,447
Are you hyphenating it?

139
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,740
Squanch this, mo-Fo.

140
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,285
Good one, Morty.
Excuse me, bartender.

141
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,287
Can you make me
a dumb grandson pep talk?

142
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,374
It's one part lame advice about
stuff you know nothing about

143
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,834
and a lot of vodka.

144
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,627
Mm-Hmm. I have a lot of vodka.

145
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:37,545
Then I'll take one of those.

146
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,171
I don't need the rest.

147
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,340
God, whatever, Rick.

148
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,884
It sounds like you and my dad
have a long history together.

149
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,553
Wish I could say the same.

150
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,555
The road your father and I
walked together

151
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,517
is soaked deeply with the blood
of both friends and enemies.

152
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,601
Must be nice.

153
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,645
Um, I used to have to draw him

154
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,355
into family photos
with a crayon.

155
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,858
The war in which we fought
is far from over.

156
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,484
We live our lives in hiding.

157
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,695
I guess I should
be happy for you.

158
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,322
I mean, great,
you guys got to hang out.

159
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,866
I hope you had a blast.

160
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,452
The galactic government
considers us terrorists.

161
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,829
It's unwise of me
to share these details,

162
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,414
but I've become inebriated.

163
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,749
I don't know
if you can appreciate

164
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,001
what it means to grow up
without a father, but...

165
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,794
The guest list at this wedding

166
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,630
includes 17 of the Federation's
most wanted.

167
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,632
We have committed
numerous atrocities

168
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,301
in the name of freedom.

169
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,677
Annnd during that time,

170
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,429
I don't suppose he
ever mentioned his daughter.

171
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,889
Are those baby quiches?

172
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,348
Night crawler pate.

173
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,392
I should prepare
for the ceremony.

174
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,436
Like talking to a brick wall.

175
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,898
In the name of the squanch,
the six rivers,

176
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,900
the four squanches,
and the nine balls,

177
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,279
I unite these two organisms
in eternal squanch!

178
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,406
Tammy, you may
squanch your vows now.

179
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,909
Birdperson...

180
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,913
You are my seed,
my worm, my earliness,

181
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,664
and my lack of cats.

182
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,167
I promise to be yours
until your death.

183
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,502
- Nice!
- Aww!

184
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,961
Birdperson.

185
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,881
Tammy, I was approaching
infertility when I met you,

186
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,633
but there is still time.

187
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,343
I am yours until my death.

188
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,844
Aww!

189
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,763
Aww.

190
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,808
I now pronounce you
Squanch and Birdperson!

191
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,651
# Girl, you got it going on #

192
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,573
I am not staring at you.

193
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,660
I am a cyborg photographer.
Just act natural.

194
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,453
This is a candid shot.

195
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,580
I don't require a camera so...

196
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,415
Sorry.

197
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,376
Hi. I am not staring at you...

198
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,842
Uh, hi, everybody.

199
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,593
I'm Rick.

200
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:54,598
You know, when I first
met Birdperson, he was, uhh...

201
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,350
Listen, I'm not the nicest guy
in the universe

202
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,685
because I'm the smartest.

203
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,478
And being nice is something
stupid people do

204
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,896
to hedge their bets.

205
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,356
Now, I haven't been
exactly subtle

206
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,774
about how little
I trust marriage.

207
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,151
I couldn't make it work,

208
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,777
and I could turn a black hole
into a sun,

209
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,821
so at a certain point,
you got to ask yourself

210
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,698
what are the odds this is legit

211
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,449
and not just some big lie
we're all telling ourselves

212
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,993
because we're afraid
to die alone?

213
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,829
Because, you know, that's
exactly how we all die... alone.

214
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,872
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, Dad.

215
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,998
Jesus.

216
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,041
But... But... here's the thing.

217
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,002
Birdperson is my best friend,

218
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,838
and if he loves Tammy, well,
then I love Tammy, too.

219
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,386
To friendship, to love, and
to my greatest adventure yet...

220
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,722
Opening myself up to others.

221
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,265
Hear, hear! Cheers!

222
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,267
Cheers to that, motherfucker!

223
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,020
Thank you, Rick.
That was beautiful.

224
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,398
Gosh, I look around this room,
and I think,

225
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,275
"Uh, Tammy,
you're a high-School senior"

226
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,902
from the planet Earth,
and you're marrying

227
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,571
"a 40-year-old Birdperson?
Like, what?!"

228
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,990
Yeah, Tammy!

229
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,701
But then I think, you know,
in a lot of ways,

230
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,704
I'm not a high-School senior
from the planet Earth.

231
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,956
In a lot of ways,
what I really am

232
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,918
is a deep-cover agent
for the Galactic Federation,

233
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,045
and you guys are
a group of wanted criminals,

234
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,048
and this entire building is,
in a certain sense, surrounded.

235
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,883
Oh, shit.

236
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,302
- I... don't get the metaphor.
- I'll explain it to you later.

237
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,054
Everyone here is under arrest

238
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,847
for crimes
against the Federation.

239
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:17,932
L'chaim!

240
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,227
- Tammy, what are you doing?
- Sit your Bird ass down.

241
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,312
Tammy?

242
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,733
Birdperson!! No!!

243
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,947
Holy...

244
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,123
Drop the portal gun.

245
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,209
Slide it to
the center of the room.

246
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,130
Somebody confiscate that
and don't damage it.

247
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,674
They'll want it at...

248
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,656
There's no time to squanch!

249
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,574
Get your family out of here!

250
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,535
I got this.

251
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,126
How about a taste
of my squanch?!

252
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,423
Come on, this way!

253
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,216
Squanch this!

254
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,476
Good thing I grabbed
a space weapon.

255
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,395
That's a confetti gun,
you fucking idiot!

256
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,522
- Dad!
- Hold on tight!

257
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,484
Aaah!!

258
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,073
Aaaah!!

259
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,952
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!!

260
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,044
What the hell happened
back there?!

261
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,838
This is on you guys.
I told you weddings are stupid.

262
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,885
Uh, Rick, is there anything
you'd like to tell us

263
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,012
about your relationship

264
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,015
with this previously unknown
galactic government?

265
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,184
All the important points
seem pretty clear, no?

266
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,436
They think they control
the galaxy, I disagree.

267
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,438
Don't hate the player,
hate the game, son.

268
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,648
How could you be so dishonest
with this family?

269
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,859
Oh! Oh, should I have been
more open and trusting

270
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,194
and loving like,
oh, I don't know,

271
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,030
my now dead best friend?
Or your daughter,

272
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,657
who is BFFs
with an intergalactic narc?

273
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:41,909
Hey, Tammy was cool!

274
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,036
- And now we know why.
- Because of you!

275
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,954
Fuck you, Summer,
and fuck the government,

276
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,831
and fuck me
for letting my guard down,

277
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,458
which I will never do again.

278
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,918
Geez, Rick!

279
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,670
You can't say f...
"'F' you" to your granddaughter.

280
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,215
I just did, Morty.
Here's dessert. Fuck you.

281
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,925
Look, I think we've all had
a tough wedding.

282
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,760
Actually,
the wedding was beautiful.

283
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,011
The reception got out of hand.

284
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,222
Anyway, I say we go home,
sleep it off,

285
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,099
and have a family meeting
in the morning.

286
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,226
Yeah, about going home,
we can't... ever.

287
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,769
What?!

288
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,145
Oh, these guys are
looking for us now.

289
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,605
Earth will be swarming
with them.

290
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,731
Us?!

291
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,108
- Jerry...
- I want to go home!

292
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,276
Look, anyone that wants
to go back to Earth is free to.

293
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,195
But here's what's gonna happen.

294
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,780
Alien bureaucrats are gonna
arrest you.

295
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,657
They're gonna put
the intergalactic equivalent

296
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,201
of jumper cables
under your nuts and or labia

297
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,036
and hook them up
to an alien car battery

298
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,621
until you tell them
where I am...

299
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,331
Which I guarantee you,
you're not gonna know,

300
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,375
which I guarantee
they won't believe.

301
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,252
So who's homesick? By applause.

302
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,671
Ladies? Anybody?

303
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,507
What are we going to do?
Where are we going to live?

304
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,759
Take it easy.
This is a blessing in disguise.

305
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,219
Fuck Earth.

306
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,138
You realize our planet's name
means dirt, right?

307
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,722
We'll find a new world.

308
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,099
Computer, how many planets
in the Milky Way

309
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,101
are at least 90% similar
to Earth?

310
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,729
765 known planets.

311
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,190
How many of those are outside
federal jurisdiction?

312
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,526
Three.

313
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,736
See? Our cup runneth over.

314
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,029
Now, who wants to go shopping

315
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,198
for a brand-new
motherfucking world?!

316
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,366
All right!

317
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,285
Look at this baby!

318
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,078
Would you even know
that wasn't Earth?

319
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,997
Yes, because there's no Africa.

320
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,082
Pssh. White people
problems, Morty.

321
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,293
Let's go down and check her out.

322
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,088
Oh. I thought
it was further away.

323
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,674
I uh... I guess this one's
a little small.

324
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,134
All right, uh, maybe...

325
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,052
Maybe we should go check out
the other two, huh?

326
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,267
Okay, this one's bigger.

327
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,313
This looks nice.

328
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,898
Mom, Dad, look!

329
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,649
Strawberries on a cob!

330
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,861
Whoa! Hey, check this out!

331
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,613
Flowers on a cob!

332
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,949
Huh. Strawberries and flowers
on a cob, huh?

333
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,242
That's pretty cool.

334
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,828
Are those... mountains on a cob?

335
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,333
Oh, my god.

336
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,464
Get in the ship, sweetie. What?

337
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,798
Get in the goddamn ship!!

338
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,133
Everything's on a cob!!

339
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,761
The whole planet's on a cob!!
Go, go, go!!

340
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,058
All right,
third time's the charm.

341
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,142
See what we got here.

342
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,980
Seems good.

343
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,440
And nothing on the cob.

344
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,275
Didn't know that was
a necessity, but...

345
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,444
No, it's nice.
I think this might be it.

346
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,279
Wow! Hey, look, you guys.

347
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,114
The sun's rising.

348
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,825
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!

349
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,872
Uh, Dad, how long are the days
on this planet?

350
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,208
Uh, computer, how long
are the days on this planet?

351
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,628
42 hours.

352
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,755
All right, well,
those are the two choices,

353
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,674
'cause cob planet is
off the table.

354
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,883
Now let's take a vote.

355
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,552
Well, it's official.

356
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,679
The obscure planet
known as Earth,

357
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,515
formerly the hiding place
of interstellar terrorist

358
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,517
and fugitive Rick Sanchez,

359
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,728
has just become
the 6,048th planet

360
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,397
to join the Galactic Federation.

361
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,566
The plucky little ball
of water and dirt,

362
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,317
which is where it gets its name,

363
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,071
is dominated by seven billion
primate-descended natives

364
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:10,117
who love to eat spaghetti
and pray to kangaroos.

365
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,995
Spaghetti, kangaroos?
I've gotta check this place out.

366
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,831
Well, you can.

367
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,083
Contact the Ministry of Tourism
for details.

368
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,252
Up next,
teenagers are calling it

369
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,256
And it's not what you think.

370
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,674
What are you...
What did you do that for?

371
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,050
Dramatic effect.

372
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,678
Good morning, family.
Oh, do I smell bacon?

373
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,680
Yes, we discovered
a species of tiny pig

374
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,807
off the coast of New Australia

375
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,059
about 30 yards east.
Or 300 yards west.

376
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,436
We'd offer you some,

377
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,855
but we hunted it to extinction
for breakfast.

378
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,690
Well, I thought
I'd walk to the South Pole

379
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,525
and do a little bit
of exploring.

380
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,027
If you guys need me, just yell

381
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,278
or throw something so hard

382
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,988
that it goes around the world
and hits me.

383
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,573
Okay, now that he's gone,

384
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,075
can we please talk about
our situation?

385
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,161
Dad, you can't talk about people
behind their back.

386
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,579
You know, it's a small world.

387
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,164
Please, he's in the South Pole!

388
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,625
And we need to have
a serious conversation.

389
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,930
South Pole discovered, baby!

390
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,766
Ohhhh!

391
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,726
Oh fuck! An ice cave?

392
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,019
Shit!

393
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,730
Things just keep on
getting better.

394
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,107
Wow, it's the planet's core.

395
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,734
I'm just saying,

396
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,903
we keep acting
like there's only two options,

397
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,321
but there's not.

398
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,198
So, yes, if we went
back to Earth,

399
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,784
as long as Rick was out there,
they'd wanna interrogate us.

400
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,994
But, and this is
purely hypothetical,

401
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,497
what if we turned your father in
to the government?

402
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,748
Jerry, so help me god,

403
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,792
if you ever bring this up again,
no more bacon.

404
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,418
There already is no more bacon!

405
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,921
This world sucks!
Our life sucks!

406
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,756
Why are we doing this
for someone

407
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,301
that would never do anything
for anyone but himself?

408
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,053
That's not the point, Dad!

409
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,056
We love Rick...
f-for the most part.

410
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,225
Yeah, you don't love
people in hopes of a reward,

411
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,352
Dad, you love them
unconditionally.

412
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,396
That's very good, kids.
I'm proud of you.

413
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,106
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

414
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,357
For the rest of your lives,

415
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,067
no matter how much it hurts you,

416
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,277
no matter how much it
destroys our children's futures,

417
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,072
we're gonna do whatever
Rick wants, whenever he wants?

418
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,949
- Yes.
- Why?!

419
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,618
Because I don't want him to
leave again, you dumb asshole!!

420
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,130
Hey. Uh...

421
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,549
I was gonna hope over
to the Gloppydrop system,

422
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,050
get some ice cream.

423
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,719
You... You want me to come with?

424
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,388
Don't you need my brain waves
for camouflage or something?

425
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,557
I'll be okay. Bye, Morty.

426
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,267
Rick?

427
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,102
You're not leaving, right?

428
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,020
Yeah, I am. To get ice cream.

429
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,647
So, you're coming back?

430
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,941
Morty, if you go to where
there's a bunch of ice cream

431
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,192
and then you don't come back,

432
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,861
you haven't
actually gotten ice cream,

433
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,113
you've just gone
where ice cream is.

434
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,240
Rick, I can handle it if you go,

435
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,159
but you'll break Mom's heart.

436
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,869
And I won't forgive you
for that.

437
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,246
Where's the van, Morty?

438
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,166
It's over the horizon
in the driveway.

439
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:20,974
# I hurt myself today #

440
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,771
For English, press 2.

441
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,606
Connecting to agent.

442
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,441
Ongoing investigations.

443
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,611
Uh, hi, my name is Jerry Smith,
I'm from planet Earth.

444
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,988
I know the whereabouts
of Rick Sanchez,

445
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,323
the wanted criminal.

446
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,616
Hold on!

447
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,117
This is Special Agent Gribbles.

448
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,535
You have a tip
about Rick Sanchez?

449
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,621
Yeah, he kidnapped me
and my family,

450
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,623
and he left us
on Dwarf Terrace-9.

451
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,459
He said he was gonna
go to the Plimplom Tavern.

452
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,294
- And listen.
- Yes?

453
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,296
I'm doing what's right
for the galaxy by calling you,

454
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,217
so if we come back to Earth, can
my family have a normal life?

455
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,886
We only want Sanchez, sir.
Your family will be fine.

456
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,471
Nice. Thank you.

457
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,181
I'm Jerry Smith,

458
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,142
and I love sucking big,
sweaty boners

459
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:08,438
and licking disgusting
furry testicle sacks.

460
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,524
Uh... okay.

461
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:17,572
# What have I become #

462
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:22,494
# My sweetest friend #

463
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:28,250
# Everyone I know #

464
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:34,506
# Goes away in the end #

465
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,216
# You could have it all #

466
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,637
- He's not coming back, is he?
- No.

467
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,931
# My empire of dirt #

468
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,017
Hey, look, cops.

469
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:52,774
# I will let you down #
Good morning.

470
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:58,238
# I will make you hurt #

471
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,452
How long will you be
visiting Earth?

472
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,829
Oh, we live here.

473
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,206
We were just off-planet
for a wedding.

474
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,541
Go that way.

475
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,564
I have processed
that you are in in distress

476
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,733
and have proscribed
antidepressants.

477
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,277
Compliments of
the Galactic Federation.

478
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,445
I feel better.

479
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,196
Your debt is 7,000 Fed credits.

480
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,990
Report to
the Ministry of Employment

481
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,326
and you will be assigned
a function.

482
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,787
Honey! I got a job!

483
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,332
# You could have it all #

484
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,877
Sorry, I am not staring at you,
I am taking your mug shot.

485
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:59,466
# My empire of dirt #

486
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,472
# I will let you down #

487
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:09,851
# I will make you hurt #

488
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,775
Hey, what are you in for?

489
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,486
Everything.

490
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,273
Hoo-Whee, what a cliffhanger.

491
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,942
Oh, boy, oh, my!

492
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,361
That's a real crazy ending, huh?

493
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,948
Hi, I'm Mr. Poopybutthole
from episode 204.

494
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,825
As you can see,

495
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,827
I'm still recovering
from the bullet shot

496
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,829
that I got from Beth.

497
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,914
Remember that one? Ooh-Whee!

498
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,958
Come and get it, kitty.

499
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,669
You know, these little fellows
help me get through the day.

500
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,422
Ooh-whee.

501
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,424
Oh, whoo-whee! Feels better.

502
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,262
I got a large pepperoni
and some crazy sticks.

503
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,764
Hey, what did you think
of that finale, huh?

504
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,600
Mm! You think the Smith family
is gonna be okay?

505
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,102
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about, bro.

506
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,854
Your total is $12.37.

507
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,856
Whoo-Whee! You think
Rick's gonna get out off jail?

508
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,816
Whoo-Whee, you think
the family's gonna rescue him?

509
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,443
Hey, what the fuck?!
Get the fuck off me!

510
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:44,863
Ow!

511
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,448
Tune in to "Rick and Morty"
season three in,

512
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,575
like, a year and a half...

513
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,245
or longer
to see how we unravel this mess.

514
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,496
Ooh-Whee!

515
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,998
Oh, my god!

516
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,499
Did you get any of that?

517
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,543
It's-a good-a show!
