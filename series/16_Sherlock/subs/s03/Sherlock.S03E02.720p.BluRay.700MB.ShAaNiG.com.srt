1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,954
They just walked out of there.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,632
Yeah, I know,
I was sort of sitting next to you.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,917
The whole Waters family,
theyjust walked right out of there.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,629
- Again, I was in the room.
- How do they always manage that?

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,199
They're good.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,679
They're greedy and they'll do it again.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,910
And next time, we're going to
catch them in the act.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,035
How?

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,871
- No good?
- They always know we're coming.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,678
- How do they always know?

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,149
They're good, they work at it.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,071
- They're never going to stop.
- Well, neither are we.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,314

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,032

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,755
- Greg.
- In the act!

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,633
The only way we're going to do this,
in the act!

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,479

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,238
You still blocking it?

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,557
Yeah, very efficiently hacked.

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,549
They must be bloody pleased
with themselves.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,119
They must be.

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,914
Right, then.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,115
Ah, no.

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,839
You go make the arrest.
This one's yours, boss.

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,035
You've never called me boss before.

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,839
No? Well, look what happens
when you're good.

27
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,275
You know how most days aren't good days?

28
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,515
- This is a good day.
- Not for the Waters family.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,635

30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,233
Okay, 10 men on the roof
All exits covered.

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,117
The bank's closed
so we've no hostages to worry about.

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,679

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,429
Sorry, no, go on, go on.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,476
Um, we've got
the tunnel entrance covered

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,357
and Davis, Well and Christie
are heading up.

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,954
- Armed Response aren't mucking around.

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,439
Sorry, I'd better get this.

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,669
It's him, isn't it?

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,871
- I... I have to go.
- What?

40
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,473
- You make the arrest.
- No way.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,471
Sorry, you'll be fine.
I'm cool with this.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,755
Jones will get all the credit
if you leave now and you know he will.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,117
Yeah, well... Yeah, it doesn't matter,
I'll have to go.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,196
Backup, I need maximum backup.

45
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,633
Baker Street, now.

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,679
What's going on?

47
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,398
- This is hard.
- What?

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,789
Really hard.
Hardest thing I've ever had to do.

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,556
Do you know
any funny stories about John?

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,710

51
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,909
What?

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,719
I need anecdotes.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,994
Didn't go to any trouble, did you?

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,511

55
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,958

56
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,196
- Shut up, Mrs Hudson.
- I haven't said a word.

57
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,952
You're formulating a question

58
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,395
and it's physically painful
watching you think.

59
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,198
I thought it was you playing.

60
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,998
It was me playing.

61
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,153
I am composing.

62
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,912
You were dancing.

63
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,910
- I was road-testing.
- You what?

64
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,878
Why are you here?

65
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,190
I'm bringing you your morning tea.

66
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,599
You're not usually awake.

67
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,949
You bring me tea in the morning?

68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,873
Where do you think
it came from?

69
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,349
I don't know,
I just thought it sort of happened.

70
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,032
Your mother has a lot to answer for.

71
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,588
Mmm, I know. I have a list.

72
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,792
Mycroft has a file.

73
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,356
So, it's the big day, then.

74
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,393
What big day?

75
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,913
The wedding.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,592
John and Mary are getting married.

77
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,314
Two people who currently who live
together are about to attend church,

78
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,992
have a party, go on a short holiday,

79
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,877
then carry on living together.
What's big about that?

80
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,393
It changes people, marriage.

81
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,993
Mmm, no, it doesn't.

82
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,431
Well, you wouldn't understand
'cause you always live alone.

83
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,318
Your husband was executed
for double murder,

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,152
you're hardly an advert
for companionship.

85
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,635
Marriage changes you as a person
in ways that you can't imagine.

86
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,073
As does lethal injection.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,596
My best friend, Margaret,
she was my chief bridesmaid,

88
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,477
we were going to be
best friends forever,

89
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,039
we always said that.

90
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,712
But I hardly saw her after that.

91
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,995
Aren't there usually biscuits?

92
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,399
- I've run out.
- Have the shops?

93
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,950
She cried the whole day, saying,
Ooh, it's the end of an era.

94
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,713
I'm sure the shop on the corner is open.

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,711
She was probably right, really.

96
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,677
I remember she left early.

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,796
I mean, who leaves a wedding early?

98
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,508
So sad.

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,511
Mmm. Anyway, you've got things to do.

100
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,031
No, not really.
I've got plenty of time...

101
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,394
- Biscuits!

102
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,199
I really am going to have a word
with your mother.

103
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,430
You can if you like,
she understands very little.

104
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,314

105
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,955
Right, then.

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,389

107
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,719
Into battle.

108
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,190

109
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,873
Congratulations!

110
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,030
Okay, hold it there,
I want to get this shot

111
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,553
of the newlyweds.

112
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,629
Ah, just the bride and groom, please.

113
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,233
- Sherlock.
- Oh, sorry.

114
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,673

115
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,035
Okay. Three, two, one.

116
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,314
- Cheese.

117
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,831
The famous Mr Holmes.

118
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,876
I'm very pleased to meet you.

119
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,196
- But no sex, okay?
- Sorry?

120
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,239
You don't have to look so scared.

121
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,548
I'm only messing.

122
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,473
Bridesmaid, best man,
it's a bit traditional.

123
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,515
Is it?

124
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,828
But not obligatory.

125
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,109
If that's the sort of thing
you're looking for,

126
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,713
the man over there
in blue is your best bet.

127
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,473
Recently divorced doctor
with a ginger cat,

128
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,269
a barn conversion and a history
of erectile dysfunction.

129
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,430
Reviewing that information,
possibly not your best bet.

130
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,749
Yeah, maybe not.

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,990
Sorry, there was one more deduction
there than I was expecting.

132
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,993
Mr Holmes,
you're going to be incredibly useful.

133
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,672

134
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,029
Hello, lovely to meet you.

135
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,594
- How are you?
- Beautiful, Mary.

136
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,669
Thank you.

137
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,588
David.

138
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,995
Mary. Congratulations.

139
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,514
- You look, um, very nice.
- Thanks.

140
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,431
John, congratulations.
You're a lucky man.

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,555
Thank you.

142
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,073
Um, David, this is Sherlock.

143
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,470
- Mmm.
- Um, yeah, we've, um...

144
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,473
We've met.

145
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,235
So what exactly are my duties
as an usher?

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,718
Let's talk about Mary first.

147
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,238
- Sorry, what?
- Oh, I think you know what.

148
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,675
You went out with her for two years.

149
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,274
Ages ago.
We're just good friends now.

150
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,759
Is that a fact?

151
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,149
Whenever she tweets,
you respond within five minutes,

152
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,559
regardless of time or current location,

153
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,198
suggesting you have her on text alert.

154
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,759
In all your Facebook photographs
of the happy couple,

155
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,829
Mary takes centre frame,

156
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,070
whereas John is always partly
or entirely excluded.

157
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,037
Wait, you can't assume from that

158
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,634
that I've still got some kind of
interest in Mary?

159
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,039
You've volunteered to be
a shoulder to cry on

160
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,473
on no less than
three separate occasions.

161
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,152
Do you have anything
to say in your defence?

162
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,310
I think from now on we'll downgrade you
to casual acquaintance,

163
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,233
no more than three planned
social encounters a year

164
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,469
and always in John's presence.

165
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,640
I have your contact details.
I will be monitoring.

166
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,268
They're right about you.
You're a bloody psychopath.

167
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,471
High-functioning sociopath.

168
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,198
With your number.

169
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,474

170
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,434
Hello.

171
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,237
Thanks for coming, thank you.

172
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,309
Oh.

173
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,878
Yes, um, well done
in the service, Archie.

174
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,155
He's really come out of his shell.
I don't know how you did it.

175
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,753
Um...

176
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,678
Basically, it's a cute smile
to the bride's side,

177
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,318
cute smile to the groom's side
and then the rings.

178
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,231
- No.
- And you have to wear the outfit.

179
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,117
- No.
- You really do have to wear the outfit.

180
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,758
- What for?
- Grownups like that sort of thing.

181
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,995
Why?

182
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,674
I don't know. I'll ask one.

183
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,990
You're a detective?

184
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,309
Yep.

185
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,231
- Have you solved any murders?
- Sure, loads.

186
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,875
Can I see?

187
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,158
Yeah, all right.

188
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,199

189
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,598
What's all that stuff in his eye?

190
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,669
Maggots.

191
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,115
- Cool.
- Hmm.

192
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,314
He said you had some pictures for him
as a treat.

193
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,595
Er, yes, if he's good.

194
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,715
Beheadings.

195
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,789
Lovely little village.

196
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,871
Hmm? What did you say?

197
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,269
Hold it.

198
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,749
Nice.

199
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,436
- Vol-au-vent?
- I'm starving.

200
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,714
- Thanks.
- I had to lose so much weight

201
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,870
- to get into this dress.

202
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,591
Mmm. He's nice.

203
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,317
Traces of two leading
brands of deodorant,

204
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,515
both advertised for their strength.

205
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,999
Suggestive of a chronic
body odour problem

206
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,149
manifesting under stress.

207
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,629
Okay, done there.
What about his friend?

208
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,157
Long-term relationship.
Compulsive cheat.

209
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,151
- Seriously?
- Waterproof cover on the smartphone.

210
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,516
Yet his complexion doesn't indicate
outdoor work.

211
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,834
Suggests he's in the habit of taking
his phone into the shower with him,

212
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,434
which means he often receives texts
and emails he'd rather went unseen.

213
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,192
- Can I keep you?
- Do you like solving crimes?

214
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,315
Do you have a vacancy?

215
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,597
- So, Harry?
- Uh, no, no show.

216
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,989
Darling, I'm so sorry.

217
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,799
Yeah, it was a bit of a punt asking,
I suppose.

218
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,519
Still, free bar,
wouldn't have been a good mix.

219
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,632
Oh. God, wow.

220
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,913
- Is that...
- He came.

221
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,108
So that's him.

222
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,350
- Major Sholto.
- Uh-huh.

223
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,795
If they're such good friends,
why does he barely even mention him?

224
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,996
He mentions him all the time to me.
Never shuts up about him.

225
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,309
- About him?
- Mmm-hmm.

226
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
Ugh, I chose this wine.
It's bloody awful.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,513
Yes, but it's definitely him
that he talks about?

228
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,874
Mmm-hmm.

229
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,997
I'm very, very glad to see you, sir.

230
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,873
I know you don't really
do this sort of thing.

231
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,520
Well, I do for old friends, Watson.

232
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,192
John.

233
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,918
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

234
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,878
Civilian life suiting you, then?

235
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,269
Er, yes, well, I think so, sir.

236
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,634
No more need for the trick cyclist?

237
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,917
No, I go now and then.
Sort of a top-up.

238
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,190
Therapy can be very helpful.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,513
Where are you living these days?

240
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,909
Oh, way out in the middle of nowhere.
You <i>wouldn't</i> know it.

241
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,316
You look well.
- I've never even heard him say his name.

242
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,992
Well, he's almost a recluse.

243
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,149
- You know, since...
- Yes.

244
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,598
I didn't think he'd show up at all.

245
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,716
John says he's the most unsociable man
he's ever met.

246
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,916
- He is? He's the most unsociable?
- Mmm.

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,878
Ah, that's why he's bouncing around him
like a puppy.

248
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,153
Oh, Sherlock.

249
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,269
Neither of us were the first, you know.

250
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,555
- Stop smiling.
- It's my wedding day.

251
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,148

252
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,958

253
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,834

254
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,511

255
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,674
Yes. What?

256
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,270
- Sherlock.
- Why are you out of breath?

257
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,069
Filing.

258
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,388
Either I've caught you
in a compromising position

259
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,914
or you've been working out again.
Favour the latter.

260
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,196
- What do you want?
- I need your answer, Mycroft,

261
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,474
as a matter of urgency.

262
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,631
- <i>Answer?</i>
- Even at the eleventh hour

263
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,392
it's not too late to know.

264
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,674
Oh, Lord.

265
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,318
Cars can be ordered,

266
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,833
private jets commandeered.

267
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,229
Today. It's today, isn't it?

268
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,872
No, Sherlock, I will not be coming

269
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,599
to the "night do",
as you so poetically put it.

270
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,393
What a shame.

271
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,950
Mary and John will be extremely...

272
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,508
Delighted not to have me hanging around.

273
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,999
Oh, I don't know.

274
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,150
There should always be a spectre
at the feast.

275
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,238
So, this is it, then? The big day.

276
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,436
I suppose I'll be seeing
a lot more of you from now on.

277
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,110
- What do you mean?
- It'll be just like old times.

278
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,428
No, I don't understand.

279
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,431
<i>Well, it's the end of an era, isn't it?</i>

280
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,638
John and Mary. Domestic bliss.

281
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,917
No, no, no. I prefer to think of it
as the beginning of a new chapter.

282
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,749
- What?
- Nothing.

283
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,432
I know that silence. What?

284
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,192
Well, I'd better let you get back to it.

285
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,589
You have a big speech
or something, don't you?

286
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,950
- What?
<i>- Cakes. Karaoke.</i>

287
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,874
- Mingling.
- Mycroft!

288
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,709
This is what people do, Sherlock.
They get married. I warned you.

289
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,279
Don't get involved.

290
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,554
Involved? I'm not involved.

291
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,596
- No.
- John asked me to be his best man.

292
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,999
- How could I say no?
- <i>Absolutely.</i>

293
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,513
- I'm not involved.
- I believe you.

294
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,999
Really, I do.

295
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,868
Have a lovely day
and do give the happy couple my best.

296
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,149
I will.

297
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,709
<i>Oh, by the way, Sherlock.</i>

298
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,388
Do you remember Redbeard?

299
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,110
I'm not a child any more, Mycroft.

300
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,952
<i>No, of course you're not.</i>

301
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,436
Enjoy not getting involved, Sherlock.

302
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,597
Pray silence for the best man.

303
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,193

304
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,192
Ladies and gentlemen,

305
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,232
family and friends.

306
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,271
And, um...

307
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,634
others.

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,831
- Uh...

309
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,519
Also...

310
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,989
- Greg.
- Molly.

311
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,274
I just had a thought.

312
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,395
Is that a brain?

313
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,392
What if John asks Sherlock
to be his best man?

314
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,436
- Well, he will. He's bound to.
- Exactly.

315
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,080
- So?
- So, he'll have to make a speech

316
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,149
in front of people.

317
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,990
There will be actual people there
actually listening.

318
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,638
Well, what's the worst
that could happen?

319
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,430
Helen Louise probably wondered the same.

320
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,909
Helen Louise?

321
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,318

322
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,149
Oh, hello, dear.

323
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,879
I was just thinking,
if John does ask Sherlock...

324
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,793
What, the speech, dear?
I know. It'll be fine.

325
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,789
It's not just the speech, though, is it?

326
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,877

327
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,869
Mrs Hudson?

328
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,474
- Oh, no, darling.
- You all right?

329
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,232
I was going to see Sherlock
and I thought you <i>were....</i>

330
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,390
- No.
...possibly dying.

331
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,754
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,834
What's wrong?

333
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,799
The telegrams.

334
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,709
- Sorry, what?
- Oh, sorry.

335
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,677

336
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,228
The telegrams.

337
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,279
Right, um...

338
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,078
- Mmm.

339
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,518
First things first.

340
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,589
Telegrams.

341
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,829
Well, they're not actually telegrams.

342
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,592
We just call them telegrams,
I don't know why.

343
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,715
Wedding tradition.

344
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,079
Because we don't have enough
of that already, apparently.

345
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,949
To Mr and Mrs Watson.

346
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,429
So sorry I'm unable to be with you
on your special day.

347
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,397
Good luck and best wishes,
Mike Stanford."

348
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,629
- Ah, Mike.
- Aw.

349
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,039
To John and Mary.

350
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,839
All good wishes for your special day.
With love and many big...

351
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,110
big squishy cuddles
from Stella and Ted."

352
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,874
- "Mary, lots of love..." Oh!

353
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,398
- Yeah?
- "...poppet."

354
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,795
Oodles of love
and heaps of good wishes from Cam.

355
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,316
Wish your family could have seen this.

356
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,231
- Hey, hmm?
- Yep.

357
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,639
Um..."Special day."

358
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,478
Very special day.
<i>''L ove." "Love." "Love." "Love."

359
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,039
Love. Bit of a theme,
you get the general gist.

360
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,394
People are basically fond.

361
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,152

362
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,433
John Watson.

363
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,757
My friend, John Watson.

364
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,435
John.

365
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,596
When John first broached the subject
of being best man, I was confused.

366
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,229
- Sherlock?
- What was that noise downstairs?

367
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,799
Ah, it was Mrs Hudson laughing.

368
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,836
It sounds like she was torturing an owl.

369
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,638
Yeah, well it was laughter.

370
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,235
Could have been both.

371
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,795
- Busy?
 Just occupying myself

372
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,553
Sometimes it's so hard not smoking.

373
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,839
Mind if I interrupt?

374
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,229
Oh, be my guest.

375
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,316
- Tea?
- Ah...

376
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,708
So.

377
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,999
- The big question.
- Mmm-hmm?

378
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,195
The best man.

379
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,237
- The best man?
- What do you think?

380
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,389
Billy Kincaid.

381
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,037
- Sorry, what?
- Billy Kincaid, the Camden Garrotter.

382
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,109
Best man I ever knew.

383
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,872
Vast contributions to charity
never disclosed.

384
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,394
Personally managed to save
three hospitals from closure,

385
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,040
and ran the best and safest
children's homes in North England.

386
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,716
Yes, every now and again
there would be some garrottings,

387
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,314
but stacking up the lives saved
against the garrottings,

388
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,799
- on balance I'd say...
- For my wedding.

389
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,113
For me. I need a best man.

390
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,189
Oh, right.

391
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,236
- Maybe not a garrotter.
- Gavin?

392
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,038
- Who?
- Gavin Lestrade.

393
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,156
He's a man and good at it.

394
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,639
It's Greg.

395
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,153
And he's not my best friend.

396
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,278
Oh, Mike Stanford, I see.

397
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,918
Well, he's nice, um...

398
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,035
Though I'm not sure
how well he'd cope with...

399
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,759
No, Mike's great,
but he's not my best friend.

400
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,636
Look, Sherlock, this is the biggest
and most important day of my life.

401
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,756
- Well...
- No, it is. It is.

402
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,634
And I want to be up there
with the two people

403
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,029
that I love and care about

404
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,758
- most in the world.
- Yes.

405
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,792
- Mary Morstan...
- Yes.

406
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,595
...and...

407
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,798
you.

408
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,152
I confess at first I didn't realise
he was asking me.

409
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,878
When finally I understood,

410
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,997
I expressed to him that I was
both flattered and surprised.

411
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,956
I explained to him that
I had never expected this request

412
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,837
and I was a little daunted
in the face of it.

413
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,354
Sherlock?

414
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,474
I nonetheless promised that I would do
my very best to accomplish a task

415
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,391
which was, for me,
as demanding and difficult

416
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,913
as any I had ever contemplated.

417
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,116
Additionally, I thanked him
for the trust he placed in me

418
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,953
and indicated that I was, in some ways,

419
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,600
very close to being moved by it.

420
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,039
No, it's getting a bit scary now.

421
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,634
It later transpired that I'd said
none of this out aloud.

422
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,676

423
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,999
So, in fact...

424
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,392
- You-you mean...
- Yes.

425
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,872
I'm your... best...

426
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,234
- Man.
...friend?

427
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,830
Yeah, of course you are.

428
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,593
Course you're my best friend.

429
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,835
Well, how was that?

430
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,392
Surprisingly okay.

431
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,154
So you'll have to make a speech,
of course.

432
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,475
So...

433
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,479
Done that. Done that.

434
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,399
Done that bit. Done that bit.

435
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,829
Done that bit.

436
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,471
I'm afraid, John,
I can't congratulate you.

437
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,678
All emotions, and in particular love,

438
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,718
stand opposed to the pure cold reason
I hold above all things.

439
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,071
A wedding is, in my considered opinion,

440
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,709
nothing short of a celebration of
all that is false and specious

441
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,711
and irrational and sentimental

442
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,995
in this ailing
and morally compromised world.

443
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,356
Today we honour the deathwatch beetle
that is the doom of our society

444
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,479
and in time, one feels certain,
our entire species.

445
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,911
But anyway, let's talk about John.

446
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,558
Please.

447
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,279
If I burden myself with
a little helpmate during my adventures,

448
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,237
it is not out of sentiment or caprice,

449
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,550
it is that he has many
fine qualities of his own

450
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,835
that he has overlooked
in his obsession with me.

451
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,673
Indeed, any reputation I have
for mental acuity and sharpness

452
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,035
comes in truth from
the extraordinary contrast

453
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,792
John so selflessly provides.

454
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,518
It is a fact, I believe,
that brides tend to favour

455
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,909
exceptionally plain bridesmaids
for their big day.

456
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,070
There is a certain
analogy there, I feel.

457
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,593
And contrast is, after all,

458
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,069
God's own plan to enhance
the beauty of his creation.

459
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,833
Or it would be if God were not
a ludicrous fantasy

460
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,639
designed to provide a career opportunity
for the family idiot.

461
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,153

462
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,440
The point I'm trying to make
is that I am

463
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,312
the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant

464
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,199
and all-round obnoxious arsehole

465
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,352
that anyone could possibly have
the misfortune to meet.

466
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,189
I am dismissive of the virtuous,

467
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,555
unaware of the beautiful,

468
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,074
and uncomprehending
in the face of the happy.

469
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,070
So if I didn't understand
I was being asked to be best man,

470
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,038
it is because I never expected to be
anybody's best friend.

471
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,955
And certainly not the best friend

472
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,271
of the bravest and kindest
and wisest human being

473
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,920
I have ever had the good fortune
of knowing.

474
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,314
Aw.

475
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,675
John, I am a ridiculous man.

476
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,796
Redeemed only by the warmth
and constancy of your friendship.

477
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,279
But as I am, apparently,
your best friend,

478
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,591
I cannot congratulate you
on your choice of companion.

479
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,839
Actually, now I can.

480
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,353
Mary, when I say you deserve this man,

481
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,798
it is the highest compliment
of which I am capable.

482
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,830
John, you have endured war

483
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,908
and injury

484
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,154
and tragic loss.

485
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,312
So sorry again about that last one.

486
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,115
So know this. Today you sit between

487
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,154
the woman you have made your wife
and the man you have saved.

488
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,876
In short, the two people who
love you most in all this world.

489
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,196
And I know I speak for Mary as well
when I say we will never let you down

490
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,475
and we have a lifetime ahead
to prove that.

491
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,709

492
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,834
- Lf I try and hug him, stop me.
- Certainly not.

493
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,720
Ah, yes. Now onto some
funny stories about John.

494
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,068

495
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,118
What's wrong? What happened?
Why are you all doing that?

496
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,315
John?

497
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,355
Oh, Sherlock.

498
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,869
Did I do it wrong?

499
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,632
No, you didn't. Come here.

500
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,594

501
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,989
- I haven't finished yet.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

502
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,958
- So onto some funny stories...
- Can you wait till I sit down?

503
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,638

504
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,310
So onto some funny stories about John.

505
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,354
If you could all just cheer up a bit,
that would...

506
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,431
...be better.

507
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,309
On we go.

508
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,473
So for funny stories, one has to look
no further than John's blog.

509
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,552
The record of our time together.

510
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,076
Of course, he does tend to romanticise
things a bit but then, you know,

511
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,149
he's a romantic.

512
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,472
We've tackled some strange cases.

513
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,675
The Hollow Client.

514
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,309
The Poisoned Giant.

515
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,789
Get down, John!

516
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,714
We've had some frustrating cases.

517
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,315

518
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,873
What is that?

519
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,109
A French decathlete
found completely out of his mind

520
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,478
surrounded by 1,812 matchboxes,
all empty, except this one.

521
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,830
And what's in that one?

522
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,318
The inexplicable.

523
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,313
Touching cases.

524
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,876
She's going to ring the doorbell.

525
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,391
Oh, no, she's changed her mind.

526
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,914
No, she's going to do it.
No, she's leaving.

527
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,196
She's leaving.
Oh, she's coming back.

528
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,238
She's a client, she's boring.
I've seen those symptoms before.

529
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,389
Hmm?

530
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,029
Oscillation on the pavement
always means there's a love affair.

531
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,350
And of course, I have to mention
The Elephant in the Room.

532
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,199

533
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,515
But we want something very particular
for this special day, don't we?

534
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,239
The Bloody Guardsman.

535
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,512
Need to work on your half
of the church, Mary.

536
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,396
- Looking a bit thin.
- Oh.

537
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,469
Orphan's lot.

538
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,516
Friends, that's all I have.
Lots of friends.

539
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,068
Schedule the organ music
to begin at precisely 11:48...

540
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,276
But the rehearsal's not for
another two weeks. Just calm down.

541
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,191
Calm? I am calm, I'm extremely calm.

542
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,430
Let's get back to the reception.
Come on.

543
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,078
John's cousin, top table?

544
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,116
Hmm, hates you.
Can't even bear to think about you.

545
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,918
- Seriously?
- Second-class post.

546
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,514
Cheap card.

547
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,953
Bought at a petrol station.
Look at the stamp.

548
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,029
Three attempts at licking.

549
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,350
She's obviously unconsciously
retaining saliva.

550
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,953
Aw, let's stick her by the bogs.

551
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,758
- Oh, yes.

552
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,309
Who else hates me?

553
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,434
Oh, great. Thanks.

554
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,637
Priceless painting nicked.
Looks interesting.

555
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,709
- Table four?
- Done.

556
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,552
My husband is three people.

557
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,029
- Table five?
- Major James Sholto. Who he?

558
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
Oh, John's old commanding officer.
I don't think he's coming.

559
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,751
He'll be there.
- Well, he needs to RSVP, then.

560
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,829
He'll be there.

561
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,355
My husband is three people.
It's interesting.

562
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,113
Says he has three distinct patterns
of moles on his skin.

563
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,833
Identical triplets.
One in half a million births.

564
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,955
Solved it without leaving the flat.

565
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,075
Now, serviettes.

566
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,634
Swan or Sydney Opera House?

567
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,755
Where did you learn to do that?

568
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,195
Many unexpected skills required
in the field of criminal investigation.

569
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,077
- Fibbing, Sherlock.
- I once broke an alibi

570
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,151
by demonstrating
the exact severity of...

571
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,355
I'm not John.
I can tell when you're fibbing.

572
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,873
Okay. I learnt it on YouTube.

573
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,520
Opera House, please.
Oh, hang on. I'm buzzing.

574
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,755
Hello?

575
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,039
Oh, hi, Beth.

576
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,350
Yeah, yeah, I don't see why not.

577
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,269
Actually, if that's Beth,
it's probably for me, too. Hang on.

578
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,033
He knows we don't have
a friend called Beth.

579
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,394
He's going to figure out that it's code.

580
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,993
- He's YouTubing serviettes.
- He's thorough.

581
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,354
- He's terrified.
- Of course he's not.

582
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,873
Right, you know when you're
scared of something,

583
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,916
you start wishing it sooner
just to get it all going?

584
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,035
That's what he's doing.

585
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,475
Why would he be scared
that we're getting married?

586
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,437
It's not going to change anything.
We'll still do stuff.

587
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,795
We need to prove it to him.
I told you to find him a new case.

588
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,632
- I'm trying.
- You need to run him, okay?

589
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,950
Show him it's still the good old days.

590
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,436
That just sort of happened.

591
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,639
Sherlock, um...

592
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,235
mate.

593
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,595
<i>I've....</i>

594
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,278
I've smelled
18 different perfumes.

595
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,719
I've sampled

596
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,995
nine different slices of cake,
which all tasted identical.

597
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,832
I like the bridesmaids in purple.

598
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,353
- Lilac.
- Lilac.

599
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,951
Um, there are no more decisions
left to make.

600
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,077
I don't even understand the decisions
that we have made.

601
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,196
I'm faking opinions and it's exhausting.

602
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,350
So please, before she comes back...

603
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,519

604
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,955
<i>....</i> Pick something.

605
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,715
- Anything, pick one.
- Pick what?

606
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,994
A case.

607
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,316
Your inbox is bursting. Just...

608
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,115
get me out of here.

609
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,430
You want to go out on a case? Now?

610
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,714
Please.

611
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,229
Sherlock, for me.

612
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,952
Don't you worry about anything.
I'll get you out of this.

613
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,678

614
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,795
Oh.

615
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,678
<i>Dear, Mr Holmes, my name is Bainbridge.</i>

616
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,433
<i>I'm a private in</i>
<i>Her Majesty's Household Guard.</i>

617
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,158
<i>I'm writing to you</i>
<i>about a personal matter,</i>

618
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,674
<i>one I don't care to bring</i>
<i>before my superiors,</i>

619
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,432
<i>it would sound so trivial.</i>

620
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,032
<i>But I think someone's stalking me.</i>

621
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,869
<i>I'm used to tourists,</i>
<i>it's part of the job.</i>

622
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,712
<i>But this is different.</i>

623
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,835
<i>Someone's watching me.</i>

624
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,710
<i>He's taking pictures of me every day.</i>

625
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,549
<i>I don't want to mention it</i>
<i>to the manager</i>

626
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,790
<i>but it's really preying on my mind.</i>

627
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,113
Uniform fetishist.
All the nice girls like a soldier.

628
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,553
It's sailor.

629
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,313
And Bainbridge thinks
his stalker is a bloke.

630
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,628
Let's go and investigate.

631
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,468
- Please?
- Elite guard.

632
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,879
Forty enlisted men and officers.

633
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,315
Why this particular grenadier? Curious.

634
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,277
- Now you're talking.
- Okay.

635
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,873
- Bye.

636
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,949
Uh, we're just going to...

637
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,077
I need, um, Sherlock to help me
choose <i>some....</i>

638
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,959
- Tie.
...socks.

639
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,593
- Why don't we go with socks?
- Yeah.

640
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,669
I mean, you've got to get
the right ones.

641
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,159
Exactly. To go with my...

642
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,389
- Tie.
...outfit.

643
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,516
Well, it'll take a while,
right?

644
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,631
- My coat in there?
- Yes.

645
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,512
Just going to take him out for a bit.

646
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,953
- Run him.
- I know.

647
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,075
You said you'd find him a case.

648
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,233
- Coming, Sherlock?
- Coming.

649
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,715
Taxi!

650
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,676
Company, halt!

651
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,391
Right turn!

652
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,317
We're here to see
Private Steven Bainbridge.

653
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,356
He's on duty right now, sir.

654
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,668
I'll certainly let him know
when he's free.

655
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,709
And when will that be?

656
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,595
Another hour.

657
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,676
You think
they give them classes?

658
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,749
Classes?

659
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,992
How to resist the temptation
to scratch their behinds.

660
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,398
Afferent neurons
in the peripheral nervous system.

661
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,113
- Bum itch.
- Oh.

662
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,750
So why don't you see him any more?

663
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,513
- Who?
- Your previous commander, Sholto.

664
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,876
- Previous commander?
- I meant ex.

665
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,238
Previous suggests that
I currently have a commander.

666
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,719
- Which you don't.
- Which I don't.

667
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,153
Of course you don't.

668
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,358
He was decorated, wasn't he?

669
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,556
- A war hero.
- Not to everyone.

670
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,591
He led a team of crows into battle.

671
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,432
- Crows?
- New recruits.

672
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,590
It's standard procedure,
break the new boys in,

673
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,352
but it went wrong.

674
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,754
They all died.
He was the only survivor.

675
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,239
The press and the families
gave him hell.

676
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,389
He gets more death threats than you.

677
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,113
Oh, I wouldn't count on that.

678
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,192
Why have you suddenly taken an interest
in another human being?

679
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,629
I'm chatting.

680
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,713
Won't be trying that again.

681
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,950
Changing the subject completely...

682
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,154
You know it won't alter anything, right?
Me and Mary getting married.

683
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,359
We'll still be doing all this.

684
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,429
Oh, good.

685
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,839
If you were worried.

686
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,399
I wasn't worried.

687
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,273

688
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,752
The thing about Mary,

689
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,073
she has completely
turned my life around.

690
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,518
Changed everything.

691
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,118
But for the record,

692
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,079
over the last few years, there are
two people who have done that and...

693
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,917
the other one is...

694
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,433
a complete dickhead.

695
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,472

696
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,158

697
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,472
Can I ask what this is
in connection with?

698
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,474
Private Bainbridge contacted us
about a personal matter, sir.

699
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,320
Nothing's personal
when it concerns my troops.

700
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,036
- What do you really want?
- I'm here on a legitimate enquiry.

701
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,668
You press?

702
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,271
Digging for some bloody
royal story or something?

703
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,873
No, sir, I'm...

704
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,556
Captain John Watson,
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers...

705
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,834
Retired.

706
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,276
You could be a used car salesman now,
for all I know.

707
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,639
- Bainbridge?

708
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,711
Gentleman here to see you.

709
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,394
Bainbridge!

710
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,548
I know you, don't I?

711
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,275
Hmm?

712
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,877
I've seen you in the papers.

713
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,709
Hanging around with that detective,
the one with the silly hat.

714
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,436
What the hell does Bainbridge want
with a detective?

715
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,199
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say.

716
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,840
You're not at liberty to say?
He's a soldier in my regiment.

717
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,514
I'll be damned if he's going to get up
to cloak-and-dagger nonsense like this.

718
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,874
- Sir.

719
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,874
- Sir.
- What's going on?

720
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,871
It's Bainbridge, sir. He's dead.

721
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,037
My God!

722
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,675

723
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,512
Let me take a look, sir, I'm a doctor.

724
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,715
What?

725
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,949
Sergeant, arrest this man.

726
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,354
What? No, no, I'm a doctor.

727
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,759
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?

728
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,671
- Sergeant.
- Let me examine him, please.

729
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,637
Sir, caught this one snooping around.

730
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,913
Is that what this is all about?

731
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,878
Distracting me so that this man
could get in here and kill Bainbridge?

732
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,473
Kill him with what? Where's the weapon?

733
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,709
- What?
- Where's the weapon?

734
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,233
Go on, search me, no weapon.

735
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,159
Bainbridge was on parade.
He came off duty five minutes ago.

736
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,355
When's this supposed to have happened?

737
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,510
You obviously stabbed him
before he got into the shower.

738
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,079
- No.
- No?

739
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,196
He's soaking wet
and there's still shampoo in his hair.

740
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,077
He got into the shower
and then someone stabbed him.

741
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,798
But the cubicle was locked
from the inside, sir.

742
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,869
I had to break it open.

743
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,393
Must have climbed over the top.

744
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,118
Well, then I'd be soaking wet, too,
wouldn't I?

745
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,875
Major, please. I'm John Watson,
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.

746
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,075
Three years in Afghanistan,

747
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,958
a veteran of Kandahar, Helmand
and Barts bloody Hospital!

748
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,712
Let me examine this body!

749
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,029
Thank you.

750
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,599
- Suicide?
- No.

751
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,479
The weapon again, no knife.

752
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,919
Here we are.
There is a wound to the abdomen.

753
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,399
Incredibly fine.

754
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,669
Man stabbed to death.

755
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,635
No murder weapon.
Door locked from the inside.

756
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,919
Only one way in or out of here.

757
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,194
- Sherlock.
- Mmm?

758
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,075
- He's still breathing.
- Oh, my God.

759
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,479
- What do we do?
- Give me your scarf.

760
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,152
- What?
- Quickly, now.

761
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,028
- Call an ambulance.
- What?

762
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,678
Call an ambulance now!

763
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,595
Do it!

764
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,477
Nurse, press here, hard.

765
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,033
- Nurse?
- Yeah, I'm making do.

766
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,793
Keep pressure on that wound.

767
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,116
Steven? Steven, stay with me.

768
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,389
Private Bainbridge had just
come off guard duty.

769
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,471
He'd stood there for hours,
plenty of people watching,

770
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,959
nothing apparently wrong.

771
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,679
He came off duty
and within minutes was nearly dead

772
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,230
from a wound in his stomach
but there was no weapon.

773
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,875
Where did it go?

774
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,837
Ladies and gentlemen,
I invite you to consider this.

775
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,956
A murderer who can walk through walls.

776
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,598
A weapon that can vanish.

777
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,791
But in all of this,
there is only one element

778
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,678
which can be said to be
truly remarkable.

779
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,799
Would anyone like to make a guess?

780
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,876
Come on, come on. There is actually
an element of Q&A to all of this.

781
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,552

782
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,194
Scotland Yard, have you got a theory?

783
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,071
Yeah, you. You're a detective,
broadly speaking. Got a theory?

784
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,752
Er, um...

785
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,753
If the blade
was propelled through the, um...

786
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,916
grating in the air vent...

787
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,357
Maybe a ballista or a catapult,

788
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,510
somebody tiny could crawl in there.

789
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,436
So yeah, we're looking for a dwarf.

790
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,669
- Brilliant.
- Really?

791
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,749
No.

792
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,796
- Next.
 He stabbed himself

793
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,519
Hello, who was that? Tom.

794
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,590

795
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,909
Got a theory?

796
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:15,478
Um, attempted suicide with a blade
made of compacted blood and bone.

797
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,152
Broke after piercing his abdomen,
like a <i>meat....</i>

798
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,749
dagger.

799
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,917
- A meat dagger?
- Yes.

800
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,993
Sit down.

801
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,629
No.

802
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,918
There was one feature
and only one feature of interest

803
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,797
in the whole of this baffling case

804
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,235
and quite frankly, it was the usual.

805
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,389
John Watson.

806
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,552
Who, while I was trying
to solve the murder,

807
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,392
instead saved a life.

808
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,748
There are mysteries worth solving
and stories worth telling.

809
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,553
The best and bravest man I know

810
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,517
and on top of that
he actually knows how to do stuff.

811
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,589

812
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,750
Except wedding planning and serviettes,
he's rubbish at those.

813
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,875

814
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,598
The case itself remains
the most ingenious

815
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,875
and brilliantly planned murder
or attempted murder

816
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,155
I've ever had the pleasure to encounter.

817
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,437
The most perfect locked-room mystery
of which I am aware.

818
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,753
However, I'm not just here
to praise John,

819
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,149
I'm also here embarrass him,
so let's move on to some...

820
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,355
No, wait. So how was it done?

821
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,271
- How was what done?
- The stabbing.

822
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,273
I'm afraid I don't know.

823
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,316
I didn't solve that one, that's...

824
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,110
It can happen sometimes. It's very...
Very disappointing.

825
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,030
Embarrassment leads me on
to the stag night.

826
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,919
Course, there's hours of material here,

827
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,956
but I've cut it down
to the really good bits.

828
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,239
Murder scenes.

829
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,475
Locations of murders?

830
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,834
Mmm, pub crawl, themed.

831
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,797
Yeah, but why can't you just do
Underground stations?

832
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,993
It lacks the personal touch.

833
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,229
We're going to go for a drink in...

834
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,197
In every street
where you've found a corpse.

835
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,474
Delightful.

836
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,312
- Where do I come in?
- Don't want to get ill.

837
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,719
That would ruin it, spoil the mood.

838
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,314
You're a graduate chemist,
can't you just work it out?

839
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,072
I like the practical experience.

840
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,313
Meaning you think I like a drink?

841
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,753
- Occasionally.
- That I'm a drunk?

842
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,875
No. No!

843
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,037
You look well.

844
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,515
- I am.
- How's...

845
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,789
Tom?

846
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,871
- Not a sociopath.
- Still? Good.

847
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,679
And we're having quite a lot of sex.

848
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,789
Okay.

849
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,710
I want you to calculate
John's ideal intake and mine

850
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,472
to remain in the sweet spot
the whole evening.

851
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,195
- Lightheaded good.
- Urinating in wardrobes bad.

852
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,549
Hmm.

853
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,473
Two, er, beers, please.

854
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,438
- Pints?
- 443.7 millilitres.

855
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,149
<i>Ah....</i>

856
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,954

857
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,958

858
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,118
- What, we're on a schedule?
- You'll thank me.

859
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,672
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

860
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,392
- Over there.
- What?

861
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,038
Toilets. Any second now, you'll get...

862
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,553
Hang on. Tell me after. I need the loo.

863
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,709
Mmm. On schedule.

864
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,872
- Eh?
- Nothing. Go.

865
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,194
- How long?
- Sorry?

866
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,554
Your visit.

867
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,955
If you could estimate
approximate volume discharge...

868
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,439
Stop talking now.

869
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,549
Oh.

870
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,995
Quick, one more. He mustn't see.

871
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,239
There you go.

872
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,595
Cheers.

873
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,754
I know Ash!

874
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,153
Don't tell me I don't.

875
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,070
That is enough! That is...

876
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,629
Ashton.

877
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,388
I know Ashton!

878
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,040
I have an international reputation.

879
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,359
Do you have an international reputation?

880
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,829
No, I don't have
an international reputation.

881
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,955
No.

882
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,316
And I can't even remember what for.

883
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,429
It's...

884
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,868
crime, something like that.

885
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,395
Oh.

886
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,596
What are you doing back?
I thought you were going to be out late?

887
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,194
Ah, Hudders. What time is it?

888
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,351
You've only been out two hours.

889
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,029
Am I a vegetable?

890
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,314
You or the...

891
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,434
Funny.

892
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,513
- Thank you.
- Come on.

893
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,034
- No, you're not a vegetable.
- It's your go.

894
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,272
Uh...

895
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,634
Am I human?

896
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,789
Sometimes.

897
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,598
Can't have sometimes. Has to be, um...

898
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,715
Yes, you're human.

899
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,030
Yes, I know. And am I man?

900
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,079
- Yep.
- Tall?

901
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,999
Not as tall as people think.

902
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,433
Hmm. Nice?

903
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,279
- Ish.
- Clever?

904
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,237
- I'd say so.
- You would.

905
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,509
Am I important?

906
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,079
To some people.

907
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,720
Do "people" like me?

908
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,039
Er, no, they don't.

909
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,634
You tend to rub them up the wrong way.

910
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,153
- Okay.

911
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,914
Am I the current King of England?

912
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,319
<i>We....</i>

913
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,791
You know we don't have a king.

914
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,074
- Don't we?
- No.

915
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,309
Your go.

916
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,309
I don't mind.

917
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,153
Am I a woman?

918
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,198

919
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,475
What?

920
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,035
Yes.

921
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,839
Am I pretty?

922
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,429
This.

923
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,352
Beauty is a construct
based entirely on childhood impressions,

924
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,953
influences and role models.

925
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,350
Yeah, but am I a pretty lady?

926
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,356
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you're supposed to be.

927
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,589
You picked the name!

928
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,274
Yeah, but I picked it
at random from the papers.

929
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,438
You're not really getting the hang
of this game, are you, Sherlock?

930
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,398
So I am human,
I'm not as tall as people think I am.

931
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,835
I'm... I'm nice-ish.

932
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,595
Clever. Important to some people.

933
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,189
But I tend to rub them up
the wrong way.

934
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,599

935
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,594
- Got it.
- Go on, then.

936
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,829
I'm you, aren't I?

937
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,595
Client!

938
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,875
Client.

939
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,312
- Hello.
- Hello.

940
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,389
Come.

941
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,471
Which one of you is Sherlock Holmes?

942
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,596

943
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,594
I don't a lot.

944
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,719
I mean, I don't
date all that much and...

945
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,477
He seemed nice, you know?

946
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,994
We seemed to automatically connect.

947
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,756
We had one night, dinner.

948
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,110
Such interesting conversation,
it was lovely.

949
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,872
To be honest,

950
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,714
I'd love to have gone further
but I thought,

951
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,315
No, this is special.

952
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,637
Let's take it slowly.
Exchange numbers."

953
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,950
He said he'd get in touch and then...

954
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,837
Maybe he wasn't quite

955
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,431
as keen as I was but I...

956
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,908
I just thought at least he'd call to say
that we were finished.

957
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,358
I went round there.

958
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,151
To his flat. No trace of him.

959
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,352
Mr Holmes, I honestly think

960
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,068
I had dinner with a ghost.

961
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,352

962
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,549
Mr Holmes?

963
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,833

964
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,558
With a ghost, Mr Holmes!

965
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,558
Boring. Boring. Boring. No!

966
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,199
Fascinating.

967
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,072
John, John, wake up.

968
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,035
Apologise about my, you know...

969
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,995
Rude. Rude!

970
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,355
I checked with the landlord
and the man who lived there died.

971
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,349
Heart attack.

972
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,112
And there we are
having dinner one week on.

973
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,478
And I found this thing online,

974
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,516
sort of chat room thing,

975
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,955
for girls who think they're dating men
from the spirit world.

976
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,079
Don't worry.
I'll find him in 10 minutes.

977
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,629
What's your dog's name?

978
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,278
Yeah, I'll be there if you want...

979
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,713
John, wake up.

980
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,153
Meant <i>to....</i>

981
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,470
You... The game is something...

982
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,231
- Oh.
- Yeah, that, that.

983
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,795
Okay.

984
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,879
Oh, it's nice.

985
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,639
Nice place.

986
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,709
- See anything?
- Hmm?

987
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,472
Any clues, Mr Holmes?

988
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,548
Oh, er...

989
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,438
I'm just going to whip this out.

990
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,189
Mmm-hmm.

991
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,269
- You all right?
- Hmm?

992
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,713
- Yeah, he's clueing.
- What?

993
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,994
He's... Hmm?

994
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,911
He's clueing for looks.

995
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,119
Mr Holmes?

996
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,354

997
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,557
- Mr Holmes?
- I'm calling the police.

998
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,755
Oh, no.

999
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,439
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1000
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,748
This is a famous detective.

1001
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,513
It's Sherlock Holmes
and his partner, John Hamish Watson.

1002
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,948
What do you think you're doing?

1003
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,279
Don't compromise the integrity of the...

1004
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,509

1005
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,639
Crime scene.

1006
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,190
Yeah, that.

1007
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,114

1008
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,270
Wakey, wakey!
- Oh, my God.

1009
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,875
Greg? Is that Greg?

1010
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,109
Get up, I'm going to
put you two in a taxi.

1011
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,080
Managed to square things
with the desk sergeant.

1012
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,149

1013
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,588
What a couple of lightweights.

1014
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,398
You couldn't even make it
to closing time.

1015
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,392
- Can you whisper?
 Not really!

1016
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,675
Come on.

1017
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,549
Well, thanks for, you know,

1018
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,596
- an evening.
- It was awful.

1019
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,033
- Yep.
- Oh.

1020
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,076
I was going to pretend but...

1021
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,388
It was, truly.

1022
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,550
- That woman Tessa...
- What?

1023
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,200
Dated a ghost,
most interesting case for months.

1024
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,236
What a wasted opportunity.

1025
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,315
Okay.

1026
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,270
How are you feeling?
- Mmm.

1027
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,633
It's just like old times,
having you back here.

1028
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,277
I thought I'd make your favourite.

1029
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,191
- One last time.
- Oh.

1030
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,635
Don't sound so final about it.

1031
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,709
I will be visiting, you know.

1032
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,189
Oh, I've heard that one before.

1033
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,269
No, it's different now, though,
isn't it?

1034
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,032
It's different to when we thought
<i>we'd</i> lost him.

1035
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,475
Well, marriage changes everything, John.

1036
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,234
- Does it?
- Yeah.

1037
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,390
You might not think it but it does.

1038
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,391
It's a different phase in your life.

1039
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,393
You meet new people
'cause you're a couple.

1040
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,276
And then you just
let your old friends slip away.

1041
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,237
It won't be like that.

1042
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,039
Well, if you've found the right one,
the person that you click with,

1043
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,678
it's the best thing in the world.

1044
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,512
Well, I have. I know I have.

1045
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,750
Oh, I'm sure. She's lovely.

1046
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,193
Yeah, I think so.

1047
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,478
- What about you?
- Me?

1048
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,791
Did you think you'd found the right one
when you married Mr Hudson?

1049
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,872
No. It was just
a whirlwind thing for us.

1050
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,189
I knew it wouldn't work

1051
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,236
- but I just got sort of swept along.
- Right.

1052
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,277
And then we moved to Florida.

1053
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,078
We had a fantastic time

1054
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,276
but of course, I didn't know
what he was up to.

1055
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,032
- The drugs.
- Drugs?

1056
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,435
He was running, um...

1057
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,439
Oh, God, what do you call it?

1058
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,238
Um, a...

1059
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,715
cartel.

1060
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,118
- And got in with a really bad crowd.
- Right.

1061
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,589
And then I found out about
all the other women.

1062
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,398
I didn't have a clue.

1063
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,875
So when he was actually arrested
for blowing someone's head off,

1064
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,316
it was quite a relief, to be honest.

1065
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,189
Right.

1066
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,916
It was purely physical
between me and Frank.

1067
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,832
We couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

1068
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,994
And, um, there was one night...

1069
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,832
Oh, is that Sherlock?

1070
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,909
Is it?

1071
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,029

1072
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,758
No, it's Sherlock.

1073
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,548

1074
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,639

1075
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,158

1076
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,269
There are going to be others.

1077
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,191
- Others?
- Victims. Women.

1078
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,951
Most ghosts tend to haunt
a single house.

1079
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,395
This ghost, however,
is willing to commute. Look.

1080
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,473
Mmm... not you.

1081
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,639
Not you. Not you.
Not you. Not you. Not you.

1082
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,797
Not you. Not you.

1083
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,874
Not you. Not you. Not you.

1084
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,914
Not you. Not you. Not you. Not you.

1085
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,433
Not you. Not you. Not you.

1086
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,669
Not you. Not you. Not you. Not you.
Not you, you, you or you. Or you.

1087
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,911
Or you. Not you. Not you.
Not you. Not you.

1088
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,110
Not you. Not you.

1089
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,151
- Hi.
- Gail.

1090
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,389
Charlotte.

1091
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,949
Robyn.

1092
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,829
Vicky.

1093
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,635
How did you meet?

1094
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,039
Came up to me in a pub.

1095
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,519
Same gym as me.

1096
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,953
We just got chatting on the bus.

1097
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,029
Online.

1098
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,833
- Name?
- Told you.

1099
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,989
His name.

1100
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,638
- Oscar.
- Mike.

1101
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,869
Terry.

1102
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,076
Um, Love Monkey.

1103
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,191
- Your place?
His place.

1104
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,669
Address?

1105
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,318

1106
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,319
Nothing happened.

1107
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,119
It was just very romantic.

1108
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,589
Four women in four nights.
He must have something special.

1109
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,591
- He was very charming.
- Innocent.

1110
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,875
He was sweet.

1111
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,553
- He a lovely...
- You okay?

1112
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,039

1113
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,989
Let your food go cold.

1114
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,399
Mrs Hudson will play hell.

1115
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,959
Not now, John.

1116
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,435
- Sorry about that.

1117
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,839
He had a lovely manner.

1118
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,591
Different names, different addresses.

1119
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,396
- Describe him.
- Short blond hair.

1120
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,754
Dark hair. Long.

1121
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,478
Ginger. I like gingers.

1122
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,595
Couldn't tell.

1123
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,594
He had a mask on.

1124
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,597
He's stealing
the identity of corpses,

1125
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,750
getting their names
from the obituary columns.

1126
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,034
All single men.

1127
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,634
He's using the dead man's flat

1128
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,312
under the assumption
it'll be empty for a while.

1129
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,589
Free love nest.

1130
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,598
- I feel sick.
- It's gruesome.

1131
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,477
- That's awful.
- Clever.

1132
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,549
Bastard.

1133
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,993

1134
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,158
Hello, Tessa.

1135
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,234
Meanwhile, back to business.
No one wants to use a dead man's home.

1136
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:05,080
At least not until it's been cleared,
so he disguises himself,

1137
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,355
steals the man's home,
steals his identity.

1138
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,873
But only for one night.

1139
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,556
- And he's gone.
- He's not a ghost, John.

1140
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,915
He's a mayfly. He lives for a day.

1141
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,999
So what was it he was looking for?

1142
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,229
Job?

1143
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,435
- Gardener.
- Cook.

1144
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,953
- Private nurse.
- I do security work.

1145
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,315
Maid.

1146
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,472
Obvious. You all work
for the same person.

1147
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,957
No, no. Not the same employer.

1148
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,678
Damn! Come on, we can do this.

1149
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,555
Ideal night out?

1150
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,437
- Clay pigeon shooting.
- Line dancing.

1151
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,717
- Pictures.
- Wine in front of the telly.

1152
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,229
Dungeon.

1153
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,112
- Makeup?
- Clarins.

1154
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,838
- No7.
- Maybelline.

1155
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,071
- Nothing special.
- Whatever's cheap.

1156
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,909
Perfume?

1157
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,479
- Chanel.
- Chanel.

1158
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,239
- Chanel.
- Chanel.

1159
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,475
Estée Lauder.

1160
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,955
Ideal man?

1161
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,117
- George Clooney.
- Oh, no.

1162
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,235
Home-loving.

1163
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,589
He'd have to like cuddling.

1164
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,235
Caring.

1165
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,509
Ten things.

1166
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,591
One, someone who isn't competitive
with other men.

1167
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,836
Two, someone who isn't constantly trying
to define himself by his masculinity.

1168
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,110
There's a unifying factor,
there has to be.

1169
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,760
None of you reported anything stolen.

1170
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,993
Security guard, gardener, cook,

1171
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,038
maid, private nurse.

1172
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,553
He's romancing his way
up the pecking order,

1173
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,437
somebody's pecking order.
Come on, think.

1174
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,794
Unless...

1175
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,072
Do you have a secret
you've never told anyone?

1176
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,229
No.

1177
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,399
- Gotcha.
- What do you mean?

1178
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,755
Everyone has secrets
and they all replied too quickly.

1179
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,354
- Got to go.
- See you.

1180
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,634
- No, wait.
- Bye-bye.

1181
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,280
Sorry, sexy,
some secrets have to stay secret.

1182
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,153
Enjoy the wedding.

1183
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,309
Yeah.

1184
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,631
Why? Why would he date
all of those women

1185
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,914
and not return their calls?

1186
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,229
You're missing the obvious, mate.

1187
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,313
- Am I?
- He's a man.

1188
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,997
Why would he change his identity?

1189
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,435
Maybe he's married.

1190
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,709
Oh.

1191
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,028
Married.

1192
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,868
Obvious, really.

1193
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,032
Our mayfly man was trying to escape
the suffocating chains of domesticity

1194
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,758
and instead of endless nights
in watching the telly

1195
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,432
or going to barbeques
with the awful, dreadful,

1196
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,794
boring people he couldn't stand,

1197
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,110
he used his wits, cleverness
and powers of disguise

1198
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,189
to play the field.

1199
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,269
He was...

1200
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,558
On second thoughts,

1201
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,596
I probably should have told you
about The Elephant in the Room.

1202
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,196
However, it does help
to further illustrate

1203
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,430
how invaluable John is to me.

1204
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,794
I can read a crime scene
the way he can understand a human being.

1205
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,472
I used to think
that's what made me special.

1206
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,869
Quite frankly, I still do.
But a word to the wise.

1207
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,952
Should any of you require
the services of either of us,

1208
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,837
I will solve your murder

1209
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,480
but it takes John Watson
to save your life.

1210
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,755
Trust me on that. I should know.

1211
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,400
He's saved mine so many times
and in so many ways.

1212
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,188
This blog

1213
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,872
is the story of two men and their
frankly ridiculous adventures.

1214
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,473
- Of murder, mystery and mayhem.

1215
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,797
But from now on, there's a new story.

1216
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,918
A bigger adventure.

1217
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,432
Ladies and gentlemen,

1218
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,034
pray charge your glasses
and be upstanding.

1219
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,514
Today begin the adventures
of Mary Elizabeth Watson

1220
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,272
and John Hamish Watson.

1221
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,475

1222
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,279
The two reasons why every
single one of us is...

1223
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,989

1224
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,912

1225
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,272

1226
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,436
What did you say?

1227
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,870
You said,

1228
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,997
John Hamish Watson.

1229
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,310
You said that, you said Hamish.

1230
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,475
This is a famous detective,
it's Sherlock Holmes

1231
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,596
and his partner, John Hamish Watson.

1232
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,353
How did you know?

1233
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,715
How did you know his middle name?

1234
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,392
Never tells anyone, he hates it.

1235
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,959
John H Watson?

1236
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,069
Yep.

1237
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,153
- Henry?
- Shut up.

1238
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,838
- Humphrey?
- Shut up.

1239
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,998

1240
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,908
- Higgins?
Go away!

1241
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,995
Took him years to confide in me.

1242
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,354

1243
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,313
That's my birth certificate.

1244
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,469
Yep.

1245
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,232
And the woman, she knew.

1246
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,433
Hamish.

1247
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,079
John Hamish Watson.

1248
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,118
Just if you were
looking for baby names.

1249
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,352
God knows where she is.

1250
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,836
Out of my head, I am busy!

1251
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,669
There's only one time
that name's been made public.

1252
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,911
Does it have to be
on the invitation?

1253
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,479
It's your name.

1254
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,597
- It's traditional.
- It's funny.

1255
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,311
<i>Enjoy the wedding.</i>

1256
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,868
Enjoy the wedding.

1257
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,359
The wedding!

1258
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,429
You knew about the wedding.

1259
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,829
More importantly,
you'd seen the wedding invitation.

1260
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,832
Now, barely a hundred people
had seen that invitation.

1261
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,876
The Mayfly Man only saw five women.

1262
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,473
For one person to be in both groups...

1263
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,114
could be a coincidence.

1264
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,872
Oh, Sherlock.

1265
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,032
What do we say about coincidence?

1266
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,599
The universe is rarely so lazy.

1267
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,671
So, the balance of probability is...

1268
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,749
Someone went to great lengths

1269
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,875
to find out something
about this wedding.

1270
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,793
- What great lengths?
- They lied. Assumed false identities.

1271
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,871
- Which suggests?
- Criminal intent.

1272
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,474
- Also suggests...
- Intelligence. Planning.

1273
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,869
Clearly. But more importantly...

1274
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,915
The Mayfly Man.

1275
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,353
The Mayfly Man is...

1276
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,317
...here today.

1277
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,795
Ooh, sorry, I...

1278
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,670

1279
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,749
Another glass, sir?

1280
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,029
Thank you, yes. Thank you, yes.

1281
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,115
Something is going to happen,
right here.

1282
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,315
Now, where were we?

1283
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,435
Could be any second.

1284
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,474
You have control of the room.

1285
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,150
Ah, yes, raising glasses
and standing up.

1286
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,199
Very good, thank you.

1287
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,633
Don't lose it.

1288
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,679
And down again.

1289
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,558

1290
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,675
Ladies and gentlemen, people tell you
not to milk a good speech.

1291
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,716
Get off early, leave them laughing.

1292
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,275
Wise advice I'll certainly
try to bear in mind but for now...

1293
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,310
Part two! Part two is more action-based.

1294
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,710
I'm going to walk around,
shake things up a bit.

1295
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,148
Who'd go to a wedding?
That's the question.

1296
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,472
Who would bother to go to any lengths
to get themselves to a wedding?

1297
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,197
Well, everyone.

1298
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,872
Weddings are great! Love a wedding.

1299
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,757
- What's he doing?
- Something's wrong.

1300
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,273
And John's great, too.

1301
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,920
I haven't said that enough,
barely scratched the surface.

1302
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,835
I could go on all night about
the depth and complexity of his...

1303
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,309
Jumpers.</i>
...jumpers, and he can cook...

1304
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,153
Does a thing,

1305
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,273
thing with peas....once.

1306
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,998
Might not be peas, might not be him.

1307
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,038
But he's got a great singing voice
or somebody <i>does....</i>

1308
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,631
Too many, too many, too many, too many!

1309
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,471
Sorry, too many jokes about John.

1310
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,879
Now, uh...

1311
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,349
Criminal intent.

1312
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,078
Where was I? Ah, yes.

1313
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,957
Extraordinary lengths.

1314
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,598
Speech! Speech.

1315
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,355
Let's talk about...

1316
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,874
All of which is suggestive of...

1317
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,469
- Murder.

1318
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,120
Sorry, did I say "murder"?
I meant to say "marriage".

1319
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,872
But, you know, they're...

1320
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,311
quite similar procedures,
when you think about it,

1321
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,598
the participants tend to know each other
and it's over when one of them's dead.

1322
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,477
In fairness,
murder is a lot quicker, though.

1323
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,312
Janine, what about this one?
Acceptably hot?

1324
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,955
More importantly, his girlfriend's
wearing brand-new, uncomfortable underwear

1325
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,395
and hasn't bothered to pick
this thread off of the top of his jacket

1326
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,152
or point out the grease smudge
on the back of his neck.

1327
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,913
Currently, he's going home alone.
Also, he's a comics and sci-fi geek,

1328
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,116
they're always tremendously grateful
when you put the hours in.

1329
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,509
- Geoff, the gents.

1330
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,150
- The loos, now, please.
- Greg.

1331
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,229
- The loos, please.

1332
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,914
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know, maybe it's your turn.

1333
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,112
Yeah, actually, now you mention it...

1334
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,954
Sherlock,
any chance of an end date

1335
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,712
for this speech? Gotta cut the cake.

1336
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,236
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen,

1337
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,675
can't stand it when I finally
get the chance to speak for once,

1338
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,274
- Vatican Cameos.
- What did he say? What does that mean?

1339
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,717
Battle stations, someone's going to die.

1340
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,915
What?

1341
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,115
Narrow it down.

1342
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,994
Narrow it down.

1343
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,952
Narrow it down.

1344
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,792
No!

1345
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,394
No! Not you, not you.

1346
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,429
You.

1347
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,319
It's always you.

1348
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,595
John Watson, you keep me right.

1349
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,989
- What do I do?
- You've already done it.

1350
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,152
Don't solve the murder, save the life.

1351
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,992
Sorry.

1352
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,230
Off-piste a bit, back now, phew!

1353
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,120
Let's play a game. Let's play Murder.

1354
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,998
Sherlock!

1355
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,390
Imagine someone's going to get
murdered at a wedding.

1356
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,708
Who exactly would you pick?

1357
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,916
I think you're a popular choice
at the moment, dear.

1358
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,235
If someone could move Mrs Hudson's glass
just slightly out of reach,

1359
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,912
that would be lovely.

1360
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,754
More importantly,
who could you only kill at a wedding?

1361
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,279
Most people you can kill any old place.

1362
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,152
As a mental exercise,
I have often planned

1363
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,753
the murder of friends and colleagues.

1364
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,515
Now, John I'd poison.
Sloppy eater, dead easy.

1365
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,114
I've given him chemicals and compounds
that way, he's never even noticed.

1366
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,758
He missed a whole Wednesday once,
didn't have a clue.

1367
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,875
Lestrade's so easy to kill,

1368
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,439
it's a miracle no one's
succumbed to the temptation.

1369
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,714
I've got a pair of keys
to my brother's house,

1370
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,472
I could easily break in there
and asphyxiate him...

1371
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,039
If the whim arose.

1372
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,997
He's pissed, isn't he? Ow!

1373
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,914
So, once again,
who could you only kill here?

1374
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,629
Clearly, it's a rare opportunity,

1375
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,278
so it's someone
who doesn't get out much.

1376
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,033
Someone for whom
a planned social encounter

1377
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,634
known about months in advance
is an exception.

1378
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,790
Has to be a unique opportunity.

1379
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,475
And since killing someone
in public is difficult,

1380
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,437
killing them in private isn't an option.

1381
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,637
Someone who lives in an inaccessible
or unknown location, then.

1382
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,631
Someone private, perhaps,

1383
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,036
obsessed with personal security...

1384
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,911
- Possibly someone under threat.

1385
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,794
Major James Sholto, who he?

1386
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,757
- I don't think he's coming.
- He'll be there.

1387
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,751
- Where are you living these days?
- Oh,

1388
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,114
way out in the middle of nowhere.

1389
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,279
The press and the family's
giving him hell,

1390
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,588
he gets more death threats than you.

1391
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,673
Oh, a recluse?

1392
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,719
Small household staff.

1393
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,836
- Job?
- Gardener, cook, private nurse, maid.

1394
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,717
High turnover for additional security.

1395
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,789
I do security work.

1396
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,711
Probably all signed
confidentiality agreements.

1397
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,199
Do you have a secret
you've never told anyone?

1398
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,191
No.
- There's another question that remains,

1399
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,952
however, rather a big one, a huge one.

1400
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,951
How would you do it?
How do you kill someone in public?

1401
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,234
There has to be a way.

1402
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,515
- This has been planned.
- Mr Holmes, Mr Holmes!

1403
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,919
Oh, hello again, Archie.
What's your theory?

1404
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,718
Get this right and there's
a headless nun in it for you.

1405
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,074
The invisible man could do it.

1406
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,513
The who, the what,
the when, the why, the where?

1407
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,953
The invisible man
with the invisible knife,

1408
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,118
the one who tried to kill the guardsman.

1409
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,909
Bainbridge? Bainbridge!

1410
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,118
Oh, not just planned,
planned and rehearsed.

1411
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,114
Ladies and gentlemen,
there will now be a short interlude.

1412
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,758
To the bride and groom!

1413
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,790
To the bride and the groom.

1414
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,669
Major Sholto's going to be murdered.

1415
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,318
I don't know how or by whom
but it's going to happen.

1416
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,072
Excuse me, coming through, consulting.

1417
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,832
- Stay here.
- Please be careful.

1418
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,956
Excuse me, coming through.

1419
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,871
Excuse me.

1420
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,751
Sorry, one moment. Oh, I'm so sorry.

1421
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,036
What's happening? What's going on?

1422
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,114
How can you not remember which room?
You remember everything!

1423
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,236
- I have to delete something!
- 207!

1424
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,555

1425
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,959
Major Sholto?

1426
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,234
Major Sholto?

1427
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,194
Major Sholto!

1428
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,077
If someone's about
to make an attempt on my life,

1429
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,549
it won't be the first time. I'm ready.

1430
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,312
Major, let us in!

1431
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,913
- Kick the door down.
I really wouldn't.

1432
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,395
I have a gun in my hand
and a lifetime of unfortunate reflexes.

1433
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,152
You're not safe in there.
Whoever's after you,

1434
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,798
we know that a locked room
doesn't stop him.

1435
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,916
The invisible man
with the invisible knife?

1436
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,399
I don't know how he does it
so I can't stop him

1437
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,549
and that means he'll do it again.

1438
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,629
Solve it, then.

1439
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,432
I... I'm sorry?

1440
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,637
You're the famous Mr Holmes.
Solve the case, on you go.

1441
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,190
Tell me how he did it
and I'll open the door.

1442
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:53,068
Please, this is no time for games.
Just let us in, you're in danger!

1443
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,639
So are you, so long as you're here.

1444
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,358
Please, leave me.

1445
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,911
Despite my reputation, I really
don't approve of collateral damage.

1446
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,838
- Solve it.
- Sorry?

1447
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,148
Solve it and he'll open the door,
like he said.

1448
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,753
I couldn't solve it before,
how can I solve it now?

1449
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,478
- Because it matters now!
- What are you talking about?

1450
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,198
What's she talking about?
Get your wife under control.

1451
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,315
She's right.

1452
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,709
- Oh, you've changed.
- No, she is. Shut up.

1453
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,075
You are not a puzzle solver,
you never have been.

1454
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,549
You're a drama queen. Now,
there is a man in there about to die,

1455
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,232
the game is on, solve it!

1456
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,429

1457
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,119

1458
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,389
- Bainbridge?

1459
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,799

1460
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,509
Bainbridge!

1461
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,189
Though, in fairness,

1462
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,554
- he's a drama queen, too.
- Yeah, I know.

1463
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,710
Major Sholto,
no one's coming to kill you.

1464
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,109
I'm afraid you've already been killed
several hours ago.

1465
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,550
- What did you say?
- Don't take off your belt.

1466
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,115
My belt?

1467
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,429
His belt, yes.

1468
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,636
Bainbridge was stabbed
hours before we even saw him,

1469
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,278
- but it was through his belt.

1470
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,952
Tight belt, worn high on the waist.

1471
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,996
Very easy to push a small blade
through the fabric,

1472
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,229
and you wouldn't even feel it.

1473
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,231
The belt would bind the flesh together

1474
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,309
- when it was tight.
- Exactly.

1475
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,356
- And when you took it off...
- Delayed action stabbing.

1476
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,590
All the time in the world
to create an alibi.

1477
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,749
Major Sholto!

1478
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,109
So...

1479
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,395
I was to be killed by my uniform.

1480
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,799
How appropriate.

1481
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,837
He solved the case, Major,
you're supposed to open the door now.

1482
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,909
A deal is a deal.

1483
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,997
I'm not even supposed
to have this any more.

1484
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,196
They gave me
special dispensation to keep it.

1485
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,990
I couldn't imagine life
out of this uniform,

1486
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,355
I suppose, given the circumstances,
I don't have to.

1487
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,195
When so many want you dead,
it hardly seems good manners to argue.

1488
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:54,596
Whatever you're doing in there, James,
stop it right now.

1489
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,113
I will kick this door down.

1490
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,634
Mr Holmes,
you and I are similar, I think.

1491
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,153
Yes, I think we are.

1492
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,992
There's a proper time to die,
isn't there?

1493
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,069
Of course there is.

1494
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,276
And one should embrace it when it comes.

1495
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,189
Like a soldier.

1496
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,999
Of course one should
but not at John's wedding!

1497
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,235
We wouldn't do that,
would we, you and me?

1498
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,588
We would never do that to John Watson.

1499
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,271
- I'm going to break it down.
- Wait, wait, you won't have to.

1500
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,429
Hmm?

1501
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,869
I believe I am in need
of medical attention.

1502
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,717
I believe I'm your doctor.

1503
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,194

1504
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,194

1505
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,432
Yeah, pretty good, just...

1506
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,318
- Hold your nerve when you're turning.
- Why do we have to rehearse?

1507
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,834
Because we are about
to dance together in public

1508
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,148
and your skills are appalling.

1509
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,559

1510
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,992
- Well, you're a good teacher.
- Hmm.

1511
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,479
And you're a brilliant dancer.

1512
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,118
- I'll let you in on something, Janine.
- Go on, then.

1513
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,948
- I love dancing. I've always loved it.
- Seriously?

1514
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,029
Watch out.

1515
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,834
Oh!

1516
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,672
That rarely comes up in crime work

1517
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,398
but, you know, I live in hope
of the right case.

1518
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,792
I wish you weren't...

1519
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,998
whatever it is you are.

1520
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,913
- I know.
- Well!

1521
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,719
Glad to see you've pulled, Sherlock,

1522
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,631
what with murderers
running riot at my wedding.

1523
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,473
One murder... One nearly murderer.
He loves to exaggerate.

1524
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,629
You should try living with him.

1525
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,195
Sherlock.

1526
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,117
- Got him for you.
- Ah! The photographer, excellent.

1527
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,397
Thank you. Um, may I have
a look at your camera?

1528
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,799
Uh, what's this about?
I was halfway home.

1529
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,479
- You should have driven faster.

1530
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,358
Ah, yes. Yes! Very good!

1531
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,713
There, you see? Perfect.

1532
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,030
What is? You going to tell us?

1533
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,754
Try looking yourself

1534
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,833
Who? For what?

1535
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,673
Is the murderer in these photographs?

1536
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,320
It's not what's in the photographs,
it's what's not in them.

1537
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,515
Not in any of them.

1538
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,797
Sherlock, the showing-off thing,
we've discussed it before.

1539
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,629
There is always a man at a wedding
who is not in any photograph,

1540
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,392
who can go anywhere,

1541
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,994
even carry an equipment bag
around with him if he likes.

1542
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,510
And you never even see his face.

1543
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,635
You only ever see...

1544
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,628
the camera.

1545
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,039
What are you doing? What is this?

1546
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,839
Jonathan Small, today's substitute
wedding photographer,

1547
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,115
known to us as the Mayfly Man.

1548
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,235
His brother was one of the raw recruits
killed in that incursion.

1549
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,358
Johnny sought revenge on Sholto,

1550
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,035
worked his way through Sholto's staff,
found what he needed.

1551
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,437
<i>An invitation to a wedding.</i>

1552
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,193
<i>The one time Sholto would</i>
<i>have to be out in public.</i>

1553
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,077
<i>So, he made his plan</i>

1554
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,396
<i>and rehearsed the murder,</i>

1555
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,998
<i>making sure of every last detail.</i>

1556
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,432
Brilliant, ruthless
and almost certainly a monomaniac.

1557
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,715
Though, in fairness,
his photographs are actually quite good.

1558
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,314
Everything you need's on that.

1559
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,154
You probably ought to
arrest him or something.

1560
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,556
- Do you always carry handcuffs?
- Down, girl.

1561
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,629
Come on, quick.

1562
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,838
It's not me you should
be arresting, Mr Holmes.

1563
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,514
Oh, I don't do the arresting,
I just farm that out.

1564
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,591
Sholto, he's the killer, not me.

1565
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,119
I should have killed him quicker.

1566
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,036
I shouldn't have tried to be clever.

1567
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,711
You should have driven faster.

1568
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,469
Right.

1569
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,272

1570
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,793
Really?

1571
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,472

1572
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,069
Whoo! Yeah!

1573
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,671
Whoo!

1574
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,309
Ladies and gentlemen,
just one last thing

1575
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,992
before the evening begins properly.

1576
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,709
Apologies for earlier,
a crisis arose and was dealt with.

1577
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,870
More importantly, however,
today we saw two people make vows.

1578
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,758
I have never made a vow in my life
and after tonight I never will again.

1579
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,277
So, here in front of you all,
my first and last vow.

1580
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,513
Mary and John...

1581
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,354
Whatever it takes, whatever happens,

1582
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,876
from now on, I swear
I will always be there, always,

1583
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,712
for all three of you.

1584
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,314
Uh, I'm sorry, I mean two of you.
All two of you.

1585
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,152
Both of you, in fact, I just miscounted.

1586
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,710
Anyway, it's time for dancing.
Play the music again, please. Thank you.

1587
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,950
Okay everybody, just dance.
Don't be shy.

1588
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,116
<i></i> PLAYS)
- Dancing, please! Very good!

1589
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,710
Sorry, that was one more deduction
than I was really expecting.

1590
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,518
- Deduction?
- Increased appetite.

1591
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,556
- I'm starving!
- Change of taste perception.

1592
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,835
Ugh, I chose this wine.
It's bloody awful!

1593
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,718
You were sick this morning.
You assumed it was just wedding nerves.

1594
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,711
You got angry with me
when I mentioned it to you.

1595
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,313
All the signs are there.

1596
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,589
The signs?

1597
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,150
- The signs of three.
- What?

1598
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,831
Mary, I think you should
do a pregnancy test.

1599
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,148

1600
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,276
The statistics for
the first trimester are...

1601
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,429
Shut up!

1602
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,715
- Just shut up.
- Sorry.

1603
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,315
How did he notice before me?
I'm a bloody doctor.

1604
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,753
- It's your day off.
- It's your day off!

1605
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,989
- Stop panicking.
- I'm not panicking.

1606
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,399
I'm pregnant, I'm panicking.

1607
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,436
Don't panic. None of you panic.

1608
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,039
Absolutely no reason to panic.

1609
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,715
- Oh, and you'd know, of course?
- Yes, I would.

1610
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,199
You're already
the best parents in the world,

1611
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,474
look at all the practice you've had.

1612
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,549
The practice?

1613
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,789
Well, you're hardly going to need
me around

1614
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,711
now that you've got
a real baby on the way.

1615
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,911
Are you all right?
- Yeah!

1616
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,234
- Dance!
- Hmm?

1617
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,390
Both of you now, go, dance.
We can't just stand here,

1618
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,595
people will wonder
what we're talking about.

1619
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,957
- Right.
- What about you?

1620
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,553
Well, we can't all three dance,
there are limits.

1621
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,790
- Yes, there are.

1622
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,199
Come on, husband, let's go.

1623
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,032
- This isn't a waltz, is it?
- No.

1624
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,959
Don't worry, Mary,
I have been tutoring him.

1625
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,917
He did, you know.
Baker Street, behind closed curtains.

1626
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,390
Mrs Hudson came in one time.
Don't know how those rumours started.
