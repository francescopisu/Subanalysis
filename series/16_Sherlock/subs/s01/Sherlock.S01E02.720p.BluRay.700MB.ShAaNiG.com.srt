2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,750
The great artisans say
the more the teapot is used

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,430
the more beautiful it becomes.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,310
The pot is seasoned by repeatedly
pouring tea over the surface.

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:35,590
The deposit left on the clay creates
this beautiful patina over time.

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,070
Some pots, the clay has been burnished
by tea made over 400 years ago.

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,990
This museum will be closing in 10 minutes.

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,990
400 years old, they're letting you use it
to make yourself a brew.

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,190
Some things aren't supposed
to sit behind glass,

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,870
they're made to be touched.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,990
To be handled.

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,350
These pots need attention.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,270
The clay is cracking.

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,670
Well, I can't see
how a tiny splash of tea is going to help.

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,510
Sometimes
you have to look hard at something

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,030
to see its value.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,270
See?

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,470
This one shines a little brighter.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,550
I don't suppose...

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,670
Um, I mean...

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,550
I don't suppose
that you want to have a drink?

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,870
Not tea, obviously.
Um, in a pub, with me, tonight.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,030
Um...?

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,150
You wouldn't like me all that much.

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,550
Can I maybe decide that for myself?

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,470
I can't.

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,230
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,270
Please stop asking.

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,270
Is that security?

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,750
Hello?

31
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,550
Can the till supervisor
please go to...?

32
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,270
Unexpected item in bagging area,

33
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,430
please try again.

34
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,430
Argh!

35
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,710
Item not scanned. Please try again.

36
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,390
Can you maybe keep your voice down?

37
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,910
- Card not authorised.
- Yes, all right! I've got it.

38
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,550
Please use an alternative method
of payment. Card not authorised.

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,590
Please use an alternative
method of payment.

40
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,070
Keep it. Keep that.

41
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,510
- You took your time.
- Yeah, I didn't get the shopping.

42
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,710
What? Why not?

43
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,310
Because I had a row in the shop
with a chip and PIN machine.

44
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,630
You... You had a row with a machine?!

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,710
Sort of. It sat there
and I shouted abuse. Have you got cash?

46
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,190
Take my card.

47
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,630
You could always go yourself, you know,
you've been sitting there all morning,

48
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,070
you've not even moved since I left.

49
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,030
And what happened about that case
you were offered -

50
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,670
- the Jaria diamond?
- Not interested.

51
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,430
I sent them a message.

52
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,150
Don't worry about me, I can manage.

53
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,510
- Is that my computer?
- Of course.

54
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,310
- What?
- Mine was in the bedroom.

55
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,350
What?
And you couldn't be bothered to get up?

56
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,830
It's password protected.

57
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,790
In a manner of speaking. Took me
less than a minute to guess yours,

58
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,910
not exactly Fort Knox.

59
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,430
Right. Thank you.

60
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,710
Oh...

61
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,630
- Need to get a job.
- Oh, dull.

62
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,350
Listen, um...

63
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,510
...if you'd be able to lend me some...

64
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,870
- Sherlock, are you listening?
- I need to go to the bank.

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,510
Yes, when you said
we were going to the bank...

66
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,430
Sherlock Holmes.

67
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,710
Sherlock Holmes.

68
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,390
- Sebastian.
- Hiya, buddy.

69
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,350
How long - eight years
since I last clapped eyes on you?

70
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,990
- This is my friend, John Watson.
- Friend?

71
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,990
Colleague.

72
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,070
Right.

73
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,710
Grab a pew.

74
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,550
Do you need anything, coffee, water?

75
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,350
No? We're all sorted here, thanks.

76
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,870
So you're doing well.
You've been abroad a lot.

77
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,510
Well, so?

78
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,990
Flying all the way
around the world twice in a month.

79
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,270
Right. You're doing that thing.

80
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,110
We were at uni together, and this guy here
had a trick he used to do.

81
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,550
It's not a trick.

82
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,630
He could look at you
and tell you your whole life story.

83
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,070
- Yes, I've seen him do it.
- Put the wind up everybody, we hated it.

84
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,190
We'd come down to breakfast
in the formal hall

85
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,190
and this freak would know
you'd been shagging the previous night.

86
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,550
- I simply observed.
- Go on, enlighten me.

87
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,350
Two trips a month, flying all the way
around the world, you're quite right.

88
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,870
How could you tell? Are you going
to tell me there's a stain on my tie

89
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,390
from some special kind of ketchup
you can only buy in Manhattan?

90
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,910
- No, I...
- Is it the mud on my shoes?

91
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,830
I was just chatting with
your secretary outside.

92
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,430
She told me.

93
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,350
I'm glad you could make it over,
we've had a break-in.

94
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,390
Sir William's office -
the bank's former chairman.

95
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,310
The room's been left here
like a sort of memorial.

96
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,350
Someone broke in late last night.

97
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,910
- What did they steal?
- Nothing.

98
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,390
Just left a little message.

99
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,790
60 seconds apart.

100
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,670
So, someone came up here
in the middle of the night,

101
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,350
splashed paint around
and left within a minute.

102
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,070
How many ways into that office?

103
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,230
Well,
that's where this gets really interesting.

104
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,110
Every door that opens in this bank,
it gets locked right here.

105
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,110
Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet.

106
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,590
That door didn't open last night?

107
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,590
There's a hole in our security.

108
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,190
Find it and we'll pay you -

109
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,750
five figures.

110
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,550
This is an advance.

111
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,150
Tell me how he got in.

112
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,710
There's a bigger one on its way.

113
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,990
I don't need an incentive, Sebastian.

114
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,470
He's, er...
...he's kidding you, obviously.

115
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,230
Shall I look after that for him?

116
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,750
Thanks.

117
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,870
Two trips around the world this month.

118
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,030
You didn't ask his secretary,
you said that just to irritate him.

119
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,830
- How did you know?
- Did you see his watch?

120
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,630
His watch?

121
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,350
The time was right,
but the date was wrong.

122
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,710
Said two days ago. Crossed the date line
twice and he didn't alter it.

123
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,950
- Within a month? How did you get that?
- New Breitling.

124
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,390
Only came out this February.

125
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,150
OK. So do you think we should
sniff around here for a bit longer?

126
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,070
Got everything I need
to know already, thanks.

127
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,350
That graffiti was a message.

128
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,590
Someone at the bank,
working on the trading floors.

129
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,270
We find the intended recipient and...

130
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,230
They'll lead us to the person who sent it?

131
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,270
Obvious.

132
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,390
Well, there's 300 people up there,
who was it meant for?

133
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,870
- Pillars.
- What?

134
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,990
Pillars and the screens.

135
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,790
Very few places
you could see that graffiti from.

136
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,270
That narrows the field considerably.
And, of course, the message was left

137
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,510
at 11.34 last night. That tells us a lot.

138
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,350
- Does it?
- Traders come to work at all hours.

139
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,070
Some trade with Hong Kong
in the middle of the night.

140
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,470
That message was intended for
somebody who came in at midnight.

141
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,270
Not many Van Coons
in the phone book.

142
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,310
Taxi!

143
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,110
So what do we do now? Sit here
and wait for him to come back?

144
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,070
- Just moved in.
- What?

145
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,350
- Floor above, new label.
- Could have just replaced it.

146
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,470
- No-one ever does that.
- Hello?

147
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,150
Hi, um, I live in the flat
just below you. I don't think we've met.

148
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,790
No, well, er, I've just moved in.

149
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,910
Actually, I've just locked
my keys in my flat.

150
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,310
Do you want me to buzz you in?

151
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,870
Yeah. And can we use your balcony?

152
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,990
What?!

153
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,230
Sherlock?

154
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,270
Sherlock, are you OK?

155
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,510
Yeah, any time
you feel like letting me in

156
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,830
Do you think he'd lost a lot of money?

157
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,030
Suicide is pretty common
among City boys.

158
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,070
- We don't know that it was suicide.
- Come on.

159
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,230
The door was locked from the inside,
you had to climb down the balcony.

160
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,390
Been away three days
judging by the laundry.

161
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,630
Look at the case, there was something
tightly packed inside it.

162
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,510
- Thanks. I'll take your word for it.
- Problem?

163
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,110
Yeah, I'm not desperate to root around
some bloke's dirty underwear.

164
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,710
Those symbols at the bank,
the graffiti, why were they put there?

165
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,790
- Some sort of code?
- Obviously.

166
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,190
Why were they painted? Want to
communicate, why not use e-mail?

167
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,750
Well, maybe he wasn't answering.

168
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,310
Oh, good, you follow.

169
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,110
No.

170
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,790
What kind of a message
would everyone try to avoid?

171
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,790
What about this morning?

172
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,310
- Those letters you were looking at?
- Bills?

173
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,350
Yes. He was being threatened.

174
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,990
Not by the Gas Board.

175
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,790
...see if we can get prints
off this glass.

176
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,750
Sergeant, we haven't met.

177
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,030
Yeah, I know who you are

178
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,510
and I would prefer it if you didn't
tamper with any of the evidence.

179
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,190
- I phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?
- He's busy. I'm in charge.

180
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,110
And it's not Sergeant,
it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.

181
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,710
We're obviously looking at a suicide.

182
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,270
It does seem
the only explanation of all the facts.

183
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,830
Wrong, it's one possible explanation
of some of the facts.

184
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,270
You've got a solution that you like,
but you are choosing

185
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,230
to ignore anything you see
that doesn't comply with it.

186
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,190
- Like?
- Wound's on the right side of his head.

187
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,470
- And?
- Van Coon was left-handed.

188
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,830
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

189
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,070
Left-handed?

190
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,550
I'm amazed you didn't notice. All you
have to do is look around this flat.

191
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,430
Coffee table on the left-hand side,

192
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,110
coffee mug handle pointing to the left.

193
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,510
Power sockets, habitually used
the ones on the left. Pen and paper

194
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,870
on the left of the phone. Picked up with
his right, took messages with his left.

195
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,670
- D'you want me to go on?
- No, I think you've covered it.

196
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,390
I might as well,
I'm almost at the bottom of the list.

197
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,150
There's a knife on the breadboard
with butter on the right side of the blade

198
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,830
because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely

199
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,070
that a left-handed man would shoot himself
in the right side of his head.

200
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,230
Conclusion, someone broke in here
and murdered him -

201
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,190
only explanation of all of the facts.

202
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,270
- But the gun?
- He was waiting for the killer.

203
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,150
- He'd been threatened.
- What?

204
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,990
Today at the bank, sort of a warning.

205
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,030
He fired a shot
when his attacker came in.

206
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,550
- And the bullet?
- Went through the open window.

207
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,470
Oh, come on

208
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,190
What are the chances of that?!

209
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,470
Wait until you get the ballistics report.

210
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,230
The bullet in his brain wasn't fired
from his gun, I guarantee it.

211
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,510
But if his door was locked from
the inside, how did the killer get in?

212
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,430
Good, you're finally asking
the right questions.

213
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,710
He's left trying to sort of
cut his hair with a fork,

214
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,470
which of course can never be done.

215
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,390
It was a threat,
that's what the graffiti meant.

216
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,550
I'm kind of in a meeting.

217
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,910
Can you make an appointment
with my secretary?

218
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,150
I don't think this can wait.
Sorry, Sebastian.

219
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,110
One of your traders, someone
who worked in your office, was killed.

220
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,950
- What?
- Van Coon.

221
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,990
The police are at his flat.

222
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,910
- Killed?!
- Sorry to interfere

223
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,150
- with everyone's digestion.
- Still want to make an appointment

224
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,430
Would maybe
nine o'clock at Scotland Yard suit?

225
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,270
Harrow, Oxford... very bright guy.

226
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,270
Worked in Asia for a while, so...

227
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,030
You gave him the Hong Kong accounts?

228
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,190
Lost 5 million in a single morning,
made it all back a week later.

229
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,790
Nerves of steel, Eddie had.

230
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,190
- Who'd want to kill him?
- We all make enemies.

231
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,950
You don't all end up with a bullet
through your temple.

232
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,430
Not usually. Excuse me.

233
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,670
It's my chairman.

234
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,550
Police have been on to him.

235
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,430
Apparently they're telling him

236
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,310
- it was a suicide.
- Well they've got it wrong,

237
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,510
Sebastian. He was murdered.

238
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,430
Well, I'm afraid
they don't see it like that.

239
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,630
- So?
- And neither does my boss.

240
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,830
I hired you to do a job.
Don't get sidetracked.

241
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,830
I thought bankers were all supposed
to be heartless bastards.

242
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,710
I need you to get over to Crispians.

243
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,870
Two Ming vases up for auction -
Chenghua.

244
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,030
- Will you appraise them?
- Soo Lin should go - she's the expert.

245
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,710
Soo Lin has resigned her job. I need you.

246
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,150
- Just locum work.
- No, that's fine.

247
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,350
You're, um...
Well, you're a bit over-qualified.

248
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,390
Er, I could always do with the money.

249
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,910
Well, we've got two
away on holiday this week

250
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,430
and one's just left to have a baby.

251
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,190
It might be a bit mundane for you.

252
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,990
Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes.

253
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,550
Mundane works.

254
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,790
- It says here you were a soldier.
- And a doctor.

255
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,150
Anything else you can do?

256
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,150
I learned the clarinet at school.

257
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,870
Oh...
...well, I'll look forward to it.

258
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,630
I said, could you pass me a pen?

259
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,030
- What? When?
- About an hour ago.

260
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,950
Didn't notice I'd gone out then?

261
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,950
I went to see about a job
at that surgery.

262
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,870
- How was it?
- Great. She's great.

263
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,830
Who?

264
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,110
The job.

265
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,190
She?!

266
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,390
It.

267
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,670
Yeah, have a look.

268
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,870
"The intruder
who can walk through walls."

269
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,030
It happened last night.

270
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,270
Journalist shot dead in his flat.

271
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,190
Doors locked,
windows bolted from the inside.

272
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,950
Exactly the same as Van Coon.

273
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,470
God! You think...?

274
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,990
He's killed another one.

275
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,030
Brian Lukis,
freelance journalist,

276
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,350
murdered in his flat.

277
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,390
Doors locked from the inside.

278
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,550
You've got to admit, it's similar.

279
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,830
Both men killed by someone
who can walk through solid walls.

280
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,590
Inspector, do you seriously believe
that Eddie Van Coon was

281
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,030
just another city suicide?

282
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,230
You have seen
the ballistics report, I suppose?

283
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,630
And the shot that killed him.
Was it fired from his own gun?

284
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,030
- No.
- No. So this investigation might move

285
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,710
a bit quicker if you were
to take my word as gospel.

286
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,350
I've just handed you a murder inquiry.

287
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,550
Five minutes in his flat.

288
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,670
Four floors up.

289
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,430
That's why they think they're safe.

290
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,590
Put a chain across the door,
bolt it shut, think they're impregnable.

291
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,470
They don't reckon for one second
that there's another way in.

292
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,430
- I don't understand.
- Dealing with a killer who can climb.

293
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,630
- What are you doing?
- Clings to the walls like an insect.

294
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,750
That's how he got in.

295
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,790
- What?!

296
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,830
He climbed up the side of the walls,
ran along the roof,

297
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,750
dropped in through this skylight.

298
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,910
You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man?

299
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,190
He scaled six floors of a Docklands
apartment building,

300
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,670
- jumped the balcony and killed Van Coon.
- Oh, hold on

301
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,190
That's how he got into the bank - ran
along the window ledge onto the terrace.

302
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,670
I have to find out
what connects these two men.

303
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,750
Date stamped on the book
is the same day that he died.

304
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,190
Sherlock?

305
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,990
So, the killer goes to the bank,

306
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,110
leaves a threatening cipher at the bank.

307
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,870
Van Coon panics, returns
to his apartment, locks himself in.

308
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,910
Hours later, he dies.

309
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,790
The killer finds Lukis at the library,
he writes the cipher

310
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,430
on the shelf where he knows
it'll be seen. Lukis goes home.

311
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,670
Late that night, he dies too.

312
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,390
Why did they die, Sherlock?

313
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,430
Only the cipher can tell us.

314
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,590
The world's run on codes and ciphers,
John.

315
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,270
From the million-pound security system
at the bank to the PIN machine

316
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,470
you took exception to. Cryptography
inhabits our every waking moment.

317
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,030
Yes, OK, but...

318
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,790
But it's all computer generated -

319
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,310
electronic codes,
electronic ciphering methods.

320
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,110
This is different.

321
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,190
It's an ancient device.

322
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,590
Modern code-breaking methods
won't unravel it.

323
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,470
- Where are we headed?
- I need to ask some advice.

324
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,910
What?! Sorry?

325
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,350
You heard me perfectly.
I'm not saying it again.

326
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,110
- You need advice?
- On painting.

327
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,830
Yes, I need to talk to an expert.

328
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,550
Part of a new exhibition.

329
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,390
- Interesting.
- I call it...

330
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,870
Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.

331
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,750
Catchy

332
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,550
I've got two minutes before
a Community Support Officer

333
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,830
comes around that corner.

334
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,470
Can we do this while I'm working?

335
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,710
- Know the author?
- I recognise the paint.

336
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,390
It's like Michigan... hard-core propellant.

337
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,590
I'd say zinc.

338
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,150
And what about the symbols?
Do you recognise them?

339
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,310
I'm not even sure
it's a proper language.

340
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,590
Two men have been murdered, Raz.

341
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,670
Deciphering this is the key
to finding out who killed them.

342
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,590
And this is all you've got to go on

343
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,470
- It's hardly much, is it?
- Are you going to help us or not?

344
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,030
I'll ask around.

345
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,590
- Somebody must know something about it.
- Oi!

346
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,590
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This gallery is a listed public building.

347
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,990
No, no. Wait, wait.
It's not me who painted that.

348
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,510
I was just holding this for...

349
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,750
Bit of an enthusiast, are we?

350
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,030
She was right in the middle of
an important piece of restoration.

351
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,950
Why would she suddenly resign?

352
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,030
Family problems.
She said so in her letter.

353
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,030
But she doesn't have a family.
She came to this country on her own.

354
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,470
- Andy!
- Look, those teapots, those ceramics.

355
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,230
They've become her obsession.

356
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,790
She's been working on restoring them
for weeks.

357
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,270
I can't believe
that she would just... abandon them.

358
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,510
Perhaps she was getting a bit of
unwanted attention?

359
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,870
You've been a while.

360
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,270
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

361
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,350
Custody sergeants don't really
like to be hurried, do they?

362
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,830
Just formalities. Fingerprints,

363
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,430
charge sheet, and I've got to be
in magistrates' court on Tuesday.

364
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,550
- What?
- Me, Sherlock! In court, on Tuesday!

365
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,150
- They're giving me an ASBO!
- Good, fine.

366
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,510
You want to tell your little pal
he's welcome to go and own up any time.

367
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,750
This symbol, I still can't place it.

368
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,390
No, I need you to go
to the police station

369
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,630
and ask about the journalist. The personal
effects will have been impounded.

370
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,950
Get hold of his diary, or something
that will tell us his movements.

371
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,670
Go and see Van Coon's PA.

372
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,270
If you retrace their steps,
somewhere they'll coincide.

373
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,790
Scotland Yard.

374
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,750
Flew back from Dalian Friday.

375
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,590
Looks like he had back-to-back meetings
with the sales team.

376
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,070
Can you print me up a copy?

377
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,110
- Sure.
- What about the day he died?

378
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,230
- Can you tell me where he was?
- Sorry, I've got a gap.

379
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,990
I have all his receipts.

380
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,070
- Your friend...
- Listen, whatever you say,

381
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,630
I'm behind you 100 per cent.

382
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,150
...he's an arrogant sod.

383
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,510
Well, that was mild.
People say a lot worse than that.

384
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,070
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
The journalist's diary?

385
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,950
What kind of a boss was he, Amanda?
Appreciative?

386
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,510
Um, no. That's not a word I'd use.

387
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,310
The only things Eddie appreciated
had a big price tag.

388
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,070
Like that hand cream.
He bought that for you, didn't he?

389
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,110
Look at this one.

390
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,510
Got a taxi from him on the day he died,
£18.50.

391
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,390
That would get him to the office.

392
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,070
Not rush hour. Check the time.
Mid-morning. 18 would get him

393
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,470
- as far as...
- ...The West End. I remember him saying.

394
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,550
Underground, printed at one in Piccadilly.

395
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,470
So he got a Tube back to the office.

396
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,870
Why would he get a taxi into town
and then the Tube back?

397
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,110
Because he was delivering
something heavy.

398
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,030
You wouldn't lug a package
up the escalator.

399
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,950
Delivering?!

400
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,950
To somewhere near Piccadilly Station.

401
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,310
Dropped the package,
delivered it, and then...

402
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,550
Stopped on his way. He got peckish.

403
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,110
So you bought your lunch
from here en route to the station

404
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,790
but where were you headed from?

405
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,670
Where did the taxi drop you?

406
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,390
- Oof!
- Right.

407
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,310
Eddie Van Coon brought a package here
the day he died.

408
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,830
Whatever was hidden inside that case...

409
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,750
I've managed to piece together a picture

410
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,310
using scraps of information - credit card
bills, receipts. He flew back from China,

411
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,790
- then he came here.
- Sherlock.

412
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,110
Somewhere in this street, somewhere
near. I don't know where, but...

413
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,310
- That shop, over there.
- How could you tell?

414
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,710
Lukis's diary. He was here too.

415
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,910
- He wrote down the address.
- Oh.

416
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,870
Hello.

417
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,350
You want... lucky cat?

418
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,950
No, thanks, no.

419
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,750
£10! £10!

420
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,990
I think your wife, she will like.

421
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,070
Um, maybe...

422
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,190
Sherlock...

423
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,310
- The label there.
- Yes, I see it.

424
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,950
It's exactly the same as the cipher.

425
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,590
It's an ancient number system -
Hang Zhou.

426
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,990
These days only street traders use it.

427
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,150
Those were numbers written on the wall
at the bank, and at the library.

428
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,230
Numbers written in
an ancient Chinese dialect.

429
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,870
It's a 15.

430
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,030
What we thought was the artist's tag,
it's a number 15.

431
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,990
And the blindfold, the horizontal line.
That was a number as well.

432
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,390
- The Chinese number one, John.
- We found it.

433
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,310
Two men travel back from China,

434
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,990
both head straight for
the Lucky Cat emporium.

435
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,150
What did they see?

436
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,230
It's not what they saw.

437
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,630
It's what they both brought back
in those suitcases.

438
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,750
And you don't mean duty free.

439
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,150
Thank you.

440
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,510
Think about what Sebastian told us.

441
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,230
About Van Coon, about
how he stayed afloat in the market.

442
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,150
- Lost 5 million.
- Made it back in a week.

443
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,990
That's how he made such easy money.

444
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,710
He was a smuggler. Mm.

445
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,590
Cover would have been perfect.

446
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,830
Businessman,
making frequent trips to Asia.

447
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,110
Lukis was the same,
a journalist writing about China.

448
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,550
Both of them smuggled stuff about.

449
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,790
The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.

450
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,910
But why did they die?

451
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,630
It doesn't make sense. If they both
turn up at the shop and deliver the goods,

452
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,270
why would someone threaten them

453
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,030
and kill them after the event,

454
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,590
after they'd finished the job?

455
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,670
What if one of them
was light-fingered?

456
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,630
- How do you mean?
- Stole something.

457
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,150
Something from the hoard.

458
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,190
The killer doesn't know
which of them took it

459
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,630
so threatens them both. Right.

460
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,230
Remind me.

461
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,910
When was the last time that it rained?

462
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,710
It's been here since Monday.

463
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,470
No-one's been in that flat
for at least three days.

464
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,470
Could have gone on holiday.

465
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,310
Do you leave your windows open
when you go on holiday?

466
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,990
Sherlock!

467
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,310
Someone else has been here.

468
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,030
Somebody else broke into the flat and
knocked over the vase, just like I did.

469
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,030
Do you think maybe
you could let me in this time?

470
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,270
Can you not keep doing this, please?

471
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,430
I'm not the first.

472
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,430
- What?
- Somebody's been in here before me.

473
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,030
What are you saying?

474
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,550
Size eight feet.

475
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,310
Small, but... athletic.

476
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,110
I'm wasting my breath.

477
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,150
Small, strong hands.

478
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,950
Our acrobat.

479
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,910
Why didn't he close the window
when he left...?

480
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,830
Oh, stupid, stupid!

481
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,790
Obvious.

482
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,430
He's still here.

483
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,030
Any time you want to include me...

484
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,830
John...

485
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,950
John!

486
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,630
Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone

487
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,110
because no-one else can compete with

488
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,710
my massive intellect

489
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,350
The milk's gone off and the washing's
started to smell.

490
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,150
Somebody left here in a hurry
three days ago.

491
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,310
Somebody?

492
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,990
Soo Lin Yao. We have to find her.

493
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,710
How, exactly?

494
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,550
We could start with this.

495
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,590
You've gone all croaky.
Are you getting a cold?

496
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,270
I'm fine.

497
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,910
When was the last time
that you saw her?

498
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,510
Three days ago. Here at the museum.

499
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,390
This morning they told me she'd resigned.

500
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,990
Just like that. Left her work unfinished.

501
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,910
What was the last thing that she did
on her final afternoon?

502
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,150
She does this demonstration
for the tourists, a tea ceremony.

503
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,830
So she would have packed up her things
and just put them in here.

504
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,950
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.

505
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,310
- If she's still alive.
- Sherlock!

506
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,950
Oh, look who it is.

507
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,430
Found something you'll like.

508
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,750
Tuesday morning,

509
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,870
all you've got to do is turn up
and say the bag was yours.

510
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,510
Forget about your court date.

511
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,030
Dude, that was rad!

512
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,470
You want to hide a tree,
then a forest is the best place to do it,

513
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,110
wouldn't you say?

514
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,870
People would just walk
straight past, not knowing,

515
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,710
unable to decipher the message.

516
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,950
There. I spotted it earlier.

517
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,750
They've been here.
And that's the exact same paint?

518
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,790
Yeah.

519
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,030
John, if we're going to
decipher this code,

520
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,750
we need to look for more evidence.

521
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,550
Answer your phone.
I've been calling you.

522
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,390
I found it.

523
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,150
It's been painted over.

524
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,830
I don't understand. It was...

525
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,990
here.

526
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,510
10 minutes ago. I saw it.

527
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,270
A whole load of graffiti.

528
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,430
Somebody doesn't want me to see it.

529
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,630
- Sherlock, what are you doing...?
- Ssh! John, concentrate.

530
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,510
I need you to concentrate.
Close your eyes.

531
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,990
What? Why? Why? What are you doing?

532
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,670
I need you to maximise
your visual memory.

533
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,670
Try to picture what you saw.

534
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,710
- Can you picture it?
- Yeah.

535
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,510
- Can you remember it?
- Yes, definitely.

536
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,550
Can you remember the pattern?

537
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,310
- Yes.
- How much can you remember it?

538
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,430
Look, don't worry.

539
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,870
Because the average human memory
on visual matters is only 62% accurate.

540
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,150
- Well, don't worry, I remember all of it.
- Really?

541
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,670
Well at least I would, if I could get to
my pockets. I took a photograph.

542
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,670
Always in pairs, John, look.

543
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,350
Numbers...

544
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,230
come with partners.

545
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,630
God, I need to sleep.

546
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,750
- Why did he paint it so near the tracks?
- No idea.

547
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,830
Thousands of people
pass by there every day.

548
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,870
Just 20 minutes...

549
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,830
Of course.

550
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,110
Of course, he wants information.
He's trying to communicate

551
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,430
with his people in the underworld.
Whatever was stolen, he wants it back.

552
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,030
It's somewhere here, in a code.

553
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,310
We can't crack this without Soo Lin Yao.

554
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,270
Oh, good.

555
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,990
Two men who travelled back from China
were murdered.

556
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,150
And their killer left them messages
in Hang Zhou numerals.

557
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,110
Soo Lin Yao is in danger.

558
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,030
That cipher, it was just
the same pattern as the others.

559
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,750
He means to kill her as well.

560
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,710
Look, I've tried everywhere -

561
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,270
friends, colleagues.
I don't know where she's gone.

562
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,670
I mean, she could be
a thousand miles away.

563
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,790
- What are you looking at?
- Tell me more about those teapots.

564
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,270
The pots were her obsession.
They need urgent work.

565
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,630
If they dry out,
then the clay can start to crumble.

566
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,790
Apparently, you have to just
keep making tea in them.

567
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,630
Yesterday, only one of those pots
was shining.

568
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,390
Now, there are two.

569
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,550
Fancy a biscuit with that?

570
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,470
Centuries old.
Don't want to break that.

571
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,990
Hello.

572
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,790
You saw the cipher.

573
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,350
Then you know he is coming for me.

574
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,950
You've been clever to avoid him so far.

575
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,190
I had to finish.

576
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,110
To finish this work.

577
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,150
It's only a matter of time.

578
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,750
I know he will find me.

579
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,710
Who is he?
Have you met him before?

580
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,710
When I was a girl, we met in China.

581
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,110
I recognised his...

582
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,550
- signature.
- The cipher?

583
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,710
Only he would do this. Zhi Zhu.

584
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,310
- Zhi Zhu?
- The spider.

585
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,870
You know this mark?

586
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,950
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

587
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,670
- Huh?
- Ancient crime syndicate, based in China.

588
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,630
Every foot soldier bears the mark.

589
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,910
Everyone who hauls for them.

590
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,870
Hauls?

591
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,390
You mean you were a smuggler?

592
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,390
I was 15.

593
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,990
My parents were dead.

594
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,030
I had no livelihood.

595
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,670
No way of surviving, day-to-day,

596
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,750
except to work for the bosses.

597
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,510
Who are they?

598
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,590
They are called the Black Lotus.

599
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,910
By the time I was 16,

600
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,110
I was taking
thousands of pounds worth of drugs

601
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,070
across the border into Hong Kong.

602
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,950
I managed to leave that life behind me.

603
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,710
I came to England.

604
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,630
They gave me a job, here.

605
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,430
Everything was good. New life.

606
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,230
And he came looking for you.

607
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,750
Yes.

608
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,990
I hoped, after five years...

609
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,110
maybe they would have forgotten me.

610
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,030
But they never really let you leave.

611
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,550
A small community like ours...

612
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,150
...they are never very far away.

613
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,150
He came to my flat.

614
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,790
He asked me to help him to track down
something that was stolen.

615
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,670
And you've no idea what it was?

616
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,990
I refused to help.

617
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,350
So, you knew him well
when you were living back in China?

618
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,070
Oh, yes.

619
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,750
He's my brother.

620
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,910
Two orphans.

621
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,790
We had no choice.

622
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,110
We could work for the Black Lotus,
or starve on the streets, like beggars.

623
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,270
My brother has become their puppet.

624
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,910
In the power of the one they call Shan.

625
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,710
The Black Lotus general.

626
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,390
I turned my brother away.

627
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,070
He said I had betrayed him.

628
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,990
Next day, I came to work

629
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,430
and the cipher was waiting.

630
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,670
Can you decipher these?

631
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,990
- These are numbers.
- Yes, I know.

632
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,390
Here, the line across the man's eyes,
it's the Chinese number one.

633
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,150
And this one is 15.
But what's the code?

634
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,670
All the smugglers know it.

635
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,350
It's based upon a book...

636
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,910
He's here.

637
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,390
Zhi Zhu has found me.

638
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,710
No, no, Sherlock.

639
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,750
Sherlock, wait!

640
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,550
Come here.

641
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,510
Get in. Get in!

642
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,950
I have to go and help him.
Bolt the door after me.

643
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,710
Careful!

644
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,150
Some of those skulls are over 200,000
years old. Have a bit of respect.

645
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,030
Thank you.

646
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,990
Liang.

647
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,630
Oh, my God.

648
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,670
How many murders is it going to take

649
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,390
before you start believing
that this maniac's out there?

650
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,510
A young girl was gunned down tonight.

651
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,350
That's three victims in three days.
You're supposed to be finding him.

652
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,670
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon

653
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,030
were working for a gang
of international smugglers.

654
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,630
A gang called the Black Lotus,
operating here in London

655
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,870
right under your nose.

656
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,310
Can you prove that?

657
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,910
- What are you thinking? Pork or pasta?
- Oh, it's you.

658
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,910
I suppose it's never going to trouble
Egon Ronay, is it?

659
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,430
I'd stick with the pasta.

660
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,750
Don't want to be doing roast pork,
not if you're slicing up cadavers.

661
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,070
What are you having?

662
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,590
I don't eat when I'm working.
Digesting slows me down.

663
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,430
So you're working here tonight?

664
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,270
- Need to examine some bodies.
- Some?

665
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,070
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.

666
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,670
They're on my list.

667
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,510
Could you wheel them out again for me?

668
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,790
Well... their paperwork's
already gone through.

669
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,510
- You changed your hair.
- What?

670
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,110
The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.

671
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,710
Yes, well...

672
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,990
It's good.

673
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,390
It... suits you better this way.

674
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,070
We're just interested in the feet.

675
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,870
- The feet?
- Yes.

676
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,710
Do you mind if we have a look at them?

677
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,070
Now, Van Coon.

678
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,310
- Oh!
- So...

679
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,630
So either these two men just happened
to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour,

680
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,150
- or I'm telling the truth.
- What do you want?

681
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,630
I want every book from Lukis's apartment
and Van Coon's.

682
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,910
Their books?

683
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,830
Not just a criminal organisation.
It's a cult.

684
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,270
Her brother was corrupted
by one of its leaders.

685
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,790
Soo Lin said the name.

686
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,470
Yes, Shan. General Shan.

687
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,150
We're still no closer to finding him.

688
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,470
Wrong!
We've got almost all we need to know.

689
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,550
She gave us most of the missing pieces.

690
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,070
Why did he need to visit his sister?

691
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,710
- Why did he need her expertise?
- She worked at the museum.

692
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,950
- Exactly.
- An expert in antiquities.

693
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,430
- Of course, I see.
- Valuable antiquities, John.

694
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,310
Ancient Chinese relics
purchased on the black market.

695
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,550
China's home to a thousand treasures
hidden after Mao's revolution.

696
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,030
The Black Lotus is selling them.

697
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,510
Check for the dates... here.

698
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,190
John, "arrived from China four days ago".

699
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,710
Anonymous.

700
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,150
The vendor doesn't give his name.

701
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,670
"Two undiscovered treasures
from the East."

702
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,190
One in Lukis's suitcase
and one in Van Coon's.

703
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,670
Antiquities...

704
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,510
sold at auction.

705
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,830
Look, here's another one.

706
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,550
Arrived from China a month ago,

707
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,990
Chinese ceramic statue sold for £400,000.

708
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,350
Look, a month before that,
Chinese painting, £500,000.

709
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,710
All of them from an anonymous source.

710
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,710
They're stealing them back in China
and one by one feeding them into Britain.

711
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,070
Every single auction coincides with
Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China.

712
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,270
So what if one of them got greedy
when they were in China?

713
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,830
What if one of them stole something?

714
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,150
That's why Zhi Zhu's come.

715
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,310
Sorry, are we collecting for charity,
Sherlock?

716
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,430
What?

717
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,390
A young man's outside
with crates of books.

718
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,950
So the numbers are references.

719
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,310
To books.

720
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,710
To specific pages
and specific words on those pages.

721
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,990
Right, so...

722
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,070
15 and 1, that means?

723
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,270
Turn to page 15
and it's the first word you read.

724
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,710
- OK, so what's the message?
- Depends on the book.

725
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,630
That's the cunning of the book code.

726
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,590
It has to be one that they both own.

727
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,430
OK, fine. This shouldn't take too long,
should it

728
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,150
We found these... at the museum.
Is this your writing?

729
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,750
Er, we hoped Soo Lin
could decipher it for us.

730
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,710
Ta.

731
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,270
Anything else I can do?

732
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,430
To assist you, I mean.

733
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,830
Some silence right now
would be marvellous.

734
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,870
Cigarette.

735
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,910
Imagine.

736
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,790
Oh...

737
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,230
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

738
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,070
but we haven't got anything now
until next Thursday.

739
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,870
This is taking ages.

740
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,230
Sorry.

741
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,590
What's the point of booking
an appointment if they can't stick to it?

742
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,230
Um, what's going on?

743
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,390
That new doctor you hired,
he hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages.

744
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,190
Let me go and have a word.

745
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,990
- Excuse me.
- Sorry...

746
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,550
John?

747
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,830
John?

748
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,110
Looks like I'm done.
I thought I had some more to see.

749
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,230
- Oh, I did one or two of yours.
- One or two?

750
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,470
Well, maybe five or six.

751
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,870
I'm sorry, that's not very professional.

752
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,510
No, not really.

753
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,030
I had... a bit of a late one.

754
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,710
Oh, right.

755
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,110
Anyway, see you.

756
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,990
So... what were you doing
to keep you up so late?

757
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,990
I was attending a sort of book event.

758
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,150
Oh. Oh, she likes books, does she,
your girlfriend?

759
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,990
No, it wasn't a date.

760
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,070
- Good. I mean, I'm...
- And I don't have one tonight.

761
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,990
A book that everybody would own.

762
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,870
15, entry 1.

763
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,110
I need to get some air.
We're going out tonight.

764
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,270
- Actually, I've got a date.
- What?

765
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,350
Where two people who like each other
go out and have fun?

766
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,990
That's what I was suggesting.

767
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,990
No, it wasn't. At least, I hope not.

768
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,590
Where are you taking her?

769
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,110
Er, cinema.

770
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,150
Dull, boring, predictable...

771
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,470
Why don't you try this?

772
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,310
In London for one night only.

773
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,950
Thanks, but I don't come to you
for dating advice.

774
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,190
It's years since anyone
took me to the circus.

775
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,390
Right, yes.

776
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,510
A friend recommended it to me
and I phoned up.

777
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,590
Oh! What are they, a touring company
or something?

778
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,350
I don't know much about it.

779
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,190
I think they're probably from China.

780
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,550
- I think so, yes.
- There's a coincidence

781
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,990
That's wonderful,
thank you very much.

782
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,150
Hi, I have two tickets
reserved for tonight.

783
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,350
- And what's the name?
- Holmes.

784
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,030
Actually, I have three in that name.

785
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,590
No, I don't think so, we only booked two.

786
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,190
Then I phoned back
and got one for myself as well.

787
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,270
I'm Sherlock.

788
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,150
- Hi.
- Hello.

789
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,070
You couldn't let me have
just one night off.

790
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,630
Yellow Dragon Circus,
in London for one day. It fits.

791
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,350
The Tong sent an assassin to England...

792
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,630
Dressed as a tightrope walker.
Come on, Sherlock, behave!

793
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,710
We're looking for a killer
who can climb, who can shin up a rope.

794
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,430
Where else would you find
that level of dexterity?

795
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,670
Exit visas are scarce in China.

796
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,630
They need a good reason
to get out of that country.

797
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,390
All I need to do
is have a quick look around...

798
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,270
Fine. You do that,
I'll take Sarah for a pint.

799
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,510
I need your help.

800
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,310
I do have a couple of other things
on my mind this evening.

801
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,510
Like what?

802
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,590
- You are kidding?
- What's so important?

803
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,390
Sherlock, I'm in the middle of a date.

804
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,430
You're going to chase some killer
while I'm trying to...

805
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,430
What?

806
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,590
While I'm trying to get off with Sarah.

807
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,230
Hey... ready?

808
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,750
Yeah.

809
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,110
You said circus. This is not a circus.

810
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,630
Look at the size of this crowd.

811
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,070
Sherlock, this is... art.

812
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,670
This is not their day job.

813
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,190
Sorry, I forgot, they're not a circus,
they're a gang of international smugglers.

814
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,390
Classic Chinese escapology act.

815
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,550
- Hm?
- The crossbow's on a delicate string.

816
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,910
The warrior has to escape his bonds
before it fires.

817
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,590
Oh!

818
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,710
She splits the sandbag,
the sand pours out.

819
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,630
Gradually,
the weight lowers into the bowl.

820
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,430
- Thank God.
- My God!

821
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,310
Ladies and gentlemen.

822
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:20,990
From the distant moonlit shores
of the Yangtze River,

823
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,070
we present, for your pleasure,

824
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:28,350
the deadly Chinese bird spider.

825
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,830
Did you see that?

826
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,790
Well, well.

827
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,070
Found you.

828
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,310
- Come on.
- Come on. Let's go!

829
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:46,270
I sent a couple of cars.
The old hall is totally deserted.

830
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,590
Look, I saw the mark at the circus.
The tattoo that we saw

831
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,430
on the two bodies, the mark of the Tong.

832
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,910
Lukis and Van Coon were part of
a smuggling operation.

833
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,470
One of them stole something when
they were in China. Something valuable.

834
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,590
The circus performers were gang members

835
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,830
- sent here to get it back.
- Get what back?

836
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,670
We don't know.

837
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,470
You don't know?

838
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,430
Mr Holmes, I've done everything you asked.

839
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,190
Lestrade, he seems to think
your advice is worth something.

840
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,470
I gave the order for a raid.

841
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,670
Please tell me I'll have something
to show for it.

842
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,550
Other than a massive bill for overtime.

843
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,790
They'll be back in China by tomorrow.

844
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,510
No, they won't leave
without what they came for.

845
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,430
We need to find a hideout.

846
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,950
A rendezvous.

847
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,230
Somewhere in this message
it must tell us.

848
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,710
Well, I think
perhaps I should leave you to it.

849
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,190
- No, you don't have to go. Stay.
- Yes, it'd be better if you left now.

850
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,750
He's kidding.
Please stay if you'd like.

851
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,790
Is it just me or is anyone else starving?

852
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,270
Oh, God.

853
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,670
So this is what you do.

854
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,590
You and John,
you solve puzzles for a living.

855
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,030
Consulting detective.

856
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,070
Oh.

857
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,710
Oh!

858
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,990
What are these squiggles?

859
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,910
They're numbers.
An ancient Chinese dialect.

860
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,310
Oh, right. Well, of course
I should have known that.

861
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,430
I've done punch
and a bowl of nibbles.

862
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,270
Mrs Hudson, you are a saint.

863
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,710
If it was Monday,
I'd have been to the supermarket.

864
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,230
Thank you. Thank you.

865
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,990
- So these numbers, it's a cipher?
- Exactly.

866
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,430
And each pair of numbers is a word?

867
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,390
How did you know that?

868
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,150
Well, two words
have already been translated. Here.

869
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,910
- John.
- Mmm?

870
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,950
John, look at this.

871
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,390
Soo Lin at the museum,
she started to translate the code for us.

872
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,070
We didn't see it.

873
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,110
Nine mill.

874
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,550
Does that mean millions?

875
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,590
Nine million quid. For what?

876
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,750
We need to know
the end of this sentence.

877
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,230
Where are you going?

878
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,990
To the museum, to the restoration room.
We must have been staring right at it.

879
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,070
At what?

880
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,950
The book, John. The book.
The key to cracking the cipher.

881
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,150
Soo Lin used it to do this. Whilst
we were running around the gallery,

882
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,670
she started to translate the code.
It must be on her desk.

883
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,790
Taxi!

884
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,950
Entschuldigen Sie, bitte.

885
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,910
Ja, danke

886
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,950
A book that everybody would own.

887
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,710
Please, wait!

888
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,350
Bitte!

889
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,470
Was wollt er?

890
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,030
Hey, du, was machst du?

891
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,310
- Minute!
- Gib mir doch mein Buch zurück!

892
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,590
Yeah. No, absolutely.

893
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,670
I mean, a quiet night in
is just what the doctor ordered.

894
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:46,590
I mean, I love to go out of an evening and
wrestle a few Chinese gangsters generally,

895
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,710
- but a girl can get too much.
- OK.

896
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,990
Er, shall we get a takeaway?

897
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,590
Yeah.

898
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,750
Page 15, entry 1...

899
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,830
Page 15, entry 1.

900
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,830
Dead man.

901
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,590
You were threatening to kill them.

902
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,350
That's the first cipher.

903
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,030
9... 0... 15...

904
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,430
er, 15 and 36.

905
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,630
36, 39, 39...

906
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,390
39...

907
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,910
9...

908
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,790
"Nine", "mill", "for"...

909
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,830
Blimey, that was quick.
I'll just pop down.

910
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,430
Do you want me to lay the table?

911
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,550
- Um... eat off trays?
- Yeah.

912
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,350
70...35...

913
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,950
Jade...

914
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,990
Jade.

915
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,470
Sorry to keep you.
How much do you want?

916
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,110
- Do you have it?
- What?

917
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,670
- Do you have the treasure?
- I don't understand.

918
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,310
"Nine mill for jade pin.

919
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,270
"Dragon den, black...

920
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,830
"tramway."

921
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,190
John! John, I've got it.

922
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,110
The cipher, the book.
It's the London A-Z that they're us...

923
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:13,150
A book is like a magic garden,

924
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,590
carried in your pocket.

925
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:33,550
- Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes.
- I'm...

926
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,070
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

927
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,630
Forgive me
if I do not take your word for it.

928
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,110
Ow!

929
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,270
Debit card, name of...

930
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,430
S Holmes.

931
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,550
Take my card.

932
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,670
Yes, that's not actually mine.
He lent that to me.

933
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:57,710
And a cheque for £5,000 made out
in the name of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

934
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,030
Yeah, he gave me that to look after.

935
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,110
Tickets from the theatre collected by you,
name of Holmes.

936
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,270
Yes, OK.

937
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,750
- What's the name?
- Er, Holmes.

938
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,630
I realise what this looks like.

939
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,190
But I'm not him.

940
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,870
- We heard it from your own mouth.
- What?

941
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,910
"I am Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone."

942
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,990
Because no-one else can compete with
my massive intellect.

943
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,190
Did I really say that?

944
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:32,350
I suppose there's no use me trying to
persuade you I was doing an impression.

945
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,830
I am Shan.

946
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,590
You're... You're Shan?

947
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,910
Three times we tried to kill you
and your companion, Mr Holmes.

948
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,630
What does it tell you when an assassin
cannot shoot straight?

949
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,990
It tells you
that they're not really trying.

950
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,310
Tramway.

951
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,470
There.

952
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:34,710
- Not blank bullets now.
- OK.

953
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,750
If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes,
we would have done it by now.

954
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,590
We just wanted to
make you inquisitive.

955
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,430
- Do you have it?
- Do I have what?

956
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,910
- The treasure.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

957
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,030
I would prefer to make certain.

958
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,630
Everything in the West has its price.

959
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:04,550
And the price for her life - information.

960
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,910
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

961
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:31,110
- Where's the hairpin?
- What?

962
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:35,070
The Empress pin
valued at £9 million sterling?

963
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,350
We already had a buyer in the West

964
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,550
and then one of our people
was greedy, he took it,

965
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,830
brought it back to London, and you,
Mr Holmes, have been searching.

966
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,110
Please, please. Listen to me. I'm not...

967
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:49,430
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
You have to believe me.

968
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,270
I haven't found whatever it is
you're looking for.

969
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:55,430
- I need a volunteer from the audience.
- No, please, please!

970
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,950
Ah, thank you, lady.

971
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,070
Yes, you'll do very nicely.

972
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:30,590
Ladies and gentlemen,
from the distant, moonlit shores of NW1,

973
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,230
we present for your pleasure,

974
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:39,390
Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion
in a death-defying act.

975
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,350
Please!

976
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,110
You've seen the act before.
How dull for you.

977
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,710
You know how it ends.

978
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,590
I'm not Sherlock Holmes!

979
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,150
I don't believe you.

980
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,030
You should, you know.

981
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,070
Sherlock Holmes
is nothing at all like him.

982
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,590
How would you describe me, John?

983
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,510
- Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic?
- Late?

984
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,030
That's a semi-automatic. If you fire it,

985
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,950
the bullet will travel at
over 1,000 metres per second.

986
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,430
Well?

987
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,790
Well...

988
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,950
...the radius curvature of these walls
is nearly four metres.

989
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,310
If you miss, the bullet will ricochet.

990
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,990
Could hit anyone.

991
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,910
Might even bounce off the tunnel
and hit you.

992
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,510
It's all right.

993
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,030
You're going to be all right.
It's over now.

994
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,590
Don't worry.

995
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,670
Next date won't be like this.

996
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,030
We'll just slip off.
No need to mention us in your report.

997
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,190
- Mr Holmes...
- I have high hopes for you, Inspector.

998
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,550
A glittering career.

999
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,550
I go where you point me.

1000
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,110
Exactly.

1001
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,270
Ta.

1002
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,070
- So, nine million.
- Million.

1003
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:42,390
Million, yes. Nine million
for jade pin dragon den black tramway.

1004
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,870
An instruction
to all their London operatives.

1005
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,550
A message.
What they were trying to reclaim.

1006
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,430
- What, a jade pin?
- Worth £9 million.

1007
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,750
Bring it to the Tramway,
their London hideout.

1008
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,310
Hang on. A hairpin worth £9 million?

1009
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,550
- Apparently.
- Why so much?

1010
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,790
Depends who owned it.

1011
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,670
Two operatives based in London.

1012
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,550
They travel over to Dalian
to smuggle those vases.

1013
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,870
One of them helps himself
to something, a little hairpin.

1014
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,430
- Worth £9 million.
- Eddie Van Coon was the thief,

1015
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,350
he stole the treasure
when he was in China.

1016
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,030
How do you know it was Van Coon,
not Lukis?

1017
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,190
- Even the killer didn't know that.
- Because of the soap.

1018
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,630
- Amanda?
- He brought you a present.

1019
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,150
Oh, hello.

1020
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,830
A little gift
when he came back from China.

1021
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,230
- How do you know that?
- You weren't just his PA, were you?

1022
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,830
Someone's been gossiping.

1023
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,630
- No.
- Then I don't understand why...

1024
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,630
Scented hand soap in his apartment.

1025
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,070
300ml of it. Bottle almost finished.

1026
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,950
- Sorry...?

1027
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,030
I don't think Eddie Van Coon was the type
of chap to buy himself hand soap,

1028
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,190
not unless he had a lady coming over.

1029
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,830
And it's the same brand
as that hand cream there on your desk.

1030
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,390
Look, it wasn't serious between us.

1031
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,990
It was over in a flash, it couldn't last.
He was my boss.

1032
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,670
What happened? Why did you end it?

1033
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,670
I thought he didn't appreciate me.

1034
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,470
Took me for granted.

1035
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,750
Stood me up once too often.

1036
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,550
We'd plan to go away for the weekend
and then he'd just leave.

1037
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,270
Fly off to China at a moment's notice.

1038
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,590
And he brought you a present
from abroad to say sorry.

1039
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,270
Can I just have a look at it?

1040
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,190
He really climbed up onto the balcony?

1041
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,390
Nail a plank across the window
and all your problems are over.

1042
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,190
Thanks.

1043
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,670
He said he bought it
in a street market.

1044
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,590
Oh, I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.

1045
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,150
Yeah, that's Eddie.

1046
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,550
Didn't know its value, just thought
it would suit you.

1047
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,510
Oh? What's it worth?

1048
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,750
£9 million.

1049
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:17,950
Oh, my God.

1050
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,550
Oh, my God!

1051
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,670
Nine million?!

1052
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,270
Over 1,000 years old

1053
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,430
and it's sitting on her bedside table
every night.

1054
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,510
He didn't know its value.
Didn't know why they were chasing him.

1055
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,750
Should've just got her a lucky cat.

1056
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,110
- You mind, don't you?
- What?

1057
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,030
That she escaped. General Shan.

1058
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,990
It's not enough
that we got her two henchmen.

1059
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,830
Must be a vast network, John.

1060
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,590
Thousands of operatives.

1061
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,110
You and I,
we barely scratched the surface.

1062
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,230
You cracked the code though, Sherlock.

1063
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,110
And maybe Dimmock can track down
all of them, now he knows it.

1064
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,470
No. No, I crack this code,

1065
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:18,630
all the smugglers have to do
is pick up another book.

1066
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,710
Without you...

1067
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,710
without your assistance,

1068
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,990
we would not have found
passage into London.

1069
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,430
You have my thanks.

1070
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,310
We did not anticipate...

1071
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,870
We did not know this man would come.

1072
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,350
This Sherlock Holmes.

1073
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,470
And now your safety is compromised.

1074
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,910
I will not reveal your identity.
