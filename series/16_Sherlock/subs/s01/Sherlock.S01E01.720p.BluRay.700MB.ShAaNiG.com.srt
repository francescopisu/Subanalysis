1
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,230
How's your blog going?

2
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,510
Yeah, good. Very good.

3
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,190
You haven't written a word, have you?

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,070
You just wrote
"still has trust issues".

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,190
And you read my writing upside down.

6
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,750
You see what I mean?

7
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,670
John, you're a soldier,

8
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,230
and it's going to take you
a while to adjust to civilian life,

9
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,190
and writing a blog about everything that
happens to you will honestly help you.

10
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,830
Nothing happens to me.

11
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,070
What do you mean,
there's no ruddy car?

12
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,550
He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry.

13
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,350
- Get a cab!
- I never get cabs!

14
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,110
- I love you.
- When?

15
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,350
Get a cab!

16
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,870
My husband...

17
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,150
was a happy man
who lived life to the full.

18
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,430
He loved his family and his work,

19
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,950
and that he should have taken
his own life in this way

20
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,990
is a mystery

21
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,390
and a shock to all who knew him.

22
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,150
Yes, yes! Taxi!

23
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,070
- I'll be back in two minutes, mate.
- What?

24
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,070
- I'm just going home to get my umbrella.
- You can share mine.

25
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,630
Two minutes, all right?

26
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,350
She still dancing?

27
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,150
Yeah, if you can call it that.

28
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,270
- Did you get the car keys off her?
- Got them out of her bag.

29
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,950
Where is she?

30
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,590
The body of Beth Davenport,
Junior Minister for Transport,

31
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,830
was found late last night
on a building site in Greater London.

32
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,470
Preliminary investigations suggest
that this was suicide.

33
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,390
We can confirm that this apparent
suicide closely resembles those

34
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,190
of Sir Jeffrey Patterson
and James Phillimore.

35
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,830
In the light of this, these incidents
are now being treated as linked.

36
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,390
The investigation is ongoing,

37
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,870
but Detective Inspector Lestrade
will take questions now.

38
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,190
Detective Inspector,
how can suicides be linked?

39
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,350
Well, they all took the same poison.

40
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,470
They were all found in places
they had no reason to be.

41
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,990
None of them had shown

42
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,670
- any prior indication.
- But you can't have serial suicides.

43
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,350
Well, apparently you can.

44
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,390
These three people,
there's nothing that links them?

45
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,910
There's no link we've found yet,

46
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,750
but we're looking for it -
there has to be one.

47
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,830
If you've all got texts,

48
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,470
- please ignore them.
- It just says "wrong".

49
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,110
Well, just ignore that.

50
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,870
If there are no more questions
for Detective Inspector Lestrade,

51
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,510
I'm going to bring
this session to an end.

52
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,190
If they're suicides,
what are you investigating?

53
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,470
As I say,
these suicides are clearly linked.

54
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,270
It's an unusual situation.
We've got our best people investigating.

55
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,390
- Says "wrong" again.
- One more question.

56
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,230
Is there any chance
that these are murders?

57
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,870
And if they are,
is this the work of a serial killer?

58
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,870
I know that you like writing about these,
but these do appear to be suicides.

59
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,870
We know the difference.
The poison was clearly self-administered.

60
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,990
Yes, but if they are murders,
how do people keep themselves safe?

61
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,550
Well, don't commit suicide.

62
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,830
Daily Mail.

63
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,430
Obviously,
this is a frightening time for people,

64
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,750
but all anyone has to do
is exercise reasonable precautions.

65
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,710
We are all as safe as we want to be.

66
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,670
Thank you.

67
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,710
You've got to stop him doing that.
He's making us look like idiots.

68
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,390
If you can tell me how he does it,
I'll stop him.

69
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,350
John!

70
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,710
John Watson!

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,030
Stamford, Mike Stamford.
We were at Barts together.

72
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,750
Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.

73
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,230
- Yeah, I know, I got fat.
- No, no.

74
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,070
I heard you were abroad somewhere
getting shot at. What happened?

75
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,990
I got shot.

76
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,510
Are you still at Barts, then?

77
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,790
Teaching now, yeah. Bright young things
like we used to be.

78
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,830
God, I hate them.

79
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,550
What about you? Just staying in town
till you get yourself sorted?

80
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,310
I can't afford London
on an Army pension.

81
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,910
You couldn't bear to be anywhere else.
That's not the John Watson I know.

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,670
Yeah, I'm not the John Watson...

83
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,470
Couldn't Harry help?

84
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,550
Yeah, like that's going to happen

85
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,590
I don't know,
get a flat share or something?

86
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,470
Come on, who'd want me for a flatmate?

87
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,390
What?

88
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,790
You're the second person
to say that to me today.

89
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,270
Who was the first?

90
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,750
How fresh?

91
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,630
Just in. 67, natural causes.

92
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,830
Used to work here.
I knew him, he was nice.

93
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,990
Fine.

94
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,270
We'll start with the riding crop.

95
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,870
So, bad day, was it?

96
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,910
I need to know what bruises form
in the next 20 minutes.

97
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,070
A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

98
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,430
Listen, I was wondering.
Maybe later, when you're finished...

99
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,550
You're wearing lipstick.
You weren't wearing lipstick before.

100
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,430
I, er... I refreshed it a bit.

101
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,990
Sorry, you were saying?

102
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,790
I was wondering
if you'd like to have coffee.

103
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,590
Black, two sugars, please.
I'll be upstairs.

104
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,110
OK.

105
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,150
- Bit different from my day.
- You've no idea!

106
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,390
Mike, can I borrow your phone?
There's no signal on mine.

107
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,270
- And what's wrong with the landline?
- I prefer to text.

108
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,550
Sorry, it's in my coat.

109
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,270
Er, here... use mine.

110
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,670
Oh, thank you.

111
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,910
This is an old friend of mine,
John Watson.

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,310
Afghanistan or Iraq?

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,510
- Sorry?
- Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

114
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,750
Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you...?

115
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,870
Ah, Molly, coffee, thank you.

116
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,430
What happened to the lipstick?

117
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,230
It wasn't working for me.

118
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,750
Really? I thought it was
a big improvement.

119
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,470
Your mouth's too small now.

120
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,110
OK.

121
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,750
How do you feel about the violin?

122
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,390
I'm sorry, what?

123
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,790
I play the violin when I'm thinking

124
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,430
and sometimes I don't talk
for days on end. Would that bother you?

125
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,710
Potential flatmates should know
the worst about each other.

126
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,390
- You told him about me?
- Not a word.

127
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,230
Who said anything about flatmates?

128
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,590
I did. Told Mike this morning I must be
a difficult man to find a flatmate for.

129
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,630
Now here he is, just after lunch,

130
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,350
with an old friend clearly just home
from military service in Afghanistan.

131
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,110
- Wasn't a difficult leap.
- How did you know about Afghanistan?

132
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,350
Got my eye on a nice little place
in central London.

133
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,030
We ought to be able to afford it.

134
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,070
We'll meet there tomorrow evening,
seven o'clock.

135
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,310
Sorry, got to dash. I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

136
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,590
Is that it?

137
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,510
Is that what?

138
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,270
We've only just met
and we're going to go and look at a flat?

139
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,590
Problem?

140
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,110
We don't know a thing about each other.

141
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,510
I don't know where we're meeting.
I don't even know your name.

142
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,870
I know you're an Army doctor

143
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,630
and you've been invalided home
from Afghanistan.

144
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,350
You've got a brother worried about you,
but you won't go to him for help

145
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,990
because you don't approve of him,
possibly because he's an alcoholic,

146
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,390
more likely because
he recently walked out on his wife.

147
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,750
And I know your therapist thinks
your limp's psychosomatic,

148
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,990
quite correctly, I'm afraid.

149
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,550
That's enough to be going on with,
don't you think?

150
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,990
The name's Sherlock Holmes, and the
address is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon.

151
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,950
He's always like that.

152
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,110
Hello.

153
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,230
- Ah, Mr Holmes.
- Sherlock, please.

154
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,470
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.

155
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,470
Mrs Hudson, the landlady -
she's given me a special deal.

156
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,750
Owes me a favour. A few years back,

157
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,550
her husband got himself sentenced to death
in Florida. I was able to help out.

158
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,190
Sorry, you stopped her husband
being executed?

159
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,790
Oh, no, I ensured it.

160
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,350
Sherlock!

161
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,950
Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.

162
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,910
- Hello. Come in.
- Thank you.

163
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,030
Shall we...?

164
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,670
Well, this could be very nice.

165
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,990
Very nice indeed.

166
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,430
Yes.

167
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,830
Yes, I think so, my thoughts precisely.

168
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,830
- So I went straight ahead and moved in.
- Soon as we get this rubbish cleaned up.

169
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,350
Oh.

170
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,070
So this is all...

171
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,950
Well, obviously
I can straighten things up a bit.

172
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,030
- That's a skull.
- Friend of mine.

173
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,670
When I say friend...

174
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,710
What do you think, then, Dr Watson?

175
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,790
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

176
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,710
Of course we'll be needing two.

177
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,190
Oh, don't worry,
there's all sorts round here.

178
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,590
Mrs Turner next door's got married ones.

179
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,510
Oh... Sherlock! The mess you've made.

180
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,710
I looked you up
on the internet last night.

181
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,270
Anything interesting?

182
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,110
Found your website.
The Science Of Deduction.

183
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,550
What did you think?

184
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,590
You said you could identify
a software designer by his tie

185
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,390
and an airline pilot by his left thumb?

186
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,630
Yes.

187
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,270
And I can read your military career
in your face and your leg,

188
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,350
and your brother's drinking habits
in your mobile phone.

189
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,550
How?

190
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,950
What about these suicides, then, Sherlock?

191
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,550
I thought that'd be right up your street.

192
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,070
Three exactly the same.

193
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,390
Four.

194
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,190
There's been a fourth.
And there's something different

195
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,950
- this time.
- A fourth?

196
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,510
- Where?
- Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

197
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,350
What's new about this one?
You wouldn't have come to me otherwise.

198
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,030
You know how they never leave notes?
This one did.

199
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,150
- Will you come?
- Who's on forensics?

200
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,590
- Anderson.
- He doesn't work well with me.

201
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,190
- Well, he won't be your assistant.
- I need an assistant.

202
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,230
Will you come?

203
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,910
Not in a police car, I'll be right behind.

204
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,710
Thank you.

205
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,350
Brilliant! Yes!

206
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,510
Four serial suicides and now a note.

207
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,630
Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs Hudson,
I'll be late. Might need some food.

208
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,430
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

209
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,030
Something cold will do. John,
have a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

210
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,790
Don't wait up!

211
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,270
Look at him, dashing about...

212
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,750
My husband was just the same.

213
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,470
But you're more
the sitting-down type, I can tell.

214
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,510
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

215
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,110
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry.

216
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,030
It's just sometimes this bloody thing...

217
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,830
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

218
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,510
Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.

219
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,910
Just this once, dear,
I'm not your housekeeper.

220
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,590
Couple of biscuits too,
if you've got 'em.

221
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,790
Not your housekeeper!

222
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,870
You're a doctor.

223
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,590
In fact, you're an Army doctor.

224
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,870
Yes.

225
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,430
Any good?

226
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,470
Very good.

227
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,230
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.

228
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,230
Well, yes.

229
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,830
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

230
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,150
Of course. Yes.
Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

231
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,190
- Want to see some more?
- Oh, God, yes.

232
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,230
Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea.
Off out.

233
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,230
- Both of you?
- Impossible suicides? Four of them?

234
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,430
No point sitting at home when
there's finally something fun going on!

235
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,790
- Look at you, all happy. It's not decent.
- Who cares about decent?

236
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,270
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

237
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,430
Taxi!

238
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,710
- OK, you've got questions...
- Yeah, where are we going?

239
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,110
Crime scene. Next?

240
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,270
- Who are you? What do you do?
- What do you think?

241
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,830
- I'd say... private detective.
- But...?

242
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,830
But the police don't go
to private detectives.

243
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,470
I'm a consulting detective.
Only one in the world. I invented the job.

244
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,910
What does that mean?

245
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,750
It means when the police are
out of their depth, which is always,

246
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,630
- they consult me.
- The police don't consult amateurs.

247
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,590
When I met you for the first time
yesterday, I said Afghanistan or Iraq.

248
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,590
- You looked surprised.
- Yes, how did you know?

249
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,670
I didn't know, I saw.

250
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,390
Your haircut, the way you hold yourself
says military. But your conversation...

251
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,070
Bit different from my day.

252
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,750
...said trained at Barts -
so Army doctor, obvious.

253
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,750
Your face is tanned...

254
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,150
but no tan above the wrists.
You've been abroad, but not sunbathing.

255
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,390
Your limp's bad when you walk, but you
don't ask for a chair when you stand,

256
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,270
like you've forgotten about it,
so it's at least partly psychosomatic.

257
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,430
That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatic.

258
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,350
Wounded in action, then. Wounded
in action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

259
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,030
You said I had a therapist.

260
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,150
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

261
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,070
Then there's your brother. Your phone.

262
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,830
It's expensive,
e-mail enabled, MP3 player.

263
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,310
You're looking for a flat share.
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

264
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,590
Scratches.
Not one, many over time -

265
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,510
it's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

266
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,750
You wouldn't treat
your one luxury item like this,

267
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,910
so it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

268
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,390
The engraving?

269
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,430
Harry Watson. Clearly a family member
who's given you his old phone.

270
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,670
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

271
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,710
Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero
who can't find a place to live.

272
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,590
Unlikely you've got an extended family,
not one you're close to.

273
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,710
So brother it is.

274
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,630
Now, who's Clara? Three kisses
says it's a romantic attachment.

275
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,030
The expense of the phone
says wife, not girlfriend.

276
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,630
Must have given it to him recently,
the model's only six months old.

277
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,190
Marriage in trouble, then -
six months on he's given it away.

278
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,550
If she'd left him,
he would have kept it. Sentiment.

279
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,390
No, he wanted rid of it. He left her.

280
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,790
He gave the phone to you,
so he wants you to stay in touch.

281
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,990
You're looking for cheap accommodation,
but not going to your brother for help.

282
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,350
That says you've got problems with him.

283
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,590
Maybe you liked his wife
or don't like his drinking.

284
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,710
How can you possibly know
about the drinking?

285
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,790
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

286
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,070
Power connection -
tiny little scuff marks round the edge.

287
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,590
Every night he plugs it in
to charge, but his hands are shaking.

288
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,630
You never see those marks
on a sober man's phone,

289
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,990
never see a drunk's without them.
There you go, you were right.

290
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,070
I was right? Right about what?

291
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,390
The police don't consult amateurs.

292
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,870
That... was amazing.

293
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,790
- Do you think so?
- Of course it was.

294
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,150
It was extraordinary,
quite extraordinary.

295
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,070
- That's not what people normally say.
- What do people normally say?

296
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,590
Piss off!

297
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,110
Did I get anything wrong?

298
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,870
Harry and me don't get on, never have.

299
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,070
Clara and Harry split up
three months ago

300
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,150
and they're getting a divorce.

301
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,110
And Harry is a drinker.

302
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,710
Spot on, then. I didn't expect
to be right about everything.

303
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,310
Harry's short for Harriet.

304
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,550
Harry's your sister.

305
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,470
What exactly am I supposed
to be doing here?

306
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,030
- Sister!
- No, seriously, what am I doing here?

307
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,550
There's always something.

308
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,750
Hello, freak!

309
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,230
I'm here to see
Detective Inspector Lestrade.

310
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,910
- Why?
- I was invited.

311
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,910
- Why?
- I think he wants me to take a look.

312
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,470
- You know what I think, don't you?
- Always, Sally.

313
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,510
I even know
you didn't make it home last night.

314
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,350
- Er... who's this?
- Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

315
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,190
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

316
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,750
Old friend.

317
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,430
A colleague?
How do you get a colleague?

318
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,710
Did he follow you home?

319
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,390
- Would it be better if I just waited...?
- No.

320
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,470
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

321
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,070
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

322
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,990
It's a crime scene. I don't want it
contaminated. Are we clear on that?

323
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,110
Quite clear.

324
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,910
And is your wife away for long?

325
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,670
Oh, don't pretend you worked that out.
Somebody told you that.

326
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,110
Your deodorant told me that.

327
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,670
- My deodorant?
- It's for men.

328
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,990
Well, of course it's for men -
I'm wearing it.

329
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,230
So's Sergeant Donovan.

330
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,590
Ooh... I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

331
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,110
Whatever you're trying to imply...

332
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,230
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure
Sally came round for a nice little chat

333
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,910
and just happened to stay over.

334
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,150
And I assume she scrubbed your floors,
going by the state of her knees.

335
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,430
You'll need to wear one of these.

336
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,870
Who's this?

337
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,430
He's with me.

338
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,150
- But who is he?
- I said he's with me.

339
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,390
Aren't you going to put one on?

340
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,150
- So where are we?
- Upstairs.

341
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,630
I can give you two minutes.

342
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,950
May need longer.

343
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,670
Her name's Jennifer Wilson,
according to her credit cards.

344
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,350
We're running them now
for contact details.

345
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,110
Hasn't been here long.

346
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,790
Some kids found her.

347
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,630
Shut up.

348
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,670
- I didn't say anything.
- You were thinking. It's annoying.

349
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,030
Got anything?

350
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,070
Not much.

351
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,750
She's German.
Ache. It's German for revenge.

352
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,790
- She could be trying to tell us...
- Yes, thank you for your input.

353
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,230
- So she's German?
- Of course she's not.

354
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,750
She's from out of town, though.
Intended to stay in London for one night

355
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,910
before returning home to Cardiff -
so far, so obvious.

356
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,950
- Sorry, obvious?
- What about the message, though?

357
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,470
Dr Watson, what do you think?

358
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,830
- Of the message?
- Of the body. You're a medical man.

359
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,550
- We have a whole team outside.
- They won't work with me.

360
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,550
I'm breaking every rule
letting you in here...

361
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,990
Yes, because you need me.

362
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,270
Yes, I do.

363
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,550
God help me.

364
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,350
- Dr Watson!
- Hm?

365
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,110
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

366
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,990
Anderson, keep everyone out
for a couple of minutes...

367
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,230
- Well?
- What am I doing here?

368
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,830
- Helping me make a point.
- I'm supposed to help you pay the rent.

369
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,270
- This is more fun.
- Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

370
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,910
Perfectly sound analysis,
but I was hoping you'd go deeper.

371
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,070
Yeah...

372
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,670
Asphyxiation... probably.
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

373
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,390
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

374
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,630
It could have been a seizure.
Possibly drugs.

375
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,550
You know what it was,
you've read the papers.

376
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,750
Well, she's one of the suicides.
The fourth...?

377
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,750
Sherlock, two minutes, I said.
I need anything you've got.

378
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,390
Victim is in her late 30s.
Professional person, going by her clothes.

379
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,590
I'm guessing the media, going by
the frankly alarming shade of pink.

380
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,670
Travelled from Cardiff today,
intending to stay in London

381
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,990
for one night
from the size of her suitcase.

382
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,070
- Suitcase?
- Yes.

383
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,550
She's been married
at least ten years, but not happily.

384
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,430
She's had a string of lovers,
but none of them knew she was married.

385
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,630
Oh, for God's sake,
if you're just making this up...

386
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,190
Her wedding ring.
Ten years old at least.

387
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,110
The rest of her jewellery
has been regularly cleaned,

388
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,430
but not her wedding ring.
State of her marriage right there.

389
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,830
The inside is shinier than the outside,
so it's regularly removed.

390
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,030
The only polishing it gets
is when she works it off her finger.

391
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,030
It's not for work, look at her nails.
She doesn't work with her hands,

392
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,430
so what or who does she remove
her rings for?

393
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,110
Not one lover, she'd never sustain
the fiction of being single for that long,

394
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,870
- so more likely a string of them. Simple.
- That's brilliant.

395
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,510
- Sorry.
- Cardiff?

396
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,830
- It's obvious, isn't it?
- It's not obvious to me.

397
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,950
Dear God, what is it like in your funny
little brains? It must be so boring.

398
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,790
Her coat - it's slightly damp, she's been
in heavy rain in the last few hours -

399
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,470
no rain anywhere in London in that time.

400
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,150
Under her coat collar is damp too.
She's turned it up against the wind.

401
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,670
She's got an umbrella in her pocket,
but it's dry and unused.

402
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,230
Not just wind, strong wind -
too strong to use her umbrella.

403
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,150
We know from her suitcase
that she was intending to stay overnight,

404
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,750
but she can't have travelled
more than two or three hours,

405
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,470
because her coat still hasn't dried.

406
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,510
So, where has there been heavy rain
and strong wind

407
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,990
within the radius of that travel time?
Cardiff.

408
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,310
- That's fantastic.
- Do you know you do that out loud?

409
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,910
- Sorry, I'll shut up.
- No, it's... fine.

410
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,950
- Why do you keep saying suitcase?
- Yes, where is it?

411
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,550
She must have had a phone or an organiser.
Find out who Rachel is.

412
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,990
She was writing Rachel?

413
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,390
No, she was leaving an angry note
in German!

414
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,670
Of course she was writing Rachel,
no other word it can be.

415
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,110
But why did she wait until she was dying
to write it?

416
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,590
How do you know she had a suitcase?

417
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,630
Tiny splash marks on her right heel
and calf not present on the left.

418
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,390
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase
behind her with her right hand.

419
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,230
Don't get that splash pattern
any other way.

420
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,350
Smallish case, going by the spread.

421
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,150
Case that size,
woman this clothes-conscious -

422
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,070
could only be an overnight bag
so we know she was staying one night.

423
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,590
Where is it?
What have you done with it?

424
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,470
There wasn't a case.

425
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,110
- Say that again.
- There wasn't a case.

426
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,350
There was never any suitcase.

427
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,830
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?
Was there a suitcase in this house?

428
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,430
Sherlock, there was no case!

429
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,190
But they take the poison themselves,
they swallow the pills.

430
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,470
There are clear signs,
even you lot couldn't miss them.

431
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,830
Right, thanks. And...?

432
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,710
It's murder, all of them.
I don't know how.

433
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,230
But they're not suicides,
they're serial killings.

434
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,790
We've got a serial killer. Love those.

435
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,670
There's always something
to look forward to.

436
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,710
- Why are you saying that?
- Her case!

437
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,670
Come on, where is her case?

438
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,630
Did she eat it Someone else was here
and they took her case.

439
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,750
So the killer must have driven here.
Forgot the case was in the car.

440
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,910
She could have checked into a hotel,
left it there.

441
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,190
No, she never got to the hotel.
Look at her hair.

442
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,550
She colour-coordinates
her lipstick and shoes.

443
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,790
She'd never have left any hotel
with her hair still looking...

444
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,350
Oh...

445
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,710
Oh!

446
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,270
Sherlock? What is it, what?

447
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,070
Serial killers, always hard. You have
to wait for them to make a mistake.

448
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,150
- We can't just wait!
- Oh, we're done waiting.

449
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,510
Look at her, really look! Houston,
we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff.

450
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,630
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's
family and friends were. Find Rachel!

451
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,590
Of course, yeah - but what mistake?!

452
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,750
Pink!

453
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,550
Let's get on with it...

454
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,590
- He's gone.
- Who, Sherlock Holmes?

455
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,870
Yeah, he just took off.
He does that.

456
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,070
- Is he coming back?
- Didn't look like it.

457
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,990
Right.

458
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,670
Right...

459
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,590
Yes. Sorry, where am I?

460
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,230
Brixton.

461
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,110
Do you know where I could get a cab?

462
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,310
It's just, er...

463
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,950
well...

464
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,670
my leg.

465
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,590
Er...

466
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,590
...try the main road.

467
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,790
Thanks.

468
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,310
But you're not his friend.

469
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,390
He doesn't have friends.

470
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,470
So who are you?

471
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,310
I'm... I'm nobody. I just met him.

472
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,390
OK, bit of advice, then.
Stay away from that guy.

473
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,390
Why?

474
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,510
You know why he's here?

475
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,750
He's not paid or anything.

476
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,110
He likes it. He gets off on it.

477
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,350
The weirder the crime, the more
he gets off. And you know what...?

478
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,550
One day just showing up
won't be enough.

479
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,910
One day we'll be standing round a body,
and he'll be the one that put it there.

480
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,030
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a psychopath.

481
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,630
Psychopaths get bored.

482
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,590
- Donovan!
- Coming.

483
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,070
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

484
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,630
Taxi! Taxi...

485
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,230
Hello?

486
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,750
There is a security camera
on the building to your left.

487
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,310
Do you see it?

488
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,750
Who's this?

489
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,030
Who's speaking?

490
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,030
Do you see the camera, Dr Watson?

491
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,350
- Yeah, I see it.
- Watch...

492
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,230
There is another camera on the building
opposite you. Do you see it?

493
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,350
Mm-hm.

494
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,510
And finally, at the top
of the building on your right.

495
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,030
How are you doing this?

496
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,190
Get into the car, Dr Watson.

497
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,390
I would make some sort of threat,

498
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,790
but I'm sure your situation
is quite clear to you.

499
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,830
- Hello.
- Hi.

500
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,990
What's your name, then?

501
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,790
Er... Anthea.

502
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,630
- Is that your real name?
- No.

503
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,190
I'm John.

504
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,910
Yes. I know.

505
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,310
Any point in asking... where I'm going?

506
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,190
None at all...

507
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,470
John.

508
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,190
OK.

509
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,990
Have a seat, John.

510
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,390
You know, I've got a phone.

511
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,350
I mean, very clever and all that,

512
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,430
but, er...

513
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,190
you could just phone me.

514
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,670
On my phone.

515
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,070
When one is avoiding the attention
of Sherlock Holmes,

516
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,350
one learns to be discreet,
hence this place.

517
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,350
Your leg must be hurting you.
Sit down.

518
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,710
I don't want to sit down.

519
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,110
You don't seem very afraid.

520
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,750
You don't seem very frightening.

521
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,390
Yes...

522
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,310
The bravery of the soldier.

523
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,910
Bravery is by far the kindest word
for stupidity, don't you think?

524
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,510
What is your connection
to Sherlock Holmes?

525
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,990
I don't have one. I barely know him.
I met him... yesterday.

526
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,310
Mmm, and since yesterday,
you've moved in with him

527
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,310
and now you're solving crimes together.

528
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,590
Might we expect a happy announcement
by the end of the week?

529
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,150
- Who are you?
- An interested party.

530
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,070
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

531
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,190
I'm guessing you're not friends.

532
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,630
You've met him. How many friends
do you imagine he has?

533
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,230
I am the closest thing to a friend that
Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.

534
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,230
- And what's that?
- An enemy.

535
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,750
- An enemy?
- In his mind, certainly.

536
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,430
If you were to ask him,
he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

537
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,310
He does love to be dramatic.

538
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,710
Well, thank God
you're above all that

539
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,990
I hope I'm not distracting you.

540
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,310
Not distracting me at all.

541
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,430
Do you plan to continue your association
with Sherlock Holmes?

542
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,710
I could be wrong...

543
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,230
but I think
that's none of your business.

544
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,990
- It could be.
- It really couldn't.

545
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,950
If you do move into, um...

546
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,870
...221B Baker Street,

547
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,310
I'd be happy to pay you
a meaningful sum of money

548
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,910
on a regular basis to ease your way.

549
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,870
- Why?
- Because you're not a wealthy man.

550
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,510
In exchange for what?

551
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,150
Information.

552
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,630
Nothing indiscreet.
Nothing you'd feel... uncomfortable with.

553
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,470
- Just tell me what he's up to.
- Why?

554
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,910
I worry about him. Constantly.

555
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,510
That's nice of you.

556
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,030
But I would prefer for various reasons
that my concern go unmentioned.

557
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,230
We have what you might call a...
difficult relationship.

558
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,070
- No.
- But I haven't mentioned a figure.

559
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,790
- Don't bother.
- You're very loyal very quickly.

560
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,710
No, I'm not, I'm just not interested.

561
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,590
"Trust issues", it says here.

562
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,390
What's that?

563
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,390
Could it be that you've decided to trust
Sherlock Holmes of all people?

564
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,750
Who says I trust him?

565
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,390
You don't seem the kind
to make friends easily.

566
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,270
- Are we done?
- You tell me.

567
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,430
I imagine people have already warned you
to stay away from him,

568
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,710
but I can see from your left hand
that's not going to happen.

569
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,310
- My what?
- Show me.

570
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,230
Don't...

571
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,670
- Remarkable.
- What is?

572
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,190
Most people blunder round this city

573
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,310
and all they see
are streets and shops and cars.

574
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,230
When you walk with Sherlock Holmes,
you see the battlefield.

575
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,590
You've seen it already, haven't you?

576
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,750
What's wrong with my hand?

577
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,390
You have an intermittent tremor
in your left hand.

578
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,470
Your therapist thinks
it's post-traumatic stress disorder.

579
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,350
She thinks you're haunted by memories
of your military service.

580
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,990
Who the hell are you?

581
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,070
- How do you know that?
- Fire her.

582
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,190
She's got it the wrong way round.

583
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,910
You're under stress right now,
and your hand is perfectly steady.

584
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,590
You're not haunted by the war,
Dr Watson...

585
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,070
You miss it.

586
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,550
Welcome back.

587
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,470
Time to choose a side, Dr Watson.

588
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,270
I'm to take you home.

589
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,110
Address?

590
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,230
Er, Baker Street.

591
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,030
221B Baker Street.

592
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,590
But I need to stop off somewhere first.

593
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,950
Listen, your boss. Any chance you could
not tell him this is where I went?

594
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,510
- Sure.
- You've told him already, haven't you?

595
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,070
Yeah.

596
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,510
Hey, um...
do you ever get any free time?

597
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,870
Oh, yeah. Lots.

598
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,630
- Bye.
- OK.

599
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,070
- What are you doing?
- Nicotine patch.

600
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,430
Helps me think.

601
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,270
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit
in London these days.

602
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,950
Bad news for brain work.

603
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,030
- It's good news for breathing.
- Oh, breathing! Breathing's boring.

604
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,830
Is that... three patches?

605
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,710
It's a three-patch problem.

606
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,030
Well...?

607
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,030
You asked me to come,
I'm assuming it's important.

608
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,110
Oh, yeah, of course.
Can I borrow your phone?

609
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,030
My phone?

610
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,950
Always a chance that my number will be
recognised. It's on the website.

611
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,950
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.

612
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,750
She's downstairs.
I shouted, but she didn't hear.

613
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,910
- I was the other side of London...
- There was no hurry.

614
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,350
Here...

615
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,190
So what's this about - the case?

616
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,710
- Her case...
- Her case?

617
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,630
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

618
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,070
The murderer took her suitcase,
first big mistake.

619
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,750
OK, he took her case. So?

620
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,990
It's no use, there's no other way.
We'll have to risk it.

621
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,510
On my desk there's a number.
I want you to send a text.

622
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,430
You've brought me here...
to send a text.

623
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,030
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

624
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,750
- What's wrong?
- Just met a friend of yours.

625
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,750
- A friend?
- An enemy.

626
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,270
Oh. Which one?

627
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,510
Well, your arch-enemy, according to him.
Do people have arch-enemies?

628
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,190
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

629
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,910
- Yes.
- Did you take it?

630
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,030
- No.
- Pity, we could have split the fee.

631
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,390
- Think it through next time.
- Who is he?

632
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,310
The most dangerous man you've ever met
and not my problem right now.

633
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,030
On my desk, the number!

634
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,190
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

635
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,350
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

636
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,270
Yes. That's not important.
Just enter the number.

637
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,750
- Are you doing it?
- Yes.

638
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,150
- Have you done it?
- Yeah, hang on!

639
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,750
These words exactly.

640
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,230
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

641
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,030
"I must have blacked out.

642
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,630
"22 Northumberland Street,
please come."

643
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,110
- You blacked out?
- What? No... No!

644
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,870
Type and send it. Quickly.

645
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,870
- Have you sent it?
- What's the address?

646
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,310
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

647
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,870
That's...

648
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,790
That's the pink lady's case,
that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

649
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,150
Yes, obviously.

650
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,830
Oh, perhaps I should mention -
I didn't kill her.

651
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,510
- I never said you did.
- Why not?

652
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,950
Given that text and the fact I have her
case, it's a perfectly logical assumption.

653
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,310
Do people usually assume
you're the murderer?

654
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,950
Now and then, yes.

655
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,550
OK...

656
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,670
- How did you get this?
- By looking.

657
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,710
Where?

658
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,510
The killer must have driven her
to Lauriston Gardens.

659
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,390
He could only keep her case by accident
if it was in a car.

660
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,150
Nobody could be seen with this case
without drawing attention -

661
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,110
particularly a man,
which is statistically more likely.

662
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,670
So obviously he'd feel compelled
to get rid of it.

663
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,830
Wouldn't have taken him more than
five minutes to realise his mistake.

664
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,430
I checked every backstreet
wide enough for a car

665
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,510
five minutes from Lauriston Gardens

666
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,030
and anywhere you could dispose of
a bulky object without being observed.

667
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,470
Took me less than an hour
to find the right skip.

668
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,550
Pink. You got all that because
you realised the case would be pink?

669
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,910
- It had to be pink, obviously.
- Why didn't I think of that

670
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,430
Because you're an idiot.

671
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,190
No, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.

672
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,870
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

673
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,150
From the case? How could I?

674
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,790
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

675
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,350
There was no phone on the body,
there's no phone in the case.

676
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,910
We know she had one.
You just texted it.

677
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,190
Maybe she left it at home.

678
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,350
She has a string of lovers
and she's careful about it.

679
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,470
She never leaves her phone at home.

680
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,150
Er...

681
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,910
Why did I just send that text?

682
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,230
Well, the question is
where is her phone now?

683
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,910
- She could have lost it.
- Yes, or?

684
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,830
The murderer... You think
the murderer has the phone?

685
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,470
Maybe she... left it
when she left her case.

686
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,070
Maybe he took it from her for some reason.

687
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,470
Either way, the balance of probability
is the murderer has her phone.

688
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,630
Sorry... what are we doing?
Did I just text a murderer?

689
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,030
What good will that do?

690
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,070
A few hours after his last victim,

691
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,590
and now he receives a text
that can only be from her.

692
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,350
If somebody had just found that phone,

693
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,550
they'd ignore a text like that,
but the murderer...

694
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,310
would panic.

695
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,390
- Have you talked to the police?
- Four people are dead, there isn't time.

696
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,110
So why are you talking to me?

697
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,950
Mrs Hudson took my skull.

698
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,030
So I'm basically filling in
for your skull?

699
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,310
Relax, you're doing fine.

700
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,830
- Well?
- Well, what?

701
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,550
Well... you could just sit there
and... watch telly.

702
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,990
You want me to come with you?

703
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,230
I like company when I go out
and I think better when I talk aloud.

704
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,710
The skull just attracts attention, so...

705
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,150
- Problem?
- Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

706
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,990
What about her?

707
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,390
She said you get off on this,
you enjoy it.

708
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,950
And I said "dangerous",
and here you are.

709
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,070
Damn it!

710
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,750
Where are we going?

711
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,350
Northumberland Street's
a five-minute walk from here.

712
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,270
You think he's stupid enough
to go there?

713
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,910
No, I think he's brilliant enough.

714
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,950
I love the brilliant ones.
They're all so desperate to get caught.

715
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,190
- Why?
- Appreciation!

716
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,830
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

717
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,870
That's the frailty of genius, John,

718
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,510
- it needs an audience.
- Yeah.

719
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,870
This is his hunting ground.
Right here in the heart of the city.

720
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,230
Now that we know his victims were
abducted, that changes everything.

721
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,150
Because all of his victims
disappeared from busy streets,

722
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,310
crowded places,
but nobody saw them go.

723
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,550
Think! Who do we trust,
even though we don't know them?

724
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,910
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

725
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,270
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

726
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,350
Don't know. Who?

727
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,350
Haven't the faintest. Hungry?

728
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,630
Thank you, Billy.

729
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,710
22 Northumberland Street.

730
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,950
Keep your eyes on it.

731
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,990
He's not just going to ring the doorbell.
He'd need to be mad.

732
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,510
He has killed four people.

733
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,070
OK.

734
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,150
Sherlock!

735
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,710
Anything on the menu,
whatever you want, free.

736
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,030
On the house, for you
and for your date.

737
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,790
- Do you want to eat?
- I'm not his date.

738
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,990
This man got me off a murder charge.

739
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,150
This is Angelo. Three years ago,
I proved to Lestrade,

740
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,470
at the time
of a particularly vicious triple murder,

741
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,550
that Angelo was in a different
part of town, house-breaking.

742
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,590
- He cleared my name.
- I cleared it a bit.

743
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,230
Anything happening opposite?

744
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,470
Nothing.

745
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,270
But for this man, I'd have gone to prison.

746
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,990
- You did go to prison.
- I'll get a candle for the table.

747
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,590
- It's more romantic.
- I'm not his date!

748
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,470
You may as well eat.
We might have a long wait.

749
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,990
Thanks.

750
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,110
People don't have arch-enemies.

751
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,110
- I'm sorry?
- In real life.

752
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,470
There are no arch-enemies
in real life. Doesn't happen.

753
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,830
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.

754
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,830
So who did I meet?

755
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,710
What do real people have, then,
in their... "real lives"?

756
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,070
Friends?

757
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,350
People they know, people they like,
people they don't like...

758
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,270
- Girlfriends, boyfriends.
- Yes, well, as I was saying, dull.

759
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,830
You don't have a girlfriend, then?

760
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,910
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

761
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,430
Mm.

762
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,030
Oh, right.

763
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,550
Do you have a boyfriend?
Which is fine, by the way.

764
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,750
I know it's fine.

765
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,470
- So you've got a boyfriend, then.
- No.

766
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,350
Right. OK.

767
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,230
You're unattached. Like me.

768
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,350
Fine. Good.

769
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,110
John, um... I think you should know

770
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,710
I consider myself married to my work
and while I'm flattered,

771
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,070
- I'm really not looking for any...
- No, I'm... not asking. No.

772
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,030
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

773
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,430
Good.

774
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,350
Thank you.

775
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,350
Look across the street.
Taxi. It's stopped.

776
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,390
Nobody getting in
and nobody getting out.

777
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,590
Why a taxi? Oh, that's clever.

778
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,910
- Is it clever? Why is it clever?
- That's him.

779
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,510
- Don't stare.
- You're staring.

780
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,630
We can't both stare.

781
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,630
Sorry...

782
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,350
- I've got the cab number.
- Good for you.

783
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,110
Right turn, one way, roadworks,
traffic lights, bus lane,

784
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,590
pedestrian crossing, left turn only,
traffic lights.

785
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,990
- Oi!
- Sorry.

786
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,590
Come on, John...

787
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,510
Come on, John. We're losing him!

788
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,070
This way.

789
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,070
- No, this way!
- Sorry...

790
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,910
Police! Open her up.

791
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,110
No...

792
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,390
Teeth, tan. What, Californian?

793
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,110
LA, Santa Monica. Just arrived.

794
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,110
- How could you possibly know that?
- The luggage.

795
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,430
First trip to London, right?

796
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,910
Going by your final destination
and the cabbie's route.

797
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,950
Sorry, are you guys the police?

798
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,310
Yeah. Everything all right?

799
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,270
Yeah.

800
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,310
Welcome to London.

801
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,430
Er, any problems, just let us know.

802
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,950
Basically just a cab
that happened to slow down.

803
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,510
- Basically.
- Not the murderer.

804
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,630
- Not the murderer, no.
- Wrong country, good alibi.

805
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,910
- As they go.
- Hey, where did you get this?

806
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,070
- Detective Inspector Lestrade?
- Yeah.

807
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,950
I pickpocket him when he's annoying.

808
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,510
You can keep that one,
I've got plenty at the flat.

809
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,230
- What?
- Nothing, just... "Welcome to London."

810
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,870
- Got your breath back?
- Ready when you are.

811
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,710
That was ridiculous.

812
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,230
That was the most ridiculous thing...
I've ever done.

813
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,710
And you invaded Afghanistan.

814
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,230
That wasn't just me.
Why aren't we back at the restaurant?

815
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,430
They can keep an eye out.

816
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,470
It was a long shot anyway.

817
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,470
So what were we doing there?

818
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,990
Oh, just passing the time.

819
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,670
And proving a point.

820
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,230
- What point?
- You.

821
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:51,270
Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson
will take the room upstairs.

822
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,750
Says who?

823
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,390
Says the man at the door.

824
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,310
Sherlock texted me.
He said you forgot this.

825
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,750
Ah...

826
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,430
Er, thank you.

827
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,670
Thank you.

828
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,670
Sherlock, what have you done?

829
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,910
- Mrs Hudson?
- Upstairs.

830
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,070
What are you doing?

831
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,750
I knew you'd find the case,
I'm not stupid.

832
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,230
You can't just break into my flat.

833
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,990
You can't withhold evidence -
and I didn't break in.

834
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,310
What do you call this, then?

835
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,430
It's a drugs bust.

836
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,990
Seriously? This guy - a junkie?

837
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,990
- Have you met him?
- John...

838
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,590
You could search this flat all day,

839
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,310
you wouldn't find anything
you could call recreational.

840
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,670
- John, you probably want to shut up now.
- But come on...

841
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,910
- No...
- What?

842
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,070
- You?
- Shut up!

843
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,590
- I'm not your sniffer dog.
- No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

844
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,270
Anderson, what are you doing here
on a drugs bust?

845
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,830
- Oh, I volunteered.
- They all did.

846
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,110
They're not strictly speaking
on the drug squad, but they're very keen.

847
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,070
- Are these human eyes?
- Put those back!

848
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,510
- They were in the microwave.
- It's an experiment.

849
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,950
Keep looking, guys.

850
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,230
Or you could help us properly,
and I'll stand them down.

851
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,390
- This is childish.
- Well, I'm dealing with a child.

852
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,430
Sherlock, this is our case. I'm letting
you in, but you do not go off on your own.

853
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,350
Clear?

854
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,550
So you set up a pretend drugs bust
to bully me?

855
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,270
It stops being pretend
if we find anything.

856
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,950
I am clean!

857
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,430
- Is your flat? All of it?
- I don't even smoke.

858
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,710
Neither do I.

859
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,910
So let's work together.

860
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,510
- We've found Rachel.
- Who is she?

861
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,150
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

862
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,110
Her daughter?

863
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,670
Why would she write
her daughter's name? Why?

864
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,030
Never mind that, we found the case.

865
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,310
According to someone,
the murderer has the case,

866
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,910
and we found it in the hands
of our favourite psychopath.

867
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,110
Not a psychopath, I'm a high-functioning
sociopath. Do your research.

868
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,790
You need to bring Rachel in
to question her. I need to question her.

869
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,190
She's dead.

870
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,750
Excellent. How, when and why?
Is there a connection? There has to be.

871
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,230
Well, I doubt it,
since she's been dead for 14 years.

872
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,910
Technically, she was never alive.

873
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,070
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's
stillborn daughter, 14 years ago.

874
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,510
Oh, that's...

875
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,350
...that's not right. How...

876
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,190
Why would she do that? Why?

877
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,550
Why would she think of her daughter
in her last moments?

878
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,430
Yep - sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

879
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,390
She didn't think about her daughter.

880
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,150
She scratched her name on the floor
with her fingernails. She was dying.

881
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,030
It took effort, it would have hurt.

882
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,030
You said that the victims
all took the poison themselves,

883
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,470
that he makes them take it.

884
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,950
Well, maybe he... I don't know,
talks to them.

885
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,550
Maybe he used the death
of her daughter somehow.

886
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,950
But that was ages ago.
Why would she still be upset?

887
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,070
Not good?

888
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,150
Bit not good, yeah.

889
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,190
If you were dying,
if you'd been murdered,

890
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,470
in your very last few seconds,
what would you say?

891
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,390
- "Please, God, let me live."
- Use your imagination!

892
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,990
I don't have to.

893
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,950
Yeah, but if you were clever,
really clever.

894
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,390
Jennifer Wilson running
all those lovers - she was clever.

895
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,230
She's trying to tell us something.

896
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,910
Isn't the doorbell working?
Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

897
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,150
- I didn't order a taxi. Go away.
- Oh, dear. They're making such a mess.

898
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,110
- What are they looking for?
- It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

899
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,950
But they're just for my hip.
They're herbal soothers...

900
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,550
Shut up, everybody!
Don't move, don't speak, don't breathe.

901
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,670
I'm trying to think. Anderson,
face the other way. You're putting me off.

902
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,270
- What? My face is
- Everybody quiet and still.

903
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,550
- Anderson, turn your back.
- Oh, for God's sake!

904
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,230
Your back, now, please!

905
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,270
- Come on, think. Quick!
- What about your taxi?

906
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,550
Mrs Hudson!

907
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,950
Oh...

908
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,150
Ah!

909
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,710
She was clever. Clever, yes!

910
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:49,150
She's cleverer than you lot
and she's dead. Do you see? Do you get it?

911
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,710
She didn't lose her phone,
she never lost it. She planted it on him.

912
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,750
When she got out of the car,
she knew that she was going to her death.

913
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,830
She left the phone
in order to lead us to her killer.

914
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,790
- But how?
- What do you mean, how?

915
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,510
Rachel!

916
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,390
Don't you see? Rachel!

917
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,390
Oh...

918
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,110
Look at you lot.
You're all so vacant.

919
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,910
Is it nice not being me?
It must be so relaxing.

920
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,910
- Rachel is not a name.
- Then what is it?

921
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,990
John, on the luggage, there's a label.

922
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,110
E-mail address.

923
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,830
Er, jenny.pink@mephone.org.uk.

924
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,350
She didn't have a laptop, which means
she did her business on her phone.

925
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,190
So it's a smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.

926
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,830
So there was a website
for her account.

927
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,950
The username is her e-mail address,
and all together now, the password is...?

928
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,230
- Rachel.
- So we can read her e-mails. So what?

929
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,230
Anderson, don't talk out loud.
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

930
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,030
We can do much more than that.
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

931
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,150
Which means if you lose it,
you can locate it online.

932
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,870
She's leading us
to the man who killed her.

933
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,950
- Unless he got rid of it.
- We know he didn't.

934
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,470
- Come on, come on. Quickly!
- Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

935
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,230
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time
for your evening soother?

936
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,270
Get vehicles, get a helicopter.
This phone battery won't last for ever.

937
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,750
We'll just have a map reference,
not a name.

938
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,390
It's a start!

939
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,550
Sherlock...

940
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,310
Narrows it down
from just anyone in London.

941
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,430
- It's the first proper lead we've had.
- Sherlock...

942
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,910
Where is it? Quickly, where?

943
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,950
Here. It's... in 221 Baker Street.

944
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,710
How can it be here?

945
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,030
How?

946
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,630
Maybe it was in the case
when you brought it back

947
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,230
- and it fell out somewhere.
- And I didn't notice it?

948
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,390
I didn't notice?

949
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,190
Anyway, we texted him,
and he called back.

950
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,270
Guys, we're also looking for a mobile
somewhere here, belonged to the victim.

951
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,350
Who do we trust,
even if we don't know them?

952
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,990
Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?

953
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,030
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

954
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,950
- Sherlock, are you OK?
- What...?

955
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,190
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

956
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,150
So, how can the phone be here?

957
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,390
Don't know.

958
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,510
- I'll try it again.
- Good idea.

959
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,110
Where are you going?

960
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,630
Fresh air, just popping outside
for a moment. Won't be long.

961
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,830
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

962
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,710
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

963
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,110
I didn't order a taxi.

964
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,310
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

965
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,230
You're the cabbie.

966
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,110
The one who stopped outside
Northumberland Street.

967
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,230
It was you. Not your passenger.

968
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,430
See?
No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

969
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,430
It's like you're invisible.

970
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,310
Just the back of an 'ead.

971
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,990
Proper advantage for a serial killer.

972
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,270
- Is this a confession?
- Oh, yeah.

973
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,510
I'll tell you what else...

974
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,670
If you call the coppers now,
I won't run.

975
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:52,350
I'll sit quiet,
and they can take me down, I promise.

976
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,670
Why?

977
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,710
- Cos you're not going to do that.
- Am I not?

978
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,470
I didn't kill those four people,
Mr Holmes.

979
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,630
I spoke to 'em...

980
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,790
and they killed themselves.

981
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,510
If you get the coppers now,
I'll promise you one thing.

982
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,230
I will never tell you what I said.

983
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,990
No-one else will die, though,
and I believe they call that a result.

984
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,030
And you won't ever understand
how those people died.

985
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,430
What kind of result do you care about?

986
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,110
If I wanted to understand...

987
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,950
- ...what would I do?
- Let me take you for a ride.

988
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,790
- So you can kill me too?
- I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

989
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,990
I'm going to talk to you...

990
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,590
...and then you're going to kill yourself.

991
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,870
He just got in a cab...

992
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,510
It's Sherlock.
He just drove off in a cab.

993
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,110
I told you, he does that.

994
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,630
He bloody left again.

995
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,310
We're wasting our time!

996
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,830
I'm... calling the phone,
it's ringing out.

997
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,470
And if it's ringing, it's not here.

998
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,310
- I'll try the search again.
- Does it matter? Does any of it?

999
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,470
He's just a lunatic
and he'll always let you down.

1000
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,230
And you're wasting your time.
All our time.

1001
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,670
OK, everybody...

1002
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,230
done here.

1003
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,310
How did you find me?

1004
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,190
Oh, I recognised you.

1005
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,790
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.

1006
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,870
Sherlock Holmes!

1007
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,350
I was warned about you.

1008
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,190
I've been on your website too.
Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

1009
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,470
Who warned you about me?

1010
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,950
Just someone out there who's noticed.

1011
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,070
Who?

1012
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,870
Who would notice me?

1013
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,030
- You're too modest, Mr Holmes.
- I'm really not.

1014
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,390
Got yourself a fan.

1015
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,070
Tell me more.

1016
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,790
That's all you're going to know.

1017
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,910
In this lifetime.

1018
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,350
Why did he do that?
Why did he have to leave?

1019
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,670
You know him better than I do.

1020
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,990
I've known him for five years
and, no, I don't.

1021
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,150
So why do you put up with him?

1022
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,110
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

1023
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,750
And because Sherlock Holmes
is a great man,

1024
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,470
and I think one day,
if we're very, very lucky,

1025
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,750
he might even be a good one.

1026
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,150
Where are we?

1027
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,390
You know every street in London.
You know exactly where we are.

1028
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,430
Roland-Kerr
Further Education College.

1029
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,390
- Why here?
- It's open.

1030
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,750
Cleaners are in.
One thing about being a cabbie -

1031
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,470
you always know
a nice quiet spot for a murder.

1032
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,590
I'm surprised more of us
don't branch out.

1033
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,590
And you just walk your victims in? How?

1034
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,110
Oh... Dull.

1035
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,790
Don't worry. It gets better.

1036
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,630
You can't make people
take their own lives at gunpoint.

1037
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,070
I don't.

1038
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,830
It's much better than that.

1039
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,990
Don't need this with you.
Cos you'll follow me.

1040
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,910
Well, what do you think?

1041
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,990
It's up to you. You're the one
who's going to die here.

1042
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,630
No, I'm not.

1043
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,950
That's what they all say.

1044
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,710
Shall we talk?

1045
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,030
Bit risky, wasn't it?

1046
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,950
Took me away under the eye
of about half a dozen policemen.

1047
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,270
They're not that stupid.

1048
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,510
And Mrs Hudson will remember you.

1049
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,430
You call that a risk? Nah...

1050
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,590
This... is a risk.

1051
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,830
Oh, I like this bit.

1052
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,750
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

1053
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,750
But you're about to.

1054
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,430
I just have to do this...

1055
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,270
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

1056
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,870
Oh, you're gonna love this.

1057
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,670
- Love what?
- Sherlock Holmes... look at you!

1058
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:38,110
Here in the flesh. That website of yours,
your fan told me about it.

1059
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,790
My fan?

1060
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,390
You are brilliant.

1061
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,870
You are a proper genius.

1062
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,750
The Science of Deduction. Now, that...

1063
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,950
is proper thinking.

1064
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,150
Between you and me sitting here,
why can't people think?

1065
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,110
Don't it make you mad?

1066
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,870
Why can't people just think?

1067
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,230
Oh, I see...
So you're a proper genius too.

1068
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,430
Don't look it, do I?

1069
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,510
Funny little man driving a cab.

1070
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,710
But you'll know better in a minute.

1071
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,790
Chances are
it'll be the last thing you ever know.

1072
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,070
OK, two bottles. Explain.

1073
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,390
There's a good bottle
and a bad bottle.

1074
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,990
You take the pill
from the good bottle, you live.

1075
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,110
You take the pill
from the bad bottle... you die.

1076
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,750
- Both bottles are of course identical.
- In every way.

1077
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,870
- And you know which is which.
- Of course I know.

1078
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,790
- But I don't.
- Wouldn't be a game

1079
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,590
if you knew -
you're the one who chooses.

1080
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:48,630
Why should I? I've got nothing
to go on. What's in it for me?

1081
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,430
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

1082
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,590
Whatever bottle you choose,

1083
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,310
I take the pill from the other one.

1084
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,750
And then together...

1085
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,310
we take our medicine.

1086
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,350
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

1087
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,710
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

1088
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,990
Didn't expect that, did you,
Mr Holmes?

1089
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,510
This is what you did
to the rest of them,

1090
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,030
- you gave them a choice?
- And now I'm giving you one.

1091
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,510
You take your time.

1092
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,430
Get yourself together.

1093
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,350
- I want your best game.
- It's not a game, it's chance.

1094
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,110
I've played four times. I'm alive.

1095
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,030
It's not chance, Mr Holmes - it's chess.

1096
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,230
It's a game of chess,
with one move...

1097
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,310
...and one survivor.

1098
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,070
And this... this...

1099
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,910
is the move.

1100
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,470
Did I just give you the good bottle
or the bad bottle?

1101
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,790
You can choose either one.

1102
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,230
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade -
I need to speak to him.

1103
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,990
It's important. It's an emergency.

1104
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,310
Er, left here, please. Left here...

1105
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,350
You ready yet, Mr Holmes?

1106
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,110
- Ready to play?
- Play what? It's a 50:50 chance.

1107
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,830
You're not playing the numbers -
you're playing me.

1108
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,870
Did I just give you the good pill
or the bad pill?

1109
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,990
Is it a bluff

1110
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,030
or a double bluff?

1111
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,190
- Or a triple bluff?
- It's still just chance.

1112
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,190
Four people, in a row?
It's not chance.

1113
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,950
- Luck.
- It's genius!

1114
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,030
I know how people think.

1115
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,110
I know how people think I think.

1116
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,550
I can see it all
like a map inside my head.

1117
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,790
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

1118
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,510
Or maybe God just loves me.

1119
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,750
Either way,
you're wasted as a cabbie.

1120
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,990
So...

1121
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,950
...you risked your life four times
just to kill strangers - why?

1122
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,550
Time to play.

1123
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,350
Oh, I am playing. This is my turn.

1124
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:36,750
There's shaving foam behind your
left ear. Nobody's pointed it out to you.

1125
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,230
Traces of where it's happened before,
so obviously you live on your own -

1126
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,550
there's no-one to tell you.

1127
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,470
But there's a photograph of children.
The children's mother's been cut out.

1128
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,190
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

1129
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,150
The photograph's old,
but the frame's new.

1130
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,590
You think of your children,
but you don't get to see them.

1131
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,870
Estranged father.

1132
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,750
She took the kids,

1133
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,310
but you still love them,
and it still hurts.

1134
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,630
Ah, but there's more.

1135
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,510
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

1136
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,310
but everything you're wearing
is at least... three years old?

1137
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,230
Keeping up appearances,
but not planning ahead.

1138
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,230
And here you are on a kamikaze
murder spree. What's that about?

1139
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,470
Ah...

1140
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,710
three years ago.
Is that when they told you?

1141
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,070
Told me what?

1142
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,190
- That you're a dead man walking.
- So are you.

1143
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,830
You don't have long, though. Am I right?

1144
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,390
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

1145
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,110
Any breath could be my last.

1146
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,630
And because you're dying,
you've just murdered four people.

1147
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,590
I've outlived four people.

1148
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,030
That's the most fun you can have
with an aneurism.

1149
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,590
No... No, there's something else.

1150
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:00,630
You didn't just kill four people because
you're bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic.

1151
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:04,670
Love is a much more vicious motivator.

1152
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,270
Somehow, this is about your children.

1153
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,710
Oh...

1154
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,230
- You are good, in't ya?
- But how?

1155
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,470
When I die, they won't get much,
my kids.

1156
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,710
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

1157
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,110
- Or serial killing.
- You'd be surprised.

1158
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,790
Surprise me.

1159
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,470
- I have a sponsor.
- You have a what?

1160
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,750
For every life I take,
money goes to my kids.

1161
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,870
The more I kill...
the better off they'll be.

1162
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,350
You see? It's nicer than you think.

1163
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,270
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

1164
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,990
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

1165
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,310
You're not the only one
to enjoy a good murder.

1166
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,510
There's others out there just like you,
except you're just a man.

1167
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,150
And they're so much more than that.

1168
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,590
What do you mean...

1169
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,750
more than a man?

1170
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,790
An organisation... what?

1171
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,990
There's a name that no-one says.

1172
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,870
And I'm not going to say it either.

1173
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,670
Now, enough chatter.

1174
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,430
Time to choose.

1175
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:37,790
Sherlock!

1176
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,310
What if I don't choose either?
I could just walk out of here.

1177
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,230
You can take a 50:50 chance,

1178
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,270
or I can shoot you in the head.

1179
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,190
Funnily enough,

1180
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,190
no-one's ever gone for that option.

1181
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,350
I'll have the gun, please.

1182
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,990
Are you sure?

1183
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,670
Definitely. The gun.

1184
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,830
You don't want to phone a friend

1185
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,190
The gun.

1186
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,870
I know a real gun when I see one.

1187
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,030
- None of the others did.
- Clearly.

1188
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,430
Well, this has been very interesting.

1189
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,030
I look forward to the court case.

1190
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,830
Just before you go,
did you figure it out?

1191
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,350
Which one's the good bottle?

1192
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,590
Course. Child's play.

1193
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,870
Well, which one, then?

1194
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,750
Which one would you have picked?

1195
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,950
Just so I know whether
I could have beaten you.

1196
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,950
Come on!

1197
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,830
Play the game.

1198
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,750
Oh!

1199
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,150
Interesting.

1200
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,950
So what do you think?

1201
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,070
Shall we?

1202
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,070
Really... what do you think?

1203
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,710
Can you beat me?

1204
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,910
Are you clever enough...

1205
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,830
to bet your life?

1206
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,150
Sherlock!

1207
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,470
I bet you get bored, don't you?

1208
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,350
I know you do.

1209
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,150
A man like you. So clever.

1210
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:07,550
But what's the point of being clever
if you can't prove it?

1211
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,350
Still the addict.

1212
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,710
But this... this is what
you're really addicted to.

1213
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,030
You'll do anything...

1214
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,270
...anything at all,
to stop being bored.

1215
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,030
You're not bored now, are ya?

1216
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,270
Isn't it good?

1217
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,070
Was I right?

1218
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,830
I was, wasn't I?

1219
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,310
Did I get it right?

1220
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,070
OK... tell me this.

1221
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,790
Your sponsor. Who was it?

1222
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,870
The one who told you about me,
my fan.

1223
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,750
I want a name.

1224
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,270
No...

1225
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,430
You're dying,
but there's still time to hurt you.

1226
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,110
Give me... a name.

1227
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,630
A name! Now!

1228
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,790
The name!

1229
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,550
Moriarty!

1230
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,070
Why have I got this blanket?
They keep putting this blanket on me.

1231
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,790
- Yeah, it's for shock.
- I'm not in shock.

1232
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,590
Yeah, but some of the guys
want to take photographs.

1233
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,870
So, the shooter - no sign?

1234
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,390
Cleared off before we got here.

1235
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,030
But a guy like that
would have had enemies, I suppose.

1236
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,230
One of them could have been
following him, but...

1237
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,310
we've got nothing to go on.

1238
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,950
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1239
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,030
OK. Give me.

1240
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,030
The bullet they just dug
out of the wall's from a handgun.

1241
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,150
A kill shot over that distance,
from that kind of a weapon,

1242
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,590
that's a crack shot.
But not just a marksman, a fighter.

1243
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:22,230
His hands couldn't have shaken at all,
so clearly he's acclimatised to violence.

1244
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,110
He didn't fire until I was in immediate
danger, though, so strong moral principle.

1245
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,230
You're looking for a man probably
with a history of military service and...

1246
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,590
nerves of steel...

1247
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,830
Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.

1248
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,550
- Sorry?
- Ignore all of that.

1249
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,990
- It's just the, er... the shock talking.
- Where are you going?

1250
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,070
I just need to... talk about
the... the rent.

1251
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,670
- I've still got questions.
- Oh, what now?!

1252
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,510
I'm in shock - look, I've got a blanket.

1253
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,790
- Sherlock!
- And...

1254
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,830
I just caught you a serial killer...
more or less.

1255
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,870
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow.
Off you go.

1256
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:15,950
Erm... Sergeant Donovan's... just been
explaining... everything. Two pills...

1257
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,190
Dreadful business, isn't it? Dreadful.

1258
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,390
Good shot.

1259
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,670
Yes. Yes, must have been.
Through that window.

1260
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,630
Well, you'd know.

1261
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,030
Need to get the powder burns
out of your fingers.

1262
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,190
I don't suppose you'd serve time
for this, but let's avoid the court case.

1263
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,910
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course I'm all right.

1264
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,710
- Well, you have just killed a man.
- Yes, I...

1265
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,750
That's true, isn't it?

1266
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,070
But he wasn't a very nice man.

1267
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,430
- No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?
- Frankly, a bloody awful cabbie.

1268
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,390
That's true,
he was a bad cabbie.

1269
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,110
You should have seen the route
he took us to get here.

1270
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,910
Stop! We can't giggle,
it's a crime scene. Stop it.

1271
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,350
- You're the one who shot him.
- Keep your voice down!

1272
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,550
Sorry, it's just, erm... nerves, I think.

1273
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,910
Sorry.

1274
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,030
You were going to take that damn pill,
weren't you?

1275
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:13,190
Course I wasn't. Biding my time.
Knew you'd turn up.

1276
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,830
No, you didn't.

1277
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,630
That's how you get your kicks, isn't it?

1278
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,590
You risk your life to prove you're clever.

1279
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:21,590
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're an idiot.

1280
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,670
- Dinner?
- Starving.

1281
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,470
End of Baker Street, there's
a good Chinese. Stays open till two.

1282
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,030
You can tell a good Chinese
by the bottom third of the door handle.

1283
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,990
Sherlock... that's him, that's the man
I was talking to you about.

1284
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,550
I know exactly who that is.

1285
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,150
So... another case cracked.

1286
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,670
How very public-spirited.

1287
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,110
Though that's never really
your motivation, is it?

1288
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,710
What are you doing here?

1289
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,270
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

1290
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,670
Yes, I've been hearing
about your "concern".

1291
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,390
Always so aggressive.

1292
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:56,310
Did it never occur to you that
you and I belong on the same side?

1293
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,390
Oddly enough... no.

1294
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,470
We have more in common
than you'd like to believe.

1295
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,590
This petty feud between us
is simply childish. People will suffer.

1296
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:08,430
And you know how it always upset Mummy.

1297
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,150
I upset her?

1298
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,470
Me?

1299
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,830
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

1300
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,270
No. No, wait...

1301
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,630
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

1302
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,070
Mother. Our mother.

1303
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:24,750
This is my brother, Mycroft.
Putting on weight again?

1304
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,150
- Losing it, in fact.
- He's your brother?

1305
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,110
Course he's my brother.

1306
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,630
- So he's not...
- Not what?

1307
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:38,510
- I don't know... criminal mastermind?
- Close enough.

1308
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,830
For goodness' sake,

1309
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,110
I occupy a minor position
in the British Government.

1310
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,710
He is the British Government,

1311
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,030
when he's not too busy
being the British Secret Service

1312
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,710
or the CIA on a freelance basis.

1313
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,230
Good evening, Mycroft.
Try not to start a war before I get home -

1314
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,950
you know what it does for the traffic.

1315
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,150
So, when you say you're concerned
about him, you actually are concerned?

1316
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,750
Yes, of course.

1317
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,830
It actually is a childish feud?

1318
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,790
He's always been so resentful.

1319
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,710
You can imagine the Christmas dinners.

1320
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,390
Yeah...

1321
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,510
No... God, no.

1322
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,430
I'd better, erm... Hello again.

1323
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,790
- Hello.
- We met earlier on this evening.

1324
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,590
Oh!

1325
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,510
- OK. Good night.
- Good night, Dr Watson.

1326
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,070
- So, dim sum.
- Mmm!

1327
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:31,910
I can always predict the fortune cookies.

1328
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,390
- No, you can't.
- Almost can.

1329
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,590
You did get shot, though.

1330
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,750
- Sorry?
- In Afghanistan.

1331
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:36,990
There was an actual wound.

1332
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,390
- Oh. Yeah, shoulder.
- Shoulder! I thought so.

1333
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,070
- No, you didn't.
- The left one.

1334
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,670
- Lucky guess.
- I never guess.

1335
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,230
Yes, you do.

1336
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,870
- What are you so happy about?
- Moriarty.

1337
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,150
- What's Moriarty?
- I've absolutely no idea.

1338
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,350
Sir, shall we go?

1339
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,070
Interesting, that soldier fellow.

1340
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,870
He could be the making of my brother...

1341
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,590
or make him worse than ever.

1342
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,510
Either way, we'd better upgrade
their surveillance status.

1343
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,950
Grade 3 active.

1344
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,030
Sorry, sir - whose status?

1345
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,390
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.
