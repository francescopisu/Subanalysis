1
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,914
So, you know...
usual girl stuff.

2
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:58,917
She picks up the dry cleaning.
She does the food shopping.

3
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,420
By the way,
your dr. Melfi
has excellent taste.

4
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,423
She only shops at
the fancy- shmancy deli--

5
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:08,427
the kind with the italian name
but you can't find a fuckin'
meatball in the whole joint.

6
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:10,429
What else?

7
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,433
I don't even know what i'm
supposed to be lookin' for.
What's up with this cooze?

8
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:19,438
It's none of your fuckin'
business. You're on a strict
need- to- know, lieutenant.

9
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:22,941
I oughta knock the shit
outta ya for what you did
to her date last month.

10
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:26,445
What? I figure this girl
is somegoomahof yours,
so i scare him a little.

11
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:28,947
What's the big deal?

12
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,453
This guy
still come around?
No.
He's not her type.

13
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:38,457
I told ya, he's a coward.
He nearly pissed himself.

14
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:40,959
All right, anything else?
I don't wanna be here all day.

15
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,463
Yesterday--
yesterday she got off at 9:00
and she went to bed early.

16
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:48,467
That's it?
That's it.

17
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:52,971
Here.
Buy yourself an iron.

18
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,613
You ready?

19
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,618
Decaf, right?

20
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:15,627
So, how was your college trip
with your daughter?

21
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:18,130
Tell ya, my life,
it's like, uh,

22
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,632
episode of
provolone somethin'.

23
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:25,137
- What's goin' on?
- My wife. All we do is fight.

24
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:28,140
Can you believe it?
She's jealous of you.

25
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:33,011
Is that something that you feel,
or has there been some
discussion with carmela?

26
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,147
She didn't know
you were a girl.

27
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:38,650
You know, a woman.

28
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,154
Excuse me, a doctor.
Woman doctor.

29
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:45,657
Why did it take you
so long to tell her?
I didn't tell her.

30
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:48,410
You spilled the beans
when you called
to change the appointment.

31
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,031
Let me ask you a different
question. Why a female?
Why a female doctor?

32
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:55,417
You know, she asked
the same friggin' question.

33
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:57,920
I sometimes wonder myself.

34
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:00,789
And?
I'll tell you
what i told her.

35
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,793
Cusomano gave me a choice
between two jewish guys
and apaisanlike me.

36
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:08,297
- I picked thepaisan.
- What's the one thing
every woman--

37
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:11,300
your mother, your wife,
your daughter--
have in common?

38
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,937
- They all break my balls.
-

39
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:19,191
no, i know what you mean.
They're all italian. So what?

40
00:04:19,558 --> 00:04:23,061
So maybe by
coming clean with me,
you're dialoguing with them.

41
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:25,447
Let me ask you a question.

42
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:29,451
Why do you have me
as a patient?

43
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:34,456
Most legit people, they'd go a
hundred miles out of their way
not to make eye contact with me.

44
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:37,459
But you--
you didn't flinch.

45
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,642
The water's warm.
Come on in.

46
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:55,644
Hey, sammy.
How are you?

47
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:59,648
Just in time.
I was just gonna
make some coffee.

48
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,650
Yeah?
How's junior?

49
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:07,022
Sit the fuck down!
Down!

50
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:12,027
That's how junior is, sammy.

51
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:14,029
I'm with
little jimmy altieri.

52
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:17,032
Yeah? You payin' jimmy
for this game?

53
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:19,534
Huh, sammy?
No.

54
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:22,537
Are you payin'someone
for this game?

55
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:24,539
Huh?

56
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,174
Aah!

57
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:29,678
The party's over.

58
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:35,183
Junior soprano is the new boss
and he ain't respectin'
old arrangements.

59
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:38,186
You're lucky.
You stayed slim.

60
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:42,190
You can buy
right off the rack.

61
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,695
I wanted something special.
The boys are having
a little time for me.

62
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:49,815
You're wearin'
the suit to
the dinner, eh?

63
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,818
These guys today,
they want to be buried
in their joggin' outfit.

64
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,824
So how's your, uh--
what's your
oldest boy's name?

65
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:03,829
Rafaelle. Ralphie.
Yeah. Good kid.

66
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,832
Yeah.
He lost his son, you know.

67
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:10,969
- What do you mean, lost?
- Dead. Morte.

68
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:17,476
Ah, just a--
just a fucking kid.

69
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:19,594
A baby.

70
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:23,598
Oh, what are we
talkin' about here?
You lost your grandson?

71
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:26,852
What are you gonna do?
These fucking animals.

72
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:29,855
These--
these drug dealers.

73
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:32,240
The little kid used to run
around here breakin' balls.

74
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,495
Domonique.
My namesake.

75
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:40,365
Did you know about this?

76
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,502
See? What'd i say
about this fucking poison?

77
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:46,004
These kids
shouldn't touch it.

78
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:50,759
I read the paper every day
about these poor pricks
overdosin'.

79
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,514
He didn't overdose.
He killed himself.
Fourteen years old.

80
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:59,017
Jesus!
Was this at
patterson falls?

81
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:03,138
- Holy shit!
That was your grandson?
- Why?

82
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:05,640
The kid, he took one of those
designer drugs, right?

83
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:09,144
Goes to the falls,
takes a header
right off the fence.

84
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:13,148
They said the current whirled
so much that his head was
bashin' on the rocks for days...

85
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,901
before he even came up.

86
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:19,905
And meanwhile,
this piece of shit...

87
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:25,410
he gets to walk the streets
and sell more of this stuff
to young kids.

88
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,913
Oh, really?

89
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:30,415
What's this
motherless fuck's name?

90
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,423
Even the coffee's old in here.
How much complaining
can you do?

91
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,926
Eventually they find you
with a broken hip.

92
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:44,930
I want to make a gift of
a maganet. That's the only
way you'll get good coffee.

93
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,434
What are you wearing?
You smell like a frenchputa.

94
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,070
It's canoe.
Johnny wore canoe.

95
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:56,575
Morning, livia.
Oh, good morning.

96
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,577
Morning.
Hi.

97
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:00,946
New arrival?
Keep moving, fella.

98
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,586
I'm happy for you, junior.

99
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:11,590
I know how long you waited
to be made boss.

100
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,595
Just don't let certain people
take advantage of your good
nature like they did to johnny.

101
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,598
What certain people?
Nobody got over on johnny.

102
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,601
Nobody's gonna
get over on me.

103
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,604
How's your jewish friend?

104
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:30,108
- Hesh? What about him?
- Who ever heard of a jew
riding horses?

105
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:32,727
- He owns a horse farm.
- Aahh!

106
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:37,232
He's tony's friend, not mine.
What do you got
against him anyway?

107
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:40,235
Who, me? Nothing.

108
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:44,739
Johnny liked him, and my son
thinks that every word
that comes out of his mouth...

109
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,741
is pure gold.

110
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:52,247
Are you tellin' me that
since i'm the new boss
i should tax hesh?

111
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,252
Heh!

112
00:08:57,752 --> 00:09:01,756
Boy, anthony must've really
gotten under your collar.
Admit it.

113
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:04,759
You're lookin'
to crack hiscalione
for puttin' you in here.

114
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:07,896
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.
Yeah.

115
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:11,266
And i'm playin'
shortstop for the mets.

116
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,770
Oh, all right,
watch the balls!

117
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:30,285
What is the matter?

118
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:32,787
Tony's cannoli doesn't want
to stand up?

119
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:35,790
Tony's cannoli's tired.

120
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,293
But i can make it
happen, baby.

121
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:41,796
I know.
It's just, maybe--

122
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,801
so how's your job?

123
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,804
Huh?
Since when do you
care about my job?

124
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:52,307
Can't i be nice?

125
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:56,811
All right. Forget it.

126
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:59,314
Mmm.

127
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:02,067
Okay, you don't want to talk
about your job? Fine.

128
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:05,570
Here. Tell somebody
who gives a fuck.

129
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,075
I'm not a fucking whore!
Stick your money up your ass.

130
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:13,078
I don't know
what's wrong with you,
but don't take it out on me.

131
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:16,581
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with me! Just wanted
to talk, that's all.

132
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:19,584
For all the conversation
i get around here, i might
as well be a fuckin' dildo!

133
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:23,588
If you were a dildo,
we wouldn't be fighting.

134
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:27,475
What does that mean?
Huh, you fuckin' refugee?
What does that mean?

135
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:30,478
- Aah!
-

136
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:32,981
come here!

137
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:34,983
Knock you out,
you fuckin' communist cunt!

138
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:36,985
Hey, hey, hey!

139
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:42,991
Yeah, same to you!

140
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:45,994
You fuckin' burned me!

141
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:50,248
Angela.

142
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,753
What do you got, andrea?

143
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,013
Clabby?
Hearts.

144
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:09,017
Jump in,
the water's warm.
Child's play.

145
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:11,019
Pound a point.

146
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:17,525
Hesh is outside.
Tell him to come in.

147
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:21,029
He says he needs
a word with you.

148
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,032
What the fuck.
I've eaten more queens
than lancelot.

149
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,791
What's up?

150
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,793
Let's walk.
That serious?

151
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:39,297
You spoke to
your uncle lately?

152
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:42,300
Junior? Yeah.

153
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:45,804
No.
I don't know.
Why? What's up?

154
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,806
Your father was
a fair man, tony.

155
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:51,810
What's that got to do
with junior?
Junior's not so fair.

156
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,312
Sometimes i wish
you'd just get to
the fuckin' point.

157
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:56,314
What'd he do?

158
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,817
He's taxing me,
tony.

159
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:01,319
He's taxing you?
When did this happen?

160
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:04,322
Today.
Did you tell him you operated
for years without any tax?

161
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:07,325
That my father loved you
and respected you?

162
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:10,695
That ten cents
out of every dollar
that goes into his kick...

163
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:13,581
is directly related
to your shylock business?

164
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:18,086
My uncle's been boss of
the family ten fuckin' minutes,
already i gotagita.

165
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,705
What'd you tell him?
Told him the truth.

166
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:24,209
It's a reasonable request
but an unreasonable figure.
Back up a minute.

167
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:27,712
What do you mean,
"it's a reasonable request"?
He's the boss now.

168
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:31,716
He can call the tune, we all
dance to it. That's the way
it's always been done.

169
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:35,220
You can either respect
what's been done in the past
or change the rules.

170
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,724
Look, tony, the reason
i came over here was to tell you
with all this bullshit goin' on,

171
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:42,977
i don't know if i can
stay in this area.
Where you gonna go?

172
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:47,482
Hey, come on. I can sit on my
royalty checks. You forget
i wrote six gold records.

173
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:49,984
No, a couple of black kids
wrote six gold records.

174
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:52,987
You owned the company.
You gave yourself a co- writing
credit. Come on, hesh.

175
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:55,990
Besides, i know you.

176
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,493
You leave this action,
you're gonna kill yourself.

177
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:02,997
How much does he want?
Five hundred large,

178
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:06,000
plus two points monthly
on my shy.

179
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,505
Hm! All right.

180
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:13,508
Do me a favor.
Sit tight for now.

181
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,010
Let me think about it
for a while.

182
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,321
How was that, baby?

183
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,823
The best.

184
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:21,826
You are the best.

185
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:25,330
Come here.

186
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:30,335
Tony, i love your cannoli.

187
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,839
You okay?

188
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,841
Yeah, i'm okay.

189
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:39,344
Go back to your sleep.

190
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:46,100
Sure you're all right?

191
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:55,610
So, what do you want
new york to do?

192
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,112
First of all,
junior can't know
that we talked.

193
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:01,115
He's gotta think
hesh came to you
on his own by himself.

194
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:06,120
You are still
runnin' things.

195
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,625
Another thing,
the arrangement, whatever it is,
can't be insulting to my uncle.

196
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,127
Hesh's gotta pay
somethin',

197
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:15,129
i just haven't
decided what.

198
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:24,138
I gotta get back.
We'll talk later.

199
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:32,146
How's the veal?

200
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:35,650
It's like rubber.
Yeah?

201
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:43,658
Tastes all right to me.
Want somethin' else?

202
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:47,211
No.

203
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:02,093
Hm.
Don't look at me.

204
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,595
Compliments of johnny sack.

205
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:13,237
Maybe you'd like to spend
the rest of our anniversary
with him.

206
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:17,742
I was over there for
ten friggin' minutes, carmela.
Don't do this.

207
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:21,746
All right, tony.
At least i know
where i stand.

208
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,252
Why you always gotta be
so dramatic, huh?

209
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:30,254
Here we go.
Huh!

210
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:33,257
All right, i'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:36,260
You don't even know what
you're apologizing for.

212
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:40,765
It's our anniversary, tony.
Ours.

213
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:44,769
Not yours, mine
and johnny fuckin' sacks'.
Ours.

214
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:48,272
Here i was thinkin' maybe we
could get a room at the plaza
like last year, or--

215
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:50,274
i don't know.
I do--

216
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,786
i'm sorry, carmela.

217
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,288
Huh?

218
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:08,292
I just got a lot on my mind,
and i'm not thinkin' straight.

219
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:14,298
Hey. I'm sorry.

220
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:22,306
Should i call the plaza?
Come on.

221
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,928
Nah, let's go home.

222
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:40,942
Hey, come here.

223
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:44,445
Carmela, what do you
want me to say?
I'm lost at sea here.

224
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:48,950
You've changed, tony,
and i resent it.

225
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,454
I resent it because it's
destroying what little
self- esteem i have left.

226
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:57,458
I swear, sometimes i think
you skeeve me.
I skeeve you?

227
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,461
You're the mother
of my children.
How the fuck did i skeeve you?

228
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:02,964
You see what
i'm talkin' about?
Right there.

229
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:04,966
"You're the mother
of my children."

230
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:08,970
I feel like i'm just
someone you've chosen
to procreate with.

231
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,973
You knew this might happen
with the prozac.

232
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:13,975
Ginny torrelli's
been on it for years
and she'd hump a fire hydrant...

233
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:17,478
if it could make a pass at her.
Dr. Melfi told me it affects
different people different ways.

234
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:19,981
Oh. She told you that?

235
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:39,000
I think before we start
today's session,

236
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,502
we need to address
the coffee situation.

237
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:45,506
It's not appropriate
of me to take gifts.

238
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:50,011
- It's a cup of coffee.
- Let's just make a rule, okay?
No gifts.

239
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:55,016
This mean i can't
drink mine?

240
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,018
No, no.

241
00:18:57,018 --> 00:19:01,022
I'm sorry. I usually have
my answering service on
when i have a patient,

242
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,524
but i have
a car emergency.

243
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:05,526
Yes?

244
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:09,030
What does that mean,
"diagnostic"?

245
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:13,534
I just wanna know
what's wrong with my car.

246
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,420
No.
No, don't do anything.

247
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,923
No, i want to get
a second opinion.

248
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:23,928
I'll-- i'll take my chances.
Thank you.

249
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,933
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

250
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:30,935
It's all right.

251
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:33,938
So...how's it goin'?

252
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,941
Good. Real good.

253
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,444
As a matter of fact,
i think i may flush
the medication.

254
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:43,948
You know? See if the changes
i'm feelin' are for real.

255
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:47,068
Why would you do that?
The prozac seems to be working.

256
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:51,455
Well, that might be the problem.
It might be workin'
a little overtime.

257
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,457
What do you mean?

258
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:55,459
Umm--

259
00:19:56,961 --> 00:20:00,331
- i'm havin' a, uh--
- reaction?

260
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:02,967
You know.
A side effect from the stuff.

261
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,336
We talked about that
when you started.

262
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:08,472
Some people get insomnia;

263
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,842
others a stomach ache
or headaches.

264
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:17,481
- But it usually passes.
- Are there any other side
effects that you know of?

265
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:20,851
Some people experience
a diminished libido.

266
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:25,239
- They have a hard time
getting or maintaining a--
- bingo.

267
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:27,742
I see.
Mm.

268
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:30,745
You know, not all impotence
is a result of the medication.

269
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,247
You sayin' there's
somethin' wrong with me?

270
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,249
When's the last time
you had a prostate exam?

271
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:38,119
Hey, i don't even let anybody
wag their finger in myface!

272
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:44,008
I'm sorry,
i shouldn't have laughed!

273
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:46,510
- Don't apologize.
- Oh, boy.

274
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:50,264
- You got a nice laugh.
- All right, let's be serious.

275
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:53,267
Hey, i'm serious.

276
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:59,774
You know that depression
is also a leading factor
in impotence.

277
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:04,278
When you awaken in the morning
or in the middle of the night,
do you ever have an erection?

278
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:10,034
- You could set your clock to it.
- Okay, so we know it's not
a physical problem.

279
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,795
Let's put that in
after the credenza.
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:24,799
You wanna tell me
what's goin' on?

281
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,802
I bought some furniture.

282
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:30,304
Why don't we just
move into roche bobois?
Save the delivery charge.

283
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:32,807
Fine.
I'll send it back.

284
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:34,809
No, but you've been spendin'
like a drunken sailor
all last week.

285
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:37,311
I said
i'll send it back.

286
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:39,814
Mother of christ, carmela,
i didn't say that, did i?

287
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:41,816
Jesus.

288
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:44,986
All due respect to new york,

289
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:47,488
i don't think you should be
tellin' my uncle
how to run things.

290
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:49,490
You think i got the balls
to drive in from new york...

291
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,493
and tell your uncle
how he should run
his family?

292
00:21:52,493 --> 00:21:57,999
I shouldn't expect to see
the statue of liberty again
if i did that, huh?

293
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:01,252
- All right, look, tony. -

294
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:05,256
hesh isn't only
a friend of you guys.
He's a friend of ours.

295
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:10,261
Somebody has to step in
so he doesn't get fucked.
I never said fucked.

296
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:13,381
And you.
Frankly, i'm a little hurt.
You should've come to me first.

297
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:16,767
- Airin' your dirty laundry
in public.
- Junior knew how i felt.

298
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:19,270
How would it look if i went
to you after i spoke to him?
He's got a point.

299
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:25,893
Bottom line is,
what're we gonna do about this?

300
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:32,533
Somethin' tells me you
have a suggestion.

301
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,904
Junior,
if there're any flies on you,
they're payin' fuckin' rent.

302
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:44,161
Five hundred is a little steep
for back taxes, no?

303
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:47,415
As far as two percent
of his action,
that's up to you to settle.

304
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:51,802
After all, that affects tony
as much as hesh.

305
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,422
I'm not out to hurt anyone.

306
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:57,925
God forbid i get in the way
of someone earning.

307
00:22:58,426 --> 00:23:01,429
Let's say one and a half
on the shy business
and 300 on the back tax.

308
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:04,432
Two fifty.

309
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:11,939
What'd i tell ya? Hold onto
your cock when you negotiate
with these desert people.

310
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:17,445
Two fifty.

311
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:19,580
All right.

312
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,972
Mr. Soprano.

313
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,734
You want sex?
No.

314
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:01,372
Go back to sleep.

315
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:16,887
You know, you have a nice body.
You ought to make it
work for you more.

316
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:20,891
Oh, really?
You reveal too much.

317
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:23,894
You don't want other men
looking at me?

318
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:26,013
No.
When you're not with me
you do what you want.

319
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:31,018
But i'm sayin' maybe
you could wear a nice,
businesslike outfit.

320
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:33,404
I think i could
get into that.

321
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:35,406
You want me to dress
like a man?
No.

322
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:38,776
No, you fuckin' wack- a- doo,
i don't want you to dress
like a man.

323
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:42,780
I'm just sayin',
maybe wear somethin'
a little more professional.

324
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,417
You know,
like you're in business.
Fuck you. I'm no whore.

325
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:50,921
No. That's not what i mean.
Not like you're in
the whore business.

326
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:52,923
Oh, forget it.

327
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,795
Come here.

328
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:04,685
Is everybody in my life
bananas or what?

329
00:25:07,188 --> 00:25:09,440
Get over here!

330
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:13,944
Come here.
Go jerk off.

331
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:16,447
Yeah.
Go jerk off.

332
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:18,949
Look at this.
She burned me.

333
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:21,452
That's not good.

334
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:23,454
What led up to that?

335
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:27,324
Carmela can be
pretty violent sometimes.

336
00:25:27,324 --> 00:25:30,327
This added problem
that i've been havin'
that we talked about--

337
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:34,331
i just thought that maybe
we needed to spice things up
a little bit. You know?

338
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:36,834
If it's not the prozac,

339
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:40,337
then maybe i just needed
a little jump start.

340
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:43,340
So i suggest to her that maybe
she dress a little differently.

341
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,845
Something titillating.
Yeah.
You know, maybe it'd help.

342
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:50,848
So i suggested to her--

343
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,850
not demanded--

344
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,852
suggested--

345
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:57,855
you know, maybe dress
a little sexier.

346
00:25:57,855 --> 00:26:00,357
But carmela
can be very sensitive.

347
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:03,360
Maybe she felt
it degraded her.

348
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,863
Not all women
are into sexy lingerie.

349
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:08,365
I'm not talkin' about
dressin' like that.

350
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,868
Then what are we
talking about?

351
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:14,371
Some women are sexier
when they dress simple.

352
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:16,373
You know, understated.

353
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,877
I don't mean--

354
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,883
fuck it.
I don't know what i mean.

355
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:31,388
Like you.

356
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:33,390
How like me?

357
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,392
You play it down.

358
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:43,901
Now, it's obvious you got
a killer body under there.
Don't get me wrong.

359
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:45,903
All right.

360
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,405
Not only do you
play it down,

361
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,409
but you're gentle.

362
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,912
Not loud.

363
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:56,914
Sweet sounding...

364
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,418
like a mandolin.

365
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:08,425
Anthony--

366
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,936
it's unfortunate that
we have to stop now,

367
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,939
because i think
it's really important
we talk about this.

368
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:25,943
Do you think you could
come back later
this afternoon?

369
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,945
No.

370
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:33,450
Till tuesday.

371
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:37,454
Okay?

372
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:44,461
Yeah, all right.

373
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:46,463
See you tuesday.

374
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:14,124
Oh, motherfucker!

375
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:18,128
Ow.

376
00:28:18,128 --> 00:28:20,130
Shit!

377
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:55,866
It's the oddest thing.
I've had this problem for weeks,

378
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:59,870
but this morning i get in
and it starts right up.

379
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,373
- And then again at the deli.
- Uh, looks fine.

380
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:06,376
Are you sure?
I was told i need a new starter.

381
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:12,382
Lady, as much as
i might wish to rob you...

382
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:14,885
even i wouldn't try to replace
a new starter with another.

383
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:20,274
- What do you mean "new"?
- New. It has everything but
the price tag hanging from it.

384
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:29,316
Come on, mikey!
I didn't do nothin'!

385
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:31,819
Poor kid
committed suicide
up here'cause of you.

386
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,705
You fuckin' know me!
Yeah, i know ya.

387
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:41,578
Now listen to me.
I'm gonna give ya a break.

388
00:29:41,578 --> 00:29:44,581
When i toss ya over--
no!

389
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:48,585
If you can fly
i won't shoot you down.
Deal?

390
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:51,472
No!
Son of a bitch.

391
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:18,749
My goodness.

392
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,751
What happened here?

393
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:28,759
It's some sad shit.
Motherfucker said he didn't
want to live no more.

394
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,761
He jumped.

395
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:39,636
How much he give you?

396
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:56,036
I thought i was the only one
junior could make look
like that.

397
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:02,910
All right.
Let me hear it.

398
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:07,414
Rusty irish.
What about him?

399
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:11,919
He took a header off the falls.
That's the closest that
junkie fuck ever got to a bath.

400
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,422
I got news for you.
That junkie fuck
was my biggest earner.

401
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:18,926
During the football season
he moved more cards
than ten guys put together.

402
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:22,062
And another thing.
A certain friend of ours
should've checked with me...

403
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:25,315
before he did a favor
for the old man capri.

404
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:29,186
You're losin' me.
Irish was the one who sold
capri's grandson that shit.

405
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:31,822
I think you created
a fuckin' frankenstein
in junior.

406
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:34,324
I created?

407
00:31:34,324 --> 00:31:36,827
We all agreed to let
junior have his day.

408
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:40,831
Let him be the lightning rod.
When lightning strikes, god
forbid, and somebody goes down,

409
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,333
it's not a young man
with a family, remember?

410
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:46,837
- We all agreed.
- Yeah, but who expected
to get raped?

411
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:51,208
When jackie was acting boss no
one minded, 'cause it all evened
out at the end of the day.

412
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,211
But your uncle-- marone!
Doesheeat alone.

413
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:57,214
He doesn't even
pass the salt.
Heh heh.

414
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:59,216
What about that
sammy grigio card game?

415
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:02,219
That fuckin' mikey
smacked him around.
That ain't right.

416
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:05,222
Come on, jimmy.
Even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

417
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:08,725
Junior was right.
He had a position.
That game wasn't payin' anybody.

418
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:13,230
The minute sammy grigio used
jimmy's name, it should've
been end of story.

419
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,734
- That's right.
-

420
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:21,238
what do you want me to do?
We made our bed. We sleep
in it. We're all men.

421
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:24,241
But how long we gonna
continue to kick upstairs
without it hurtin'?

422
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:27,244
I mean something, anything,
should trickle down over here,
no?

423
00:32:27,494 --> 00:32:32,883
All we want you to do
is talk to him.
After all, he's your uncle.

424
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:35,636
- Come on.
- That's right.

425
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:51,151
Who is it?
It's me, ma.

426
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:53,654
Who?
Anthony.

427
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:57,157
Open the door.

428
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:04,164
I thought you were
the activities lady.
Hey.

429
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:06,166
She's a real pain
in the ass.

430
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:10,170
Playing bingo,
livia?
Not tonight,
honey.

431
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,673
You know, she's a
degenerate gambler.

432
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:15,175
Uh, millie?
Millie?

433
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:17,177
Hmm?
My son.

434
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:20,681
Handsome.

435
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,692
So how's it goin'?

436
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:34,194
Oh, what can i say?

437
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:36,196
Hey, this is great.

438
00:33:36,697 --> 00:33:39,700
The only thing that's missin'
is that broken readin' lamp
you had by the phone.

439
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,202
I got it downstairs.
I can bring it if you want.

440
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:44,705
Shh, shh, shh.
Listen.

441
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:47,708
Oh, she's
driving me crazy.
Who?

442
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:51,211
Next door!
There it is again.

443
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:53,213
Oh!

444
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:56,717
That's enough water!
How much water
does she need?

445
00:33:57,217 --> 00:34:01,722
She runs
the water all day.
Water, water, water!

446
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:05,726
I'm livin' next door
to gunga din!

447
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:09,229
I went down to ferrara's.
I got you some biscotti.
Almonds?

448
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:11,732
Yeah.
All right.
Leave'em there.

449
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:15,235
I'll take'em
downstairs later
for my coffee.

450
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,745
Uncle jun been by?
Oh...once in a while.

451
00:34:24,745 --> 00:34:27,247
It makes him
uncomfortable here.

452
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:31,752
He's got a lot on his mind.
More responsibilities
means more headaches.

453
00:34:31,752 --> 00:34:35,255
Better men than him
had to work hard.
Yeah.

454
00:34:35,255 --> 00:34:41,261
He'll be all right...
long as he remembers
who his friends are.

455
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:46,767
I'd just hate to see him mess
this up. He's been waitin'
a long time for the big chair.

456
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:51,772
What do you mean?
It's not a business that
forgives bad decisions.

457
00:34:51,772 --> 00:34:54,775
I hate to see him making
wrong moves, you know?

458
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:58,278
Especially at the start
of the game.
Why're you tellin' me?

459
00:34:58,278 --> 00:35:02,282
- Tell him.
- Ma...you got his ear.

460
00:35:02,282 --> 00:35:04,284
He listens to you.

461
00:35:04,284 --> 00:35:06,286
I don't know that world.

462
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:08,789
No, of course not.

463
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:12,292
But if anything, you know,
were to come up--
that's all.

464
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,795
I don't want
to get involved.

465
00:35:14,795 --> 00:35:18,799
If you have something
to say to your uncle
then bring it up to him.

466
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,669
Oh, i wish the lord
would take me.

467
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,172
Come on, ma.

468
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:29,676
There's probably plenty of gents
in this place that want a date
with a lovely woman like you.

469
00:35:30,177 --> 00:35:32,679
Look, i'm goin'
downstairs...

470
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,183
before that
activities lady finds me.

471
00:35:36,683 --> 00:35:38,185
You want coffee?

472
00:35:38,685 --> 00:35:40,687
Yeah, all right.
Bring my cookies!

473
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:44,191
Carmela, i don't
want to sound like...

474
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:46,693
religion is a cure- all,

475
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:49,696
but i think if tony
got more involved
with the church...

476
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:53,700
it may help to expedite
things in his therapy.

477
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,204
What's killing me
is this is
a self- inflicted wound.

478
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:58,705
I pushed for it.

479
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:03,343
I could deal with thegoomahs.
I knew i was better than them.

480
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:07,848
As stupid as it sounds,
i viewed them as a form
of masturbation for him.

481
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:11,351
I couldn't give him
what he needed all the time.

482
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:14,354
You're a man, father.
You know that thirst.

483
00:36:16,356 --> 00:36:19,860
I was too busy with
the house and kids
to quench it.

484
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:27,367
But the psychiatrist--
you know, she's not
just agoomah.

485
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:30,370
For the first time i feel
like he's really cheating...

486
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,874
and i'm the one
who's thirsty.

487
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:37,377
I'm not gonna stay in
a marriage that's made--
shh. Shh.

488
00:36:37,377 --> 00:36:40,380
Let's not even
think about that.

489
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,382
Divorce is for the weak,

490
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:45,886
for people who never
intended on dying married
in the first place.

491
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:51,391
You know, carm,
we reap what we sow.

492
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:54,394
What do you mean?

493
00:36:54,394 --> 00:36:59,399
You admit to accepting
his dalliances in the past.
They meant nothing to tony.

494
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:04,771
But you said
it was like they were
lightening the workload,

495
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:08,775
providing a wife's duty
when you were too busy
with the kids and the house.

496
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:10,777
You practically
welcomed it.

497
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,533
I want you to pray
to our holy mother.

498
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:20,537
Ask her for guidance
and forgiveness...

499
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:23,540
so that you can get
through this as a couple.

500
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:29,045
You're not without sin
in this, carmela.

501
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:35,769
She's outta control.
She's spendin' money like we're
the sopranos of park avenue.

502
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:39,272
But you've noticed her,
which may have been
the point.

503
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:45,278
Look, before we
run out of time,

504
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:50,150
i'd like to discuss
what happened when
we were here last week.

505
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:55,405
How's your car?

506
00:37:57,407 --> 00:38:00,293
Did you steal my car
and have it fixed?

507
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:04,798
We had an agreement:
No gifts.

508
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:07,300
I didn't want
to see you get robbed.

509
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:12,422
It was you.
You had no right
to steal my car.

510
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:17,427
- I've been scared to death.
- Why?

511
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:21,064
It's a violation of my privacy.
What else have you done?

512
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:26,686
Answer me.

513
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:31,191
I love you.

514
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:33,693
Anthony--
i'm in love with you.

515
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:37,697
I'm sorry.
That's just the way it is.

516
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:41,201
Okay, let me talk.
No.
It's not the prozac.

517
00:38:44,204 --> 00:38:46,206
I dream about you.

518
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:48,708
I think about you
all the time.

519
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,211
I can't get excited
about any other women.

520
00:38:52,712 --> 00:38:54,714
There's nothing else
to say.

521
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:59,719
I love you.
Let me start here.

522
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:04,724
I know this may be
very hard for you
to swallow,

523
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:08,228
but you're only feeling
this way because we've
made such progress.

524
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:11,231
What?
I've been gentle.
That's my job.

525
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:15,735
I listen.
That's what i do best.

526
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:19,239
I've been a broad, generic
sympathetic woman to you,

527
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:22,242
because that's what
this work calls for.

528
00:39:24,244 --> 00:39:28,748
You've made me all of
the things you feel are
missing in your wife...

529
00:39:28,748 --> 00:39:31,251
and in your mother.

530
00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:42,762
You're makin' me out to be
some fuckin' mama's boy.

531
00:39:43,263 --> 00:39:47,267
I'm a man...
and you're a woman.

532
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:49,269
End of story.

533
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:55,275
And this crap about freud
and every boy wanting to have
sex with his mother--

534
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:57,277
that's not gonna fly here.

535
00:39:57,277 --> 00:40:00,280
I didn't say that.

536
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,782
I want to make sure we
understand each other.

537
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:05,785
Yeah, we understand
each other.

538
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:10,290
You don't love me.

539
00:40:14,794 --> 00:40:17,297
You don't want me to come
back any more, fine.

540
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:19,799
It's quite the opposite.

541
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:23,303
This is all a byproduct
of progress.

542
00:40:23,303 --> 00:40:25,305
Has someone been
following me?

543
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,310
Okay, forget it.

544
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,812
I'll see you next week.

545
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:45,074
All right! Let's go!

546
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:47,076
Move it!
Remember when you
used to tell me--

547
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:52,081
i always thought you could make
the pros. You coulda done it.
You had a swing like joe di.

548
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:55,585
You're crazy.
What, you think
i'm shittin' you?

549
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:59,088
Yeah, i could barely
hit. 250.
That's because
you didn't want it.

550
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:03,476
Too busy chasin' skirt.
Chasin' skirt,
your average was. 500.

551
00:41:03,977 --> 00:41:06,479
- Yeah, what happened?
- So what is it you want
to talk about?

552
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:12,986
Octavian.
You know, augustus.

553
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:17,490
You fuckin' with me?
No.
Octavian became augustus.

554
00:41:19,993 --> 00:41:22,495
Forget about that.
Bottom line:

555
00:41:22,495 --> 00:41:25,999
Augustus was a caesar--
and everybody loved him,
right?

556
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:30,003
You know why?
I don't know
that i give a fuck.

557
00:41:30,003 --> 00:41:33,006
Everybody loved him
'cause he never ate alone.

558
00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:37,510
Capisci?
It was the longest time
of peace in rome's history.

559
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,514
He was a fair leader,
and all his people
loved him for that.

560
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:45,518
This the one that they
stabbed in the back?
No, that was julius.

561
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:50,523
I'm talkin' about augustus.
He shared his wealth,
and all his people loved him.

562
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:55,778
You said that three fuckin'
times. I heard it."his people
loved him." what's your point?

563
00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:02,285
Remember the story you told me
about the father bull
talkin' to the son?

564
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:05,788
They're up on this hill.
They're lookin' down
on a bunch of cows.

565
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:08,291
The son goes to the father,

566
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,793
"dad, why don't we run
down there and fuck
one of these cows?"

567
00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:13,546
You remember what
the father said?

568
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:17,550
Father says,
"son, why don't we walk down
there and fuck'em all?"

569
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,053
I told you that?
Yeah!

570
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:22,555
Why don't we
fuck'em all!

571
00:42:22,555 --> 00:42:25,058
That's funny.

572
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:28,561
Okay, i get your point.
Why don't you just
come out with it...

573
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:32,065
instead of all this
augustus- octavian shit?
I don't know.

574
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:36,069
Are you okay?
You been actin'
mesamortelately.

575
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:39,072
I ain't seen
a long face like that
since you were a kid.

576
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:44,077
I'm okay. It's just,
uh...bullshit stuff.
Don't worry about it.

577
00:42:44,077 --> 00:42:48,081
You sure?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm okay.

578
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:55,705
Junior took the 250
you gave him and whacked it up
amongst the top five guys.

579
00:42:55,705 --> 00:42:58,207
You know, so he doesn't
look greedy.
Smart move.

580
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:01,210
Yeah.
Your uncle may turn out
to be another harry truman.

581
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,213
What's that mean?
Truman had a big job
thrust upon him.

582
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:07,216
He didn't want it,
but in the end he made
some pretty wise decisions.

583
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:11,220
So who knows?
Your uncle may turn out to be
the right man for the job.

584
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,225
I fuckin' hope so,
'cause i'll tell you right now,
i don't want the fuckin' job.

585
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:19,228
Let junior die
from the stress.

586
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:22,231
It's what gave
jackie the cancer,
god rest his soul.

587
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:24,734
"Boss."
Fuck it.
Who needs it?

588
00:43:35,495 --> 00:43:37,997
- It's nice here.
- I can't stand the smell.

589
00:43:37,997 --> 00:43:40,500
Shit, flies all over
the place.

590
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,504
But i could stand here for hours
and watch'em run around.
There's a kind of beauty to it.

591
00:43:45,004 --> 00:43:48,007
I envy them.
I wouldn't go that far.

592
00:43:48,007 --> 00:43:51,511
I would.
They got no bills,
no headaches,

593
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:53,513
no familycazies
runnin' around.

594
00:43:53,513 --> 00:43:56,516
One horse likes another horse,
they go up to each other,
they fuck. That's it.

595
00:43:56,516 --> 00:44:00,520
No problems,
no hundred questions,
no guilt.

596
00:44:03,022 --> 00:44:05,525
I don't know what the fuck
i'm talkin' about.

597
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:09,028
So junior whacked up my money
and spread it around, huh?

598
00:44:09,028 --> 00:44:10,530
Yeah.

599
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:14,167
Five bosses, 50 a pop.
Not a bad day's pay.

600
00:44:16,169 --> 00:44:18,671
Still, i wish it
wasn't your money.

601
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:21,424
You know, it makes me
feel terrible.

602
00:44:24,293 --> 00:44:26,429
What?

603
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:32,935
You old fuckin' jew.
Here's my share.

604
00:44:32,935 --> 00:44:35,938
You think i'm gonna
profit off your tax?

605
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:41,060
Never entered my mind.

606
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:04,217
Dr. Melfi--
there's nothin' there,
you know.

607
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:06,719
You don't have to
explain nothin',
tony.

608
00:45:09,222 --> 00:45:11,224
This psychiatry shit--

609
00:45:11,724 --> 00:45:14,227
apparently, what you're feelin'
is not what you're feelin',

610
00:45:14,227 --> 00:45:17,230
and what you're not feelin'
is your real agenda.

611
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,363
You're gonna stick with it,
right?
I don't know.

612
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:36,866
Think you should.

613
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:39,869
You do?
Uh- huh.

614
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:44,874
I was jealous.
I should've told you--

615
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:46,876
no, wait.
Let me finish, tony.

616
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:51,380
I've been thinkin'
a lot about this.

617
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:56,886
I was jealous of her ability
to help you--

618
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:01,390
to be a sort of
salvation to you.

619
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,893
I talked to father phil,
and...

620
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:07,897
i wanna be that woman
in your life.

621
00:46:14,904 --> 00:46:18,407
Carm, you aren't just
in my life.

622
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:20,409
You are my life.

623
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:27,416
Come here.

624
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:46,819
Okay, i'm no good
at speeches.

625
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:49,939
Yeah,
you owe him a fuckin' dime,
you'll hear some great speeches.

626
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:53,326
- Shut up. Let me talk. -

627
00:46:53,326 --> 00:46:55,828
go ahead, talk.
I was only kiddin'. Go ahead.

628
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:58,698
I'd like everybody
to raise their glasses.

629
00:47:08,591 --> 00:47:11,594
Okay, uh--

630
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:15,598
he taught me
as much as anybody,
'cept for maybe my father.

631
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,102
Even if he wasn't my uncle,

632
00:47:20,603 --> 00:47:23,606
i'd be
standin' here sayin'...

633
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:27,109
- to our new boss, salud.
-

634
00:47:29,896 --> 00:47:32,532
to junior.

635
00:47:32,532 --> 00:47:34,283
Junior.

636
00:47:36,035 --> 00:47:37,637
To junior.

637
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:40,740
Salud.
