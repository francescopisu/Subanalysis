1
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:57,749
How'd it go?
They got a 48- to- 52
male- female ratio,

2
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,751
which is great,

3
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:02,754
strong liberal arts program
and this cool
olin arts center for music.

4
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:05,257
Usual programs abroad
are china, india--

5
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:07,759
you're just applyin' here.
Already you're leavin'?

6
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,762
It's an option, dad.
Junior year.

7
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:14,766
What do you study
in india? How not
to get diarrhea?

8
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:18,270
They don't require sat scores,
but mine will help
'cause they're high.

9
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,272
Socially, i don't know.

10
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:22,274
This one girl told me
there's a saying:

11
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:25,277
"Bates is the world's
most expensive form
of contraception."
Hey.

12
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:29,781
What kind of talk is that?
The girls at the other colleges
we been to, they just put out?

13
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:32,668
Oh, my god.

14
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,172
It's pretty, huh?

15
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:39,675
Yeah.

16
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:42,044
Two to go.
Colby up.

17
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:46,048
Dad, how come
you didn't finish college?

18
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:49,551
Well, i had that
semester and a half
at seton hall.

19
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:51,553
Yeah, and?

20
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,057
Your grandma and grandpa
didn't stress college.

21
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:57,192
They were
working- class people.

22
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:59,695
How come your parents
were anti- education?

23
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:03,815
They weren't anti.
You can't lay it
all off on them.

24
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,819
I got into
a little trouble
when i was a kid.

25
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,821
I heard.
Mm- hmm.
You did?

26
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:12,457
While in waterville,
dine at the stone house,

27
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:15,460
serving the freshest
maine lobster since 1840.

28
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,963
Come see our new salad bar,
featuring a wonderful--

29
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:33,979
are you
in the mafia?

30
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,232
- Am i in the what?
- Whatever you wanna call it.
Organized crime.

31
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,853
That's total crap.
Who told you that?

32
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,855
Dad, i've lived in the house
all my life.

33
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:47,359
I've seen police come with
warrants. I've seen you going
out at 3:00 in the morning.

34
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,363
You never seen doc cusamano
go out at 3:00 in the morning
on a call?

35
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:54,116
Did the cusamano kids ever find
$50, 000 in krugerrands...

36
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:57,119
and a. 45 automatic while they
were hunting for easter eggs?

37
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:01,123
I'm in the waste management
business. Everybody immediately
assumes you're mobbed- up.

38
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:03,625
It's a stereotype,
and it's offensive.

39
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,128
And you're the last person
i would want to perpetuate it.

40
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:09,131
Fine.

41
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:12,634
There is no mafia.

42
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,279
All right, look.

43
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,282
Med, you're a grown woman,
almost.

44
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:32,287
Some of my money...

45
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:35,290
comes from illegal gambling
and wha-- and whatnot.

46
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:44,549
How does that make you feel?

47
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:48,053
At least you don't keep
denying it, like mom.

48
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:50,555
Kids in school think
it's actually kind of neat.

49
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:53,175
- They seen
the godfather, right?
- Not really. Casinowe like.

50
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,177
Sharon stone,
'70s clothes, pills.

51
00:04:55,677 --> 00:04:58,814
I'm not askin' about those bums.
I'm askin' about you.

52
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:02,067
Sometimes i wish
you were like other dads.

53
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:05,570
Then, like mr. Scangarelo,
for example.

54
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,573
An advertising executive
for big tobacco.

55
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:11,827
Or lawyers? Ugh.
So many dads are full of shit.

56
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:14,830
- And i'm not?
- You finally told
the truth about this.

57
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:25,590
Look, med,
part of my income comes
from legitimate businesses.

58
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,959
- Stock market, i--
- look, dad, please. Okay?

59
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,462
Don't start
mealy- mouthing.

60
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:38,970
How's my sweetheart?

61
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,973
I'm so pissed
i can hardly see.

62
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:46,111
- Why? You gettin' the flu?
- No, it's my cousin, svetlana.

63
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:49,231
- The amputee?
- Two months
she's only in america,

64
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:51,233
and she's already
getting married.

65
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:54,986
You knew the deal. I got
two kids high school age.
We talked about this.

66
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,622
Yes, and a wife
whenever you want.

67
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:59,624
What do i have in my life?

68
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:04,246
- Boy, am i glad i called.
- Fuck you, then! Hang up!

69
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:06,381
How are the whirlpool jets?
They get'em in right?

70
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:10,001
Don't throw up in my face
things you buy me, okay?

71
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:13,388
Her prosthetic leg
fell off in a gap store,

72
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:16,391
and he carries her out
like a knight...

73
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,894
in white satin armor.

74
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:22,397
I gotta go.
Uh, my daughter's comin'.

75
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,768
Jesus.

76
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:35,911
Yeah. How ya feelin'?

77
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:38,914
Oh, better, actually.
Fever just broke.

78
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:40,916
I miss you two.

79
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,418
How's the interviews
going?
Good.

80
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:46,037
Real good.
Oh, yeah?
Did she like bates?

81
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,541
Anything to get her
off of this berkeley kick.

82
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,543
What the fuck?

83
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,680
Tony?

84
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:58,683
Yeah, yeah.
Look, i'll call you back
from the motel.

85
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:17,319
Meadow! Come on!

86
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,214
Come on.
Get in.
Okay, okay!
What's the rush?

87
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:34,219
Geez, dad!

88
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:44,095
- What's going on?
- I think i saw
an old friend, that's all.

89
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:48,099
- You know that guy
at the gas station?
- Maybe not.

90
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,485
- Probably not.
- Then what?

91
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,104
Dad, slow down!

92
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:59,995
Dad, jesus,
what's with you?

93
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,746
- It's all right.
-
fucking maniac!

94
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,749
- What's going on? -

95
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:06,868
just foolin' around.

96
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:13,875
Dad-- colby. Turn.

97
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,378
Colby. Turn left.
It's to the left!

98
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,513
Left!

99
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:21,016
Dad!

100
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:23,018
See? That's'cause you're
talkin' to me so much.

101
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,894
Hey, this gets us
toward colby anyhow.

102
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,034
Dad, that's our motel.

103
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:41,653
Hello. Our motel's
right there.

104
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:50,045
- Do you know that guy?
- Nah. It wasn't him.

105
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:03,425
Bada- bing.

106
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:06,928
- Take this number down
and call me back.
- Now? It's pourin' down here.

107
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:09,431
207- 555- 0185.

108
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:14,569
Mmm. Bonjour.

109
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,072
Room service
et arrivee.

110
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:19,074
Oop.

111
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:24,079
Why, thank you,
kind sir.

112
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,586
- What? You said
poached eggs. -

113
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:35,590
you're not gonna eat'em now,
after all that work.

114
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:39,094
I guess my eyes
were bigger
than my stomach.

115
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:49,604
Anthony, why don't you
go over to jason's,
play nintendo?

116
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:54,859
Nope. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No kisses. Cooties.

117
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,861
I'll be back
in, like, an hour.

118
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:58,980
Okay.

119
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,628
Oh, motherfucker.

120
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,632
A real fuckin' shit.

121
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:24,506
Hey. I'm not sure,
but i think i just saw
fabian petrulio.

122
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:27,008
Refresh my memory.
Was he before your time?

123
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:31,012
Made guy. Flipped about
ten years ago when he
got busted for peddlin' "h."

124
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:34,649
Rat fuck
took out a lot of people,
a lot of people from our outfit.

125
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,652
My old man was sick.
He never recovered
when he heard the news.

126
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:40,655
- You saw this guy?
- That's what i'm sayin'.

127
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:44,159
- I think i did,
but i'm not sure.
- Up in maine? What the fuck?

128
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,661
He went into
the witness protection program.
Then they kicked him out.

129
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:49,664
Now he goes to colleges and
gets paid all kinds of money...

130
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,666
to talk about what
a big, bad mafioso he was.

131
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,169
- Piece of shit.
- Febbie and me partied
a couple of times,

132
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,171
but jackie aprile
knew him good.

133
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,173
They did a couple of counts
together up in lewisburg.

134
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:01,176
You know that bust that was
in his rec room of sinatra?

135
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,678
Febbie made it for him
in a prison workshop.

136
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:07,048
That was frank, that bust?
I always thought
it was shaquille.

137
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:10,051
Fucker needs to practice
a little on lips.

138
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:13,304
Yeah, i know. Anyway,
run these plates for me.

139
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:17,308
Go ahead.
Maine,

140
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:20,945
d- x- 6- 6- 9- 2- 0.
Call you back tonight
at 10:00. all right?

141
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,951
Hey.
What's wrong
with the phone in your room?

142
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:30,955
Nothin'. Takin' a walk,
saw the phone. Figured i'd
give christopher a call.

143
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:33,458
Oh, yeah?
Everything okay?
Yeah.

144
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,461
Yeah. They got a leak
in the roof, though.
Is that all right?

145
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,963
Uh- huh.
Huh?

146
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,303
Who is it?
Father phil.

147
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:47,305
Just a second.

148
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,808
Oh, jesus.

149
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,450
Oh, my god.
Look at you!

150
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,952
Oy!
I hope i'm not
barging in.

151
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:19,954
Oh, no, i was,
uh, watching tv.

152
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:21,956
Oh. I was over
at the clothing drive,

153
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:23,958
and i thought
you were up in maine.

154
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,461
Oh.
By the way,
your marchino
pedal pusher suit,

155
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:28,463
it just
flew out of there.

156
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:30,465
Oh, good, good, good.

157
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:32,467
So anyway, jean cusamano
said you were ill.

158
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,470
Yes, i was. The flu
that was going around?

159
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,474
Yipes.
Yeah. I still have
a little fever, but, uh--

160
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:41,976
i also have
a confession
to make, carm.

161
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:44,479
Uh--

162
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:48,983
i- i have a jones
for your baked ziti.

163
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:51,986
Oh.
Sure. Any time.

164
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:53,988
I have some in the freezer.
I can reheat it.

165
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:57,492
It's so much better that way,
isn't it? The mozzarella
gets all nice and chewy.

166
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,994
I like that too.
I was having
a little fernet.
Yeah.

167
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:03,998
- Settles the system.
Would you like something?
- Some wine, if it's open.

168
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:07,502
Mm- hmm.
So, how's med and
tony's trip going?

169
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:12,390
I should know? He doesn't have
time to talk to me for two
lousy minutes.
Oh, geez.

170
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:20,398
Dad, stop staring.
Why are you doing that?

171
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,902
It's an exciting time.

172
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:28,907
I can't tell you
how proud i am of you.
A real student at casa soprano.

173
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:31,910
And she looks like
one of the models right out
of italianvogue.

174
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,413
Italian, italian, italian.
Thank you.

175
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:38,917
You're definitely
up to something.

176
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,419
Oof! How'd you get
so cynical?

177
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:50,178
That stuff
we talked about before.

178
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:54,182
- How's that sittin' with you?
- Like i wasn't 90% sure
already.

179
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:57,685
- What about your brother?
Does he know?
- I think so.

180
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:01,189
There was a time
when the italian people...

181
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:04,192
didn't have
a lot of options.

182
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:07,195
You mean like mario cuomo?

183
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:10,198
Sorry.

184
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,202
You know, i put food
on the table.

185
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:17,205
My father was in it.
My uncle was in it.

186
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:20,208
Maybe i was too lazy
to think for myself--

187
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:24,212
consider myself a...rebel.

188
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:27,715
Maybe being a rebel in my family
would have been sellin'
patio furniture on route 22.

189
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:33,221
In college,
nothing interested you?

190
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:36,224
Nah, i barely got in.

191
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:39,227
Well,
kind of liked history.

192
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:41,229
Yeah?
Yeah.

193
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:43,731
Napoleon,
the roman empire.

194
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:46,234
The potsdam conference--
that kind of thing.

195
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:49,737
- What's the potsdam conference?
- Pots- damned if i know now.

196
00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:51,739
Oh, my god.

197
00:14:56,744 --> 00:14:59,747
Dad, i have something
to tell you.

198
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:01,749
Yeah?

199
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:07,755
- You're not--
- no! Jesus!

200
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,264
A couple of weeks ago,
me and some friends,
we were doing speed.

201
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:19,267
- We did kind of a lot
of it for a while.
- You what?

202
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,769
It was just between
homework and sats...

203
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,772
and just general
pressure of life.

204
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:27,275
- We needed something
to keep going.
- That crap'll kill you.

205
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:30,278
- I know.
- I oughta slap the shit outta
you. Where did you get it?

206
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,781
If i thought
this was gonna be a lecture,
i never would have told you.

207
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:37,785
Take a reality check. What do
you think i'm gonna say?
Where did you get it?

208
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:41,289
No way i'm telling you,
especially after this reaction.

209
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:44,292
Why did you tell me?

210
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:49,297
You were honest with me today.
I won't be doing it again.
It got too scary.

211
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:52,300
Jesus, right under my nose.

212
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:55,803
You think you'd know.

213
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:57,805
No, dad, you won't.

214
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:07,815
I'm glad you told me,
in spite of everything.

215
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:10,818
I'm glad i did too.

216
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,820
I'm glad we have
that kind of relationship.

217
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:23,197
Tony hates
building fires.

218
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:25,199
We have
this beautiful fireplace,
and those same three logs...

219
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,201
have been in there
since lincoln split them.

220
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:30,705
Fear of fire.
Good deterrent
to keep out of hell.

221
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:34,208
Maybe there is hope for him.

222
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,095
Oh. I got something for you.

223
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:39,097
That's what
we were talking about.

224
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,599
The chapter on buddhism
is spectacular,

225
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:44,102
but i don't want you going
over to those zany zennies.

226
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:48,606
Fat chance. It's funny.
I could never just sit on
the floor and think of nothing.

227
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,109
- Thank you.
- Sure.

228
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:55,613
You'll see how islam
has gotten a bad rap
in current culture, and--

229
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:59,984
boy, this chianti, though,
is beyond reproach.

230
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:02,236
- Word up.
-

231
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:09,744
dad.
Thought you fell in.

232
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:14,248
This is carrie
and lucinda.
How ya doin'?

233
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:17,251
- They go to colby.
- Yeah? Why don't you
hang out with them?

234
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:20,755
- Dad.
- What better way to learn
about the college?

235
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:23,257
Yeah, maybe, but--

236
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:26,260
no, no,
that'd be cool.
Please excuse him.

237
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,763
No, really.
We love to dish
the school.

238
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:31,265
- Well--
- go ahead.

239
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:33,768
Okay.
Now, med,
no drinkin'.

240
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:36,771
Girls, you see
that she sticks
to cokes.

241
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:40,274
I'll come back for you
in an hour and a half.
Be good.

242
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:48,783
Yo.
What do you got?

243
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:50,785
- Wet shoes.
- You chose this life.

244
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:53,287
You don't want
to work in the rain,
try out for the yankees.

245
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,790
The car is registered
to fredrick peters,

246
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,793
38 washington street,
waterville, maine.

247
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:01,796
It's off route 201.
I looked it up.

248
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:05,800
Fredrick peters.
Fabian petrulio.
Good match, huh?

249
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,687
I guess. I don't know.
T, what are you gonna do?

250
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,190
I don't know.

251
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,193
I got meadow here.
Jesus.

252
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:18,696
Fuckin' nightmare. You want,
i'll fly up and take care of it.

253
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:21,699
You're a good kid.
You stay put.

254
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,702
- Maybe call pussy or paulie.
- What, they can do it,
but i can't?

255
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:28,206
Don't be sensitive. They had
a friend, jimmy, die in prison
on account of this scumbag.

256
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:32,710
- All right, i'll let'em know.
- Fuck, i gotta do my homework
and positively i. D. This guy.

257
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,714
- I thought you said it was him.
- I haven't seen him in
12 years. I gotta make sure.

258
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,717
All right, i'll call you
around midnight. Sit tight.

259
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:49,727
You think
i'm a schnorrer,
don't you?

260
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,730
A who?
Yiddish.

261
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,234
It means somebody
who always shows up
in time for free grub.

262
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,736
Well, you're here a lot.

263
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:01,239
And you're a man.
You like to eat.

264
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,743
I can't get over you
with that yiddish.

265
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:08,746
Oh, that's, uh--
my neighborhood
in yonkers was mixed.

266
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,748
Jewish and italian,
you know?

267
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:12,750
Eh, a heady brew.

268
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,752
What does that mean,
"heady"?

269
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:17,255
Mmm. Melting pot.

270
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,757
Some vigor.
Oh.

271
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:27,765
Hello.
Hello.
I'm calling for tony soprano.

272
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,768
Cajun stuffed olives?
Who can i say
is calling?

273
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:34,272
- This is dr. Melfi.
- His nurse?

274
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:37,275
No. Is--
is this mrs. Soprano?

275
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,277
Uh, that's right.
And you are again?

276
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:41,279
Jennifer melfi.
Dr. Melfi?

277
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,282
Jennifer.
Lovely name.

278
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:49,787
No, he's not home.
Could i impose
on you to, uh,

279
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:52,790
to tell him that
i need to reschedule
monday's appointment.

280
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,793
- I'm down with the flu.
- Does he have your number?

281
00:19:55,793 --> 00:20:00,298
- Let me give it to you in case.
- I lost my pencil, up his ass.

282
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,300
I'll tell him
you called.

283
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,810
Why does he have to lie?

284
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,314
Why couldn't he tell me
his therapist is a woman?
What is he hiding?

285
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:19,817
- Maybe he did tell you, and you
didn't hear him clearly.
- Oh, please.

286
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:23,321
Here's your fernet.
Why wouldn't he tell me,
unless he's screwing her.

287
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,823
Carmela, please.

288
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,326
And i thought
he was changing.

289
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:32,330
I thought therapy was gonna
clear up the fuckin' freak show
in his head.

290
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,334
Carmela. I'm sure
you're wrong about them.

291
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,836
Therapy is a start.

292
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:42,340
It's a good start,
but, yes, it doesn't
fix the soul.

293
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,843
He's gonna need help
from other sources
to repair that.

294
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:48,346
Well, then you
talk to him.
You help him.

295
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,348
But, well,
there you go.

296
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:52,850
W- will he listen?

297
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,973
He must be
a very unhappy man.
He's unhappy!

298
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:01,475
Sleep is my number one--
aw, shit.

299
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:05,980
Why go into it?

300
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:26,417
Good thing
it's full of air bubbles.

301
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:30,421
- Mommy?
- Yes, bear?

302
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:33,424
Would you put me to bed?
I'm scared.

303
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:36,427
- Sure, honey. Hold on.
- I thought
she was sleeping.

304
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,930
Yeah, well, she woke up.
Daddy's gonna come too,
sweetie.

305
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,316
We'll both
put you to bed.

306
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:45,936
Hurry, daddy.
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:22:19,053 --> 00:22:22,056
These red pepper flakes
really make all the difference.

308
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:24,058
Mm. Spicy.

309
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:26,060
Good as willem dafoe was,

310
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,063
i cannot picture
that jesus looked like him.

311
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:31,949
Could you
pass the cheese?

312
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:33,951
Not that he didn't do
a good job, willem dafoe,

313
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:35,953
but the story's
confusing.

314
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:38,456
So he gets down
offthe cross?

315
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,958
Mm.

316
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,461
You know, originally,
bobby d. Was supposed
to have that role?

317
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,963
Really?
Oof.
Mm- hmm.

318
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:48,466
- Different picture.
- Oh, totally.

319
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,970
You talkin' to me, pilate?

320
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:58,342
You must be talkin' to me,
'cause i don't see nobody else
here, except barabbas here.

321
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:00,344
You know
what's remarkable?

322
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:03,347
If you take everything
jesus ever said,

323
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:05,850
add it up, it only amounts
to two hours of talk.

324
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,352
No.
Mm- hmm.

325
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:11,355
No, but wait.
I heard the same thing
about the beatles.

326
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:14,859
Except it was
if you add up all their songs,
it only comes to ten hours.

327
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,864
Yes.

328
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:25,369
Of course, it wasn't
just what christ said.
It was his deeds.

329
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,872
See, that's my question.

330
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:31,876
I understand what he did,
but a lot of what he said,
i don't get.

331
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:35,379
Like,"the sun rises on the just
and the unjust alike"?

332
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:39,884
Why?
Because. Christ was
saying that we're all--

333
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:42,636
that whores will go to heaven
before a lot of the righteous?

334
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:44,638
Uh- huh.
That's
not right.

335
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:48,142
Let's face it, father.
We got some major
contradictions here.

336
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:53,647
- It's about love.
Think about it like that.
- What does that mean?

337
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:58,152
It means,
hopefully, someday,

338
00:23:58,152 --> 00:24:00,654
we will learn to tolerate,

339
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:04,158
accept and forgive
those that are different.

340
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:10,047
Change through love.

341
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:20,057
Well.

342
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:22,676
Well-- oh, man,
i better get going.

343
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:24,812
Where you going?
You just got here.

344
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:26,814
It's getting late.

345
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:29,316
But it's pourin' rain out.

346
00:24:29,316 --> 00:24:32,820
And i know
you love that dvd player.
I gotremains of the day.

347
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:35,940
Hmm.
See?
Do i know you?

348
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,443
Anything with
emma thompson, i'm there.

349
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,579
Father phil,
i didn't know you looked.

350
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:43,697
What?

351
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:47,201
To take in through the eyes
a beautiful woman?

352
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:51,705
Is that so different
than a sunset, a douglas fir,

353
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:54,458
or any of god's
handiwork?

354
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:47,645
Hey, fred.
Hey, tanky.
What do you say?

355
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:50,147
You gonna give away
any homemade cheese
this year?

356
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:53,150
For what they get
for cream, i don't know.

357
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,152
Listen, tank,
anybody been lookin'
for me...

358
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:57,154
or askin'
any questions
about me?

359
00:25:57,154 --> 00:26:00,157
Big guy.
New york sounding?
Is there a problem?

360
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:05,663
No, no. Nah, dipshit
hit me with his boat while
i was tubin' on caribou lake.

361
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:08,666
Claims it was
my fault.

362
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:11,168
If he shows up,
you want me
to give you a call?

363
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:13,671
Yeah, i wouldn't mind.
Do that. Thanks.

364
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:24,181
You ready?
Yeah. Let's go.

365
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:20,104
No one was asking
for you, fred.

366
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:22,106
All right, vitus.
Thanks.

367
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,620
Hello, rat.

368
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:48,409
Please leave me alone,
miss kenton.

369
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:50,911
Why won't you
show me your book?

370
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:53,914
This is my private time.
You're invading it.

371
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:55,916
Oh, is that so?
Yes.

372
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:59,420
I'm invading
your private time, am i?
Yes.

373
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,791
What's in that book?
Come on. Let me see.

374
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:07,795
Or are you protecting me?
Is that what you're doing?

375
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:11,048
Would i be shocked?

376
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:15,552
Would it ruin
my character?

377
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:19,056
Let me see it.

378
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:42,463
Father, turn it off.
I can't handle it.

379
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:45,466
What?

380
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:48,469
What is it?
Oh, father,
i'm a terrible person.

381
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:50,471
Oh, no.

382
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:54,475
You're a wonderful woman.

383
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:57,978
Oh, it's been
building in me.
I need to get it out.

384
00:29:57,978 --> 00:30:00,981
There's so much in me,
i wanna-- i wanna--

385
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:03,484
carmela,
if i can help.

386
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:05,486
Please.

387
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,491
How?

388
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:18,999
How long has it been
since you last confessed?

389
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,003
Uh-- uh--
i, uh--

390
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:26,006
if you like,
i can do this with you.

391
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,511
You mean right here,
father? Now?

392
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:33,514
The whole world
is god's house.

393
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:35,516
He hears and sees
everything.

394
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:03,544
Forgive me, father,
for i have sinned.

395
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:07,548
It has been four weeks
since my last confess--

396
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:11,552
what am i
talkin' about?
That's a lie.

397
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:14,555
I haven't
truly confessed
in tw- twenty years.

398
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,310
Go on.

399
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,313
I have forsaken...

400
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:29,319
what is right...
for what is easy,

401
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:36,326
allowing what
i know is evil
in my house;

402
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:40,831
allowing my children--

403
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:43,834
oh, my god,
my sweet children--
to be a part of it...

404
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:46,787
because i
wanted things
for them.

405
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,173
Wanted a better life,
good schools.

406
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:53,176
I wanted this house.

407
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:57,180
Wanted money in my hands--
money to buy anything
i ever wanted.

408
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,300
I'm so ashamed.

409
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:10,811
My husband.

410
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:15,816
I think he has committed
hor- horrible acts.

411
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:21,705
I think he has-- you know
all about him, father phil.

412
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:24,708
I'm the same.
I've said nothing.
I've done nothing about it.

413
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,712
I got a bad feeling.

414
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:33,717
It's just a matter of time
before god compensates me...

415
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:36,720
with outrage
for my sins.

416
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:55,105
All right, come on.

417
00:32:57,607 --> 00:33:00,110
Oh, tequila breath.

418
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,112
Whew!
Sorry, dad.

419
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:04,614
It's all right, kiddo.
Just hang onto me.

420
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:06,616
Don't throw up
on that dress,

421
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,618
or i'll have to tell
your mother everything.

422
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:11,121
This guy was giving me
tequila shooters.

423
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:17,627
Oh-- oh, god,
everything is spinning.

424
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:20,597
You're not mad,
are you, daddy?

425
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:22,599
Little bit.
Where are the keys?

426
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,469
- I gave them to you.
-

427
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:28,221
i love you, dad.
- I know.

428
00:33:39,232 --> 00:33:41,651
You must
truly repent,

429
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:44,021
genuinely
and honestly.

430
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:48,742
And in the future,
you must renounce
all these actions,

431
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:50,627
and then god
will absolve you.

432
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:56,633
I don't know, father.
I'll try.

433
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:00,637
But i still love him.

434
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:04,091
I still believe
he can be a good man.

435
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:07,978
Then you help change him
into a better man,

436
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:10,981
and then you will have
done good in god's eyes.

437
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:17,154
I think you should
take communion.

438
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:20,657
Yeah.

439
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:37,674
Why do you
have that with you?

440
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:40,677
Unfortunately i had
to say mass for someone
in intensive care.

441
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:50,937
Lord, i am not worthy
to receive thee.

442
00:34:50,937 --> 00:34:52,939
But just say the word,

443
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:55,442
and i will be healed.
And i will
be healed.

444
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:17,831
This is
the body of christ.

445
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:19,833
It was broken
for you.

446
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:35,599
This is
the blood of christ.

447
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,567
It was shed for you.

448
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,461
Accept the spirit of christ,
our lord and savior.

449
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:06,463
Amen.

450
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:09,466
In the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit.

451
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:13,470
Amen.

452
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:34,241
Dad?

453
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:37,244
I booked a seat on
a boston flight, tomorrow, 4:00.

454
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:40,247
- Best i could get.
- Don't come.

455
00:36:40,747 --> 00:36:43,250
I'll make sure you
and meadow clear the state
before anything happens.

456
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,752
We don't ever meet
face to face.
This is my thing.

457
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:50,390
I am your soldier, antonio.
This is my duty, like we're
always talkin' about.

458
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,894
The way this went down,
this is my call.

459
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:55,896
I gotta vouch
for this myself.

460
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:59,399
Clippin' a famous rat
would put me a cunt hair away
from bein' made.

461
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,902
He might have recognized me
at the gas station.
He could lam anytime.

462
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:07,908
You stay put.
End of discussion.

463
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:12,913
Why are you using
the pay phone again?

464
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:15,415
These walls are
like paper. I didn't
want to wake you up.

465
00:37:15,415 --> 00:37:18,418
Dad, please don't lie
to me.
Let's go back
to bed.

466
00:37:18,418 --> 00:37:20,420
Lying down
made me throw up.

467
00:37:49,816 --> 00:37:51,818
Hello.

468
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:54,821
Oh, hi, honey.

469
00:37:56,323 --> 00:37:58,325
Oh, yeah.
Was it fun?

470
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:01,828
Oh, good.

471
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:07,334
Oh, you-- you wanna
sleep over there?

472
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:13,340
Okay. Love you.

473
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:39,366
That was a. J.

474
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:42,369
He's sleepin' over.
Oh, i see.

475
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:48,375
He's at
a friend's house.

476
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,877
Oh.

477
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,882
The pucillos.
I don't know
if you know them.

478
00:38:57,884 --> 00:38:59,886
No, i--

479
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,391
oh.

480
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:08,395
Oh-- oh, i--
what?

481
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:11,031
Oh!
Are you all right?

482
00:39:23,543 --> 00:39:25,045
Father phil?

483
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:27,547
Are you
all right?

484
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:53,656
Hello.

485
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:56,159
Hello?

486
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:35,615
Ow! Don't!

487
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:40,620
Wanna stop and get
a beer? Huh?

488
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,489
No?

489
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:31,671
I'll pick you up
in a little while.
You knock'em dead.

490
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:34,874
- Aren't you coming in?
- No, i left my watch
at the motel.

491
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,377
I'll catch up
to you later.

492
00:41:37,627 --> 00:41:40,513
Grab me a student paper.

493
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,562
You should have
some coffee.

494
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:35,568
Last night--
yep.

495
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,073
We didn't
do anything
out of line?

496
00:42:40,073 --> 00:42:42,575
There's nothing
to apologize about.

497
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:46,579
Right.
That's right.

498
00:42:49,082 --> 00:42:53,086
I should
get dressed,
get goin'.

499
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:55,088
Anthony junior
will be home soon.

500
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:59,592
Oh, my god. My car's
been out there all night
in plain sight.

501
00:42:59,592 --> 00:43:02,095
If we didn't do anything wrong,
we didn't do anything wrong.

502
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:04,597
Is there a commandment
against eating ziti?

503
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,102
It's okay.
Take a shower,
get dressed.

504
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:12,105
Don't forget
your sacrament kit,
whatever.

505
00:43:13,606 --> 00:43:16,609
I'm home!

506
00:43:21,614 --> 00:43:23,866
Carmela.

507
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:27,870
I don't know
where to begin.

508
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:35,878
It's-- it's not
that i don't have desire
for you in my heart.

509
00:43:35,878 --> 00:43:38,381
Marrone, father, please.
But last night...

510
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:41,384
was one of
the most difficult tests
from god ever for me.

511
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:43,886
What are you
talkin' about?
We're friends.

512
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:49,392
What's that look about?
What, i look some way?

513
00:43:54,897 --> 00:43:58,267
I was just thinkin'
about when we watched
casablancalast week.

514
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:01,270
That new print
is great, huh?

515
00:44:02,772 --> 00:44:04,273
You know when bogie says,

516
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:07,777
"of all the lousy gin joints
in the world, why'd she
have to pick mine?"

517
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:11,781
Of all thefinukpriests
in the world,

518
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:14,283
why did i have to get
the one who's straight?

519
00:44:16,285 --> 00:44:18,421
Carmela--

520
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:20,923
come on. It's a joke.

521
00:44:41,944 --> 00:44:45,448
I would have done it
myself last night,
but some people came along.

522
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:48,951
But anyway,
it's a gray town car, new model.

523
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:51,454
You pick'em up
on the colby campus.
Stay on'em.

524
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:53,456
Where on
the colby campus?

525
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:56,459
What'd i just say?
His kid's applyin'.
The fuckin' admissions office.

526
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:58,961
Oh. Okay.
You follow'em.

527
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:01,330
An hour outta town,
you pull up alongside--

528
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,332
- boom! Twelve- gauge.
- Fuck that.

529
00:45:03,332 --> 00:45:07,837
Do what i ask,
or you'll never get
another bag off me.

530
00:45:11,724 --> 00:45:15,595
No, no. Fuck that.
Fuck that!

531
00:45:15,595 --> 00:45:18,598
You want the cops
to find out who burnt down
the historical house?

532
00:45:18,598 --> 00:45:21,601
Fuck you,
fuck- wad!

533
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:24,604
We were volunteer firemen
together, asshole! I know!

534
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:37,366
Yeah, is dougy in?

535
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,116
Good mornin', rat.
Who are you?
What is this?

536
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:37,370
Don't make me laugh.
You pimp! You fuck!

537
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,374
- Teddy, there must be
something we can do--
- tony. It's tony, you fuck.

538
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:45,378
You know how much trouble
you're in now? You took
an oath, and you broke it!

539
00:47:45,378 --> 00:47:48,381
I could've
killed you last night,
outside the motel.

540
00:47:48,381 --> 00:47:51,884
Your daughter was drunk,
remember? I was there
in the parking lot.

541
00:47:51,884 --> 00:47:53,886
I had a gun,
but i didn't do it.

542
00:47:53,886 --> 00:47:56,505
Because of her,
i told myself,
"it's just a coincidence.

543
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:59,508
He's takin'
his little girl to college."

544
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:02,762
One thing about us wiseguys,
the hustle never ends.

545
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:05,765
You shot me at that motel,
your life would've been
flushed down thepiscia- do!

546
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:07,650
Please, tony, i'm begging!

547
00:48:10,653 --> 00:48:13,272
Jimmy says hello
from hell, you fuck!

548
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:48,451
Where have you been?
I went back
to the motel,

549
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:50,453
they didn't have the watch.

550
00:49:50,953 --> 00:49:53,956
So i went to the restaurant.
They was closed. I had
to wait for them to open.

551
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:57,843
Restaurant had your watch?
I took it off in the bathroom
when i was washing my hands.

552
00:49:58,844 --> 00:50:01,714
You ready?
Don't wanna be late
for bowdoin.

553
00:50:16,395 --> 00:50:19,148
Dad, what's up with that?

554
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,652
Oh, uh,
the restaurant.

555
00:50:24,653 --> 00:50:27,656
I tried the back door.
There were puddles.

556
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,162
It was dumb.
I know.

557
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:42,671
Your hand is bleeding.
Dad, where did you go?
You saw that man, didn't you?

558
00:50:42,671 --> 00:50:46,675
I cut it on a screen door.
What man?

559
00:50:46,675 --> 00:50:49,562
The man you said
you didn't know.

560
00:50:49,562 --> 00:50:51,564
Ah, va a napoli.
What do you think
happened?

561
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:54,066
I don't know.
You got in a fight?
You don't know.

562
00:50:54,066 --> 00:50:56,569
You're makin'
a big deal outta this,
and you don't know.

563
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:59,071
You were on the pay phone
again last night
at 1:00 in the morning.

564
00:50:59,071 --> 00:51:02,074
I was on the pay phone
at 1:00 in the morning?

565
00:51:02,074 --> 00:51:04,076
Excuse me,
miss cuervo anejo.

566
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:08,581
You can't be trusted to remember
what happened last night, 'cause
you were seeing pink elephants.

567
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:11,200
I warned you not to drink.

568
00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:19,208
Dad, you're being honest
with me, right?

569
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:22,962
Pretty soon here
you're gonna start
hurtin' my feelings.

570
00:51:22,962 --> 00:51:26,348
- We have that kind
of relationship, you said.
- That's right.

571
00:51:26,348 --> 00:51:30,352
We do or we don't.
Takes two to tango.

572
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:34,857
- Dad--
- what?

573
00:51:40,479 --> 00:51:42,481
Nothing.

574
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:52,491
I love you.

575
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:54,994
I love you too.

576
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:02,001
Where's my paper?

577
00:52:02,251 --> 00:52:04,253
I forgot.
She forgot.

578
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,262
Miss soprano,
come on in.

579
00:52:16,765 --> 00:52:19,902
Shall we talk
about your future?

580
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:12,288
Oh, here they are,
the two ivy leaguers.

581
00:53:12,288 --> 00:53:14,790
Mwah! How was it?
Do you's want something to eat?

582
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,792
It was good.
I gotta call hunter.

583
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:19,295
Hey.

584
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:22,298
Gee, she spared me
no boring detail.

585
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:25,301
I'll be back.
What a trip.

586
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:28,304
I'm beat.
What, new england?
It's so gorgeous.

587
00:53:28,304 --> 00:53:32,808
Hmm. You still sound
a little nasal,
but you look better.

588
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:36,178
Any cold pasta?
There was some ziti,
but it all got eaten.

589
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:40,683
The whole tray?
From last sunday?

590
00:53:42,184 --> 00:53:44,603
Monsignor jughead was here.

591
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:47,606
If you are referring
to father intintola,
yes, he was.

592
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:49,608
Hmm.

593
00:53:49,608 --> 00:53:52,611
He spent
the night here.
Yeah, right.

594
00:53:53,612 --> 00:53:55,614
Okay.

595
00:53:58,117 --> 00:54:01,620
- The priest spent the night
here. What happened?
- Nothing.

596
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:05,507
- Where was anthony?
- He was sleeping over
at jason's.

597
00:54:05,624 --> 00:54:08,127
The priest spent the night here,

598
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,130
nothin' happened, and you're
tellin' me this because--

599
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:16,018
you might hear something,
take it the wrong way.
His car was out front all night.

600
00:54:16,518 --> 00:54:20,522
You know what?
This is too fucked up
for me even to think about.

601
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:29,531
What'd you guys do
for 12 hours? Play,
uh,"name that pope"?

602
00:54:30,532 --> 00:54:33,535
He gave me
communion.

603
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:36,288
- Oh, i'll bet
he gave you communion.
- Excuse me?

604
00:54:36,288 --> 00:54:40,292
The guy spends the night
here with you, and all
he does is slip you a wafer?

605
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:42,795
That's verging on sacrilege.

606
00:54:42,795 --> 00:54:45,164
- Oh, i didn't mean to verge.
- You think i'm lying?

607
00:54:45,297 --> 00:54:47,800
I don't know,
but the whole thing sounds--

608
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,302
would i have told you about it
voluntarily if there had been
anything to be ashamed of?

609
00:54:50,302 --> 00:54:53,305
Do i look like
the friggin' thornbird
over here?

610
00:54:53,305 --> 00:54:56,308
He's a fag. That's it.

611
00:54:56,308 --> 00:54:58,811
'Cause otherwise,
i gotta question
what i'm hearin' here.

612
00:55:00,312 --> 00:55:02,815
Oh, tony, you are a sketch.

613
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,321
Oh, by the way,
your therapist called.

614
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:13,826
Jennifer?

615
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:18,947
Carm.

616
00:55:19,948 --> 00:55:21,950
I just thought you'd
think it was weird...

617
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:24,203
if i saw a woman psychiatrist,
that's all.

618
00:55:25,704 --> 00:55:29,708
Carm, come on!
It's just therapy, that's all.
We just talk!

619
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,086
