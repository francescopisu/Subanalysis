1
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:01,753
You gonna say somethin'
or what?

2
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:04,256
It's your time.

3
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:11,647
- What's he doin' here?
-

4
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,016
a friend of mine
just walked right by.

5
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:16,902
Heshie. He has a 3:00.

6
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,922
Yeah.

7
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:41,426
Yeah, baby.

8
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:55,807
Oh, yeah.

9
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:58,810
What the hell's goin' on?

10
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,812
Thunderstorms.

11
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:07,569
- Jackie?
- You smell it? That's rain.

12
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:12,457
Dr. Melfi, what the hell
you doin' to me?

13
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:25,220
Go back to sleep.

14
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:46,241
What are you doin' up?
You got school tomorrow.

15
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:49,244
Workin' on a high score.
Did your mother
go to bed?

16
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:52,748
Yeah. Where were you?

17
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:56,001
Yeah. Compactor went down
at barone sanitation.

18
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:02,007
Move over.

19
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,012
Ready?
Yeah.

20
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:10,015
Go. Watch out
for the ghosts.

21
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:13,018
Whoa!

22
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:15,520
This thing ain't
steerin' right.

23
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,522
Yeah, kickin' your butt.

24
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:20,525
So how things goin' with you?

25
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:25,030
How's school?

26
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:35,791
Dad, you have
to concentrate. New game.

27
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,297
Hey, no fair.
It's called a handicap.

28
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:46,168
- Come on. Stop. Stop.
- Kickin' your ass now.

29
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:48,804
One hand. Look at that.
I can't see. Ha, ha.

30
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:56,928
Get off! Ow!
Stop! Come on!

31
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:03,935
You lose.
Focus through distractions.

32
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:07,939
There's a lesson for ya.
I want you in bed in 10 minutes.

33
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:13,328
Andretti, you listenin' to me?

34
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:16,832
Good night, dad.
Good night.

35
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:20,452
Dr. Nathan, please
return to e. R. Bay five.

36
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:24,956
Where'd you park?
In the parking lot.

37
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:28,460
No one followed me.
Adriana, you wouldn't
know it if they did.

38
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,964
Oh, yeah, like tony soprano's
hidin' in my backseat.
You are so paranoid.

39
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:38,470
Bring the car right here.
I know. He's in disguise.

40
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:43,358
That could be him. Hey, tony!
Or maybe he's in the trash can.

41
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:46,361
Come out, come out,
wherever you are. Ow!

42
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,864
Let go of me!

43
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:52,868
It could be anybody anytime.
I don't even know if
it's tony who's after me.

44
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:55,871
Christopher,
you gave crystal meth
to hisdaughter.

45
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:59,241
Which i'm not sure he knows.
Look at my wrist.
It's all red.

46
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:02,127
I'm sorry! I am sorry!

47
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:06,882
But i got dragged out
to the fuckin' meadowlands
by my neck, mock execution!

48
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:09,501
What?

49
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,636
What?
Nothin'.

50
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,639
No. What?
You don't want to know,
okay? Trust me.

51
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,142
No. What?

52
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:21,146
I heard the nurse say you made
number two in your pants.
Is that what happened?

53
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:26,151
Get the car! Please!
Can we just go to brendan's,
score some shit...

54
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:29,654
and find out what the fuck
is goin' on, please?

55
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,776
The moon. The full moon!

56
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:37,279
Brendan, let's go.
Wake up, man.

57
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,281
For the exact time.

58
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,785
The fool leaves
his door open.

59
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:45,787
I gotta pee.
Go for it.

60
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,789
Yo, einstein.
You should have seen me
at the hospital.

61
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:52,294
It took three nurses
to hold me--

62
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:55,297
you will understand and comply
with the following orders.

63
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:58,550
All security personnel are to be
equipped with silver bullets.

64
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,686
Those silver bullets are
to be blessed by a priest,
not in english, but in latin.

65
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:06,691
All passengers and personnel
are to be restricted
to their cabins...

66
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:08,693
with the doors
bolted and locked.

67
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:11,196
End of orders! Sir!
Yes, sir!

68
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,698
Take him below.
Take him below.

69
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:21,072
Yeah. Yeah. Uh- huh.
That's the message. Thanks.

70
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:23,575
Way to go, anth!

71
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:28,079
Here, in five, four,
three, two.

72
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,583
Yo. Yo, check it.

73
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:45,480
You think this is funny?

74
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,483
What? What's funny?
Yeah, i didn't do nothin'.

75
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,485
You beep me one more time,
you're gonna be sorry.

76
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:52,988
We don't know what
you're talking about.

77
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:54,990
"Your mother blows."
That's a real original message.

78
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:58,860
Yeah, maybe she does,
right, anth?
Yeah.

79
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,863
Oh, yeah? Then why'd
you scarf up all the doughnuts
she sent us at camp?

80
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:06,251
And you used to cry on her
shoulder,"i'm so homesick,
mrs. Piocosta!"

81
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:09,254
Why don't you shut up?

82
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:11,506
Have another doughnut,
ya fat fart knocker.

83
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:19,264
Oh, go on! Kill'im!
Yeah!

84
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:21,266
Oh, yes!

85
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,768
Dick wad!
Ass!

86
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:28,273
Hey! Break it up.
Break it up!

87
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:31,276
I want a five- minute
cooldown period right now.

88
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,402
See ya next week, doc.

89
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:43,905
Oh, mr. Dante,
you forgot something.
Oh, thank you, baby.

90
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:47,292
- Don't forget to keep flossing.
- You saved my life.

91
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,795
All right.
All right.
See you next week, all right?

92
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:56,301
Can i help you, sir?

93
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,304
Sir? Sir?

94
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:23,828
Oh, my god.

95
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,333
I'm having
second thoughts.
About?

96
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,453
This whole thing,
the whole arrangement.

97
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:35,457
Security.

98
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:38,960
I come here. I tell you things.
I don't know how safe it is.

99
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,463
I understand
your concerns.

100
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:45,600
But i told you what the ground
rules are. As long as i don't
hear anything incriminating--

101
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:49,604
you don't fuckin' get it.
Just my bein' here
incriminates me.

102
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:53,608
Somebody sees me, they tell
somebody else. All of a sudden,
i'm a celebrity!

103
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:57,612
I thought
we made some progress
of your narcissism.

104
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:01,116
Who are you?

105
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:04,486
Why is that so important
for you to know?

106
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:09,124
My mother told me
never to answer a question
with a question.

107
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:12,877
So, your mother
did teach you something.

108
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:17,132
If i asked you about your life,
who you talked to,
who you trust--

109
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:20,001
i'd have to take the fifth.

110
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:24,506
That's cute.

111
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:28,009
Oh! I--

112
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:32,514
i-- i'm sorry.
I wasn't aware of
what i was...saying.

113
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:35,517
I'm...sorry.

114
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:45,026
Hey, what are you
doing here?

115
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:48,029
Chris sent me to pick you up.
Chris? Why?
Did something happen?

116
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,282
Must be my dad, right?
Why else would chris send you?

117
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:53,785
Did brendan get my poem?

118
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,287
It's probably nothing.
Another search warrant.

119
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:58,289
He calls them the federal bureau
of annoying bullshit.

120
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,793
You told your old man,
didn't you?
You scared me. What happened?

121
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:06,798
This is me and adriana movin'
to florida'cause some puke
couldn't keep your mouth shut.

122
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:09,684
What are you talking about?
Seriously. Did brendan
say anything about me?

123
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:13,054
Get us outta here!
Get us out!

124
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:17,058
What did you tell your old man?
About the meth? You insane?
He'd have me beaten up!

125
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:19,561
Don't you get it?
This is serious!

126
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:22,447
Let go of me!
Listen--

127
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:24,566
stop this shit!
He's worried about you.

128
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:27,819
He's been asking where
you've been, you asshole!

129
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:31,322
I'm sorry if i hurt ya.

130
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:34,826
I hate my life,
being a soprano.
Hey.

131
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:38,329
Don't ever say you hate life.
That's blasphemy.

132
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,331
Fuck you.

133
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:43,835
Okay, let's go. Remember
like when you were little.

134
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:46,337
I'll buy you one of those
happy meals, all right?

135
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:48,840
Where the fuck are you?

136
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:03,905
This is a new shirt.

137
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:06,908
Your grandmother
bought you this shirt.
I find it in the trash?

138
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,911
It's a westport.
It's not even cool anymore.

139
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:12,781
What did you just say?

140
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:15,784
I got in a fight.
I hope it was worth it.

141
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:19,287
I hope you did as much
damage to his wardrobe.
Who with?

142
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,289
I didn't get caught.
No demerits.

143
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:25,293
Anthony, who?
Jeremy.

144
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:30,682
Jeremy piocosta? You spent
all that time together at camp.
I thought you were friends.

145
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,553
Well, if that's all
the information i'm getting,
i'm calling mrs. Piocosta.

146
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:37,939
No, ma, wait.
Ma, don't call.

147
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:40,442
I swear. You kids
are going to learn
the value of a dollar.

148
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:43,445
I'll wash your car.
You never put
any effort in.

149
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:46,448
I will. I promise.
I'll do it really good.

150
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,450
Just don't call.
I'll get the money.

151
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,953
Forty dollars, anthony.
I know, i know.

152
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,963
Ma!

153
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:05,467
How ya doin'?
What brings you here?

154
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:08,970
Remember that pastry place,
ferrara's?

155
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,973
Brought you
some macaroons.

156
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:15,477
Oh, they're too sweet.

157
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:18,480
What are you talkin' about?
They're your favorites.

158
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:24,986
The activities director, rosie,

159
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:29,491
says they're organizing
a trip to the city.

160
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:32,494
Dinner and a show.

161
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:34,996
And you don't wanna go.

162
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:38,500
I don't like
the people here.
You don't know the people here.

163
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,505
And that city.
Grown men soiling themselves.

164
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:46,875
- It's not like that anymore, ma.
- That giuliani.

165
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,510
Maybe we should just
stick to the field trip.

166
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,514
Mothers throwin' their babies
out of skyscraper windows.

167
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:55,633
You're always with
the babies out the windows.

168
00:13:57,135 --> 00:14:00,138
I don't see you tryin' to mix
with the other ladies here...

169
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:04,275
or talk to the nice gents
i see walkin' around.

170
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:06,895
You're not makin'
the most of your opportunities.
What do you care?

171
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:10,398
Out of sight, out of mind.

172
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:14,402
We don't think like that,
not me or carm or the kids.

173
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:17,405
I wish the lord
would take me now.

174
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:23,161
I come here to get cheered up.
You think that's a mistake?

175
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:26,664
You bein' sarcastic?

176
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:29,417
You can't put
all your problems on me.

177
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:32,921
This is the most expensive
retirement community
in new jersey.

178
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,925
If you wanted to, you could be
happy here, but you're just
pissing it all down the drain.

179
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:39,928
What beautiful language
for your mother.

180
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,321
You want the macaroons?

181
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:53,324
I don't care.

182
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,702
Leave some out
for the lunatics.

183
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:21,853
Good- bye, ma.

184
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:28,610
They're saying
it might rain today.

185
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:37,118
Don't worry. I'll drive safe.

186
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:43,124
What the hell are you doing?

187
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:46,628
This place is an hour
from my office.
An hour?

188
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:49,130
What are you, a woman?
Get a bladder transplant.
My mother lives here.

189
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,633
It's not real
convenient for me.

190
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,135
It's not convenient?
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:59,140
Why don't we meet by your
precinct? The government would
love pictures of us together.

192
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,643
What do you got for me?

193
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:06,648
Here.

194
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:10,151
"Jennifer melfi, m. D."
Yeah. Her background,
daily routine.

195
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:12,654
And your personal
relationship
with her is?

196
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:15,156
None of your
fuckin' business.

197
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:17,158
You can't blame a guy
for tryin'.

198
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:19,661
What are you,
bored with your life?
Oh, yeah, sure.

199
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:22,163
Bustin' whores and junkies.

200
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,284
Plus, it's a super huge thrill
to pay two alimonies on
a $40, 000- a- year income.

201
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:29,787
I don't want her touched.
I don't want her bothered.

202
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:32,290
I just want to know
the who, when, why.
That's it.

203
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,293
Usual fee?

204
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:40,298
The knicks lost, lieutenant.
You're down two large.

205
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:43,301
Lay off the vig.
We'll see what kind
of job you do.

206
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,304
Okay. See you in a few days.
What ya got in the box?

207
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:48,806
Macaroons.

208
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:58,533
This is awful.

209
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:01,035
I can't deal with this.

210
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:06,791
What kind of god? Hmm?

211
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:11,162
Christopher!
Where you been?

212
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:14,048
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

213
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:16,551
Brendan's dead.
What are you talkin' about?

214
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:19,053
The fish is in my pocket.

215
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:23,174
Brendan's brains are
floatin' in his bathtub.
Message job through the eye.

216
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:26,310
- Mo green special.
- Fuckin' uncle junior.

217
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,312
What are you talkin' about,
mo green?

218
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:31,315
In one, mo green's
eyes got too big
for his stomach,

219
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:33,317
so they put a small
caliber in his eye.

220
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,937
- Mikey palmice does their hits.
- In his glasses, you mean.

221
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:37,939
Glasses, eyes.
Why you quibbling with me?

222
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,942
I'm at the world trade center.

223
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:47,331
What are you doin'?

224
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:50,701
Mikey palmice is a made guy.
Cocksucker didn't have
the balls to do it himself.

225
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:53,704
Contracted fuckin' russians
and he killed my friend.

226
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:57,842
Our response should
suit the message.

227
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,962
Through the mouth
means the guy was a rat.

228
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:05,216
The eye is just how
francis framed the shot,
for the shock value.

229
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:07,718
Brendan didn't deserve this.
Don't try to talk me out of it.

230
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,720
You can't touch mikey.

231
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,724
Your fuckin' uncle's
pissin' on your head.
What do you expect me to do?

232
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:18,729
I'm on it. I know where
mikey's house is
over by route ten.

233
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:23,234
No. He tries to leave,
you break his other neck.

234
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,251
Nurse bradley,
you're wanted in e. R.

235
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:44,255
Nurse bradley,
you're wanted in e. R.

236
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:57,151
Hey, mr. G. Q.
Hey.

237
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,153
Got a ticket.
Yeah.

238
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,772
How ya doin', mikey?
How ya doin'--

239
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:09,664
son of a--
look.

240
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:11,666
Your suit's wrinkled.
Let me fix it.

241
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:16,287
- Ow!
- What are you screaming about?
Free alterations.

242
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:19,040
Ow! Ow!
Mr. Slick.

243
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,295
This is overdue.

244
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,190
You hear about
the chinese godfather?

245
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,192
He made them an offer
they couldn't understand.

246
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:41,812
You gonna stop this
before it gets out of hand?

247
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:46,951
- Not even a hello?
- I'm here'cause i love you
and i respect you.

248
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:49,453
Don't pretend
you're payin' me respect.

249
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:51,455
A son who throws his mother
in an asylum.

250
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,458
She lives like
apoverettoup there.

251
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,961
That's none
of your business.

252
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:01,966
Your friends-- they interfere
in my business. They expect me
to turn the cheek.

253
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:04,218
The truck and all that
was made good to you.

254
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:08,839
I'm sitting here like patience
on a monument, waitin' for
discipline to be handed down.

255
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,342
Your boys were warned,
and still they embarrass me.

256
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:15,346
I run my crew my way.
What you did was extreme.

257
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:20,101
Now you're my judge?
I answer to bigger people
than you, my friend.

258
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:24,605
Oh? Like jackie?
Wanna take this
to his deathbed?

259
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:31,362
That nephew of yours
we gave a high colonic,
uh, he earns good?

260
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:36,367
He's comin' up.
Okay.

261
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:38,753
He works for me now.

262
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:41,255
Excuse me.

263
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:44,125
Maybe he gives youagito
for a change.

264
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:49,513
You got some set of balls.
You know that?
Absolutely not.

265
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:53,517
I show you my hand,
and you slap it away.

266
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:03,027
What's the matter with you?
Why can't we talk like
adults anymore, hmm?

267
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:08,032
Out. Next time you come in,
you come heavy or not at all.

268
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:13,537
You don't mean that.

269
00:21:35,726 --> 00:21:40,731
So by the time i get to take
the sergeant exam, of course,
the pay scale is frozen by law.

270
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:42,733
Why are we following
these people?

271
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:45,736
They grabbed a meal,
saw a movie, so what?

272
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:48,356
Lucky for you
they stopped off
at that package store.

273
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:53,110
- Yeah, i got a juice.
- Yeah, i can smell the potatoes.

274
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,112
Hey, listen, asshole.

275
00:21:55,112 --> 00:21:58,616
Same make and model
left the scene of a triple
homicide on long island.

276
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:01,118
Stay fuckin' current.

277
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:08,376
So you broke it off with
the poorshlubafter a week?

278
00:22:08,376 --> 00:22:13,881
I know. I feel for you males.
It's our goddamn fault
you don't know how to act.

279
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:16,884
Oh, admitting mistakes.

280
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:21,389
We tell you
to be more sensitive.
You join promise keepers.

281
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:24,892
We say get in touch
with your feelings.

282
00:22:25,393 --> 00:22:29,897
You run off into the woods
in a loincloth, gunking yourself
with bear fat, beating a drum.

283
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:32,400
Hey, don't ruin my evening.

284
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,902
You know what i mean.

285
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:38,406
Sure. You want someone
who's sensitive to your needs...

286
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:41,909
but still decisive enough
for the occasional grope
in the closet.

287
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:45,413
Yeah. Something like that.

288
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:49,917
Oh, shit.
That's all i need.

289
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:53,304
We were going over
the speed limit?

290
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:56,307
I wasn't looking.
Pull over.

291
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:21,699
License and
registration, please.

292
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:26,704
Uh, i'm sorry, officer.
Did i do something wrong?

293
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:29,590
Detective.

294
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,593
You crossed a double line.
Have you been drinking, sir?

295
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,712
We had wine with dinner.

296
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:37,348
Step out of the car, please.

297
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,850
I don't believe this.

298
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,855
Just relax, randall,
and do what he says, okay?

299
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:50,361
I need you to walk
a straight line to me, sir.
Heel to toe.

300
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:55,733
Look, uh,
i applaud your vigilance,
but this is totally unnecessary.

301
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,235
All right? I'm a lawyer.
I know i'm under the limit.

302
00:23:58,486 --> 00:24:00,988
Open the trunk, please.
What?

303
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:02,490
You want to search
my golf bag?

304
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,992
Open it!
I will not.

305
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:07,244
You ever hear
of probable cause?

306
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:09,747
Oh, yeah, that's
a real good legalese--
what?

307
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:12,133
Oh, you resisting arrest?

308
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:14,635
- Hey!
-

309
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:17,138
vin, will you fuckin'
cool it? Vin!

310
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,640
He can't do that!
Get back in the car!

311
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,642
He didn't do
anything wrong!
Ma'am!

312
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:25,146
Back in the car. Now.

313
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:26,647
Come on. Let's go.

314
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:30,151
I perceived what
i thought was a weapon.

315
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:33,654
What the hell's
wrong with you, vin?

316
00:24:33,654 --> 00:24:37,158
Take him. D. U. I. ,
resisting arrest, assaulting
an officer. Do it now.

317
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:39,660
What's he--
do it!

318
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,162
Jesus.

319
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:46,667
Don't you touch me!

320
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:50,671
You got prime rib at home.
Don't be goin' out
for hamburgers.

321
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:53,674
What? What are you
talking about?

322
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:58,179
Randall! Randall!
I'll follow you!

323
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,183
I'm gonna call my lawyer, you!
Fuck you!

324
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:05,302
She's seeing a randall curtin,
tax lawyer.

325
00:25:05,302 --> 00:25:11,308
He's lives at
1242 rennsalaer road.

326
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:14,311
He's divorced.
He's got two kids.

327
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:18,816
He's the country club type.
Not much in the balls
department, i might add.

328
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,568
What about her?

329
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:24,572
Her, the good doctor, she's
in her office at 8:00 a. M.
She leaves at 6:00.

330
00:25:24,572 --> 00:25:26,574
She orders up a tuna sub
and a diet coke.

331
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:31,078
She's got a three- bedroom condo
in essex fells,
shops at pathmark.

332
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:34,081
She's divorced.
One kid, 19.

333
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:38,085
Outside of schmucko,
she don't get out much,
but she does see a shrink.

334
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:40,588
She what?
Yeah.

335
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:44,725
She sees a shrink once a week.
His name is elliot kupferburg.

336
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:47,094
Oh, fuck me.

337
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:50,598
Well, she don't fuck anyone
from what i can tell.

338
00:25:50,598 --> 00:25:53,100
Well, it's not because
she don't got the goods.

339
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,103
She left her blinds up.
I got some of them
victoria secrettype snaps.

340
00:25:56,103 --> 00:26:00,608
If you're interested.
A little of this?

341
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:02,610
Good enough then?
Yeah.

342
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,863
- You got any advil?
- What am i, a fuckin'
pharmacy now?

343
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:10,868
What you got on friday's game?
I got three bills on rutgers.

344
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:14,872
I don't solve
all your problems.

345
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:25,266
Thank you.

346
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,135
With a stapler? Wow.

347
00:26:28,135 --> 00:26:30,638
I heard mikey had to
give up that nice suit.

348
00:26:31,138 --> 00:26:34,642
Yeah?
He got too attached to it.

349
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:39,647
Michael palmice's been
a disease since he was five.
He had it comin'.

350
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:42,650
It don't make things
any easier though.
My uncle's a stubborn man.

351
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,786
Stubborn enough to go to war?

352
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:52,042
What kind of word is that?

353
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:57,548
There hasn't been a war
since the columbo thing.
Everybody decided.

354
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:00,050
No one's goin' to
the mattresses this day and age.

355
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,554
I got a top- of- the- line
posturpedic at my house.
Fuck it.

356
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:07,558
If jackie hadn't
gotten sick, none of this
would have happened.

357
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:10,060
When you're right,
you're right.

358
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:13,564
One of us captains gotta
step up. Lack of control at the
top is fuckin' up this family.

359
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:16,567
- That's true.
- You can say that again.

360
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:21,071
If the old man were here,
instead of in that cell
in springfield,

361
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:24,074
he'd say,"raymond,
this is your moment."

362
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:27,077
Go easy with
the grease gun, okay?
What?

363
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:31,582
You're the boy wonder.
Both him and jackie
had you picked from day one.

364
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:34,084
You got the age.
You got the seniority.

365
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:38,088
I also got an 18- year- old
with m. S. , okay?

366
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,591
I told nucci
i'd be doin' less, not more.

367
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:43,594
All due respect to your
crippled kid, you don't
want a wire up your ass.

368
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:45,596
You don't want the headache.

369
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:48,599
That's why you should be boss.
You're so fuckin' smart.

370
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,101
And it's
"physically challenged."

371
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:53,604
Absolutely.

372
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:57,107
Why don't we run this thing
like a council?

373
00:27:57,608 --> 00:28:01,612
Larry, the old guys set this up
as a paramilitary organization.

374
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:07,117
We need a supreme commander
at the top, not the fuckin'
dave clark five.

375
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:10,621
Face it. You and junior
are gonna have to duke it out.

376
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:14,625
You gotta be boss.
Number one:
I love the man.

377
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:19,129
Number two:
He's got new york behind him.

378
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:23,133
Not for anything,
god bless your uncle, but he's
livin' in the wrong century,

379
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,135
and new york knows it.

380
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:29,139
You want it, t?
You'll get their okay.

381
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:32,643
It's the right thing.
It's inevitable.

382
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:36,146
I don't want no disturbance.

383
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,163
Hey, what's up?
Nothin'.

384
00:28:53,414 --> 00:28:56,417
I bet you told your mom
what happened.

385
00:28:56,784 --> 00:28:59,286
What are you, high?

386
00:28:59,286 --> 00:29:03,290
Well, you owe me 40 bucks
for the shirt. The collar
was totally ripped.

387
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:05,426
You still owe me
for fourth of july.

388
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:07,177
Bottle rockets?
I paid for them.

389
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:11,181
Not for the m80s.
Remember? The ones
you blew up the frogs with.

390
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:15,185
- Oh, yeah.
That was pretty cool.
- Yeah.

391
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:18,689
Listen. Just give me the money.

392
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:22,192
- That thing was so gay.
I did you a favor.
- You're gonna do it.

393
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:24,311
Make me, fatty.

394
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:27,314
- Dick wad.
- Asshole.

395
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:30,818
Whoa!

396
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:33,821
Shithead.

397
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:36,323
Bitch-- come on.

398
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:40,077
Let's go, shithead.

399
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:43,080
- Let me go!
- Why? So i can
kick your ass again?

400
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:46,216
- I was kicking your ass.
- Nobody won. It was a draw.

401
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:50,721
The pit tomorrow, 3:00.

402
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:54,341
You gotta help me
with these cinch bugs.
They're killing my sweet corn.

403
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:57,845
Well, this blue stuff works
pretty well, and it's safe
for the environment.

404
00:29:57,845 --> 00:30:01,348
I tried that.
You got any d. D. T. Back there?

405
00:30:01,732 --> 00:30:04,735
Uh, that stuff's illegal.
It's been banned.

406
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:08,105
Maybe you got a surplus in the
back, you could go, you look.
I'll meet you back there.

407
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:10,858
Look, mr. Soprano,
if i could do
something, i would--

408
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:15,496
mr. Piocosta! Right?
How ya doin'?

409
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:20,367
Remember our boys went
to camp aheka together?

410
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:23,003
Of course. Tony.
How are ya?
Good. Good.

411
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,873
Your kid still got
that killer crossover dribble?

412
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:29,376
- Yeah, i guess so.
- That's gonna get him
a scholarship.

413
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,012
- So how's anthony?
- He's moody, you know?

414
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:35,516
For a kid that age,
you know?

415
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,634
It was nice seein' ya, tony.

416
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:41,271
Why don't we get together and
cook up some dogs for the boys?

417
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:45,776
Tony, i-- i don't even know
if these guys are close anymore.

418
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:48,278
Did anthony mention
anything to you?

419
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:50,531
I'll have carmela call joanie.
We'll get together.

420
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:53,650
- Linda.
- Linda.

421
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:56,286
That's great.
Tony, that's great.

422
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:59,289
I'll see you around.

423
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:35,325
Tony?

424
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:38,328
Yeah.
Oh, my god.

425
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:40,330
Tony?

426
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:48,839
I thought the medication
was supposed to help
your panic attacks.

427
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:53,844
It-- it does.
It's the first one in a while.

428
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:58,348
What does your therapist say?
He should increase your dosage.

429
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:00,851
He's got more degrees
than a thermometer.

430
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:04,354
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

431
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:09,359
Does your therapist
ask questions
about our marriage?

432
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,362
I know that personal
feelings are hard for you
to talk about.

433
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:16,867
Talk. That's
all we do is talk.

434
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:19,369
Carm, i'm gonna quit.

435
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:23,874
Did you bring
this up with him?
Yeah.

436
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:27,377
He knows. I guess.

437
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:33,383
Oh, shit. I forgot to take
my fuckin' prozac this mornin'.

438
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:36,386
It's up in the bathroom.
Can you get it?

439
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:42,893
I know with jackie sick
you're under
tremendous pressure.

440
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:47,397
But i feel if
the therapy didn't hurt,
it wouldn't be helping.

441
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,901
No, you don't understand.

442
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:54,905
That's why you're
in therapy. Because
i don't understand!

443
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:58,909
I'm telling you, tony,
if you give up now, i'm gonna
have to reevaluate things.

444
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:01,411
What is that, huh?

445
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:04,414
I got a very sensitive job.
I'm not an average joe
on the block.

446
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:07,417
I gotta spell it out for you?
It's our marriage, tony!

447
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,419
Therapy is
too much exposure.
Fine!

448
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,923
You live with
the results then!

449
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:15,425
What's that, a threat?

450
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,295
No, tony.
It's a rave review.

451
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:20,797
You get your own
fuckin' pills.

452
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:28,021
How long did the attack last?

453
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:30,023
About 30 seconds.

454
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:36,396
I was dizzy, out of breath.
That's it though.
I never lost consciousness.

455
00:33:36,897 --> 00:33:39,900
Anything since?

456
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,905
I'm gonna write
a script for xanax,
just for a couple of days.

457
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:50,043
It'll get you over
this short- term stresses.

458
00:33:50,043 --> 00:33:55,549
My uncle. He's got me in a box
where i gotta do something
i don't wanna do.

459
00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:02,556
And then there's my mother.

460
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:05,058
I pay four grand a month
for this place,

461
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:10,063
and she acts like i'm an eskimo,
pushing her out to sea.

462
00:34:10,063 --> 00:34:12,816
She's testing.

463
00:34:14,684 --> 00:34:16,770
Same as your uncle.

464
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:20,157
Like little kids.

465
00:34:20,273 --> 00:34:23,276
There's a good book about this.
I'll give you the name.

466
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,412
No, i read, i go right out.

467
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:29,666
It'sstrategies for
coping with elder family.

468
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:33,537
Can't fuckin' spank'em though.

469
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:38,041
Would it hurt you
to let your mother think
that she's still in charge?

470
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:41,044
You have children.
You know what they're like.

471
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:46,800
You know that sometimes it's
important to let them have the
illusion of being in control.

472
00:34:57,944 --> 00:34:59,946
Chris, my man!

473
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:02,949
Surprised to see me?
Heard they took you
for a little ride.

474
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:06,453
Tour of the meadowlands.
Oh, yeah?

475
00:35:06,953 --> 00:35:08,955
Heard you had
a little b. M. Out there.

476
00:35:08,955 --> 00:35:11,458
- So you got my cut?
- They came and took it.

477
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:14,461
- Who?
- Junior soprano's boys.

478
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:16,463
They said you was out,
and it's they corner now.

479
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:20,467
- You let them do that?
- I don't argue too well
suckin' on a smith & wesson.

480
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:24,471
- You didn't beep me?
- Word on the street,
you out of commission.

481
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:26,973
Sorry, man. Business.

482
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:32,979
Chris, you know there's
no one i'd rather give
my ten points to than you.

483
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,234
It's all right.
It's not your fault.

484
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:39,236
Oh, i'm glad
that you say that, man.

485
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:43,607
Sneaky motherfucker!

486
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:46,993
Oh, shit! Oh!

487
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:52,249
I don't care if they shove
a scud missile up your ass.

488
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:56,753
This is my corner.
You pay anyone but me,
i'm comin' back for your thumbs.

489
00:35:57,003 --> 00:36:00,006
And that didn't happen,
what you said!

490
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:07,264
I'm gonna kill you!

491
00:36:15,021 --> 00:36:17,524
If you get in trouble,
go for the takedown.

492
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:21,027
Sweep kick and steamroll.
Game is over.

493
00:36:21,027 --> 00:36:23,029
All you're doing
is makin' me nervous.

494
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,033
Do you want a nitro bar?
Would you shut the fuck up?

495
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,905
- He's coming!
- It's the moment of truth.

496
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:05,438
Here.

497
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:09,075
- What the hell is that?
- Just take it.

498
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:11,578
I'll fight you for it.

499
00:37:12,078 --> 00:37:14,831
- I can't.
- What do you mean, can't?

500
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:18,201
Just take it!

501
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:24,090
I knew you'd chicken out.

502
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,712
Man!

503
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:30,597
He chickened out.
He's scared.

504
00:37:31,097 --> 00:37:33,099
Oh, yeah!
He's real scared ofyou.

505
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:37,604
What's that supposed to mean?
You won, man! Yeah!
Tonio, you won!

506
00:37:38,104 --> 00:37:40,857
I'm leaving.

507
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,978
Boo!

508
00:38:19,145 --> 00:38:21,147
One of the gangland's
youngest alleged leaders...

509
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:24,401
died late this afternoon
at st. Isaac's hospital.

510
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:26,903
Turn it off.
Turn the music off!
Giacomo "jackie" aprile,

511
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:31,408
allegedly one of the state's
top mafia figures was first
hospitalized last year.

512
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:37,414
Authorities called aprile
the acting boss for 74- year- old
ercoli "eckley" demeo,

513
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:40,784
currently serving
a life sentence in springfield
federal penitentiary.

514
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:46,289
Authorities believe he was made
acting boss for the north jersey
mafia two years ago.

515
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:48,425
Aprile was 44 years old.

516
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:51,928
Thank you, heather,
for that live report.

517
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:55,932
Goddamn it. I was just there.
They told me
he wouldn't go today.

518
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:57,934
It looks like the possibility
of rain for this weekend.

519
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:02,439
I'll never forget
where i was this day.

520
00:39:05,692 --> 00:39:09,195
It's okay.

521
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:12,699
He was a good man.

522
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,202
Let's do a toast.
Give me a toast.

523
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:21,708
To a great man.
To a great leader.

524
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:24,711
A great friend.

525
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:28,715
To jackie.

526
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:33,219
Buonanima.
Buonanima.

527
00:39:37,223 --> 00:39:40,727
T! Ya hear what happened?

528
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:42,595
Just now.

529
00:39:42,595 --> 00:39:47,100
That's not all. I go to make
a pickup from yo yo mendez.

530
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,103
He says it ain't my corner
anymore. It's junior's.

531
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:53,106
Christopher.
This ain't the time.
They're movin' in!

532
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:56,609
I say we go to defcon 4!

533
00:39:56,609 --> 00:39:59,612
I gotta assess this, all right?

534
00:40:00,113 --> 00:40:04,117
What are we, politicians?
Does this look like
the senate to you?

535
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:06,119
- Hey, hey.
- This is about respect
of our thing!

536
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,621
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
It doesn't concern you!

537
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:13,126
Yes, it is. I represent you
out there, and i'm tired of
puttin' my tail between my legs.

538
00:40:13,126 --> 00:40:17,130
This ain't negotiation time.
This isscarface, final scene.

539
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,633
Fuckin' bazookas under each arm.
Say hello to my little friend.

540
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:23,770
Always with the scenarios.

541
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,773
You don't do somethin', i gotta
question your leadership.

542
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:29,776
What the--
you ungrateful little fuck!

543
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:32,278
Where'd you get
the balls to question
my leadership, huh?

544
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:34,280
I'm just sayin' how it is.

545
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:37,784
I ought to rip
your fuckin' head off
and finish the job.

546
00:40:38,284 --> 00:40:40,787
You're the boss.
That's right.
I am.

547
00:40:40,787 --> 00:40:46,292
You're lucky a man
i loved died today.

548
00:40:55,802 --> 00:40:59,806
Here we go,
the war of'99.
We should go with him.

549
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:02,809
You do what you're told
when you're told.

550
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:05,812
Adios, junior.

551
00:41:08,314 --> 00:41:11,317
Mind your mother now,
hear me?

552
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:17,824
Never mind.

553
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:20,827
A little more.
That's good right there.

554
00:41:20,827 --> 00:41:23,329
Right there?
Yeah, that's good.

555
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:25,331
All right.

556
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:32,705
Here! Take this.

557
00:41:34,207 --> 00:41:36,209
Uncle junior.

558
00:41:36,342 --> 00:41:38,344
I need to talk to ya.

559
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:47,604
I came in heavy, like you said,
but i don't wanna use it.

560
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:06,873
Our friend jackie has died.

561
00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:09,876
I heard.

562
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:12,128
Now we need a leader.

563
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,882
We do.

564
00:42:19,886 --> 00:42:22,388
And i don't want any
confusion or misunderstandin'.

565
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,257
Yes?

566
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:30,763
Sopranos have been waiting
a long time to take the reins.

567
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:38,271
That's why i want it
to be you, uncle jun.

568
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:45,778
This is your decision?

569
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:48,031
It is.

570
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:50,533
You speak for the captains?

571
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:52,669
I can.

572
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:57,173
Come here.

573
00:42:57,173 --> 00:43:01,678
You crazycialtrone.
You had me worried there.

574
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:04,180
You think i'm gonna mess
with a guy like you?
You been pumpin' iron?

575
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,683
You're stronger than a bull.

576
00:43:06,683 --> 00:43:11,054
Hey, call parcel's.
Give this guy a tryout, huh?
Come here.

577
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:15,058
Always the bullshitter.
Just one thing, one thing.

578
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:19,562
You know i can't
be perceived to
lose face, right?

579
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:23,566
So, bloomfield...

580
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:28,071
and the paving union.

581
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:30,573
It's my asking price.

582
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:39,082
Congratulations.

583
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:50,426
I almost got
in a fight today.

584
00:43:50,426 --> 00:43:53,930
Fight?
With jeremy piocosta.

585
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,432
I take french with his brother.
He's such a poseur.

586
00:43:56,683 --> 00:44:00,186
Who won?
No one. He backed out.

587
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:03,189
Phil litto said,
"yeah, he's real scared of you."

588
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:05,191
When i asked
what that meant,
they all laughed.

589
00:44:05,191 --> 00:44:08,194
Duh.
What do you mean?

590
00:44:08,194 --> 00:44:11,698
Sometimes you're so naive.

591
00:44:11,698 --> 00:44:15,201
What do you think
dad does for a living?
Waste management.

592
00:44:15,201 --> 00:44:18,204
Do you know any other
garbage men who live
in a house like this?

593
00:44:18,204 --> 00:44:19,706
Uncle jackie.

594
00:44:19,706 --> 00:44:22,709
And why do we call him uncle
when he's not even related?

595
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,713
He's in dad'sotherfamily.

596
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:31,601
Come here.

597
00:44:41,861 --> 00:44:43,363
I'll print it out for you.

598
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:28,908
Hi.
Jennifer.

599
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:32,912
I tried calling.
Yeah, the phone's
off the hook.

600
00:45:32,912 --> 00:45:34,914
Come on in.

601
00:45:39,919 --> 00:45:43,790
I guess we won't
be going to dinner.

602
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,792
I'm worried, jennifer.

603
00:45:49,295 --> 00:45:51,798
I think i'm starting
to lose it.

604
00:45:51,798 --> 00:45:55,051
I was standing
in line this morning
in the doughnut shop.

605
00:45:55,051 --> 00:46:00,556
A man in a booth looked at me.
All of a sudden, i started
shaking uncontrollably.

606
00:46:00,556 --> 00:46:03,059
Lady says,"next."
I ran away.

607
00:46:05,945 --> 00:46:11,951
Hey. You've been through
a very traumatic experience.

608
00:46:13,953 --> 00:46:19,959
I hate to admit this, but
i'm afraid to go outside.

609
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,966
I...got this crazy idea
that i'm being followed.

610
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:30,970
And this song keeps
running through my head.

611
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,973
"People are strange."
The doors.

612
00:46:34,474 --> 00:46:38,978
Where faces look evil
when you're alienated.

613
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:40,980
Randall--

614
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,485
dead at 27
in a paris bathtub.

615
00:46:45,485 --> 00:46:48,488
Okay, i think you should go
and talk to mel gelbar.

616
00:46:48,488 --> 00:46:51,991
He specializes in
post- traumatic stress disorder.

617
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:54,994
Y- you couldn't
prescribe something?

618
00:46:55,495 --> 00:46:57,497
I'm your date,
not your doctor.

619
00:46:57,997 --> 00:47:01,501
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah. No.

620
00:47:32,398 --> 00:47:38,037
Saw my first dead body
when i was about 15, maybe 16.

621
00:47:38,037 --> 00:47:42,041
Won't tell you about how he got
clipped, because it was, uh--

622
00:47:44,544 --> 00:47:46,546
sorry.

623
00:47:46,796 --> 00:47:50,917
You okay?
I was thinking.

624
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:55,171
I guess i live
a sheltered existence.

625
00:47:55,671 --> 00:47:57,673
How so?

626
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:02,678
Well, i'm in this room
for ten hours a day.

627
00:48:02,678 --> 00:48:05,681
I guess i'm out of touch
with the...

628
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:10,686
climate of rage
in american society,

629
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:13,689
the casual violence.

630
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,443
Your voice is all tight.

631
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:25,952
This week my friend
got beat up...

632
00:48:25,952 --> 00:48:28,337
by a policeman, no less.

633
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,340
Oh, yeah?

634
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:35,845
It was a nightmare.

635
00:48:35,845 --> 00:48:38,214
Wow.

636
00:48:38,214 --> 00:48:40,716
I mean, i don't know
if this cop...

637
00:48:40,716 --> 00:48:44,220
was crazy or drunk or what.

638
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:50,226
But he was raving,
"prime rib, hamburger."
It was surreal.

639
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:54,113
Fuckin' moron.

640
00:48:55,615 --> 00:48:59,735
I mean, it sounds like
this guy is a fuckin' moron.

641
00:48:59,735 --> 00:49:03,623
My friend's filing suit
against the city.

642
00:49:03,623 --> 00:49:07,627
But the worst part of it is,
my relationship with him
will never be the same.

643
00:49:07,743 --> 00:49:12,381
Sorry.
Oh, it wasn't your fault.

644
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:18,387
Hey, this is your session.
I'm sorry. This is--

645
00:49:18,504 --> 00:49:20,506
hey.
Very unprofessional.

646
00:49:20,506 --> 00:49:23,509
No, it's all right.
You had your wits
scared out of you.

647
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,512
Is the xanax helping?

648
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:31,267
Fine. No more attacks.

649
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,904
But you still
have your doubts?

650
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:38,407
About therapy?

651
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:41,410
No, no, no, no.
Give it another chance.

652
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:44,914
Got a lot of good ideas here.

653
00:49:44,914 --> 00:49:46,916
Okay.

654
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:50,670
On how to cope.

655
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:58,427
Tell me why this was
a smart move to make
junior the big willie.

656
00:49:58,427 --> 00:50:02,932
Look at him. He's content.
Thinks he's the king of kings.

657
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:07,937
Truth is, every decision
is made by me.

658
00:50:07,937 --> 00:50:09,939
I still worry
about the money end.

659
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:12,441
That's'cause that's
what you do. You worry.

660
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:16,445
He doesn't know
we kick back to jackie.

661
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:17,947
We're gonna do good.

662
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:22,952
Point is, he's got the title.
He's a happy fuckin' camper.

663
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:25,454
The house is secure.

664
00:50:25,454 --> 00:50:29,458

a brand- new lightning rod
on top to take the hits.

665
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,460
Smart. Very smart.

666
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,964
Yeah, and now
you got bloomfield
and the union chair.

667
00:50:35,464 --> 00:50:39,969
Otherwise you'd fuck me, larry,
but you wouldn't respect me
in the morning, would ya?

668
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:42,471
As long as you guarantee
to keep the old fart in line.

669
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:45,975
Hey, i still love that man.
I'm his favorite nephew.

670
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:48,978

671
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:51,480
