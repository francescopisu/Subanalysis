1
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:12,177
You woke up this morning

2
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:15,647
got yourself a gun

3
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:19,034
your mama always said
you'd be the chosen one

4
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:22,538
she said
you're one in a million

5
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:25,541
you've got to burn
to shine

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,543
but you were
born under a bad sign

7
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:31,046
with a blue moon
in your eyes

8
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:33,048
when you woke up
this mornin'

9
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:36,051
all that love had gone

10
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:40,806
your papa never told you
about right and wrong

11
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:44,059
but you're, but you're
looking good, baby

12
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:46,562
i believe that
you're a- feelin' fine

13
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:49,314
shame about it
born under a bad sign

14
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:53,435
with a blue moon in your eyes
so sing it now

15
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:58,574
woke up this morning
you got a blue moon
got a blue moon in your eyes?
?

16
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:00,826
Yeah

17
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,697
you say you
woke up this morning

18
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:08,200
the world turned
upside down

19
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,335
lord above, things ain't
been the same

20
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:14,206
since the blues
walked into town

21
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:18,210
but you're, but you're
one in a million'cause you
got that shotgun shine

22
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,097
shame about it
born under a bad sign

23
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:25,851
with a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah

24
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:28,854
woke up this morning

25
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:31,356
got yourself a gun

26
00:01:31,356 --> 00:01:33,859
got yourself a gun

27
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:36,478
got yourself a gun

28
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,484
come on. Come on, dog.
Come on, come on, come on.

29
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:44,987
Come on, come on, come on.

30
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:46,989
Go get it.
Look at this.

31
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:50,993
Look at this plastic.
And there's weeds.

32
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:53,495
It looks like
tobacco road.

33
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:56,131
Nobody gets down here.
Anthony!

34
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:59,134
Those dogs are wild dogs.

35
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:03,138
Cemetery dogs.
They'll take your hand off.

36
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:05,140
Come over here.

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,644
Say a hail mary
for your grandfather.
Lay off. He's a kid.

38
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:13,015
So he should
neglect his elders?
Just like his father.

39
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:16,018
Yeah, real scamp.
Yeah, my son,

40
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:18,020
the mental patient.

41
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,022
Remember those trips
to the shore?

42
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:22,274
Me and tony used to
ride the waves?

43
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:26,778
- I taught him how to bodysurf.
- My son was brought up right.

44
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:29,281
He needs a psychiatrist
for what?

45
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:31,783
To talk about his sex life?
Enough.

46
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,786
I hate it
as much as you do.
Anthony!

47
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:38,290
Those dogs could start
foaming at the mouth.

48
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:42,177
Hey, grandma. How come
youse not supposed to
breathe in the cemetery?

49
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:45,180
Who says?
It's a joke, for christ's sake.
Say "why?"

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,683
'Cause you'll make
the dead people jealous.

51
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:54,806
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Who's got the ball?

52
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,693
- Who's got the ball?
- Oh, my god.
Meadow, look out!

53
00:02:57,693 --> 00:03:00,562
Come around, come around!

54
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:02,564
Up, up, up!
Cover'em through!

55
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,200
- I can't watch.
- Yes!

56
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,953
- Atta girl, meadow!

57
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:09,955
You're a brick wall, baby!
Brick wall!

58
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,958
Good save! Come on, now!
Come on!

59
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:15,077
That was close.

60
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:18,580
Pretty good.
Look at you
at girl's soccer, tony.

61
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,583
What do you want from me?
My only son's a couch potato.

62
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,219
- Red, five!
- What are you,
yellow card happy?

63
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:25,837
Rough play, my ass!

64
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:28,473
Oh, come on!

65
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:31,593
Hi, honey.
Got get'em, baby.

66
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:35,097
This fat kid is such a sneak
with that elbow!

67
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:38,600
Coach says next year
chiara is gonna be
one of his stars.

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,603
Come on, falcons! Let's
pull it out, for christ sake!
Heather dante!

69
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:46,858
- A hundred bucks for a goal!
- What's with ally today?
She's sleepwalkin' out there.

70
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:51,496
She eats at our house
three nights a week.
I know she's got the energy.

71
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:55,000
That tackle was all ball,
asshole!

72
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,253
Yeah, zebra,
i'm talkin' to you!

73
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,372
You blow that whistle
one more time, i'm gonna
stick it up your fuckin' ass!

74
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:04,876
Get off the field! Now!
Get off the field or your team
is gonna forfeit the game!

75
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:08,880
I'm goin'.
You fuckin' son of a--
get off the field!

76
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,386
You're a hell of a guy.

77
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,641
Falcons!
Falcons, heads up!

78
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:24,029
Red 42, 42! Push!

79
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:27,399
Ally! Come on.

80
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,404
Come on, al!

81
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,424
Yes, yes, yes!

82
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,430
Did i tell you?
Did i tell you?

83
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,933
He's a brilliant coach.
He's a beautiful,
brilliant genius.

84
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,936
Yeah. You in love
with him or what?
Frankly, yes.

85
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:08,440
If he steers chiara through
to a college scholarship,
i'll blow the guy at midfield.

86
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,693
Oh, you will?

87
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:14,196
How's cheffing at dimples?

88
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:17,199
You gotta come sample
the salad bar. We got
a special chemical brightener.

89
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,201
Keeps the lettuce crisp.
How nice.

90
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:21,703
Oh, yeah.
It's beautiful.
The offer's still there.

91
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:24,206
You wanna make a little money,
you put some out on the street,

92
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:26,708
at two points,
we split the interest.

93
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,211
Nice.

94
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:33,715
I can't do the math,
ton'. I'm an artiste.

95
00:05:33,715 --> 00:05:36,718
Get outta here.

96
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:38,720
Good job, girls!

97
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,983
Absolutely, yeah.
You do that so well, coach.

98
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:55,987
Thank you.
You did a hell of a job,
coach.

99
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:58,123
Welcome to the bada bing.
Everything's on the house.

100
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:01,126
Brandy! Come here!
I want you to meet somebody.

101
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:03,128
- This guy coached college.
- Get outta here.

102
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:07,132
Division 1- a!
Nay, that's boonie state.

103
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:10,635
Besides, art, the time
has come to stop moving
my wife and deena...

104
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:12,637
like pawns every time
somebody ups the ante.

105
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:17,142
Anyway, now many chances
does a man get to coach
his own daughter?

106
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,644
What do they say?
"Money isn't everything."
Hear, hear.

107
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:22,647
- It's the kids
that are important.
- Cheers to the falcons.

108
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,649
Continued success.

109
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:32,657
Brandy, why don't you give
the coach a deluxe tour
of the vip lounge?

110
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:36,161
What?
Oh, guys.

111
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:38,663
Jesus,
we said a beer.

112
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:43,168
Oh, whoa-- no, i--
uh, thank you, but
i don't think so.

113
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,671
Aw, jesus christ.

114
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:50,675
Okay, brandy, go, uh,
sit on a tuffet.

115
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:53,178
Coach,
it's on the house.

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,799
- What the fuck are you
doin' here?
- Who's he?

117
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,801
My girl's soccer coach.
You got somethin' for me?

118
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:02,804
For one thing, every car you see
in your rearview mirror
is not a fed.

119
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:05,807
Mikey palmice went out
and got a major manhattan p. I.

120
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,810
Mikey palmice thinks
someone here is rattin'
for the government.

121
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,313
What else is new?
What else?

122
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:14,816
My colleague over at
organized crime task force...

123
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:19,321
gets chatty after, uh,
caffeine drinks.

124
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:23,825
Names of people
whose fiscal interests
intersect with your own.

125
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:27,329
Shit.
I'm still trying to find out
if you've been named.

126
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:31,833
But these people, they are
keeping these indictments
very, very internal, tony.

127
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,336
For all i know, they got
a folder withmyname on it,

128
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:36,338
and if i was smart,
i wouldn't be here.

129
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:40,225
I rest my case.
As it is, i'm up the street
on a rape/homicide.

130
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:44,229
What i need now, is to see
a liquor license, sir,
if you don't mind.

131
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:48,233
So anybody wonders
why i was here, or
for the lie detector test--

132
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:53,738
cha- cha, show him
the liquor license.
Don't touch the girls.

133
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,241
How you doin'?

134
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,243
Bada bing. Arthur bucco!

135
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:00,245
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

136
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:06,868
- Hello?
- What, you gonna stay
in that bar all day?

137
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:10,005
I'm shootin'
a little pool.
I'll rack'em up for you.

138
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:13,008
I thought we were supposed
to be painting the trim
on the patio.

139
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:15,510
I bought the primer
and i've been scraping.

140
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:19,130
- You have.
- Arthur, i could really
use your help.

141
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:21,766
All right. Sure.
Honey, i'll be right home.

142
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:27,639
This fuckin' guy lays down
the law, ton'.

143
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,141
Fuckin' blisterin'.
I'll be right home, honey.

144
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,144
I've gotta be
getting home too.
Shelly'll be looking for me.

145
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,647
It's quite the lifestyle
you got here, though.

146
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,649
See you later,
coach.
Okay.

147
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,151
Different strokes.

148
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,789
Melvoin, frolov, schneider
and archide.

149
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,791
I'm sorry.
He's in a meeting.
Can i take a message?

150
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,793
What's goin' on with the feds
and their fuckin' indictment?

151
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:51,296
Just put it
right down there.

152
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:55,300
Here's the bill.
The book is off
from the 14th ward.

153
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:58,303
I don't wanna minimize
your position, corrado.

154
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:01,306
Two prior convictions.
That places you in jeopardy
of sentence...

155
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,308
under the
habitual offenders statute.

156
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:06,678
I'm payin' you four an hour
to hear shit that's already
eatin' my insides?

157
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,180
Who had the peppers
and eggs?
Over here.

158
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:11,566
That's what i should've had.

159
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:19,074
I'd be happy
to surrender mr. Soprano?

160
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:22,077
You can be assured
of my full cooperation?

161
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:25,447
You'd rather they kicked in
your front door
in the middle of the night?

162
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,949
It's a target letter,
corrado.

163
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:31,202
I wasn't getting anywhere,
so i asked them point blank
what your status was.

164
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:35,590
Just testing. That's what
a good lawyer would do.

165
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,210
- They'd let me know
when it was appropriate.
- I may just start paying taxes.

166
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:41,596
- Fuckin' funny. -

167
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:44,349
i'm sick and tired
of sittin' around here
on my hands.

168
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,851
I'm gonna get outta here.
Down to boca
with your lady friend?

169
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:51,222
- What the fuck you know?
- Works for the joint fitters
union, didn't somebody say?

170
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:55,610
Runs their, uh,
labor management fund
outside the fed's oversight.

171
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:00,615
If you can't get
your friends jobs, what's the
purpose of attaining success?

172
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:03,118
The wheels of justice
turn slowly.

173
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:06,371
Take her to florida.
Develop a tan.

174
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:10,625
- Where's the key
to the partners' crapper?
- Top right- hand drawer.

175
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,629
Junior, we're working out of
our fuckin' lawyer's office.

176
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,631
Is that right?

177
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:20,635
I didn't want to say anything,
but this government's case?

178
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:23,138
If there's a leak,
it's in tony's boat.

179
00:10:23,638 --> 00:10:25,640
You wanna tell me...

180
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,643
my nephew's in bed with
the justice department,
just say it.

181
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:30,645
Don't stammer around
like a fuckin' spastic.

182
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:33,148
There's something
fucking wrong with that guy.

183
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:37,652
I feel it in my gut.
I'm worried about you,
skipper.

184
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:41,156
I'm sorry, mikey.
You're a good boy.

185
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:43,608
Fuck this.
I'm goin' to boca.

186
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,829
Deena, when you guys showed up
to verbum dei last year,

187
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:50,332
i thought,"soccer.
Give me a break."

188
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:54,836
But your dad makes it seem
like this, i don't know,
metaphor.

189
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:56,838
Yeah.
Yeah, dad's pretty cool.

190
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:59,841
You guys, where's al?
She was supposed to
loan me a cig.

191
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:02,344
I'll come with.

192
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:04,846
Al?
Ally!

193
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:08,850
Al!

194
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,355
If you're smoking,
you owe me five dollars!

195
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:15,357
Al?
Ally?

196
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,229
Ally?

197
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:24,232
- Ally, what are you doing?
- Ally!

198
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,368
Oh, my god! Ally!
Ally! Oh, my god!

199
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:33,625
Her parents split up.
That's why she spends
all her time at our house.

200
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,627
But the kid was born
with a silver spoon.

201
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,129
Teenage girls are
under a lot of stress.

202
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,132
I know this kid.
She's great.

203
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:45,637
Was it a genuine
suicide attempt, or was
it a suicidal gesture?

204
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:49,140
"Small cutting"
is the clinical term.

205
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,142
What's "large cutting"?
O. J. In the missing tracksuit?

206
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:54,145
It's a cry for help.

207
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:56,147
Ah.

208
00:11:56,147 --> 00:12:00,151
Her mother says she...
tried this before.

209
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:03,655
A couple times.

210
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:06,157
What else is going on
in your life?

211
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,276
Life is putting
the prozac to the test.

212
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,662
It's all that business that
keeps popping up in the news?

213
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:13,665
I'd rather talk about
my daughter.

214
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:16,167
Principal says girls in sports,
they do better.

215
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:19,671
They don't take the drugs,
they don't get knocked up.

216
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:21,673
But now this shit.

217
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,676
If my daughter ever tried
to kill herself--

218
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,048
oh, god!

219
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,559
Last week
i called you a whore.

220
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,063
I might've been...

221
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,565
overstatin' the case
a little bit.

222
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:56,207
Oo- hoo.
Mr. Soprano.

223
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:59,577
Miss sanfillipo.
I have a check here
for you to sign.

224
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:04,082
Twenty grand.
For research
and development...

225
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:06,468
into furthering
the art and science...

226
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:09,471
of metal and ceramic
joint fitting.

227
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:11,723
Where does our research
and development
take us this time?

228
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:14,225
I was thinking
boca raton.

229
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:17,979
My, my.
You read my mind.
I'm all packed, baby.

230
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,098
I gotta talk to my cousin.

231
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:23,101
Uh, mr. Soprano?
What?

232
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:27,105
I was waitin' to talk to jerry
about how i could use some, uh,
wiggle room...

233
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:29,741
on this mall job i got
in north bergen.

234
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:31,493
Then i saw you here.
And i thought,

235
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:35,497
"what the hell?
I may as well
ask the man himself."

236
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:37,499
Let's you and i meet.

237
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:40,001
I can pass my recommends
onto my cousin.

238
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:47,509
Hey, mama livia, how are you?
Do you remember me,
larry boy barese?

239
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:50,011
Well, i know
who you are!

240
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:54,015
You lit an apartment house
on fire...

241
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:56,518
and scared your mother
half to death.

242
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:59,637
Mama's moving in here
on the fifteenth.

243
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:02,140
I like your shoes,
larry boy.

244
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,894
Mama hasn't been well in
her mind. Last week she threw
a jar of artichokes at me.

245
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:08,897
She better not throw
any artichokes at me!

246
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:11,399
Ma, how you doin'?

247
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,902
- Remember larry?
- Water under the bridge.

248
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:16,404
Yeah. We're gonna take a walk.
We'll be right back.

249
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:18,406
You should get some shoes
like his.

250
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:22,410
I'll tell you somethin',
tony. You've always been
a fuckin' genius.

251
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,913
But this last move is
the best move you ever did.

252
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:27,415
The feds are never gonna
surveil an old folks home.

253
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:31,419
That's why i got six truckloads
of bootleg polident comin' in.

254
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:33,421
Hey, jimmy.
How you doin'?
There he is.

255
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,807
Did you get your mother
settled into a suite?

256
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:37,809
They're not sure they're
gonna accept her.

257
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,811
They wanna see my
financial statement again.

258
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:42,814
So this office supply chain
comin' up from virginia.

259
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:45,066
What's the deal on them?
I spoke to them.

260
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:48,570
I think they're gonna listen
to reason on minority hiring.

261
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:53,074
You been to games?
What've they got?

262
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:05,954
What the fuck?

263
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:10,842
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!

264
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:14,345
Knees high, colgiavani!
Eyes ahead!

265
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:16,347
Energy, girls, energy!

266
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:20,852
I know we're all upset about
all that's been going on, but
we still have a season left!

267
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:23,354
Come on!
Let's go!
Hey, coach.

268
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,857
Hey, fellas. Uh, sorry,
but practice is closed today.

269
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,860
I'm trying to
keep the team focused.
What're you doin'?

270
00:15:30,478 --> 00:15:34,232
You're leavin' us?
After two fuckin' years?

271
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:37,735
I told that reporter
to wait until after sectionals
before he put that in the paper.

272
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:41,623
Coach, look at my little girl
out there.

273
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:47,745
- You're breakin' her heart!
- Believe me, art.
I am hugely conflicted.

274
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:49,747
But rhode island
doubled my salary!

275
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:53,751
They're giving my daughter
a full ride!
What could i do?

276
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:58,006
- They made me an offer
i couldn't refuse.
- You haven't heard ours.

277
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,391
Come on, sil.
Look, buddy,
i got a family too.

278
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:03,394
I happen to have a daughter
who loves playing soccer
very much.

279
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:06,898
Just kiddin'
about the offer thing.

280
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:09,400
Hey, nobody blew a whistle!

281
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:12,403
Let's not get lazy
out here! Come on!

282
00:16:12,403 --> 00:16:16,157
- Why don't you
go fuck yourself?
- Excuse me?

283
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:18,776
Hey, med, want me
to tell your father--
this is my field.

284
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,915
Why don't you give me
ten laps around the goals!

285
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,667
Whatever.
Make that 20.

286
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,786
Anybody else
wanna mouth off?

287
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:33,791
Good! Come on!
Let's circle up
for keep- away!

288
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:36,544
Let's go! Over here!
Get in a big circle!

289
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:38,680
Go! Come on! Move it!

290
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,682
Out here!
I need some people out here!

291
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:42,934
Come on! Let's go!

292
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:57,448
Gimme your glass.

293
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:02,453
Who would've ever thought
we could've been
this contented?

294
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:06,958
I did. As soon
as i saw you, i knew.

295
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,460
You're a sweetheart.

296
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,464
If only they knew
the other side of you.

297
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:16,467
They'd eat me
for breakfast.
Mmm.

298
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:19,971
I've been lookin'
at some real estate.
Some nice houses on the market.

299
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,473
Maybe you'd like
something bigger.

300
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:25,977
No, corrado.
This is our place.

301
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:29,981
You know how long
we been comin' here?
Sixteen years.

302
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,983
And every one of them good.

303
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:37,989
How's junior, junior?
Hmm?

304
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:40,491
He's catching some shuteye.

305
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,495
Oh. You're such
a powerhouse.

306
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:47,498
When you kiss me
down there,

307
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:51,002
you're like
a great artist.

308
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:54,005
You got a real instinct
for it.

309
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:57,508
Pass me the red peppers.

310
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,022
You know the thrill
you give?

311
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:16,527
Just keep it to yourself,
okay, roberta?
Yeah.

312
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,529
All to myself.

313
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,541
Corrado?
Yeah?

314
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,543
Why the big secret?

315
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:36,547
About what?
Oral sex.

316
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:40,551
What's so terrible
about pleasing a woman?

317
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:47,058
You always have to
talk about everything.
I wanna know why!

318
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:50,061
It's complicated.
Yeah.

319
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:54,065
But why?
Why?

320
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,068
Because they think
if you'll suck pussy,
you'll suck anything.

321
00:18:57,068 --> 00:19:00,071
Oh, you're kidding.
It's a sign of weakness.

322
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:04,575
And possibly a sign
that you're afinocch'.

323
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:08,579
A fag?
That's ridiculous.

324
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,583
How would the two
even translate?

325
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:18,089
What are you gonna do?
I mean, i don't make the rules.

326
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:23,678
Hey, it's not big
lifestyle choice, shylockin'.

327
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:26,180
My aunts quintima
and gemma.

328
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,433
They got money out
earnin' on the street.
It's like bein' a banker.

329
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:31,936
You help people.

330
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:36,941
Chiara broke down in tears
when she heard the coach
was leaving.

331
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:39,443
You don't wanna
talk about it, fine.
No, i--

332
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:44,448
i gotta go pick up
carmela at her sister's.
Let me ask you a question.

333
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:47,451
Why does your wife hate me?
Charmaine doesn't hate you.

334
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,956
Yeah.

335
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,959
You lie
like i play the french horn.
What?

336
00:19:56,961 --> 00:20:01,465
Look at the fuckin'faccim
over here. Wearing a cap
in a nice restaurant like this.

337
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:06,971
That's one of the things
i hated most when i had
my restaurant.

338
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:11,475
It's values today.
Standards are crumbling.

339
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:16,981
Would it have killed
this coach to stick around
until my kid graduates?

340
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:19,483
Then let him stay four years
for chiara.

341
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:22,987
Hi.

342
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:26,240
That burns my ass.

343
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:30,244
Where you goin'?

344
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:34,248
That would be great.

345
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:38,252
- Take your hat off.
- Excuse me?

346
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:41,756
They don't sell hot dogs here.
They took the bleachers out
two years ago.

347
00:20:41,756 --> 00:20:43,758
It's my hat.
I'll wear it where i want.

348
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:03,277
How you doin'?

349
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:18,409
- Thank you.
- Look at him. Douche bag.

350
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,412
Good for you!

351
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:23,914
Um, send them a bottle
of montepulciano.

352
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:27,918
And, uh, get the license plate
of these two guys
sittin' behind artie.

353
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:29,920
Get the valet to do it.
They look like cops.

354
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:46,437
I hear a voice

355
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:49,440
well, look who's here!
Hi!

356
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:54,695
Tony, look who's here!
Alphonse, how you doin'?

357
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:57,448
Good. Yeah.
You feelin' better?

358
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:03,337
Gonna miss that
left foot of yours.
Tony.

359
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:07,341
No, it's okay, mr. Soprano.
I'm gonna play.
No shit.

360
00:22:07,341 --> 00:22:10,845
Pardon my french there.
You sure, ally?

361
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:14,849
Yeah, i-- i had a long talk
with coach hauser and--

362
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:19,353
i'm gonna play.
That's all.

363
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:22,356
- I told her she didn't have to.
- Just said she wanted to.

364
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:28,362
- Yeah.
- Did coach pressure you,
ally?

365
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:30,865
No, mrs. Soprano.
He would never do anything
like that.

366
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:33,367
How's he gonna pressure her?
He didn't have thecoglione
to stick around.

367
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,369
Dad.
What?

368
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:39,240
It's what we all wanted.

369
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:44,745
Okay. Right?
Long as everything's, uh--

370
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:48,249
look, we're trying
to watch this, guys, okay?

371
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,752
Kick ass, girls.
Right?

372
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:54,255
Good night.

373
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:17,778
Listen, roberta.
What i said earlier?

374
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:20,281
Mm- hmm.
I'm serious.

375
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:23,784
You discuss that with anyone,
we're gonna go ten rounds.

376
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:26,787
We just skimmed 20 thou
off the development fund,

377
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:29,790
and you're worried about
a littlelecca fica?

378
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,793
Will you keep it down?
All right.

379
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:37,298
I'll tell everyone
you're a good kisser.
I just won't say where.

380
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:40,301
That's my reputation
you're playin' with.

381
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:44,805
Honey, my lips are sealed.

382
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:48,309
Not too sealed, right?

383
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:52,313
Visual on corrado soprano
and female travel companion,

384
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:55,816
2200 hours, boca lounge.

385
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:12,216
Hey, hey, hey!
How's my boy today, huh?

386
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:15,219
Go, go, go!

387
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:19,723
I'm lookin' for, uh,
coach hauser?

388
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,726
That's me. Petey!
Come here!

389
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:26,597
A little somethin'
from your friends
at the bada bing club.

390
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:31,485
Brand new, surround sound,
hdtv compatible.

391
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:34,355
- Well, tell them thanks, but--
- this fucker's gettin' heavy.

392
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:37,858
If this is about rhode island,
tell your friends it's
a done deal. I already signed.

393
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:42,363
I don't know what it's about,
but the tv stays here.
Put it down.

394
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:44,365
No!

395
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:47,868
I mean it! Pick it up!
Get the goddamn thing
off my property!

396
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:50,871
Look, pal, i don't think
you quite understand.

397
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:52,873
Oh, i understand
only too well.

398
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:55,376
You tell your friends
i know all about them.

399
00:24:55,376 --> 00:24:57,878
If you did,
you'd do what they want.

400
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:01,882
Is that a threat?
How quickly things change.

401
00:25:01,882 --> 00:25:04,385
Let me tell you something,
guido--
my name is clarence.

402
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:08,389
I have friends in
law enforcement, and they
would call this extortion.

403
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,527
Come on.

404
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:19,033
You tell those assholes
don hauser will not be
intimidated!

405
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:22,036
I will not be threatened
or bribed!

406
00:25:22,152 --> 00:25:24,655
I go where i want to
when i want to!

407
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:29,159
Hey!

408
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:35,583
All day, every day,
85 and not one drop of rain.

409
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:38,085
Oh, and those nights.

410
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:41,472
Bobbi, you are so lucky
with this guy.
You have no idea.

411
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:43,224
He's a sweetheart
underneath it all.

412
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:46,477
I wish i could get lou
to be like him.

413
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:49,480
More sensitive,
if you know what i mean.

414
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,102
That coral looks good.
I don't understand why i always
have to ask him for oral sex.

415
00:25:56,604 --> 00:26:00,608
Not like you
and your corrado.
Bebe, listen.

416
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:03,360
I know we always used to
yak about our sex lives.

417
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:06,864
I think it would be better
if we didn't anymore.

418
00:26:06,864 --> 00:26:09,250
Okay.
I mean it.

419
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:13,120
Sure. It's just
you're lucky, that's all.

420
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:22,763
- So, ma, you gonna come
to the big game?
- Game?

421
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:26,267
What game?
Miss meadow's soccer team
is goin' to the sectionals.

422
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:30,771
- Nobody tells me anything.
- Everybody hear me just tell
my mother about the game?

423
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:35,025
Can anybody
think of anything else
to talk about except soccer?

424
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,028
All right. Uncle jun',
how was boca?

425
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:41,031
Wonderful.
I don't go down enough.

426
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:43,901
That's not what i heard.

427
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:47,404
About what?

428
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:51,909
Nothing. I'm sorry.
I-- i don't know
what i'm talkin' about.

429
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,412
- Last time, aunt bobbi
bought me a live piranha.
- You believe that was a piranha.

430
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:58,666
That woman is not your aunt!

431
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,168
Livia, i warned you.
Stata zit'.
Bobbi's a sweet, sweet girl.

432
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:05,673
- What the hell's
the matter with you? -

433
00:27:05,673 --> 00:27:08,175
what did i say?

434
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:10,811
This wife of yours.
She's got the giggles.

435
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:14,315
- Can i be excused?
- We just sat down.

436
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:17,685
- How are you gonna play
tomorrow, you don't eat?
- He's right. You need protein.

437
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:20,688
- No, i don't because i quit.
- You quit.

438
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:23,691
What are you talkin' about?
With ally back, you can
go to the state.

439
00:27:23,824 --> 00:27:26,327
A girl slits her wrists
and you can think about
is a game?

440
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:30,331
It wasn't like friggin' cobain.
It was just a little
suicidal gesture.

441
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:34,451
- Come back here!
- You're not excused!

442
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,587
Oh, let her go.
Go ahead, honey!

443
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:38,589
Ma!
Why don't you butt out?

444
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:41,842
Only time you act like
a grandmother is when
you wanna score some points.

445
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:48,849
I will not eat in this house.
Junior, take me home.

446
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,469
- I'm not finished.
- Youmangia, uncle jun'.
She'll come back.

447
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:59,109
The stukas and messerschmitts.

448
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:01,612
They have command
of the skies.

449
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:08,619
The stuka is quite
a formidable weapon.

450
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:12,623
I don't know.
I'm glad meadow quit.

451
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:16,126
That coach pushes them
to the brink.
It's unhealthy.

452
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:18,879
Well, what do we mean
when we talk about commitment?

453
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:21,382
And that asshole.
He thinks he can just
walk away?

454
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:23,500
Watch it, cowboy.
Don't start.

455
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:27,888
What was with you
and uncle jun' tonight?

456
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:30,758
You better not get
in that coach's face.
Tell me about uncle jun'.

457
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:32,760
No, no, stop it!
Stop it!

458
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,762
I can't, i can't.

459
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:37,264
Yes, you can.
I know you want to.
All right. Okay.

460
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:45,022
Gabby dante's cousin and bobbi
go to the same nail parlor.
And--

461
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:50,778
your uncle-- no, i shouldn't
say. I shouldn't!

462
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:53,163
Come on.
Okay, okay! Okay.

463
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,169
Well, let's just say...

464
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:03,674
your uncle has acquired
a taste for her.

465
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:07,928
Uncle jun' gives head.
World- class.

466
00:29:07,928 --> 00:29:11,432
The old man's whistlin'
to the wheat field?
Don't be disgusting.

467
00:29:11,432 --> 00:29:13,434
He's a bushman
of the kalahari!

468
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:17,438
That's why i don't tell you
anything. 'cause you
don't know when to stop.

469
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:19,940
Oh, my god,
if this ever gets out.

470
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,945
Like you don't do it,
or any of your friends.
Bunch of hypocrites.

471
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:28,949
Hey. What goes on
in this bedroom stays here,
and you know that.

472
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:33,954
Once a year?
I can resist the urge
to gossip.

473
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:48,085
Arthur? You're home?

474
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,587
The grease in that "fryolater."

475
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:53,090
I'm gonna smell like
a cheap french fry
for the rest of my life.

476
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,594
So this is why we scrimp
and save to send our kids
to that school, huh?

477
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:00,597
So that you can have our name
just dragged through the mud?

478
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:05,102
What?
Shelly hauser called me
this afternoon.

479
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:09,106
Your friends sent somewayos
down there with a stolen
tv set...

480
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:11,108
to try and bribe the coach.

481
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:13,610
From your friends
at bada bing.

482
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:18,749
As if a tv set is gonna
get somewhere with a man
like coach hauser!

483
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,751
A tv set?

484
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:25,255
Arthur, do you
honestly believe that
they're gonna stop there?

485
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:28,258
They tried
bribing this man.

486
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:31,762
What's next?
Always with
the extreme scenarios.

487
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:34,264
No, come on, arthur.
Tell me. What's next?

488
00:30:34,264 --> 00:30:36,266
You grew up
in the neighborhood.

489
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:40,270
Don't pretend
like you don't know what
tony soprano is capable of.

490
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:45,776
Who is it?
I found your dog.

491
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:57,037
What?
No, you're mistaken.
My dog is upstairs.

492
00:30:57,154 --> 00:31:00,657
Golden retriever,
blue nylon collar?

493
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:03,160
Honey, who is it?
Evenin', ma'am.

494
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:08,165
He has our dog.

495
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:11,168
Where's petey?
I thought he was locked in.
Yeah, come get him.

496
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:14,171
I wouldn't want petey
to get hit by a car.

497
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:33,941
Petey, petey!

498
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:36,944
You okay? Come here.
What, no reward?

499
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:40,948
Just kiddin'.
I'm an animal lover.

500
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,952
You okay, boy?

501
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:48,088
Med, you can cheer up
about the coach,

502
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,591
'cause i got a feelin'
he's gonna reconsider
the big move.

503
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:54,094
- Tony!
- Did you do something?

504
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:56,096
What could i do?
Point is...

505
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:59,099
he's gonna stick around
and finish what he started
with the girls, that's all.

506
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:05,606
That's it.
Well, did i tell you?

507
00:32:11,478 --> 00:32:13,981
You need to develop
some appreciation'cause you
got people all around you...

508
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:17,985
tryin' to help you and
all you do is bitch and moan!

509
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:21,989
I see this coach tryin' to
abandon his team. I see
your friends gettin' worked up.

510
00:32:21,989 --> 00:32:25,993
So i try to do somethin'!
Is that why you think
we're so upset, dad?

511
00:32:25,993 --> 00:32:29,997
Because a coach that most of us
can't even stand is leaving?

512
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:33,500
So, w- what difference
does that make? You don't have
to love him to be successful.

513
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:35,135
Catfish hunter
hated billy martin.

514
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:39,139
Bill parcells, his guys,
they can't stand him
till they start to win!

515
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:41,758
Coach hauser had sex
with ally!

516
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:45,646
What?
That's why she cut herself.

517
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:50,150
That's why i've been
practically living at her house.

518
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,653
All right,
hold on a minute.

519
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:55,656
Maybe--

520
00:32:55,656 --> 00:32:57,774
with ally?

521
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:03,163
Meadow,
this is horrible. This is
also a very serious accusation.

522
00:33:03,163 --> 00:33:06,533
- What exactly did ally say?
- That they had sex!

523
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:10,037
More than once! That she's
not a virgin anymore!

524
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:15,425
All right.

525
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:17,928
Ally's a very...
pretty girl.

526
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:20,681
Maybe there was--
maybe there was some confusion.

527
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:23,183
Maybe she wanted to...

528
00:33:23,183 --> 00:33:25,185
look like she was sophisticated
in you guys' eyes.
Dad!

529
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:31,191
What?
Tony! What if
this had been meadow?

530
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:33,560
What kind of confusion?

531
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,563
A girl that age, the coach
should not have been
in any position...

532
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:40,200
where there's even
a remote possibility
of confusion!

533
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:43,704
I'm losin'
my fuckin' mind here.

534
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,073
Tony, go downstairs,
will you, please,
so me and meadow can talk?

535
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:49,576
Jesus fuckin' christ!

536
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:51,828
God, now what did i do?

537
00:33:52,212 --> 00:33:56,216
Meadow.
Mom, i only told so he wouldn't
make coach hauser stay here.

538
00:33:56,216 --> 00:33:59,720
Meadow, this is
a horrible, horrible thing.

539
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,223
Mom, she's in love with him,
but he won't leave his wife.

540
00:34:03,223 --> 00:34:05,726
Leave his wife?
Meadow!

541
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:12,733
Now, meadow, he didn't
touch you, right?
No, but what about deena?

542
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:15,736
If she finds out
about her father,
it'll totally destroy her life.

543
00:34:15,736 --> 00:34:18,739
Just tell dad to let him go
anywhere he wants, okay?

544
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,241
Come here. Oh.

545
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:31,501
Moldonado and his brother,
they'll handle it.

546
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:34,504
Mal owes me a solid.

547
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:37,007
No. No hired help.

548
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:39,009
This is personal.

549
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:43,013
Very glad to hear you say that.
I'll give him a real
after- school special.

550
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:49,519
You outta
your fuckin' mind?
What?

551
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:52,889
I know you
kidnapped the coach's dog
and all that other shit.

552
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,392
But if you
do one more thing--
aw, shut up, arthur.

553
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:58,395
You know, you're
five fuckin' time zones
behind your own ass.

554
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:01,898
No, i'm fuckin' serious.
You hear me, tony?

555
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:04,901
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

556
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:07,904
You wanna hear serious?
You wanna know what your
wonderful fuckin' coach did?

557
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:13,410
He fucked little
ally vandermeed and who
knows who else he fucked.

558
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,662
What are you talkin' about?
"Fucked"?

559
00:35:18,665 --> 00:35:22,669
- That's crazy.
- That's why that kid slit
her wrists, youstunad'.

560
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:28,175
And my daughter should know
this shit, should have to
think about that filth?

561
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:30,177
No.
No.

562
00:35:30,677 --> 00:35:35,682
That self- righteous prick
put his dick in my little girl's
soccer teammate.

563
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:41,571
She's in eleventh grade,
for christ's sake.
Oh, my god.

564
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:45,325
Chiara. He drove her home from
the supermarket one night.

565
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:49,329
- Oh, my little girl.
- Fuckin' degenerate
son of a bitch.

566
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:52,332
He deserves to die.
Betrayin' children?

567
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:55,836
Artie, believe me,
he ain't gonna be
doin' that shit no more.

568
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:58,338
I guarantee you that.

569
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:09,716
He's in the pro shop!

570
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:16,723
I don't need a cart!

571
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:21,228
Nobody told you to put
my nephew under surveillance.

572
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,231
I know, junior.
I know.

573
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:27,234
I just wanted to be
on the safe side,
and i'm glad i did.

574
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:30,237
Because your nephew
is not just hangin' out
at that titty bar...

575
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:32,739
and goin' to his daughter's
soccer games.

576
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:36,243
Go ahead.
Twice last week...

577
00:36:36,243 --> 00:36:39,246
he goes toward
the medical center,
then they lose him.

578
00:36:39,746 --> 00:36:42,749
A girlfriend.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

579
00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:45,752
He's seein' this
russian slit, very open.

580
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:47,754
Your nephew
is talking to the feds.

581
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:51,758
Where else would he be goin'
where it would require
such precautions?

582
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:54,761
And what the fuck else
would be the big secret?

583
00:36:54,761 --> 00:36:56,763
What am i, a swami?

584
00:36:58,265 --> 00:37:00,767
Hey.

585
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:04,271
Silvio! You're lookin'
good. I like that hat.
Mikey palmice.

586
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:08,275
How you feel?

587
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:14,531
You shanked it, sil.
I still got the coach
on my mind.

588
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:20,537
We got fresh air,
sunshine, a beautiful day.
Forget about that shit.

589
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:24,541
- Thank god for golf some days.
- I'm trying to concentrate
here.

590
00:37:26,793 --> 00:37:30,297
- Did you get any golf in
down in boca, uncle jun'?
- Fuckin' manners! Please!

591
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:38,054
So you play, uh, manatee
or what's the name
of the other one?

592
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:43,059
Will you let the man tee off?
You yap worse than six barbers.

593
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:45,562
If you'd have shut up
during that game
against mountain lakes,

594
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:48,565
you wouldn't have missed
that fuckin' fly ball.

595
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:50,567
I was ashamed
to face my friends.

596
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:55,572
Good mikey. Better.

597
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:59,576
What do you mean,"better"?
Well, you know,
it's...better.

598
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:10,720
- Whoa, junior!
- "Whoa, junior" what?

599
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,974
Uncle junior's into muff.
What?

600
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:18,228
Oh, did i say "muff"?
I meant "rough."

601
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:23,233
Good shot.

602
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:29,489
What's that smell?
Did you guys go to a sushi bar?

603
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:32,242
What the fuck's
he talkin' about?
I don't know.

604
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:35,862
I thought you were
a baccala man, uncle jun'. What
are you doin' eatin' sushi?

605
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:39,499
You're fuckin' runnin' off
at the mouth, you know that?

606
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:43,870
South of the border?

607
00:38:44,371 --> 00:38:46,873
Down mexico way

608
00:38:46,873 --> 00:38:50,510
listen, my friend.
At least i can deal...

609
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,013
with my own problems,
unlike some i know.

610
00:38:53,013 --> 00:38:57,017
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Take it however you want.
Don't bullshit with me.

611
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:59,636
Guys, guys.
We here to play golf or what?

612
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,889
Come on.

613
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,392
South of the border?

614
00:39:05,892 --> 00:39:09,029
Where the tuna fish play

615
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:13,033
arthur.

616
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:15,535
Everybody's just so upset.

617
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:19,539
The mother's on sedatives.
She's completely
unable to deal.

618
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:22,042
The father was
in europe somewhere.
They haven't reached him.

619
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:26,046
The little girl, ally, she
thinks it's all her fault.

620
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:28,548
Lousy bastard. He's not
gonna get away with this.

621
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:31,051
You got that right.

622
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:33,553
What?

623
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:37,057
Hand me that bottle
of bug be gone,
will ya?

624
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:39,559
Arthur, what?

625
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:45,565
Somethin' goin' on,
artie?

626
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:48,435
Your mobster friend
gonna do somethin' crazy?

627
00:39:50,937 --> 00:39:53,940
If i had any balls,
i would do it myself.

628
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:57,444
Arthur, you do have balls.
That's why you're not like him.

629
00:39:57,944 --> 00:40:01,448
Fuck it. Fuck the world!

630
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:04,334
Artie, this isn't makin'
some slob take his hat off.

631
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:09,589
This is beating a man to death
or cutting his balls off
or what?

632
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:12,842
You can't tell me coach hauser
doesn't deserve it!

633
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:17,347
Okay, but-- listen to you.
Think about what you're saying.

634
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:19,215
Yeah, you tell me.

635
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:23,219
Who's worse? Tony soprano
or that child- molesting fuck?

636
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,223
I trusted him.
I'd like to rip his heart
out of his chest!

637
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:31,111
Jesus christ, arthur.
I cannot believe you only
think about yourself!

638
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:35,365
Myself? Myself?

639
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:38,985
I resent that, charmaine!

640
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,132
Junior, what the fuck?
What's the matter?

641
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:57,137
What? That bullshit
with the sushi?

642
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:03,643
Nah, i-- i don't know
what he was talkin' about.
He, uh, he babbles.

643
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,762
What was that?
You're another one!

644
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:09,015
Me? Hey, he completely
lacked respect.

645
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:11,518
Sick and tired of having to
make excuses for him
all the time.

646
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:14,521
- It isn't right.
- It's'cause he's
a fucking mental weakling.

647
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:17,023
- I know.
- You don't know shit, mikey!

648
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:25,915
He's seein' a psychiatrist,
for christ's sake.
How about that, huh?

649
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:30,420
My nephew
is seein' a psychiatrist.
Makes me wanna cry.

650
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,425
- No shit?
- Indictment's being prepared.
He's spilling his guts.

651
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:38,928
- I fuckin' knew it.
- No, you didn't
fuckin' know it!

652
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:41,931
I just told you.

653
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:47,437
God knows how much of
our family business he airs.
If the place is bugged--

654
00:41:47,937 --> 00:41:49,439
that stuff's not admissible.

655
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:54,444
It's that, uh, that, that
doctor/patient privilege,
just like us and melvoin.

656
00:41:54,444 --> 00:41:57,947
Melvoin's a lawyer.
He's in the fuckin' ballpark.

657
00:41:57,947 --> 00:42:00,450
Suppose this shrink
gets scared or somethin'?

658
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,453
Do you remember those fuckin'
escovedo brothers, whoever
the fuck, in california?

659
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:07,957
They whacked their parents?
Their shrink was in
a fuckin' witness chair.

660
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:10,960
Shit.

661
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:16,466
Anthony wants to play games,
okay.

662
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:19,969
I taught him games.

663
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,472
I taught him
how to play baseball.

664
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:27,977
You talking
about clippin' him?

665
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:30,480
Nobody would slap my wrist
if i did.

666
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:35,068
There's guys in prison
that have done half the damage
this prick has.

667
00:42:35,568 --> 00:42:39,439
The judicial system has gotten
much better in dealing with
sexual predators.

668
00:42:39,439 --> 00:42:41,441
Oh, yeah.
Let's impeach him.

669
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:43,443
If you're telling me of intent
to harm this person,

670
00:42:43,443 --> 00:42:47,447
i must warn you of my duty
to alert law enforcement.

671
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,083
I don't know why
i tell you anything.
I'm interested...

672
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:53,703
in why you feel punishing
this man falls upon you.

673
00:42:53,953 --> 00:42:56,339
- Well, it sure doesn't
fall upon you.
- What do you mean?

674
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,341
What would you do?
You'd call the cops,

675
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:01,344
who'd get some judge
who'd give him
psychiatric counseling.

676
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:03,346
So maybe he could talk about
his unhappy childhood...

677
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:07,467
and we could have sympathy
for the fuck'cause he's
the real victim here, right?

678
00:43:07,467 --> 00:43:10,853
You know what you do? Stick
your head in the sand'cause
that's what people like you do.

679
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:13,473
Discredit psychology
all you want,

680
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:15,975
but i continue
to ask the question:

681
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:21,364
Why do you think
you, anthony soprano,
always has to set things right?

682
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:32,492
Hey, paulie. Is tony in?
Tony!

683
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:34,994
- Artie!
- Hey, ton', i gotta talk to ya.

684
00:43:35,495 --> 00:43:38,247
- Kinda busy right now.
- I gotta talk to you.

685
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:42,885
All right, we'll, uh,
finish later, all right?

686
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:57,900
Come on in.
Hey.

687
00:44:03,406 --> 00:44:07,910
It's about, uh, the thing.

688
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,413
You know what?

689
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,533
Nothing's happened yet,
has it?

690
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:17,670
Just gotta make the call.
I'm savorin' the moment.

691
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,922
- You gotta call it off.
- Don't worry about it.

692
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:22,425
You got nothin' to do
with it. You don't
go nowheres near this.

693
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:26,295
I don't care about that!
It's wrong, tony.

694
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:30,800
You can't do it.
It's wrong?
Oh, what he did isn't?

695
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:33,436
I'm beggin' you.
I hate the guy too.

696
00:44:35,054 --> 00:44:37,440
What do you wanna do,
artie?

697
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,444
You wanna call the cops?
Here. Here's the phone.

698
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:45,565
They'll arrest him, right?
He'll get out in two fuckin'
years, move to saskatchewan.

699
00:44:45,565 --> 00:44:49,569
Then you know what he'll do?
He'll teach girls' soccer,
and he'll start all over again.

700
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:53,956
You don't think
i wanna rip him apart
like a fuckin' chicken?

701
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:57,460
I drove by his house.
I almost got out.

702
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,462
But you didn't.

703
00:44:59,962 --> 00:45:03,583
Something happens to him,
who's it gonna help, huh?
His daughter?

704
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:08,087
That girl? No, you, tony.

705
00:45:08,087 --> 00:45:10,590
And silvio and me and whoever.

706
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,092
It's just gonna
make us feel better.

707
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:17,597
So don't even think about
calling this justice.
Leave it to the cops.

708
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:20,099
Let me ask you a question.

709
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:24,103
Who the fuck do you think
you are comin' in here,
talkin' to me like this?

710
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:28,107
Now your boyfriend
is finished.
You deal with it.

711
00:45:28,107 --> 00:45:31,611
Okay?
Tony, don't do it.

712
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:35,114
This is me asking you.
Why don't you
get the fuck outta here?

713
00:45:35,114 --> 00:45:38,618
Come on.
Get the fuck out!
Go!

714
00:45:38,618 --> 00:45:41,621
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

715
00:45:54,634 --> 00:45:57,136
Oh, yeah

716
00:45:57,136 --> 00:45:59,138
oh, yeah

717
00:46:08,397 --> 00:46:09,899
dewayne, dewayne

718
00:46:19,792 --> 00:46:21,794
woke up

719
00:46:24,797 --> 00:46:26,799
yeah

720
00:46:36,058 --> 00:46:38,060
yeah

721
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:49,188
yeah

722
00:46:53,192 --> 00:46:55,695
dewayne

723
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:02,585
corrado.

724
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:07,590
I was worried! You usually
call me when you're this late.

725
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:13,095
I bought us some
barbecued chicken, some salad
and some lemon meringue pie.

726
00:47:13,095 --> 00:47:15,097
But i got so hungry,
i had a piece.

727
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:18,100
Did i tell you
to keep your mouth shut?
What?

728
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,103
Did i tell you to keep
your goddamned mouth shut?

729
00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:24,106
No, corrado, don't hit me!

730
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:42,375
You stupid, fucking,
blabbermouth cunt!

731
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:45,878
I don't understand.

732
00:47:45,878 --> 00:47:48,381
Get your pencils
and your crap and
the rest of your shit...

733
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:51,884
and don't be here tomorrow!

734
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:55,755
Oh, no, corrado, don't leave!
I love you!

735
00:47:57,757 --> 00:48:00,259
I am so sorry!

736
00:48:00,393 --> 00:48:02,395
No, corrado!

737
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,668
Yeah.
You there at the place?

738
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:27,670
Is he in the house?
Yeah.

739
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,673
Fuck it. Walk away.

740
00:48:30,673 --> 00:48:32,675
Just fuckin' walk away.
Don't do it.

741
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:34,677
Fuck!

742
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:36,679
All right.
Leave it alone.

743
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:39,181
Yeah, no problem.

744
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:41,684
Son of a bitch.

745
00:48:42,184 --> 00:48:44,186
Lynn, we are here live
as colleagues and neighbors...

746
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:48,307
were shocked to hear of charges
brought against donald hauser,

747
00:48:48,441 --> 00:48:51,444
coach of the
verbum dei high school
girls' soccer team.

748
00:48:51,944 --> 00:48:54,447
Alerted by a student friend
of the alleged victim,

749
00:48:54,814 --> 00:48:57,450
whose name cannot be revealed
because of her age,

750
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:59,952
police issued a warrant for
hauser's arrest this evening.

751
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,333
Tony.
In my hometown

752
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:16,836
tony, jesus.
Where i live

753
00:49:16,836 --> 00:49:20,339
you smell like
lord calvert.

754
00:49:23,843 --> 00:49:25,845
Tony.

755
00:49:28,848 --> 00:49:31,350
We don't talk
we all get together

756
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,354
any kind of weather
and we do the camel walk

757
00:49:42,862 --> 00:49:47,366
what is with you tonight?

758
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:49,502
Tony, what is this?

759
00:49:49,502 --> 00:49:52,505
Oh, jesus.

760
00:49:52,505 --> 00:49:56,008
Mixed with alcohol.
Oh, tony, that's wonderful.

761
00:49:56,008 --> 00:50:00,629
- Happy trails.
Here, let's get you to bed.
- Carmela.

762
00:50:00,629 --> 00:50:03,132
Carmela.

763
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:06,635
I didn't hurt nobody.

764
00:50:20,282 --> 00:50:22,284
Call the shrink.

765
00:50:22,785 --> 00:50:24,787
Tell her the town's gonna go
to the fuckin' mormons.

766
00:50:48,894 --> 00:50:50,996
I hear a voice

767
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:56,035
from the back of the room

768
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:00,906
i hear a voice

769
00:51:00,906 --> 00:51:03,609
cry out

770
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,178
