1
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:08,524
John gotti.
Life in prison.

2
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:11,393
No chance of parole.

3
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:13,896
We've seen arrests
and prosecutions...

4
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:17,399
in florida and elsewhere
of top mob figures.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,402
What are you doin'?
Put that back.

6
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:24,907
- What's the situation
on the ground today,

7
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:27,409
right now, in the mob?

8
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:31,663
Confusion, instability,
vacuum at the top.

9
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:34,666
What caused the decline?
Your sister's ass.

10
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:39,805
An aggressive government policy
over two decades
to behead the crime families.

11
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:42,307
But wasn't it,
at least in part,

12
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:45,811
a disregard
within the mob itself...

13
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:50,065
of the rules
that served the old dons
so well?

14
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:52,067
The shoe fits.
Oh, no doubt.

15
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:56,071
So, cheer me up,
babe.

16
00:00:56,071 --> 00:01:00,576
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me back in.

17
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:03,579
Huh? Is that pacino
or is that pacino?

18
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:06,582
- Fuckin' spittin' image.
- Vincent rizzo.
- Yes.

19
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:09,451
Former soldier
in the genovese family.

20
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:12,704
Government witness
turned best- selling author.

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,842
- Do you agree
with u. S. Attorney braun?
- The party's over.

22
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:18,844
He is a wiseguy.
Please elaborate.

23
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:21,346
It's not like it was.
Cloning.

24
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:24,349
- Mexicans are huge in that.
- Fascinating, gotta admit it.

25
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:27,352
'Cause they work
as parking valets.

26
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:31,723
Do i mean that organized crime
is just gonna pack its bags
voluntarily...

27
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:33,725
and go the way
of the dodo bird?

28
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,112
Vincent, they're not
going the way of the dodo bird--
what you talkin' about?

29
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:39,615
- Mexicans.
- What about them?

30
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:43,118
- Cell phones.
- I'm not talkin'
about clonin' cell phones.

31
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,622
Jesus. I'm talkin'
about fuckin' sheep, science.

32
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:50,125
I tell my kids,
"only god can make a life."

33
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,128
Guy here asks,"what if
they had cloned princess di?"

34
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:59,001
But, you know, the heyday,
the golden age or whatever
of the mob?

35
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:02,137
That's gone,
and that's never comin' back.

36
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:05,641
And they have only themselves
to blame.

37
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:09,144
Ah, va a napoli.
They pay thischiacchierone
by the word?

38
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,647
- I think
it's drug trafficking.
- Oh!

39
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:16,401
I think that ruined everything.
You're lookin' at
a mandatory 35 to life...

40
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:20,272
in prison, and guys started
to rat on each other just so
they could avoid prosecution.

41
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:23,408
What's goin' on with
that princess di thing?

42
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,912
Do you think the royal family
had her whacked?

43
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:29,915
Last time i take a fuckin' limo
in paris.

44
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:33,535
- Like you were
ever in paris, paulie.
- I went over for a blow job.

45
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:37,539
Your mother was
working the bonbon concession
at the eiffel tower.

46
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,543
So, did you hear what
i told him? I told him
i went over for a blow job.

47
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:44,546
"Your mother was
workin' the bonbon concession
at the eiffel tower."

48
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:47,549
Got a list of people
long as my leg
i wouldn't want cloned.

49
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:50,185
The fuckin' mayor of new york,
that's the guy least likely
to get cloned.

50
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:53,055
So, the code of silence
or theomerta...

51
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:56,441
or whatever you wanna call it
just went by the boards.

52
00:02:56,942 --> 00:03:00,062
You're always
gonna have organized crime,
always.

53
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:03,065
As long as the human being
has certain appetites...

54
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:07,069
for gambling, pornography
or whatever,

55
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:10,072
someone's always gonna surface
to serve these needs.

56
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:15,577
Always.
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me back in.

57
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:09,908
- You got dvd players
in back?

58
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:13,412
Don't hurt me, man.
Only people get hurt, the ones
who try to be fuckin' jerk- offs.

59
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:17,165
Okay? Now, step down,
nice and easy. Come on.
Move it.

60
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:19,167
Come on.
He's got the dvd players.

61
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:23,171
Hey, quick and painless.
Nobody wants to hurt your ass.
Okay, but you gotta tie me up.

62
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,174
You gonna be a jerk- off now?
My boss is gonna think
i'm in on it.

63
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:28,293
What? Do we look like
we're tryin' for a merit badge?

64
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:32,798
- We travel around with rope?
- I've got some in the cab.
Please. I need this job.

65
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:35,801
- Jesus christ. Get a rope.
- I don't know who in
the company gave up the route,

66
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,805
but there's no way
i could walk away unscathed
without being fired.

67
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,808
- You wanna be scathed?
- Yeah, so it looks like
i didn't give up...

68
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,444
without a struggle.

69
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:52,451
- Oh!
- That's cool.
Thank you, man.

70
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:56,455
- That- that's enough.
- No. Wait.

71
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:00,959
Cool. That's cool.

72
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,962
Scathed? Scathed.
Scathed.

73
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,420
Mr. Miller,
my science teacher,
he got his car stolen.

74
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,922
You're kidding.
From where? His house?

75
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,924
Mm- mmm. Right
from his parking spot
at school.

76
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,428
A saturn. He only
had it, like, a year.

77
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:21,430
The security people
at the school are a joke.

78
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,934
Did you hear
what anthony jr. Just said?
Mr. Miller's car got stolen.

79
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:28,570
Refresh my memory.
Who's he again?

80
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,073
Your son's science teacher?

81
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:37,579
- You're up early, dad.
- He just bought that car
a year ago.

82
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:41,450
- So? Insurance'll pay.
- Yeah, but they don't
give full value.

83
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,202
These poor teachers,
they don't make a lot.

84
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:47,205
So he can work
a summer vacation.
Yeah.

85
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:50,342
- Maybe you could help find it.
- Funny.

86
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:53,345
I thought i told you
i changed my name from lojack
to anthony soprano.

87
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:56,965
Laugh. I thought i'd pee
my pants. Seriously, though,
pussy's got the body shop.

88
00:06:56,965 --> 00:07:00,102
- He couldn't ask around?
-
i'm late.

89
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:03,605
What are you
getting in science?
D+.

90
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:06,108
See what i can do.

91
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:09,728
That's not what i meant.
He's gotta work for his grades.

92
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:23,492
I'm going
back to bed.
Bye, dad.

93
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:26,378
See you later.

94
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:29,247
Here. Eat this.

95
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:39,758
Technology comes
to the bing!

96
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:41,760
Hey, christopher,
where you been?

97
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,262
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.

98
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:47,766
Hey. Is the load here?
- Yeah.

99
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,270
Georgie,
if a guy named serge calls,
you tell him i'll be right back.

100
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,773
Ton',
these new phone systems--
hold, conference--

101
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:58,660
- sometimes i get confused.
- How complicated is it?

102
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,662
You answer the phone;
you take the fuckin' message.

103
00:08:00,662 --> 00:08:05,033
The voice mail only comes on
if you let the phone ring.
Jesus christ, georgie.

104
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:17,679
- I hear there's not as many
titles available as on laser.
- There's more comin', though.

105
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,682
My internist told me
the picture's not that different
from the laser either, ton'.

106
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:23,185
But the sound?
Way improved.

107
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,687
Good.
'Cause nothin' beats...

108
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,690
poppin' up
some orville redenbacher's
and listenin' tomen in black.

109
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,193
All right. Fuck it.
Hey. No, no. It's the
goddamn wires, that's all.

110
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:34,196
I'll be glad to hook it up,
ton'. You know, i used
to be an installer.

111
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:43,572
Why can't you
be nice to brendan?
We discussed that.

112
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,711
Ton', i was just gonna
come lookin'. It's
the guy...for you.

113
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:52,214
Serge?
I'll take it over there.

114
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,722
Serge?

115
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:06,228
You press "hold"
when you transfer a call.

116
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,980
I'm sorry, tony.

117
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:17,606
- Now he's not gonna call back.
- Brend's a good earner, t.
This jack was his plan.

118
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:21,109
Yeah, he's a good kid, but i
don't like that methamphetamine.

119
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,997
Fuck. I gotta
call my mother.

120
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,873
Hello?
Hello? Ma?

121
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:38,376
Ah, look who calls!

122
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:41,379
How you doin'?
I was wonderin' when
you were gonna call.

123
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:45,267
Well, you can stop
wonderin' now. This is it.
I'm callin' ya.

124
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:48,770
Uh, i called you yesterday,
remember? You were supposed
to call me back?

125
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:53,775
I phoned your house.
Some operator
answered the phone.

126
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,777
I couldn't understand
a word she was saying.

127
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:57,646
Ma, how many times
i gotta tell ya?
That's not an operator.

128
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:02,033
That's an answering machine.
Oh, fancy, fancy.

129
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:05,537
Here. Let me turn the heat off
under these mushrooms.

130
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,545
You and my mother,
you're like two peas in a pod.

131
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:17,666
She can't master the phone
either, but she's 70 years old.
What's your fuckin' excuse?

132
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:27,425
What is she doin' now?

133
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,935
Oh, my god.

134
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:40,438
Oh, my god!
Ma.

135
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,442
Ma?

136
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:48,947
Hey, ma!

137
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,952
Oh, my god!
Ma?

138
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:57,339
Where the hell is she?
Who is this?

139
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:00,842
It's anthony.
The mushrooms--
they're on fire.

140
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,461
All right, ma. Get
the fire extinguisher under
the sink, the one i gave you.

141
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:07,215
- Get it.
- Oh, my god! The wall's
gettin' all black!

142
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,467
All right, ma.
Hang up and call 911.

143
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,469
Ton', the guy's
on the second line.

144
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:14,606
Aren't you coming over?
Press "hold," goddamn it!

145
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:16,975
Listen, ma.
I can't come over.
I'm 40 minutes away.

146
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:20,478
You hang up, call 911
and leave the house.

147
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:23,114
Look at how i live.

148
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:26,484
Ma, hang up
and call 911.

149
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,994
Hello?
Carmela, my mother's
got a fire in the kitchen.

150
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:39,247
Oh, my god.
She's callin' 911.
Can you get over there?

151
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:42,884
Yeah. I'm on my way.
Thank you, baby.
I know you're busy.

152
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:47,005
Serge. Serge? Listen.
I can't talk to you
right now.

153
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:50,392
I gotta go
to an outside line.
Give me your number.

154
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:54,646
All right. All right.
I'll call you back.

155
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:58,400
Is your mom okay?
This shit cannot go on
like this.

156
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:03,905
Hey, t. Hey, t.
This teacher--
they stole his car.

157
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:08,910
You got a plate number?
Call my wife.

158
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:15,667
Have a nice day, ma'am.
Thanks, fellas.

159
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,169
No problem.

160
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:26,678
Ma,

161
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:30,181
i wish you would let me
get somebody in here
to help you.

162
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:33,685
You shouldn't be alone.
Help me what?

163
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:39,307
- With the housework.
- I have my ways.

164
00:12:39,307 --> 00:12:42,310
A stranger could care less
about doing it right.

165
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:46,948
Can i tell you something,
though, ma?
You need company.

166
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:50,952
Now, don't start with that
nursing home business again.

167
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:54,456
This is not a nursing home.
It is a retirement community.

168
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:04,833
You want me to make you
a littlepastin, put a little
something in your stomach?

169
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:12,340
Ma, i've told tony...

170
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,845
and i've told you many times.

171
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:21,483
- You can always
come and live with us.
- I know when i'm not wanted.

172
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:27,605
I just invited you to come and
share my home. If you want me
to beg, that's different.

173
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:32,110
Leave this place...

174
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,612
that my husband
and i shared?

175
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:37,615
Change can be a positive.

176
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:41,119
He was a saint.

177
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:49,127
That son of mine, is he
still having those fits?

178
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:53,882
They're not fits, ma.
They're anxiety attacks.

179
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:56,384
He's on medication.

180
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:06,060
What bmw's
charging us for paint?

181
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,565
- Been that way
for six months.
- When was i last here?

182
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:14,068
Hey...

183
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,572
we maybe
caught a break here, boss.

184
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,574
Shop on watchung avenue...

185
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,460
said some guy's brought in
a saturn with these plates,
tryin' to unload it for parts.

186
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:26,331
Are you tellin' everybody this
fuckin' car's for tony soprano,
and leave it in one piece?

187
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:29,717
Yeah. Sure.
It's for the kid's teacher.

188
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:33,221
My guys said that
one of those goofballs
had a uniform on...

189
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:36,090
from, uh, buttfucks.

190
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,977
Whatever. The coffee shop.
I guess the guy works there.

191
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:42,347
Watchung avenue
and what?

192
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:46,351
I'm fuckin' rockford
over here.

193
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:54,609
Decaf cappuccino prima
nonfat magnifico,
double espresso regolare.

194
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:57,111
I'll take you
over here, sir.

195
00:14:57,612 --> 00:15:02,116
Um, i think
i'll have an espresso.
Paulie, you want anything?

196
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:07,121
- They got any just coffee?
- Our cafe du jour
is new zealand peaberry.

197
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:10,124
Marrone. Whatever.

198
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,127
That's 4. 20.
Pick it up over there.
One medium du jour.

199
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:16,631
One single espresso regolare.
Yeah. Keep it.

200
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:20,134
Du jour, espresso, coming up.
- Honey, let me ask you.

201
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:23,638
My wife was in the body shop
around the corner on
watchung avenue the other day.

202
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:27,642
The guy in front of her leaves,
and she sees he dropped...

203
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:30,645
his money clip,
but he was already gone.

204
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:33,147
And we'd like
to get it back to him.

205
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:37,151
She said he was wearing
a uniform like that there.

206
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:40,154
Real black hair, she said,
tall, little earring.

207
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:44,158
- I'm sorry, sir, but
these stores are everywhere.
- Tell me about it.

208
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:53,051
Fuckin' italian people.
How did we miss out
on this?

209
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:56,554
What?
Fuckin' "expresso,"
cappuccino.

210
00:15:56,554 --> 00:16:00,058
We invented this shit,
and all these other cocksuckers
are gettin' rich off it.

211
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:04,062
Yeah. Isn't it amazing?
It's not just the money.
It's a pride thing.

212
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:07,065
All our food.
Pizza. Calzone.

213
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:09,567
Buffalo mozzarella.
Olive oil.

214
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:14,572
These fucks had nothin'. They
ate poopsie before we gave'em
the gift of our cuisine.

215
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:20,194
But this, this is the worst,
this "expresso" shit.
Take it easy.

216
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:25,199
So she finally agreed
to have somebody
come in days.

217
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,705
Carmela called an agency,
and they sent over
this trinidadian woman.

218
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:35,710
No matter what i do,
i feel guilty.

219
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,712
Why?

220
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:43,217
Well, the real reason is
i know i can't let her
live with us.

221
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:47,105
That doesn't
seem very practical,
given her personality.

222
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:51,609
It's my wife.
She won't allow it.

223
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:53,861
Where are your sisters
in all of this?

224
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:58,366
Oh, they cut it off with her
a long time ago. No way
she's bunkin' with them.

225
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:03,371
So you're carrying
all this guilt when your mother
is clearly someone...

226
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:06,874
who has great difficulty
in maintaining a relationship
with anyone.

227
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:13,381
But she's my mother.
You're supposed to take care
of your mother.

228
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:18,886
- She's a little old lady.
- Not to you.
She's very powerful.

229
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:22,890
- Bullshit.
- You accord
this "little old lady"...

230
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:26,394
an almost mystical ability
to wreak havoc.

231
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:29,897
Let me tell ya something.
You definitely don't
wanna get her started.

232
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:32,900
There are some people who...

233
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,404
are not ideal candidates
for parenthood.

234
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:38,406
Come on.
She's an old sweetie pie.

235
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:43,411
What were some
of the good experiences
you remember as a child?

236
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:46,914
The loving, warm ones.

237
00:17:56,924 --> 00:17:59,927
One time we were down
at the shore,

238
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:03,431
about'68, '69,
the whole family.

239
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:08,936
My father, he tripped
and he fell down the stairs,
and we were all laughin'.

240
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:12,940
The whole family was laughin'.
My mother was laughin'.

241
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:16,944
Any other loving experiences?

242
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:19,447
Hey, she's a good woman.

243
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:23,451
She put food
on that table every night.

244
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:26,954
I'm the ungrateful fuck
'cause i come here
and complain about her,

245
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,958
and i let my wife
exclude her from my home.

246
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,091
Hey, ma?

247
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:51,596
You perrilyn?
Yes.

248
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:54,599
Tony soprano.
Ah.

249
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,101
How you doin'?
I'm fine, thank you.

250
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:02,607
Olivia, your son is here!

251
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:07,495
Isn't he a handsome thing?
And look what he brought!

252
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:13,501
Listen. Let's
get one thing straight.

253
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:19,006
In the hours you're here
takin' care of my mother,
no ganja, okay?

254
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:22,009
Hey, ma! Fiore!

255
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,014
I'm not dead,
unfortunately for some.

256
00:19:27,014 --> 00:19:30,017
The tall ones
are delphiniums.

257
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:33,020
You know, frankie valli,
when he visits jersey,

258
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,523
this is the florist
he uses.

259
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:40,027
Aren't they beautiful?
You want me to put them on
the dining room table, olivia?

260
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:43,898
You make sure
the bottom of that vase
isn't wet.

261
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:49,036
- Mr. Tony, would you
like some tea or something?
- Coke. Thanks.

262
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:58,546
So how's it
goin' today?

263
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:01,916
- She's stealing.
- Who?

264
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,418
That ditsoon,"who."

265
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:09,924
That beautiful plate
that aunt settimia took
from that restaurant in rome--

266
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:12,426
it's gone.

267
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,929
I don't know, ma.
She seems like a nice person.

268
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,932
She doesn't fool me
for a second.

269
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:28,943
Sure she stole it?
Sure you didn't give it
to one of the relatives?

270
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:32,446
You keep forcing
your possessions on people,
thinkin' you're gonna die.

271
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:35,950
I wish it was tomorrow.

272
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:45,710
- Who does she think she is?
- She's happy, ma.
She's singin'.

273
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,214
Anthony, i don't
want her around here.
I can manage somehow.

274
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:55,469
No. No. I'm not cavin'
into you this time. She stays.

275
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:04,478
Your uncle called here
lookin' for ya.

276
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:08,366
- Uncle jun'?
- He sounded agitated.

277
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:14,739
Jackie,
you're the boss. Tell'em
to leave comley trucking alone.

278
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:17,491
Didn't know
it was a comley truck.

279
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:22,496
For 21 fuckin' years, comley's
been puttin' food on my table.
Protection money.

280
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:25,383
- Chris didn't know goin' in.
- Bullshit.

281
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:28,386
You want my dvd player?
You can watchgrumpy old men.

282
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:33,391
- You're gonna be a fuckin'
funny boy too, now, huh?
- Hey, you're sopranos.

283
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:35,893
But, jackie, you go around
hopin' you and your uncle
can settle a thing,

284
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:38,396
just the two of you,
not be invited to
a fuckin' sit- down.

285
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:41,899
You got fuckin' chiricahuas
workin' for you. You don't
control'em.

286
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,903
- Here we go.
- Jackie, you got a ruler?

287
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,909
The kids who hit that truck,
they make restitution to junior.

288
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,413
Done. It's done.

289
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:00,918
Christopher montisanti's
a fuckin' loose cannon.
And that filone kid--

290
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:04,422
- for this, you get a man
out of a sick bed?
- Hey, fuck that shit.

291
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:11,929
Giacobbe,
how you feelin'?

292
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:14,932
I may be acting boss
while the old man's
a guest of the government,

293
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:18,436
but i wish somebody'd
tell my bowels,
'cause they don't obey.

294
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:24,442
The fuckin' chemo.

295
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:28,946
- Maybe i should
name a successor.
- This day and age?

296
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:32,450
Who wants the fuckin' job?

297
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,453
Your mom tells me
you got a girl comin' in
to help?

298
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:39,957
That's good.

299
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:42,960
All right. I gotta go.

300
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,330
I'll see you soon.
Okay.

301
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,336
We okay?
All right.

302
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:58,092
A smoke he hires
for his own mother.

303
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:04,231
Hey, mikey,
how's the boy?

304
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:06,233
What boy is that, ton'?
The one you sleep with.

305
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:09,236
Ohh.
I was just kiddin' ya.
How you doin'?

306
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:11,238
I'm all right.
How's my uncle
treatin' ya?

307
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:13,741
We're coverin' our nut.
Hey, your nephew, what's he,
retarded?

308
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:16,744
He likes to play
with trucks or somethin'?
"Retarded"?

309
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:20,247
What if jerry lewis heard
you talkin' like that?
Oh, that's muscular dystrophy.

310
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:23,751
It's too bad
they don't have a telethon
for fuckface- itis, huh?

311
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:28,255
They found a cure yet?
Come on. I was just
kidding you.

312
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:30,257
Come on.
You're a good sport.
Come on. All right.

313
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:32,760
You all right?
You all right?
Yeah. I'm all right.

314
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,262
You all right? Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.

315
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:40,935
Double cappuccino
suprema.
Double
cappuccino suprema.

316
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:47,441
Excuse me.
Large nonfat latte.

317
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:50,694
A guy fittin' the description
does work in this here branch.

318
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:54,698
His name is eduardo arnaz.
Him and his gay lover
both work here,

319
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:57,318
and i got the address.

320
00:23:57,318 --> 00:24:00,821
Paulie,
you listenin' to me?
Yeah.

321
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:03,824
Oh, again with the rape
of the culture.

322
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:07,328
Can we go find
these spice girls already
and get this over with?

323
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:12,967
Two small cafe du jours.

324
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:15,836
Half cap on one.

325
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:24,478
What?

326
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:27,982
That's it!
What happened?

327
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:32,987
Beats me.
Did you say something
to her?

328
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:37,992
I know how
to talk to people.
These blacks.

329
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:40,995
Who knows what they're
gonna take the wrong way.

330
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:43,998
So she's gone.

331
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:48,869
Traffic and weather together
on this tuesday morning.

332
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:52,122
Here's heather in the chopper.
Over here on the west side,

333
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:55,626
the delay again this morning
at the inbound lincoln tunnel--

334
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:59,129
about a 25- minute delay
if you're approaching it
near route 3.

335
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:02,633
The queue there beginning
just before the bergen viaduct.

336
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:06,770
You got your marching orders
yesterday. Why didn't you
pay the man his restitution?

337
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,773
Restitution, okay, but
you know how much he wants,
your uncle?

338
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:14,278
Fifteen dollars.
Hey, you jacked the wrong truck,
that's what happens.

339
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:21,151
I didn't notice you
rushin' to give back
your fuckin' dvd player.

340
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:25,906
Matter of fact, i'm enjoying it
very much. I screened
the bank dicklast night.

341
00:25:25,906 --> 00:25:29,293
- "Did you warble,
my little wren?"
- I'm not gonna pay it.

342
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:32,162
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm serious.

343
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,798
No, serious is what happens
if you don't pay--
by my hand.

344
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:39,670
In my thoughts,
i use the technique
of positive visualization.

345
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,172
How come
i always feel undermined?

346
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:44,675
By what i did on
the triboro towers situation
alone,

347
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:47,678
i should've been made,
right then-- boom.

348
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:51,181
- Hmm.
- No. I'm fuckin' serious,
tony.

349
00:25:51,432 --> 00:25:55,069
- The books are closed.
- Did you talk to jackie
about me?

350
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:58,822
They're not accepting
any new members, okay?

351
00:26:00,074 --> 00:26:04,078
You know, you got a reputation
for immaturity,

352
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:08,082
and it's not gonna be improved
by not payin' the tributes
the acting boss demands of you.

353
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:10,701
Acting boss, my ass, ton'.
Come on. Everybody knows...

354
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:15,706
you really run things since
jackie became the kemo sabe.

355
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:20,461
Open the fuckin' door.
Open the fuckin' door!
What the fuck?

356
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,221
All right. All right.

357
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:34,224
Fuck it. But 15 grand
is too much.

358
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:36,727
I'll tell you what.

359
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:41,732
You give me the 15k, i'll talk
to uncle junior personally,
and maybe i can get it to 10.

360
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:54,495
One more thing.
You leave comley trucking...

361
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:57,498
and every other fuckin' item
on this planet that belongs
to my uncle junior,

362
00:26:57,498 --> 00:27:00,000
including
his hemorrhoid doughnut,
the fuck alone.

363
00:27:00,134 --> 00:27:02,136
Got it?

364
00:27:02,636 --> 00:27:04,638
Yeah.

365
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:16,517
"Did you warble,
my little wren?"

366
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:20,270
What do you think
his commission'll be?
Two, three grand.

367
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,774
Ten to junior. We're lucky,
we net 500 bucks
from the whole thing.

368
00:27:36,787 --> 00:27:39,790
Who is it?

369
00:27:40,174 --> 00:27:43,794
- What?
-

370
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,303
mr. Arnaz?
What do you want?

371
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:56,807
You seen a schoolteacher's
saturn around here?

372
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:01,945
Come here! --

373
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:04,948
anybody else here,
desi?

374
00:28:04,948 --> 00:28:08,952
Eddie, i'm ready.
Yep. Here comes lucy now.

375
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:13,207
Those people
at the airport shuttle
are always late.

376
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:16,710
- Eddie!
- You boys drove off with the
wrong car a couple of days ago.

377
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,830
- Oh, my christ.
- We ain't sayin' shit until
there's an attorney present.

378
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:22,466
Go ahead. Make a statement.

379
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:24,718
I got fuckin' johnnie cochran
right here for you!

380
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:39,099
You boys put a real crimp
in my week.

381
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,353
Get over here. --

382
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:46,356
hey, puss,
here's the fuckin' set.

383
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:52,329
- Look.
- Fuckin' car's been chopped.
Fuckin' useless now.

384
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:56,450
- That's not it.
- Then why is that car inside
there? See it? That dodge?

385
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,371
Why is that motherfucker
wearin' a fuckin' plate number
i been carryin' all week?

386
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:04,374
I don't know.
Let me tell ya
what's gonna happen here.

387
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:08,762
The two of youse
are climbin' over that fence
and shaggin' those plates.

388
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:11,765
- But the razor wire--
- then one of you stays
with us...

389
00:29:11,765 --> 00:29:15,769
while the other
goes out on the street
and boosts another saturn.

390
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:27,397
On the lookout for ducks, dad?
Know the old man
pretty good, huh?

391
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:29,399
Don't look so sad.
They were cute,

392
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,903
but remember how pissed you were
about the pool filter?

393
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:36,907
It was special,
them coming here, huh?
Don't you think?

394
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:39,660
I really wasn't into it.

395
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,164
What time's your grandma
gettin' here?

396
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:47,301
She had to drive fanny
to the doctors.

397
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:50,804
Then she is picking up
my mother and father,
and they're comin' here.

398
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:53,924
They're each
gonna bring some antipast'.

399
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:56,927
You know, i complain
about my mother all the time,

400
00:29:56,927 --> 00:30:00,564
about how she just sits at home
and feels sorry for herself,

401
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:04,685
but she's always ready
to drive those oldster friends
of hers around,

402
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:06,687
the ones that can't
drive anymore.

403
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:10,190
I'm proud of her.
It gives me hope.

404
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:34,214
Ooh. It's getting chilly
out here.

405
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:39,603
Make plenty of noise
before you open the front door.
You never know who's in there.

406
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,473
There's mystar ledger.
Thanks.

407
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:47,978
Oh, this street.
It's another pain in the ass.

408
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:57,738
She broke her wrist
on the steerin' column.
A minor concussion.

409
00:30:57,738 --> 00:31:00,624
What about the other woman?

410
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,628
- Hip.
-

411
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:10,634
we were down at the hospital
till 2:00 in the mornin'...

412
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:13,136
talkin' to her doctor...

413
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:15,639
and the staff gerontologist.

414
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:18,642
They're sayin' that she
shouldn't live alone anymore.

415
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:24,147
She can't
manage the telephone.

416
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:28,652
And yet you say
she's very healthy and alert.

417
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:30,654
Like a bull.

418
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:34,157
Why?

419
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:38,161
I'm just thinking. And
i know there are other doctors
who are right there,

420
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:44,284
but you know from your own life
that depression
can cause accidents,

421
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:46,286
poor performance or worse.

422
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:50,290
So what are you sayin'?
That unconsciously she tried
to whack her best friend?

423
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:54,177
It's interesting
that you would even take that
from what i said.

424
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:58,181
Either way,

425
00:31:58,181 --> 00:32:02,185
she could need a change
in her living situation,
be around more people.

426
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:05,188
Well, we were lookin'
at green grove.

427
00:32:05,188 --> 00:32:09,443
That's a beautiful facility.
It's more like a hotel...

428
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:11,945
at cap d'antibes.

429
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:18,068
Yeah, but to her
it's a nursing home.

430
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:21,071
Well, she needs to be made
to see the distinction,

431
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:24,074
that in fact she's embarking
on a rewarding chapter.

432
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:30,580
I know seniors
who are inspired and inspiring.

433
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,592
Ladies?

434
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:50,600
Hey, we're the ones--
kenny portugal said,
"say'hello. '"

435
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,603
Oh, yeah. Kenny.

436
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:59,109
- What the fuck
is with this cocksucker?
- Back up.

437
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,112
Back up.
Mr. Scorsese, good evening.

438
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:05,115
Whoa. Wow.
Wow. Ho- ho- ho!

439
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:09,503
Marty! Kundun.
I liked it.

440
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:20,881
So my boy at comley...

441
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:24,384
said there's a truckload
of italian suits.

442
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:27,888
Those unload fast.
Mario'll take the whole load.

443
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:32,392
- He said the shipment
moves thursday, 6:00 a. M.
-

444
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:39,900
- give me one good reason
i should not jack this truck.
- Hey, don't feel bad.

445
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,403
It's junior's own fault.
He gives us no choice
except to do it again.

446
00:33:43,403 --> 00:33:45,405
Takin' that outrageous
fuckin' tribute.

447
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:49,910
Not only does he shit
on our heads, we're supposed
to say,"thanks for the hat."

448
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,914
It's not like i'm
gettin' somewheres playin'
by the rules. Fuck tony.

449
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:56,917
"The books are closed."
Blow me.

450
00:33:56,917 --> 00:34:01,421
No. That's some true shit.
Come on. They're not confirming
any new made guys? How come?

451
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:05,058
Fucking chaos.
Nobody knows who's
runnin' things anymore.

452
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:10,564
Guys, they don't even know
who to make payments
up the ladder to in some cases.

453
00:34:10,564 --> 00:34:13,567
I'm talkin' about the year 2000,
the millennium.

454
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:16,570
Where do we go from here?

455
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:29,449
Mm. Ma,
this virginia ham--

456
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,954
- go. Go and
get yourself some more.
- No. I'm full.

457
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:36,456
It's good, though.

458
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:38,959
You never let me feed you.

459
00:34:41,461 --> 00:34:45,966
- So, gettin' back to what
we were talkin' about--
- you want that lamp?

460
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:49,970
Ma, lie down.
That lamp--
that's real ormolu.

461
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,107
- You know what that's worth
when it's new?
- We're fixed good, lamp- wise.

462
00:34:54,107 --> 00:34:57,477
Take it,
and take the barcalounger.

463
00:34:57,477 --> 00:35:01,481
Somebody's gotta take
this-- this stuff before i die.

464
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:04,367
Otherwise there's gonna be
an awful lot of stuff here...

465
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:08,371
that the junkman's gonna have
to cart off to the dump.

466
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:13,877
Ma, you're not gonna die;
your stuff's not gonna be
hauled off to the dump.

467
00:35:13,877 --> 00:35:15,879
But you do have to start
plannin' for your future.

468
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:19,382
You got the most rewarding
chapter of your life
comin' up.

469
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:22,886
- You know my good jewelry?
- The stuff dad gave you?

470
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:26,389
Yeah, some
of those pieces came right out
of cartier's window, huh?

471
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,894
Listen.
Carm doesn't want it.
Not now.

472
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:33,897
What we both want
is for you to live long...

473
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:36,900
and wear your sparklers
to your grandchildren's
graduations.

474
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,904
I gave it all
to your cousin josephine.

475
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:44,274
- What the fuck?
The good jewelry?
- She always admired it.

476
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:46,776
They don't have much money.

477
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,914
You gave a fuckin' cousin
cartier dinner rings, and you
give me a vibratin' chair?

478
00:35:51,164 --> 00:35:55,669
Your wife
never showed any interest
in my jewels.

479
00:35:55,669 --> 00:35:58,672
She never complimented me
on any of it, as i can remember.

480
00:35:58,672 --> 00:36:01,424
You listen to me, now.
Before you do any more
serious damage...

481
00:36:01,424 --> 00:36:05,929
to yourself or your
grandchildren's inheritance,
you're gonna stop livin' alone.

482
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:08,181
I'm not going
to that nursing home.

483
00:36:08,682 --> 00:36:12,686
Green grove is a
retirement community, and it's
like a hotel at cap d'antibes.

484
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:16,306
- Who's he?
- A captain who owns
luxury hotels or somethin'.

485
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:20,443
I don't know. That's
not the point. The point
is i talked to mrs. Dicaprio.

486
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:24,948
She's got a corner suite
available with a woods view.
It's gonna go fast.

487
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:27,067
Of course it's available.
Somebody died.

488
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:30,070
Oh, ma, you gotta stop!
You gotta stop with this--

489
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,707
this black- poison cloud
all the time, 'cause i can't
take it anymore!

490
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:36,209
Ohh, poor you!

491
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:39,212
You know,
i got problems at work.
I got problems at home.

492
00:36:39,212 --> 00:36:41,715
I got a friend
who's been diagnosed
with cancer.

493
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:45,218
Most parents would be grateful
if their yuppie children put as
much thought into this as i did.

494
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:48,722
- I'm not going to that place.
- Then i will go to court,

495
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:51,725
and i will get a durable power
of attorney over you
and i will place you there.

496
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:55,478
Then kill me now.
Go on. Go.
Go into the ham...

497
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:59,482
and take the carving knife
and stab me here.

498
00:36:59,482 --> 00:37:01,985
Here. Now. Please!

499
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,487
It would hurt me less
than what you just said.

500
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:08,858
- You know, i know seniors
that are inspired!
-

501
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:20,870
yo, monty, we said
we'd meet out front.
You're not even dressed.

502
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,007
- I'm takin' a pass.
- What?

503
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:27,377
It's italian suits,
christopher.

504
00:37:27,377 --> 00:37:31,381
There was a time in my life when
bein' with the tony soprano crew
was all i ever dreamed of.

505
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:34,017
So what am i doing?

506
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:37,637
- This is some fuckin' note.
- Shh. Don't wake her up.

507
00:37:38,138 --> 00:37:40,140
Come on. It's 5:15.

508
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,644
Maybe one reason why things are
so fucked up in the organization
these days...

509
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:48,648
is guys runnin' off,
not listenin'
to middle management.

510
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:54,154
- Fuck tony.
That's a quote.
- We have to stick together.

511
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:58,658
Why be in a crew?
Why be a gangster?

512
00:37:58,658 --> 00:38:01,661
Hey, coach, suck my dick.

513
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:03,663
Yeah.

514
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:21,681
Yo! Hey, yo!
We need some help over here.

515
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:28,688
Okay, let's be very cool, yo.
Get down out of the cab!

516
00:38:28,688 --> 00:38:31,191
You heard the motherfucker!
Hurry up!

517
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:34,194
Yo, chill.
I'm a friend of billy's,
your friend on the inside?

518
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:37,697
Yeah? Cool. No probs here.
Increase the peace:
That's our motto.

519
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:41,835
I'm gonna
take my lunch, okay?
Whatever. Come on.

520
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:49,342
Hold up, man.
You can't drive a fisher- price.

521
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:56,216
What's with the gun
pointed sideways shit?

522
00:39:03,223 --> 00:39:05,225
Get out! Come on!
Get down!

523
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:08,228
You drive.
I'll direct you.

524
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:12,982
- Jesus! -

525
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:15,618
control your shit,
fool!

526
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:21,241
Fuck. Oh, fuck!
Fuck!

527
00:39:23,243 --> 00:39:25,245
Fuck!

528
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:30,250
Fuck! Junior fuckin' soprano's
gonna go ape- shit! Fuck!

529
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:35,388
You excited about comin'
to live with us, hon?

530
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,642
You will be. Trust me.

531
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:43,012
Oh, look, ma!
Here's your stuff.

532
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:46,516
They made good time.
Yeah.

533
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:50,520
You got your own bed
and your dresser.

534
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,157
You know,
when my grandmother went
to live...elsewhere,

535
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:57,660
they weren't allowed
to bring personal effects.

536
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:05,418
Ma, you gotta
sign right here.

537
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:16,930
Yes?

538
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:21,684
- Mr. Soprano,
do you have an uncle junior?
- He tracked me down here?

539
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:24,437
Line two?
Here you go.

540
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:27,440
Tell him i'll call him back.
He'll return the call.

541
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,195
He did?
Apparently, it's urgent.
She said he sounded upset.

542
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:35,198
He'll call back.

543
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,704
Livia, did you ever
hear the old italian saying--

544
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:45,208
my aunt used to go:

545
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:54,717
- What does that mean, bonnie?
- Time and patience...

546
00:40:54,717 --> 00:40:58,721
change the mulberry leaf
to silk.

547
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:14,487
You be all right?

548
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:18,491
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks for all your help.

549
00:41:19,993 --> 00:41:22,495
I'm gonna
make us a nice lunch.

550
00:41:22,495 --> 00:41:24,998
I got some fantastic
prosciut' in there.

551
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:32,005
Hello? Yep.
It's christopher.

552
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:34,123
Yeah?

553
00:41:34,624 --> 00:41:37,510
Christ. I been callin'
for hours. Give me a call back
on an outside line.

554
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,893
T, don't get mad.

555
00:41:53,893 --> 00:41:56,145
There's been a little shit.
I had nothin' to do with it,
just so you--

556
00:41:56,145 --> 00:42:00,033
spit it out.
Brendan hit comley again.

557
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:02,285
He what?

558
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:06,289
And, uh, the driver,
you know--

559
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:12,295
no, i don't know.
He caught some friendly fire
or something, and he's gone.

560
00:42:13,913 --> 00:42:17,050
Oh, fuck.
What do we do, t?
Brendan didn't fence the load,

561
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,670
'cause now he's thinkin'
maybe it was mario who dimed us
to junior last time.

562
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,672
Fuck!

563
00:42:40,573 --> 00:42:44,577
Hey, ton'. Sorry you have to
wreck your saturday like this.

564
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:51,334
You boys.
You boys, i'll tell ya.

565
00:42:54,203 --> 00:42:57,707
It's beautiful stuff,
though.
Ton', i'm so sorry.

566
00:42:57,707 --> 00:43:01,210
Shut up.
Just so long as you realize
i had nothing to do with this.

567
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,714
Ton', that's true.
He stood home.
Shut up.

568
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:07,216
You stood home?

569
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:12,221
Did you do anything to stop it?
Did you offer any guidance?

570
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:16,225
What do we mean when
we say "leadership"? Hmm?

571
00:43:16,225 --> 00:43:20,730
Ton', part of it's the crank,
but i'm goin' into detox,
swear on my mother.

572
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,233
Brendan, shut the fuck up.
You wanna get me clipped?

573
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:30,740
- What are we gonna do?
- What you're gonna do is
you're gonna take these suits,

574
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,243
put'em back in the truck,
go over to comley's main yard
and give'em back.

575
00:43:34,627 --> 00:43:36,996
- Aw, fuck.
- And then you're gonna
call my uncle,

576
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:39,382
and you're gonna tell'im
when it's done.

577
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:43,136
- What about the dead guy?
- You keep proddin' him
with a stick.

578
00:43:43,136 --> 00:43:47,006
You light a candle
to st. Anthony. But
i think you're fucked.

579
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:55,648
Ton', what if this
didn't go back?
Would it be a problem?

580
00:43:59,152 --> 00:44:01,654
You know,
i don't see you assholes
puttin' that rack...

581
00:44:01,654 --> 00:44:04,774
and that rack and this rack here
back in the truck.

582
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:17,420
Just when i thought i was out,
they pull me back in.

583
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:22,792
Hey, mr. Miller,
your car is back.

584
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:26,796
My wife dropped me off
this morning, and there it was.
It was in my parking spot.

585
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:31,300
My uncle pussy
helped my dad locate it.
Your uncle pussy?

586
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,803
Yeah. He's
in the car business.

587
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:37,807
Well, i don't know what to say
to your dad. I mean, thanks,
of course.

588
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:39,809
It's nice and clean too.

589
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:42,195
Whoa. Different keys.

590
00:44:42,695 --> 00:44:46,199
Probably too much
to hope my papers are still
inside the trunk here.

591
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,953
It's a different color.
- Whoa.

592
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:53,956
Ooh.

593
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:56,959
My dad's a hero.
Mm- hmm.

594
00:45:56,636 --> 00:46:00,139
Did you actually
lose consciousness,
like with the ducks?

595
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:02,391
No.

596
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:08,397
Just, uh, a shortness of breath
and white spots
in my field of vision.

597
00:46:08,397 --> 00:46:12,401
- Improvement.
- 'Cause i'm sad
to put my mother away?

598
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:15,905
Sad is good.
Unconscious isn't.

599
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:21,410
She'll be in very good hands.
You've done the best for her.

600
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:24,914
She won't speak to me.

601
00:46:26,415 --> 00:46:29,418
That is sad,
but whose choice is that?

602
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:32,421
Somehow,
that doesn't make it any better.

603
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:36,926
Can you admit to yourself
that, yes, you're sad,

604
00:46:37,426 --> 00:46:40,429
but you're very angry
and full of rage?

605
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:43,933
- I'm sad.
- It's hard to admit that...

606
00:46:43,933 --> 00:46:47,937
you might have feelings of
hatred towards your own mother,
isn't it?

607
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:50,940
You're out of your tree.

608
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,443
Listen to me carefully.
Of course you love her.

609
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:59,949
What i'm trying to say
is own the anger
instead of displacing it.

610
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:02,451
Otherwise,
it defines your life.
You know,

611
00:47:02,952 --> 00:47:06,455
it needs to be acknowledged.
It's a good thing
time is up.

612
00:47:06,455 --> 00:47:10,209
I don't wanna talk to you
anymore."hate your mother."

613
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:40,990
Shit.

614
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,877
A-- what
do you call it-- menu.

615
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:49,882
"Press two if you
know your party's extension."

616
00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:53,386
Is that an operator
or an answering machine?

617
00:47:53,502 --> 00:47:55,504
Let's see. Hello?
Hello?

618
00:47:55,888 --> 00:47:57,890
Hello?

619
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,509
Hello?

620
00:48:00,509 --> 00:48:03,012
"Press zero."
Hello?

621
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:06,015
Hello? Hello?

622
00:48:06,515 --> 00:48:09,018
Hello--
