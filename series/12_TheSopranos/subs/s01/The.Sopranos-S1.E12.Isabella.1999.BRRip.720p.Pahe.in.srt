1
00:01:48,457 --> 00:01:51,960
Junior, hey.
Jimmy,
how you doin', kid?

2
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,463
How many of these things
we gotta go to?

3
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:57,466
Brendan filone's mother
at the kid's funeral,
the way she carried on.

4
00:01:57,466 --> 00:01:59,968
Fuckin' manners.
I just want you to know,

5
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,971
i always thought you had
that right too, you know?

6
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:06,975
Jimmy, let me tell you
something. Don't worry
about what i know.

7
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:22,107
I was just over
to tony's house.
Oh, yeah?

8
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:24,610
How was he?

9
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,614
He looked, uh, tired.

10
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:31,250
Maybe he's
got hypoglycemia.

11
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,119
- Maybe he's depressed.
- What's he got to be
depressed about?

12
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:37,256
He talked to me
about it.

13
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:39,508
- Depression?
- Well--

14
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,877
what the fuck
do you know
about depression?

15
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,012
Nothin'.
I'm just sayin', that's all.

16
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,515
But he's sleeping all the time.
He's not taking care
of himself.

17
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:48,884
A lot of top guys
had dark moods.

18
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:51,887
That winston churchill,
he drank a quart of brandy
before breakfast.

19
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:55,891
And, uh, napoleon,
he was a moody fuck too.

20
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,531
- Am i nuts? -

21
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:06,034
a day at the mall in mules
and i'll be crippled for life.

22
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,043
Oh, i told lilliana to put
some giambott' in the microwave
for when you get up.

23
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:18,547
Tony, how are you fixed
for sweat socks?

24
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,533
We're gonna be right by
the sports authority.

25
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,470
Tony?

26
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:30,475
Tony, i know
you're in there.
I know you hear me.

27
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:33,478
Will you let me sleep?
Does your lady therapist
know about this?

28
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,981
Maybe you need
more medication.

29
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,984
She already got me
on lithium and prozac.
What else you want?

30
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:42,487
Aromatherapy, something.
This is not normal,

31
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,490
for a healthy adult male
to take to bed like this.

32
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,861
I got a lot on my mind.
Really?
Well, move over then.

33
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,365
Those indictments are
hangin' over my head too.

34
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:57,269
Plus i got the roots
in the pipe to the street.

35
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,757
My best friend pussy
has disappeared. He's
probably fuckin' dead, okay?

36
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:04,760
This downturn started long
before pussy bompensiero
disappeared.

37
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:12,801
If you want me, i will be
at the paramus mall...

38
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:17,222
getting your son a suit
to wear to his first formal.

39
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,984
Carmela, come on!
Sunlight is good
for people, tony.

40
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:32,120
In alaska, they wear these
little light hats in the winter
so they don't get depressed.

41
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,582
Sorry, junior.

42
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:43,085
The jackson
street bridge was out.

43
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:47,589
If you say you're gonna
be someplace, be someplace.
Sorry.

44
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,591
Junior,
you all right?

45
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:52,594
Porkchop boy was here,
that fuckin' altieri.

46
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,598
Runnin' his mouth about
the brendan filone hit.

47
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,602
Is that what him and my other
capos talk about behind my back
at the fuckin' old folks home?

48
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:03,105
Well, the
meeting's adjourned
at the green grove.

49
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:07,109
Chucky and i spoke
to donnie p. , and the thing,
it's happenin' tomorrow.

50
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,363
That quick? Good.
Yeah.

51
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:14,366
Black guys.
It'll never lead back.

52
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,868
Think they got
apisciatoio
in this place?

53
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:23,375
Look at her like that.
Mariolina gave me
my first hand job--

54
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,995
me and vincent maniscalooo
in the alley behind
the chicken market.

55
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:30,882
- Junior.
- God, what am i saying
at this poor woman's wake?

56
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,886
I just wanted to let you know
so you didn't have to worry.

57
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:38,507
- Everything's taken care of
about tony.
- Let's go.

58
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,643
When i was a little kid,
no older than that,

59
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:44,646
i always used to wonder
why nobody collected
prayer cards...

60
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:47,149
like they collect
baseball cards.

61
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,403
Thousands of bucks
for honus wagner...

62
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:53,905
and jack shit for jesus.

63
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:57,409
It's going down
in a newsstand that he goes to
by the medical center.

64
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:01,530
Where he spills his guts
on some fuckin'
shrink's carpet.

65
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,033
Junior, these guys
are very, very good.

66
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:07,035
Donnie paduana did time
with them at rahway.

67
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:09,538
And i was very specific.

68
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:13,542
He's not gonna suffer.
He's gonna have an open casket.
I promise.

69
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:17,045
Enough! I don't wanna
hear any more.

70
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:19,931
Jesus, michael,
if i delegate,
i delegate.

71
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,435
Is that what time it is?

72
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:29,057
There is absolutely nothing
on the street about
the big guy, t, anywhere.

73
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:35,063
I went to see
his family.

74
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:40,068
Angela doesn't know shit,
or she deserves an
academy fuckin' award.

75
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:42,571
His goomah either.

76
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:45,574
I don't wanna hear
no more talkin' about pussy.

77
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:50,078
Mr. Tony,
let me take that robe
and wash it for you.

78
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:52,581
Did i ask you
to take the robe?

79
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:02,090
Jimmy altieri
was in the bing.

80
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,093
Can't even look him
in the face anymore.

81
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:08,096
If he's wired,
it's doing jack shit
for the government...

82
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:12,100
'cause all we feed him now
is deliberate bullshit
till we can--

83
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,605
you know.
Don't do nothin'
about jimmy.

84
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:19,107
I don't even know
if he's the guy
that flipped.

85
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,112
I don't know nothin'
no more.

86
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:30,619
Pussy probably freaked out
and he's lammin' it,
that's all.

87
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:37,125
How many times
do i gotta say it?

88
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,883
You goin' somewhere, t?
You want me to drive you?
No.

89
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:49,137
- I usually drive you.
- I'm goin' downstairs.

90
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:51,273
What are you gonna do?

91
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:53,775
I'm gonna get my pants outta
the fuckin' dryer, okay?

92
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:31,680
Hello.
Hi.

93
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,183
Is this yours?
I found it in the yard.

94
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:38,320
Oh, no. Really?

95
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:41,823
I thought
the cusamanos were away.

96
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:45,827
Yeah, they went
in bermuda to play golf.

97
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,948
You're from italy,
aren't you?

98
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:53,451
My english is pitiful.
No.

99
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,837
You speak very good.

100
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:58,707
Your english is better
than my italian.

101
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,710
"Principles of oral surgery"?

102
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,215
I'm a student. I'm here
as a part of an exchange program
between our two countries.

103
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:11,853
Boy, if my dentist looked
like you, i'd stay awake
during a root canal.

104
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:16,358
All right.
I'll, uh-- i'll let you study.

105
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:21,363
Thank you for bring me--

106
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:23,365
i don't know
how to say in english.

107
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,867
Well, that makes two of us.

108
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,739
Bye.

109
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:21,039
Remember,
they don't want
nothin' above the neck.

110
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:30,298
Whoa.

111
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:37,689
Doughnuts? No wonder
he can't lose weight.

112
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,191
Where's he goin' now?

113
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:46,698
- Yo, sir? Excuse me.
- What?

114
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,700
Could you pull forward
so we can get out?

115
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,953
Give me a minute.
Police department.

116
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:53,955
Where's your badge?

117
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:56,324
Man, i said move
this piece of shit
fuckin' now!

118
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:59,828
Get the fuck
outta my face.

119
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:07,335
Shit!
We gonna have to waste
this motherfucker too?

120
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:10,588
Let soprano get his doughnuts.
We'll pop him when he gets out.

121
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:34,112
- Where's he goin'?
- Let's see if he left his
motherfuckin' keys in the car.

122
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,124
Man, this is fucked up.

123
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,634
No. No.

124
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:59,637
Jesus. You make a left
at the stop sign.

125
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,524
You must be lookin'
straight at us. What are
you, fuckin' ray charles?

126
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:06,144
Jesus christ!
How the hell could
it not have gone down?

127
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:08,146
I know, junior.
I'm sorry.

128
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,281
Some civilian got in the way.
Donnie will explain it to us.

129
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:14,035
- He's around the corner.
He got lost.
- I wanted it to be over.

130
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:17,155
I know.
Junior, mints?

131
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,551
We've been standin'
around here forever.

132
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:34,422
You don't think we got
better things to do?
What the fuck, man?

133
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:38,426
They'll do it
fuckin' tomorrow.
My personal guarantee.

134
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:41,429
Let me tell you something,
donnie. If they don't,

135
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:44,566
some hikers are gonna
find your personal guarantee
rolled up in a tube...

136
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:46,184
and shoved up your ass.

137
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,687
Mike, they got blocked in.
There were witnesses.

138
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,689
Tomorrow.
What did i just say?

139
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:55,693
I already talked to them.
I realize it's urgent.

140
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:58,696
I hear tony s's own mother
wants him popped.

141
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:02,200
Who the fuck told you that?
- It was just a joke, right? -

142
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:05,086
you think that's funny,
a guy's own mother?
Okay, okay.

143
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,956
Tomorrow.
Fuckin' "a"!

144
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:12,594
All right.

145
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:25,106
I don't like it.
This fuckin' guy's big mouth.

146
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:27,609
Nah, he's okay.
I don't like it.

147
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:30,612
Next he'll be makin' jokes
about me.

148
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,733
Chucky, tell him
to wait a minute.

149
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:39,737
Yo, donnie,
hold on a minute.

150
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,244
Hey, donnie. Sorry.

151
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:12,353
- Are you still taking
the lithium?
- Lithium, prozac.

152
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:17,859
When is it gonna end?
We're tryin' to give
a jolt to your system.

153
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:21,362
Give it a, uh--
a little kick start.

154
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:24,365
Why don't you kick me
in the fuckin' head?
What you're going through...

155
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:26,367
is very painful,
i know that.

156
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,120
You get stabbed in the ribs,
that's painful.

157
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:33,124
This shit--
i don't feel nothin'.

158
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:35,126
Nothin'.

159
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:38,129
Dead. Empty.

160
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:44,519
What else?

161
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:50,775
- What?
- What were you just
thinkin' about then?

162
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:54,779
This gorgeous
piece of cus.

163
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:58,783
It's next door to cusamano's.
She's stayin' there
while they're away.

164
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:03,905
- So you do feel something.
- Don't split hairs with me,
'cause i've had it with you.

165
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:08,793
Like fuckin' king midas
in reverse here. Everything
i touch turns to shit.

166
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:11,045
I'm not a husband
to my wife.

167
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:13,664
I'm not a father
to my kids.

168
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:16,918
I'm not a friend
to my friends.
I'm nothin'.

169
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,923
I don't even know
why i come here.

170
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,427
Nothin' else to do,
i guess.

171
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:30,181
Do you think it would help
if you went someplace
so you could rest up a while?

172
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:33,818
- Oh, you mean like vegas?
- No, not vegas.

173
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:36,687
Someplace where you
could be looked after.
Like a hospital?

174
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:41,692
- With the padded rooms
and the straitjackets?
- No. No straitjackets.

175
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:43,694
A residential
treatment center.

176
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:46,197
You got any idea what
my life would be worth...

177
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:49,700
if certain people found out
i checked into
a laughing academy?

178
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,838
- Your life is boxing us in.
- Well, i'll take a gun, and
i'll blow my fuckin' head off.

179
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:57,208
If that's what you're saying,
then i think youshould
be hospitalized.

180
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,711
Oh, yeah? Well, you get
a couple of guys, you come
to my house, you try it.

181
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,349
All right.

182
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:09,470
I'm gonna push the prozac
to 60 milligrams.

183
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:12,723
Sure. Why not?

184
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:27,738
Hey, is that you?

185
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,743
Ciao.
Look who's here.

186
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:36,747
I was just talkin'
about you. No kiddin'.
What are you doin' here?

187
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:40,251
Oh, i have the class
in gum graftingalla scuola.
I just finish.

188
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:44,255
Let me ask you.
This sandwich,

189
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,257
it says it's a hero.

190
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:48,259
Why do they call
a sandwich hero?

191
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:51,762
You don't wanna
eat that. No.
No?

192
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:54,265
Come on.
What's your name?

193
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:57,768
Isabella.
I'm tony.

194
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:00,771
You never went
in italy?
No.

195
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:03,774
Why not?
You don't want to go?

196
00:19:03,774 --> 00:19:06,277
I guess i just
never got off my ass.

197
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,913
- Excuse my french.
- Your french?

198
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:11,782
- It's an expression.
- Oh.

199
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:18,039
And where are your people from?
Wait a minute. Don't tell me.

200
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:24,295
- Avellino?
- How'd you know that?

201
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,681
I didn't.
I guess it.

202
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:29,684
You look like this guy
from there.

203
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:33,804
He came after
the "hearthquake" to repair--

204
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:36,807
oh, how do you say?

205
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:40,194
- The seat of the house?
- I love how you say that.

206
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:44,565
- Hearthquake.
- You are making a joke.

207
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:47,068
No. No, i'm sorry.

208
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:49,070
Go ahead.

209
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,707
Fondamenta.
You understand?
Fondamenta.

210
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:54,825
- Foundation.
- Foundation, si.

211
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:57,828
Foundation was cracked,
and he repaired the stone.

212
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,831
My grandfather was a stone
mason. He was avellinese,
him and his brother.

213
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:05,336
Tony, you should visit
avellino if your family
come from there.

214
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:09,840
There isn't too much left
because of the many
hearthquake.

215
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:15,346
But from the 17th century
is still there
a beautiful palazzo,

216
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,348
palazza della donna.

217
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:21,352
And there is a place in
the corner of the piazza...

218
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:24,855
is a wine bar
you can sit.

219
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:28,359
You can see the hills.
And when it's spring,

220
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,747
you can smell
the blossoms
from the lemon tree.

221
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:35,249
And there is a church
with a bell.

222
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:38,753
And they say,
when it rings,

223
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:41,255
that means
that the baby...

224
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:45,259
was conceived
in the town.

225
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,162
Tony?

226
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:27,168
Tony?
Are you on medication?

227
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,055
No. No.

228
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:40,181
Tell me more about your,
uh-- your dental studies.

229
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:45,686
I was interested mainly
in tumors...

230
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:48,439
of the gum and
soft tissue of the mouth.

231
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,941
Yeah?

232
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:54,945
Tumors of the gum, huh? Wow.

233
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:57,198
Dad, we're eating!

234
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:03,204
Hold it, ma. Anthony.

235
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:06,707
- What does a gentleman
do for a lady?
- In his own house?

236
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:09,710
A young lady's invited anthony
to his very first formal, ma.

237
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,712
Well, then.

238
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,722
Okay?

239
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:24,225
Thank you, young man.

240
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:29,730
Okay.

241
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,866
Tony!

242
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:37,121
Honey, i told you
that your mother
was coming for dinner.

243
00:22:39,123 --> 00:22:43,127
Hi, ma.
Well, look who's
decided to join us.

244
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,629
And with that breath!

245
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:52,386
- You know, i don't really
need that right now, ma.
- Aren't we being sensitive?

246
00:22:52,386 --> 00:22:55,890
Meadow, can you take some
chicken and pass it, please?

247
00:22:57,391 --> 00:23:00,895
Where's uncle jun'?
He said
he wasn't feeling well.

248
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:05,399
In its lifetime, the average
american chicken's feet
never even touch the ground?

249
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:09,019
- That's dicked up.
- If i was that young lady...

250
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:11,522
and you came and took me
to that dance...

251
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:15,159
and used
that kind of talk,
i'd slap your face.

252
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,661
That's right, ma.
Thank you.

253
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:20,164
Well, the whole
world's gone crazy.

254
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:23,417
Some woman in pennsylvania,
she shot her three children...

255
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:26,036
and set her house
on fire.
Here we go.

256
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:29,790
How come my son's
in a bathrobe?
Is he sick?

257
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,792
- He's fine.
- Dad, you're depressed.

258
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:35,429
Depressed? My father
came to this country...

259
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,434
with 17 cents in his pocket,
and he never made a peep.
Ma.

260
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:42,686
What's he got
to be depressed about?

261
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:45,689
Nobody threwhim
into the glue factory...

262
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:48,692
and soldhishouse
out from underneath him.

263
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:53,197
Ma, we all agreed
we would sell your home.
I'm goin' back upstairs.

264
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:57,818
I was making a joke.
Oh, i suppose it
would be better...

265
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,954
if i never opened my mouth.

266
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:03,207
Grandma, how can it be
a joke if you're crying?

267
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,209
Oh, i mean, this is
really the last time.

268
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:07,711
I am never coming back
to this house.

269
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:25,179
What a day.
With this wind, huh?

270
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:27,681
Whatcha lookin' at?
Oh, nothin'.

271
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:41,579
Who's she?

272
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,082
Dental student
from italy.

273
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:47,084
You know her.

274
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,589
We had lunch.

275
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:53,591
Lunch?

276
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:58,596
You fucking piece of shit.

277
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:02,099
Going out to dinner with you
is a distant memory for me,

278
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:05,603
but you have time
to take her to lunch?

279
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:08,606
You are sinking
this whole family
into your misery...

280
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:11,609
with your wallowing
and your complaining,

281
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:15,112
while i spoon- feed you
and bathe you.

282
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:19,617
All it takes is a half- inch
of another woman's thigh
to get your ass out of bed?

283
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:21,619
What am i,
a fucking idiot?

284
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:25,623
If i had an ounce
of self- respect,
i would cut your dick off!

285
00:25:33,714 --> 00:25:35,716
You know, i was there
last night for dinner.

286
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:40,087
I couldn't go.
Those poor freakin' kids.

287
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:42,089
Yeah, they barely have
a father now.

288
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:44,091
You should see
the way he comes down
to the dinner table.

289
00:25:44,592 --> 00:25:47,845
- I don't wanna know.
- In his bathrobe
at 7:00 in the evening.

290
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:50,848
Some bargain.
That's all anyone should
have to pay for a movie.

291
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,735
My cousin cakey
after he had his lobotomy,
he looked exactly like my son.

292
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:57,354
- Livia.
- Empty. A shell.

293
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,857
Better cakey had died
than go on living like that.

294
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:02,993
- That's what his own mother
always used to say.
- Don't talk about it anymore.

295
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:05,996
I don't wanna hear
about it anymore. Don't
talk about tony. It's done.

296
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:29,770
Mr. Tony, ms. Carmela
said to tell you...

297
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:34,275
she went to new york
to buy a suit for a. J.

298
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:36,777
Go away.
Okay.

299
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:41,282
Ms. Carmela told me
to remind you of
your appointment.

300
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:15,316
Hey, how
you doin', tony?
Pick six today?

301
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:18,819
No, just an orange juice
and a racing form today.

302
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:26,827
This wind, huh?
Yeah.

303
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,336
Thanks. Take care.
Okay.

304
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,373
- You dead now, motherfucker!
-

305
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:19,129
aw, shit!

306
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:47,574
Oh, my god, daddy.
Where is he?
Please let me be all right.

307
00:28:47,574 --> 00:28:49,943
They didn't say anything
when they called?
No, they didn't.

308
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:53,947
Oh, tony.
Oh, my god.
Look who's here.

309
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:56,450
Oh, my god, tony.
Is he all right?

310
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,953
Jesus christ, tony.
Daddy, your ear's all bloody.
What'd they do to your ear?

311
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:02,956
I'm just putting in
a few stitches
to create a nice closure.

312
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:05,209
Oh, jesus,
we were so scared.

313
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,211
They almost killed you
for a stupid car.

314
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:09,713
Nobody told them about
the kind of gas mileage
that thing gets, huh, med?

315
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:14,351
It's not funny, dad.
What's the matter
with you?

316
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:16,970
Forget how to talk
'cause your old man
got banged up a little?

317
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,857
- No.
-
he's just frightened, tony.

318
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:23,360
The doctor needs
to finish up here, ma'am.

319
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,612
Come on, kids.
Let's give
the doctor some room.

320
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:28,232
- Come on.
- See ya later.

321
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:33,237
Poor dad.
He'll be all right.

322
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,626
Christ.

323
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:42,629
You people can't wait
until they finish
sewing my ear back on?

324
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:44,631
Face it, tony.
One inch to the left...

325
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:47,000
and you're down in a drawer
instead of talking to me.

326
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,002
Who's talkin' to you?

327
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:51,889
- What's he doing here?
- Oh, agent harris
is just leaving.

328
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:55,509
We're offering
your husband full
immunity from prosecution...

329
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:57,511
in return for any testimony
that he might give us.

330
00:29:57,511 --> 00:30:01,648
We relocate you and your family.
You'll be completely safe,
all of you.

331
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:04,651
- Hey, don't talk to me wife.
- So he wouldn't have to go
to jail either?

332
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:07,154
Carmela, ask this prick
if i'm even indicted.

333
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:10,524
This assassination problem
is not gonna go away. I think
both of you realize that.

334
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:13,410
I told you
to stop talking to my wife.

335
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:16,530
- Carmela, wait outside.
- Kiss my ass, tony.

336
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,283
We're the only option
you have left, tony.

337
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:22,286
It's not safe for you anymore
in the streets or in jail.
This conversation is over.

338
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:26,673
- What do you know?
- He doesn't know anything.
It was a fuckin' carjacking.

339
00:30:26,673 --> 00:30:28,675
Now, get out!
You're upsetting
my wife!

340
00:30:28,675 --> 00:30:31,929
In case
you change your mind.

341
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:40,554
- You know he's right, tony.
- Nothin's gonna happen.

342
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:42,940
Wake up, tony!
It already did!

343
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:49,813
- I took an oath, carmela.
- What are you, a kid
in a tree house?

344
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:52,199
Did you ever tell anybody
about me gonna see melfi?

345
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:55,452
Is that why they tried
to kill you? Because
you're seeing a psychiatrist?

346
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:58,572
Look, what are you
talkin' about?
It was a carjacking.

347
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:02,075
- At least have the decency
not to lie to me.
- What do you wanna do?

348
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:06,079
You wanna move to utah?
Be mr. And mrs. Mike smith?

349
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,083
We could sell some
indian relics by the road,
maybe start a rattlesnake ranch.

350
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:14,471
This is our chance
to get out, tony.
We could start a whole new life.

351
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:17,724
Have some mormons
over to dinner. Eat some
tomatoes that have no taste.

352
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:20,727
You know what i want?
I want those kids
to have a father.

353
00:31:20,844 --> 00:31:23,480
They got one.
This one. Me.

354
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:26,483
Tony soprano.
And all that comes with it.

355
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,986
Oh, you prick.

356
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:34,107
Mmm. Good.

357
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:42,366
Probably i can't go
to that dance now either.
God, self- involved much?

358
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,123
Hey, it's uncle silvio
and uncle paulie.
Hey, squirt.

359
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:53,627
They shot my dad.
He's all right, though,
isn't he?

360
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:58,131
Take more than a jamaican
bobsled team with cap guns
to stop your old man.

361
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:00,133
Where is he?
With mom.

362
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,135
All right.

363
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:11,645
They look kinda weird.

364
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:18,652
I don't believe
it was a carjacking.

365
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:27,127
This afternoon in montclair,
anthony soprano,

366
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:31,632
who allegedly holds the rank
of captain or higher in
the northern new jersey mafia,

367
00:32:31,632 --> 00:32:34,635
was wounded
in what the victim claims
was an attempted carjack,

368
00:32:35,135 --> 00:32:40,140
but sources in the f. B. I. Say
was a gangland execution
gone awry.

369
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,645
Soprano escaped
with minor wounds and was taken
to an undisclosed area hospital.

370
00:32:45,145 --> 00:32:48,265
However, one of his assailants,
william johnson
"petite" clayborn,

371
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,267
was fatally wounded
in the attack.

372
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:52,769
Continuing now with--

373
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,274
is this true?
Why, do you think
they made it up?

374
00:32:57,274 --> 00:33:00,777
But how- how could
this happen?

375
00:33:00,777 --> 00:33:03,780
I don't know.
I don't figure to know.

376
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,283
I feel like
i'm floatin' in space.

377
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:09,786
- He's gonna look
for who did this to him.
- Anthony? Of course he is.

378
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:13,290
- Livia, you understand
what's goin' on here?
- My son got shot.

379
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,792
- And he got away.
- What do we do now?

380
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:19,296
- What the fuck
do we do now, livia?
- We go see him.

381
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:25,302
- Tony?
- Of course! He's my only son.

382
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:28,805
Thanks, sweetheart.

383
00:33:29,056 --> 00:33:32,559
We could use some peppers
out here, huh, carm?
I'll get'em, dad.

384
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,062
Don't you have
like two hours
worth of homework to do?

385
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:39,066
I can't help too?
Some fuckin' shit, huh?

386
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:43,570
Tony!
Jesus fucking christ!
Oh!

387
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,822
Who do we blame
for the hat?

388
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:48,709
I was down the shore
at tom's river on
denny najarian's boat.

389
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:51,211
Two shooters.
And his piece
was under the seat.

390
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:54,715
- Do you believe this guy?
- Nah, two girls from
the hood, that's all.

391
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:58,585
- Do we know who they are yet?
- The live one took off
in a taurus.

392
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:03,590
Taurus?
Yeah, moolies
in a new taurus.

393
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:06,093
Doesn't exactly fit
the profile.

394
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:08,595
Motherfuck!
What?

395
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,847
These guys
i had a beef with
at the newsstand.

396
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,350
You were there?
Not yesterday.
The day before.

397
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,353
The newsstand?
The one in montclair?

398
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:19,990
- Yeah, yeah. I was,
uh, in the neighborhood.
- What were you doing there?

399
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,993
- Uh, takin' my mother
to the doctor.
- Oh.

400
00:34:25,862 --> 00:34:28,365
Hey, put it
right there, baby.

401
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:30,867
Thank you.

402
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:35,372
Ah, this husband
of yours, carmela.
How much we love him.

403
00:34:35,372 --> 00:34:38,375
He's the best.
He's like a father to me.

404
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:43,380
Just make sure
nothin' happens to him.

405
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,884
- I'll get it. -

406
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,773
come on.

407
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:57,277
All due respect,
ton', it had to be
your uncle, right?

408
00:34:57,277 --> 00:35:00,280
Well, why fuckin' now?

409
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,784
Maybe he found out.
Found out what?

410
00:35:03,784 --> 00:35:06,787
That he's joe jerk- off,
not the boss.

411
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:10,290
That you been runnin'
things behind his back.
Anthony!

412
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,292
Uncle jun'!

413
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,911
Don't get up. I heard
your knee was fucked up.

414
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:17,414
Don't worry, ma.
I'm all right. Come here.

415
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:19,416
Your ear,
it's disfigured.
It's all right.

416
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,918
Hi.

417
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:25,806
I got mikey palmice,
all my crew out there,

418
00:35:25,806 --> 00:35:27,557
crackin' heads
to find out
who did this.

419
00:35:27,557 --> 00:35:31,061
When we're done with them,
they're gonna wish
they were never born.

420
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:35,565
- Tony?
- Look who it is.
Father intintola.

421
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:39,069
- I came as a friend.
How are you, tony?
- All right.

422
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:44,074
If you'd like
to speak privately,
we could kneel in prayer--

423
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:46,576
not right now.
Why don't you
grab a sandwich...

424
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:49,579
and we'll talk later.

425
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:53,083
- You're sleepin' over, right?
- Uh, can i get anybody
anything?

426
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,585
Sil, maybe
another sambuca.
Hey, i'll get it, carm.

427
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:58,088
I'll take a curacao
if you got it.
I'll buy him one too.

428
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,340
No, that's all right.
No alcohol for me.

429
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:02,592
Can he hear
through that ear?

430
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:06,963
Ma, sit down.
Here you go.
Have something to eat.

431
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:15,722
- Want some?
- Fuck it. I thought
for sure it was him.

432
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:18,725
But there he is,
glasses and all.

433
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:23,230
Don't eat capicollo, grandma.
It's nothin' but fat
and nitrates.

434
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,232
Capicollo.
Over here.

435
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,987
- Look at that face.
- Who is that?

436
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:32,989
- Who?
- That girl.

437
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:36,993
- Who, meadow?
- Who is she?
Is that concetta?

438
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:38,995
That's your granddaughter.
Meadow?

439
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:42,499
All right.
Don't get impatient.
I'm your mother.

440
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:46,753
Hey, grandma, did you hear?
Dad fought off two black guys.
One got shot in the head.

441
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:49,256
Anthony, what time is it?
Why aren't you dressed
for the dance?

442
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,141
- I can't go.
- Why not?

443
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:54,644
- Don't you need me here?
- And disappoint the future
miss new jersey?

444
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:57,647
- Get outta here.
- Well, mom was going to drive
us. She can't now, right?

445
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:00,650
You're gonna go.

446
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:53,954
I gotta know something.

447
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:56,456
And i want the truth.

448
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,963
Did you ever tell anybody
about you and me?

449
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:08,969
I may have
mentioned something
to my immediate family...

450
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:10,971
that i had a patient
who was in some trouble...

451
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:14,474
with all the stuff
we were hearing about
in the news.

452
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:18,979
I never mentioned a name
or any other specifics...

453
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:21,982
that could identify you
as that person.

454
00:38:34,995 --> 00:38:37,864
My son's.

455
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,869
Does your family know?

456
00:38:45,372 --> 00:38:48,875
My mother's made a few comments.
But i don't see how she knows.

457
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:50,877
And if she did--

458
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:58,635
hey, don't even go there
about the old lady.

459
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:05,141
You should've seen her
at my house after what happened.
She was losin' her fuckin' mind.

460
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,529
How are you doing
with all of this?

461
00:39:14,034 --> 00:39:17,537
Tell you the truth,
i feel pretty good.
Yeah.
Really?

462
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:22,042
Well, that's good.
Talk about
a jolt to the system.

463
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:25,045
Try gettin' shot at.
It'll give you
a nice kick start.

464
00:39:32,552 --> 00:39:36,056
You know,
when i was depressed,

465
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:38,558
i said i didn't wanna live.

466
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:45,065
Well, i'll tell you somethin'.

467
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:47,567
I didn't wanna die.

468
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:51,571
Every fuckin' particle
of my bein' was
fightin' to live.

469
00:39:57,577 --> 00:40:00,580
- I had lunch with that girl
next door, you know.
- You did?

470
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,582
Isabella.

471
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:09,089
She was tellin' me
about the avellino,

472
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:11,591
where my--
where my people are from.

473
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,593
It sounded nice.

474
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:17,097
Anyway, she was talkin',
and, uh,

475
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:19,599
all of a sudden--

476
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:24,104
you know, uh,

477
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:29,109
we went
to another place,
like, in my mind's eye.

478
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:34,614
I don't know.
We went back in time
to like 1907 or somethin'.

479
00:40:36,616 --> 00:40:39,619
And we were in this room,
you know.

480
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:44,124
And she had this baby.
She was holdin' it, you know.

481
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:46,126
On her breast,
she was nursin' it.

482
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:48,628
She was whisperin'
to it, like,

483
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:54,134
"it's okay, little baby.
Don't cry. It's gonna
be okay. I love you."

484
00:40:57,137 --> 00:41:01,641
- Did the baby have a name?
- She was calling it antonio.

485
00:41:03,643 --> 00:41:08,148
Anthony, your fantasy.
That's-- that's you,
that little baby.

486
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:12,152
And isabella.
That she was nursingyou.

487
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,663
Oh, fuck me.

488
00:42:03,203 --> 00:42:05,705
You think
this is a stretch?

489
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,222
Hey, can we get
some of that whiskey?

490
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:32,098
Livia.
You don't knock?

491
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:35,735
- I could've been in the nude.
- What the hell is going on?

492
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:39,105
- Look and see
if my slipper is over there.
- Fuck your slipper!

493
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:41,608
I don't like that talk.

494
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:45,995
Was was that bullshit
yesterday? You don't even
recognize your granddaughter?

495
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:52,502
Well, i-- i've-- i've been
forgetting things lately.

496
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:57,507
You'll-- you'll find
that it'll happen
to you soon too.

497
00:42:57,507 --> 00:43:02,011
That's terrific timing.
Right after the move on your son
goes in the toilet.

498
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:04,514
I don't know
what you're talking about.

499
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:20,146
Hey, cooze. Cooze.

500
00:43:22,148 --> 00:43:24,150
How was bermuda?

501
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,153
Jeannie, she wrecked up
her motorbike.
She hurt her ankle pretty bad.

502
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:29,155
Oh, yeah?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Thanks.

503
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:32,158
So where's your...
dental student?

504
00:43:32,158 --> 00:43:34,160
Where's my what?

505
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:37,046
Isabella.
I haven't seen her
in a couple of days.

506
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:40,049
Come on.
Your houseguest. Isabella.

507
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,053
Dark hair, beautiful.

508
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:48,558
- You don't know what the fuck
i'm talkin' about, do you?
- I got no idea.

509
00:43:49,058 --> 00:43:53,062
You didn't have
an italian girl--
she's here studying the--

510
00:43:53,313 --> 00:43:57,066
we had skippy palumbo from
down the street come into the
house to take care of the dog.

511
00:43:59,068 --> 00:44:01,571
Never mind. Forget it.

512
00:44:01,571 --> 00:44:05,074
It's a joke.
I'll talk to you later.

513
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:07,577
All right.

514
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:18,087
You sure about this?
You're not pulling
my leg?

515
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:21,591
What am i, an idiot?
Of course i'm sure.

516
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:24,093
You never--
no.

517
00:44:24,093 --> 00:44:26,095
Frankly, i think
i've said enough about it.

518
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:29,098
I never threatened
to cut your dick off.

519
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:43,529
Hello?
Yeah, it's your patient.

520
00:44:43,896 --> 00:44:46,399
The one who's been
involved in a few things
in the news lately?

521
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,785
I gotta talk to you.
What's wrong?

522
00:44:48,785 --> 00:44:52,288
There was no isabella.
What?

523
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:55,792
There was no isabella.
I just talked to cusamano.

524
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:58,294
Him and the whosits
just got back
from bermuda.

525
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:01,297
I asked him,"where's
the dental exchange student
that's stayin' at your house?"

526
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:04,917
- He looked at me
like i was fuckin'pazzo.
- You said your wife saw her.

527
00:45:05,418 --> 00:45:09,055
- You both argued about it.
- Yeah, i asked her about that.

528
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:11,174
And?
You thought
she was pissed then?

529
00:45:11,307 --> 00:45:14,310
You should see her now,
now that i told her the whole
thing was just a fantasy.

530
00:45:15,812 --> 00:45:18,815
- Discontinue the lithium.
- I already flushed it.

531
00:45:19,065 --> 00:45:23,436
Even if it was the medicine,
this fantasy of yours
has meaning.

532
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:28,574
You know, the issue
of mother and child,
the madonna.

533
00:45:28,574 --> 00:45:30,693
You didn't see this broad.

534
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:33,696
Did you ever flirt
or come on sexually
with isabella?

535
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:36,082
No.
Why not?

536
00:45:36,082 --> 00:45:40,586
You said she was
very beautiful and voluptuous.
Another question.

537
00:45:40,586 --> 00:45:44,090
- Why now?
- What do you mean?

538
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:47,093
Why the need for the fantasy
of a loving, caring woman now?

539
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:53,349
- I don't know.
- I think you should come in
so we could talk face- to- face.

540
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:56,352
- I can't right now.
- You know, your mother
is always...

541
00:45:56,352 --> 00:45:59,222
talking about infanticide.

542
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:01,224
Yeah, it's a sad situation
that goes on in the world.

543
00:46:01,607 --> 00:46:05,611
- Are you still feeling okay?
- I feel pretty good, actually.

544
00:46:05,611 --> 00:46:10,116
When i find out
who took a shot at me,
i'm gonna feel even better.
