1
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,086
Mr. Soprano?

2
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:03,589
Yeah.

3
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,101
Have a seat.

4
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,633
My understanding
from dr. Cusamano,

5
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,636
your family physician,
is that you collapsed.

6
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,138
Possibly
a panic attack.

7
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,140
You were
unable to breathe.

8
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,142
Theysaid it was
a panic attack...

9
00:02:57,142 --> 00:03:01,897
'cause the blood work
and neurological work
came back negative.

10
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:05,400
And they sent me here.

11
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,536
You don't agree
that you had a panic attack.

12
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:13,041
How are you feeling now?

13
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,043
Good.

14
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:18,547
Fine.
Back at work.

15
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:20,549
What line of work
are you in?

16
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,669
Waste management consultant.

17
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:33,679
Look, it's impossible
for me to talk
to a psychiatrist.

18
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:37,683
Any thoughts at all
on why you blacked out?

19
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:43,188
I dunno. Stress, maybe.

20
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:46,692
About what?

21
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,617
I don't know.

22
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:58,620
The morning
of the day i got sick,
i'd been thinking.

23
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:04,126
It's good to be in something
from the ground floor.

24
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:07,129
I came too late for that.
I know.

25
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,133
But lately,
i'm gettin' the feelin'
that i came in at the end.

26
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,135
The best is over.

27
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:17,639
Many americans, i think,
feel that way.

28
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,144
I think about my father. He
never reached heights like me.

29
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:25,647
But in a lot of ways,
he had it better.
He had his people.

30
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:28,650
They had their standards.
They had pride.

31
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:31,653
Today, what do we got?

32
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:39,911
Did you have these feelings of
loss more acutely in the hours
before you collapsed?

33
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:43,165
I don't know.

34
00:04:57,062 --> 00:05:00,932
- A couple of
months before,

35
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:04,069
these two wild ducks
landed in my pool.

36
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,574
It was amazing. They're
from canada or someplace,
and it was matin' season.

37
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:12,077
They had some ducklings.

38
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,836
Here you go.
Here you go.

39
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:28,460
My daughter's friend was there
to drive my daughter, meadow,
to school.

40
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,962
Meadow, your father
with those ducks.

41
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:33,965
I know. The whole yard
smells like duck poop.
It's embarrassing.

42
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:39,104
Girls, you gotta have more
than just cranberry juice.
You need brain food.

43
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:42,607
Happy birthday! Thirteen.
He doesn't act it.

44
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:45,610
The male and female duck
made a home in your pool
and did it.

45
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,114
- Eeew. Get outta here.
- Disgusting.

46
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:53,118
Girls, you want some
of last night'ssfogliatell?

47
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:57,873
- Get outta here with that fat.
- One bite.
- How do you stay so skinny?

48
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:03,628
Him with those ducks.

49
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:07,999
If you don't like that ramp,
i'll build you another one.
Maybe it's the wood.

50
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:14,005
Hey, kids, come here!
They're trying to fly!

51
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:17,509
- Come here. The babies--
they're trying to fly. -

52
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,011
look!
They're trying to fly.

53
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:23,765
National geographic, dad.
Super.

54
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:27,402
You showed us yesterday.
It's great!

55
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:31,773
Now, my wife feels this friend
is a bad influence.

56
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:35,277
That's so cool you're gonna
be able to come to aspen
with my family at christmas.

57
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:37,279
Last year,
i saw skeet ulrich.

58
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,781
As close as from
where you're sitting.
Oh, my god.

59
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:41,783
Miss meadow,
we made a deal--

60
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:44,286
you keep your school grades up
and you keep your curfew...

61
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:46,788
between now and christmas,
then you get to go.

62
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:48,790
I know that.

63
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,792
Good morning, ladies.
Hey, mr. Soprano.

64
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:53,295
We're late, dad.
Hey! Happy birthday.

65
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,797
Thanks, dad.

66
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:06,308
You're gonna be home
for anthony junior's
birthday party, right?

67
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,312
Bird man, hello.

68
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:13,315
Yeah. Yeah. I'll
get home early from work.

69
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:16,318
I'm not
talking about work.

70
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,573
This isn't gonna work.
I can't talk
about my personal life.

71
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,576
Finish telling me
about the day you collapsed.

72
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:32,968
I drove to work
with my nephew, christopher.
He's learning the business.

73
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:34,970
He's an example of what
i was talking about before.

74
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,975
Did you call what's- his- name
at triboro towers
about the hauling contract?

75
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:44,980
I got home too late
last night. I didn't
want to wake the man up.

76
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,984
Did you get up early
this morning and call?
He's in his office by 6:00.

77
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:52,988
I was nauseous this morning.
My mother told me i
shouldn't even come in.

78
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:57,108
Bear in mind,
this is a kid who just
bought himself a $60, 000 lexus.

79
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:05,617
There's that guy mahaffey.
Get out.

80
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:09,120
Yeah, right there
next to the boo- boo in pink.

81
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,122
Back up.

82
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:26,638
My friend mahaffey.
Pulling his taffy.
Hello.

83
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:30,892
We saw this guy,
and there was this issue
of an oustandin' loan.

84
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:34,279
Can i stop you for a second?

85
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,781
I don't know where
this story is going.

86
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:40,285
But there are a few
ethical ground rules...

87
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:43,788
we should quickly
get out of the way.

88
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:49,294
What you
tell me here falls under
doctor/patient confidentiality.

89
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:53,798
Except, if i was, uh--
if i was to hear,

90
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,801
let's say, a murder
was to take place.

91
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:58,803
Not that i'm saying it would,
but if--

92
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:03,308
if a patient comes to me
and tells me a story where
someone's going to get hurt,

93
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,810
i'm supposed to go
to the authorities.

94
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:08,813
Technically.

95
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,936
You said you were
in waste management.

96
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:19,824
- Environment.
- Dr. Cusamano, besides
being your family physician,

97
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:23,078
is also your
next- door neighbor.

98
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:25,580
See what i'm saying?

99
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,083
I don't know what happened
with this fellow,

100
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,585
i- i'm just saying.

101
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:35,707
Nothing. We had coffee.

102
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:41,596
- Help!
-

103
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:50,221
security! Help!
- Aw, shit!

104
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:12,744
- Asshole!
-

105
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:17,749
tony! Wait up!

106
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:27,642
Security!
Hey, security!

107
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:52,167
You all right?

108
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,669
My leg is broken!
The bone's coming
through.

109
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,671
Oh, let me see.

110
00:10:56,671 --> 00:11:00,425
I'll give you
a fuckin' bone, you prick!
Where's my fuckin' money?

111
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,678
- So you had coffee.
- Right.

112
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:07,682
- ...your fuckin' face,
motherfucker!
-

113
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:15,190
- what are you doing? Get
over here! Get over here!
- That's $3, 000. $3, 000.

114
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,692
Go ahead.

115
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:23,198
- Where's our fuckin' money?
- I'll get the money.

116
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,316
I know you'll get
the fuckin' money.

117
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:27,318
Know what you should get?
A cork in your fuckin' mouth,
'cause you tell people...

118
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:29,821
i'm nothing
compared to the people
that used to run things.

119
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:32,824
I'm sorry!
- You prick! -

120
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:36,828
i'm nothing?

121
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,833
Shut up!

122
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,086
What are you crying about?
H. M. O.!

123
00:11:45,086 --> 00:11:47,589
Huh?
You're covered, you prick!

124
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,092
Degenerate fuckin' gambler.

125
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:52,727
Go on.

126
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,230
Next day,
i had a breakfast meeting.

127
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,233
I was called in to consult
by a garbage company
i represent.

128
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:00,485
Big, what's the story
with triboro towers?

129
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,738
The site manager wants to
renew his contract with dick,

130
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:05,356
but this kolar
sanitation--

131
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,358
another nationwide company.

132
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:11,863
The kolar brothers, some kind
of czechoslovakian immigrants.

133
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:14,365
These polacks, they'll haul
paper, plastic and aluminum...

134
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:16,868
for 7, 000 a month
less than dick.

135
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,504
So they pay us
40 times the monthly
for stealin' your stop.

136
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:21,506
That's the thing--
they won't.

137
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:25,009
He says if he can
tell commie bosses
in czechoslovakia...

138
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:28,012
to go fuck themselves,
he can fuckin' tell us.
Oh!

139
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:30,882
I give up.
Fuckin' garbage
business.

140
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:33,384
Yeah, i know.
It's all changing.

141
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,386
Let me see what i can do.

142
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,523
Are you sure?
You over your stomachache?

143
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,525
Oh, yeah.
Good.

144
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:43,528
What are you
doin' here?
Hey.

145
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:47,532
Gabriella sends me down here
for thecapicollo.
Best in the area.

146
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:49,150
Hey, t,
let me ask you something--

147
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:52,654
you used to go to school
with a guy named artie bucco?

148
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:56,040
This situation came up.
It involves my uncle.

149
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,042
I can't go into details
on this one.

150
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,545
That's fine.
But i will say this:

151
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:03,915
My uncle adds
to my general stress level.

152
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:08,169
It's none of my business,
but down at the club...

153
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,674
word is your uncle junior
is gonna whack pussy malanga.

154
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,813
He's gonna do it at your friend
artie bucco's restaurant.

155
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,942
Hey, boys.
How are you?

156
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:36,447
Don't move.
Uncle jun',
how you doin'?

157
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:39,951
Hey, good to see you.

158
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,953
Hiya, chris.
Hey, uncle junior.

159
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:43,955
I was just
talking about you.

160
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:45,957
It's anthony junior's
birthday dinner tonight?

161
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:48,459
Yeah. Don't
buy anything big.

162
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:51,963
We overindulge him,
okay?

163
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,966
Hey!
Oh! Artie,
how's your rash?

164
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,968
It's itchy.
Come here.

165
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:01,856
Good to see you.
Can you come over?
Yeah. Have a seat.

166
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:08,863
You know what it means for
arthur, one of these old mutts
gets wet in here?

167
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:11,866
Yeah. It'll
ruin his business.

168
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,369
You better sit down
with your uncle.

169
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:19,490
Uncle junior's
my father's brother.

170
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,493
Good guy.
Just gettin' old. Cranky.

171
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:27,332
Used to take me to yankee games
when i was a kid.

172
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,717
I love my uncle.

173
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:33,721
At the same time,
when i was young,

174
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:37,225
he told my girl cousins i would
never be a varsity athlete,
and frankly,

175
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:41,229
that was a tremendous blow
to my self- esteem.

176
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:07,622
Who's there?
It's me, ma.

177
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:10,124
Who are you?

178
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:13,127
Ma, open the door.

179
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,633
Anthony?
Yeah, it's me.
Open the door.

180
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:26,140
Hi, how are you?

181
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,777
Geez, ma,
get some air in here.

182
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:32,280
You lock the door
after you?

183
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,285
Yeah. I did.
Somebody called here
last night after dark.

184
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:41,289
Who?
You think i'd answer?
It was dark out.

185
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,291
Ma, i'll never
understand that.

186
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,294
The phone is an auditory thing.
Dark is an eye thing.

187
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,796
I can understand
not going out after dark,

188
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:50,798
but not answering
the phone after dark?

189
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:53,301
Oh, listen to him.
He knows everything.

190
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:55,803
You want some lunch?
I got eggplant.

191
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:57,805
No. No.
I just ate.

192
00:15:57,805 --> 00:16:00,308
Know who i just ran into?
Uncle jun'.

193
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:05,813
You think he ever
comes to see
his sister- in- law?

194
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:07,815
Yeah. Remember
artie bucco?

195
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,818
Kid i went
to elementary school with?
Artie!

196
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:13,321
Oh! Yeah, i still
see his mother.

197
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:20,828
She tells me
he calls her
every day.

198
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:23,331
Yeah. Well.

199
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,333
Uncle jun's gonna
make a problem for artie.

200
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,335
Could affect
his livelihood.
What's that?

201
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:29,837
Cd player.

202
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:32,790
For who?
For me?
Yeah.

203
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,293
I don't want it.
You don't want it?

204
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:37,795
You love music. All the old
stuff is being reissued on cd.

205
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:41,799
All your old favorites.
Pajama game, connie francis.

206
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,801
Here.

207
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:53,811
Come on.
Come on.
What? What?

208
00:16:57,815 --> 00:16:59,317
Ma, you need something
to occupy your mind.

209
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:03,321
When dad died, you were going
to do all kinds of things.
Oh, he was a saint.

210
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,823
Yeah, i know he was,
but he's gone.

211
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:08,826
You were gonna travel,
get a volunteer job.

212
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:11,829
Stop tellin' me
how to live my life.
Just shut up.

213
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:17,335
- I just worry about you.
- Don't start with that
nursing home again.

214
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:21,339
It's not a nursing home!
It's a retirement community.

215
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,343
You're with active seniors
your own age. You go places.
You do things.

216
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:30,848
I've seen these women in these
nursing homes in wheelchairs
babbling like idiots.

217
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,353
- Here, eat your eggplant.
- I told you, i already
ate lunch.

218
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:40,858
All right, listen.

219
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,861
You just speak to uncle junior
about artie, okay?

220
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,364
He respects you.
He'll listen to you.

221
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:48,866
If your uncle has business
with arthur,

222
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:51,369
he knows what he's doing.

223
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:56,007
And i don't?

224
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:59,510
Well, all i know is...

225
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:04,132
daughters are better at
taking care of their mothers
than sons.

226
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:07,135
Yeah, and i bought cds
for a broken record.

227
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:15,893
I expect to see you tonight at
anthony junior's birthday party
with your baked ziti.

228
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:18,896
Only if i'm picked up
and brought back home.

229
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:22,400
I don't drive
when they're
predicting rain.

230
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,902
You're a healthy girl.
It's good for you to drive.

231
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:27,405
Use it or lose it.
I gotta go to work.

232
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:30,408
Sure. Run off.

233
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,746
And that night
was my son's birthday party.

234
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:38,249
My wife invites the priest.
He's always at the house.

235
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,251
Hey, tony.
How you doin'?

236
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:42,753
You likecreme anglais?
You bless it,
i'll eat it.

237
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:45,756
She's not coming.
Grandma just called.
Who?

238
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:47,758
She started crying
and hung up.

239
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:49,760
She needs
a purpose in life.

240
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,762
Your mother is tougher
than you think.

241
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:54,765
So what?
No fuckin' ziti now?
Hey!

242
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:30,017
At first, it felt like
ginger ale in my skull.

243
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,029
Mom, daddy just fell! Mom!

244
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,534
Tony!
Dad!

245
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:49,537
Get back!
Madonna mia!

246
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:52,039
Daddy! Dad!

247
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,543
Anthony jr. , call 911.

248
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:10,057
Dr. Cusamano
put me in the hospital.

249
00:20:10,057 --> 00:20:12,009
Gave me every kind of test.

250
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:16,597
When you're in the m. R. I. ,
there's a microphone if
you get claustrophobia.

251
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:21,919
I suggest you don't do that
because we have to start
over from the beginning.

252
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,905
Okay.

253
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,827
Hey, carm.

254
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:35,333
I thought you might
want some company.

255
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,452
Yeah.

256
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,955
6:30 in the morning.

257
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:44,458
How are the kids?

258
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,961
They're worried
about you.

259
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:51,215
I told anthony jr.
We'd rain- check his birthday.
Okay.

260
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:00,224
Think i got a brain tumor?

261
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:02,226
Well, we're gonna
find out.

262
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,730
What a bedside manner.
Very encouraging.

263
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,115
What are you gonna?
Not know?

264
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:13,988
We had some good times.

265
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:16,991
Had some good years.
Here he goes
with the nostalgia.

266
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,377
Hey, all i'm sayin'
is no marriage is perfect.

267
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:21,379
Well, havin' that
gumaon the side helps.

268
00:21:21,495 --> 00:21:23,631
I told you i'm not
seeing her anymore.

269
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:26,751
- How do you think i feel
having that priest around?
- Don't even go there!

270
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,253
Father is
a spiritual mentor.

271
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,255
He's helping me
to be a better catholic.

272
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,258
Yeah. Well, we all
got different needs.

273
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:38,396
What's different between
you and me is you're going
to hell when you die!

274
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,915
My nephew christopher...

275
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,418
was handling
the garbage contract problem.

276
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:04,922
But on this,
i will also not go into detail.

277
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:24,442
Emile kolar.
Chris moltisante.

278
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:28,446
In czech republic, too,
we love pork.

279
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,948
You ever have
our sausages?

280
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:35,953
No. I thought the only
sausages was italian
and jimmy dean's.

281
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:39,457
See what you learn
when you cross cultures
and shit.

282
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,460
My uncle evzen
doesn't know i came.

283
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,962
If we make progress,
i'll have to tell him.

284
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:49,467
We have
to make progress,"e- mail."
We gotta stop the madness.

285
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:51,969
The garbage business
is changing.

286
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:55,973
You and i of
the younger generation,
we have issues in common.

287
00:22:55,973 --> 00:23:00,478
"Emile."
Where'd you go
to high school?

288
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:04,482
Was it poland?
I'm not polish.

289
00:23:04,982 --> 00:23:07,985
Czechoslovakian, what's that?
A type of polack, right?

290
00:23:07,985 --> 00:23:11,489
We came to this country
when i was nine.
I went to west essex.

291
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:13,491
Yo, money. You used to play
my cousin in football.

292
00:23:13,491 --> 00:23:15,993
- He went to boon--
- where's the stuff?

293
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:18,496
Yes. Yes, yes.

294
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:21,999
The reason for the visit.

295
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:25,503
I got it all deployed
for you.

296
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,872
Taste the wares,"e- mail."

297
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,874
"Emile."

298
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:57,151
The doctors kept me hangin'
about the tests.

299
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:59,653
As doctors will do.

300
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:03,157
So my uncle and i played a round
of golf and had lunch.

301
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:07,044
You keep mentioning your uncle.
What seems to be the problem?

302
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:11,048
Who do you think you are?
The person who says
how things go.

303
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:14,051
Now, listen,
artie's business...

304
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:16,053
is nice, upscale people
from the suburbs.

305
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:18,055
Don't ruin his life.

306
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:20,558
Vesuvio is where pussy
feels safe.

307
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:22,560
He's been eating here
all his life.

308
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,563
Hey, you kill him
someplace else.

309
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:29,066
You may run north jersey,
but you don't run
your uncle junior.

310
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:33,070
How many fuckin'
hours did i play
catch with you?

311
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:40,694
Can we focus more
on your immediate family?

312
00:24:40,694 --> 00:24:43,197
My wife and my daughter
were not getting along.

313
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:47,084
Your husband
plowed under his corn
to build a baseball field.

314
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:49,587
These laser discs
are incredible.

315
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:53,591
Tony watchesgodfather ii
all the time.

316
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:56,093
He says the camera work
looks as good as in the theater.

317
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:58,596
Gordon willis. Tony
prefersii, noti?

318
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:01,599
Yeah. He likes the part
where vito goes back to sicily.

319
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,101
Iiiwas, like,
what happened?

320
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:06,103
Where does tony
rankgoodfellas?

321
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:10,107
Do you have racoons?

322
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:12,610
Somebody's
jimmying the window.
What?

323
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,113
You have all these
security lights.
Who would try--

324
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:20,117
oh, no.
Geez louise.

325
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:21,869
Hold it!

326
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,488
Meadow.

327
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:29,627
I notice the glass rattles
every time i walk
to the laundry room.

328
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:31,629
Do we have any,
what- ya- call- it, putty?

329
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:34,131
Don't give me that.
You snuck out!

330
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:38,135
- What's going on?
- You locked my bedroom window
on purpose so i'd get caught.

331
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:42,139
Normal people thought
you were doing your homework!

332
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:45,142
You have become a master
of lying and conniving.

333
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:46,894
Yeah, i know i'm grounded,

334
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:49,897
but patrick's swim meet
is tomorrow and he needed me!

335
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:54,151
Grounded for this?
Oh, no, you're not grounded.

336
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:57,905
You're not going
to aspen, that's where
you're not going.

337
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:59,657
Yes!

338
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:03,410
But this shit i'm tellin' ya,
it'll all blow over.

339
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:07,915
Didn't you admit
to dr. Cusamano...

340
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:10,417
that you were
feeling depressed?

341
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:24,431
Melfi.

342
00:26:25,432 --> 00:26:27,434
What part of the boot
you from, hon?

343
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:30,437
Dr. Melfi.

344
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:33,440
My father's people
were from caserta.

345
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,442
Avellino.

346
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:38,445
My mother would've loved it
if you and i got together.

347
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:50,324
Anxiety attacks are legitimate
psychiatric emergencies.

348
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:52,326
Suppose you were driving
and you passed out?

349
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:56,330
Let me tell you something.
Nowadays, everybody's
gotta go to shrinks...

350
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:00,834
and counselors and go on
sally jesse raphael
and talk about their problems.

351
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:04,338
Whatever happened
to gary cooper?

352
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:07,841
The strong, silent type.
That was an american.

353
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:09,843
He wasn't in touch
with his feelings.

354
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:11,845
He just did
what he had to do.

355
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:14,348
See, what they didn't know
is once they got gary cooper...

356
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:17,351
in touch with his feelings,
they wouldn't be able
to shut him up.

357
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:19,853
Then it's dysfunction
this and that,
dysfunctionvaffancul!

358
00:27:19,853 --> 00:27:24,358
You have strong feelings
about this.

359
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:26,360
I had a semester
and a half of college.

360
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,364
I understand freud.
I understand therapy
as a concept.

361
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:32,866
But in my world,
it does not go down.

362
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:38,372
Could i be happier?
Yeah. Who couldn't?

363
00:27:38,372 --> 00:27:41,375
Do you feel depressed?

364
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:45,379
Do you feel depressed?

365
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:55,389
Since the ducks left.
I guess.

366
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:59,393
The ducks that preceded
your losing consciousness.

367
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:02,396
Let's talk about them.

368
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:19,046
You can't blame t
for being pissed.
You whacked this kid.

369
00:28:19,046 --> 00:28:21,548
You should've waited.
That's the last time
i show initiative.

370
00:28:21,548 --> 00:28:24,051
Imagine how i felt?

371
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:26,053
T's running down
the garbage business;

372
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:28,055
i wet a guy to hold on
to one of our stops.

373
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:32,426
He's not running
it down. It's getting
harder in new york.

374
00:28:33,427 --> 00:28:38,432
One, two, three!

375
00:28:38,432 --> 00:28:40,434
Come on!

376
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:44,188
- This is fucked up.
- What, pussy?

377
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:46,690
The kolar uncle is gonna
find the kid dead
in one of his bins...

378
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,693
and get out of our
fuckin' business?

379
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:52,196
No way.
"Louis brasi
sleeps with the fishes."

380
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:57,201
- Luca brasi. Luca.
- Whatever.

381
00:28:57,201 --> 00:29:00,204
There's differences,
christopher, okay,

382
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:03,207
from the luca brasi
situation and this.

383
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,711
Look, the kolars
know the kid is dead,

384
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:09,713
it hardens
their position.

385
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:12,216
Plus, now, the cops
are looking
for a murderer.

386
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:14,218
So, what do you wanna do?

387
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:17,721
He disappears.
He never comes home.

388
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:20,224
They know,
but they don't know.

389
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:23,727
They hope maybe
he'll turn up...if.

390
00:29:23,727 --> 00:29:27,231
Yeah. Yeah.
Come on.
Let's get'im.

391
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:30,734
Take'im
to staten island.
I'll cut'im up.

392
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:32,736
All right.
Let's go.

393
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:35,739
Pussy, you know,
t collapsing
at the birthday--

394
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:39,743
what would you do
if he was disabled?

395
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:41,995
Why would you
even ask that?

396
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:46,467
Our lecture series
in action.

397
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:51,472
It's someone from the university
discussing the novels
of zora neale hurston.

398
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:53,974
Hmm!

399
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:56,477
Didn't you just
read her in school, med?

400
00:29:57,478 --> 00:29:59,480
It's very nice.

401
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:07,488
You know, grandma,
this place
is pretty neat.

402
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:09,990
You should really
think about it.

403
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:12,493
This room
was renovated last year.

404
00:30:12,993 --> 00:30:14,995
What goes on
behind there?

405
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:17,998
Those doors lead
to our nursing unit.

406
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:21,118
Thisis
a nursing home!

407
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:23,120
This is a residence,
but just in case--

408
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,124
no, you are not
getting me into--
you're not listening.

409
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:31,128
You're not listening, ma.
I know these women
in their wheelchairs.

410
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,630
Ma, you're not
listening.

411
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,133
Ma.
You think
you're so high and mighty.

412
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,635
With your fancy office.
Ma!

413
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:42,139
Ma!
People come here
to die.

414
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:48,645
Oh, my god!
Tony!

415
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:51,899
Somebody get a doctor.
Dad!

416
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,792
So, you've come back
for help.

417
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:04,294
Don't look at that
as a defeat.

418
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:06,797
She's part of
that generation that grew up
during the depression.

419
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:09,299
But the depression to her
was a trip to six flags.

420
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,302
There's that
"d" word again.

421
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:20,310
Stay with your mother.

422
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:29,319
Now that my father's dead,
he's a saint.

423
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,322
When he was alive,
nothing.

424
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:40,781
My dad was tough.
He ran his own crew.

425
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:45,285
A guy like that,
and my mother wore him down
to a little nub.

426
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:49,790
He was a squeaking
little gerbil when he died.

427
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,794
Quite a formidable
maternal presence.

428
00:31:57,264 --> 00:31:59,266
I gotta be honest
with you, um,

429
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:02,269
i'm not getting any satisfaction
from my work either.

430
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:04,271
Why?

431
00:32:04,771 --> 00:32:09,276
- Well, because of rico.
- Is he your brother?

432
00:32:09,276 --> 00:32:12,779
- No, the rico statutes?
- Oh, of course.

433
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:16,783
You read the papers?
The government's using
electronic surveillance...

434
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:20,287
and various legal strategies
to squeeze my business.

435
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,744
Do you have any qualms
about how you actually
make a living?

436
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:30,747
Yeah.

437
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,252
I find i have
to be the sad clown.

438
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:38,255
Laughing on the outside,

439
00:32:38,755 --> 00:32:41,258
crying on the inside.

440
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:44,761
See, things
are trending downward.

441
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:47,764
Used to be a guy got pinched,
he took his prison jolt
no matter what.

442
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:49,716
Everybody upheld
the code of silence.

443
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:54,237
Nowadays, no values.

444
00:32:54,237 --> 00:32:57,741
Guys today have no room
for the penal experience.

445
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:59,743
So everybody
turns government witness.

446
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,583
I feel exhausted
just talking about it.

447
00:33:07,084 --> 00:33:08,585
Well,

448
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:12,589
with today's pharmacology,
no one needs to suffer...

449
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:16,593
with feelings of
exhaustion and depression.

450
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:21,214
Here we go.
Here comes the prozac.

451
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:32,976
Mahaffey does not
have the money.
What do you mean?

452
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,479
- Mahaffey does not
have the money.
- How could he not?

453
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:38,865
- The man does not
have the money.
- We ran the man over.

454
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:42,486
- T himself.
- The man has no wiggle room.

455
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:44,988
He's bled dry.

456
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:50,994
So, uh,

457
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:53,997
i hear that junior
wants to whack
pussy bompensiero.

458
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:56,750
- Pussy malanga.
- Oh, little pussy.

459
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:00,754
You think he's going to fuck
with big pussy? My pussy?

460
00:34:01,755 --> 00:34:04,257
Andrea.

461
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:07,761
Stay with drinks on the house--
all night.

462
00:34:08,261 --> 00:34:10,263
Sorry, mr. Dante.
Sorry.

463
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:12,766
So, uh...

464
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:16,269
your uncle resents
that you're the boss.

465
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:17,771
Sadness accrues.

466
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:20,524
Your uncle's
had a hard- on
his whole life.

467
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:23,527
First against
your father,
his younger brother,

468
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:27,030
'cause he was a
made man before him,
and now you.

469
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,535
So, sure,
he can't stomach your
telling him what to do.

470
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:34,037
Hesh, i love the man.

471
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:37,174
The man is driven,
in toto, by his insecurities.

472
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,544
I feel bad i was the messenger.

473
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:45,048
Your friend, artie,
with the restaurant,

474
00:34:45,298 --> 00:34:47,934
get him out of town
for three weeks.

475
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:49,936
That way,
the restaurant closes,

476
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:53,440
the hit has to go down
someplace else.

477
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,944
You old fuckin' jew.
No wonder my old man
kept you around so long.

478
00:34:57,944 --> 00:35:01,448
What about this jew's 250
on mahaffey's 100?

479
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:09,456
All right, mahaffey has
a new business partner: You.

480
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:14,961
H. M. O. S pay out millions
to doctors, hospitals,
whatever the fuck.

481
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:18,465
That m. R. I. I had,
$2, 000 a pop.

482
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:22,469
Now, we
give this mahaffey a choice.
He either has his company...

483
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:26,473
start payin' out phoney claims
to fake clinics we set up...

484
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:30,477
or he pays hesh
the 250 grand he owes him--

485
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:33,980
which we know
he cannot do--

486
00:35:35,982 --> 00:35:38,735
or it's a rainy night
in lyndhurst.

487
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:42,739
Very smart.
Could be major.

488
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:46,743
- Could be as good as garbage.
- Garbage is our bread
and butter.

489
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:49,746
Was.

490
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:02,008
Miss meadow!

491
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:09,516
So, med.
I'm not going.

492
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:13,520
Every year on this date
since you were itty- bitty,

493
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,889
mom and meadow
get all dolled up,

494
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:20,894
drive in to new york,
plaza hotel, for tea
under eloise's portrait.

495
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:24,898
Look. Where's yours?
I have too much homework.

496
00:36:24,898 --> 00:36:28,902
It's our little tradition.
We always have so much fun.

497
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:32,405
To tell you the truth,
i felt it was dumb
since i was eight.

498
00:36:32,405 --> 00:36:34,908
I just go
because you like it.

499
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,413
And here i thought
this was something
we would do...

500
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:44,918
long after you got married
with girls of your own.

501
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:47,921
Hopefully i won't
be living here by then.

502
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:50,173
You've got mail.

503
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:55,929
Meadow, you can't just lie
and cheat and break the rules
you don't like!

504
00:36:58,932 --> 00:37:00,934
What? You have something
you want to say to me?

505
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:04,187
Do you have any idea
how much it means...

506
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:06,189
to go skiing in aspen?

507
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,192
Do you think
that's gonna happen
every year,

508
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:12,829
like lame tea and scones
at the plaza hotel?

509
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:16,199
Good- bye.

510
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:19,452
Close my door, please.

511
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:22,455
Artie!
Okay, gimme a drop.

512
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:25,458
Oh! A drop, not a spurt.
Suave, a drop.

513
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:29,462
Artie. How are you?
Hey!
Stir the meatballs.

514
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:32,465
I wonder if you can
help me out.
What do you need?

515
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:36,720
Cruise, caribbean,
s. S. Sagafjord,
11th through the 29th.

516
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,473
Pair of tickets.
I can't use'em.

517
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:43,476
Can you take'em
off my hands?
Where'd they come from?

518
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:46,112
- Comps.
- Comps?

519
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,367
- What does that mean,
"comps"?
- As business manager...

520
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:52,869
for the kitchen
the restaurant workers union,
i administer the dental plan.

521
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:55,488
You listening to me?
Yeah.

522
00:37:55,488 --> 00:37:59,993
A couple of dentists got
together, and in appreciation,
they awarded me these tickets.

523
00:38:00,493 --> 00:38:02,495
Problem is,
i can't get away.

524
00:38:02,495 --> 00:38:05,999
Here.

525
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,001
When's the last time
you got away?

526
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:10,887
Anthony, thank you.
All right.

527
00:38:17,894 --> 00:38:19,896
Mr. Soprano.

528
00:38:27,654 --> 00:38:30,657
You cannot accept
a gift like that
from tony soprano.

529
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:33,159
No way.
Listen, charmaine,

530
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:36,663
if i gotta stick my hand
up the ass of one more lobster
without a break--

531
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:40,667
i'm gonna go postal.
I don't even
want to talk about it.

532
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:44,671
Art, melissa,
it's time to go home.

533
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:47,674
Honey, you have
to get away.

534
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:50,176
Wehave to get away
for the marriage.

535
00:38:50,176 --> 00:38:53,179
No! It's bad enough
that these mobsters...

536
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:55,932
still come in
and patronize the place.

537
00:38:55,932 --> 00:39:00,553
- So what? We're not connected.
- Because we
turned down those tickets.

538
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:04,307
But the tickets were comps.
Tony is a labor leader.

539
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,309
Arthur,
please grow up!

540
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,312
Does the mind
not rebel at
any scenario...

541
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:13,316
under which dentists
are sending the don
of new jersey...

542
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:15,318
first class
on a norwegian
steamship?

543
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:19,322
Somebody donated
their kneecaps
for those tickets.

544
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:22,208
Herman, there's no way
i can subvert...

545
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,210
my fuckin' company.

546
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,213
Have them
pay claims for m. R. I. S
that never happened?

547
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:29,716
The paperwork
will look just
like the real.

548
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:31,718
How do i not
get caught?

549
00:39:31,718 --> 00:39:33,720
I hate to hear you
knocking yourself.

550
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,222
You're a smart guy.
I'm depressed.

551
00:39:36,222 --> 00:39:38,224
I'm so depressed
i can't eat, sleep.

552
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:41,728
You on prozac?
Zoloft.
It's similar.

553
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:44,230
It's supposed to help
with gambling too.
No shit?

554
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,233
This new generation
of antidepressants...

555
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:50,987
are supposed to be useful
against compulsive behaviors.

556
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:52,989
That's a shame.
A medication comes along...

557
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:55,992
after gambling gets
your fuckin' hip busted to shit.

558
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:58,995
I'm trying
not to be cynical.

559
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:01,998
Your debt and the feeling
surrounding it is the source
of your problems.

560
00:40:02,115 --> 00:40:05,869
You know it and i know it.
I'm sorry i haven't
paid you, herman.

561
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:10,006
- I know you are.
- I never meant
to denigrate tony soprano.

562
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:12,008
Hey, you wanna go
for a walk in the rocks?

563
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:15,011
The crutches.
I can't--
come on.

564
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:18,515
It's beautiful.
We'll help you.
I go out to think.

565
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:34,531
Thanks, but no.

566
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:37,534
Uh...let's try it--

567
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:42,405
what you were sayin' before
with the m. R. I. S?

568
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:09,432
Dick's lookin' for ya.

569
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:13,937
Hey, tony. I just heard
from triboro towers.

570
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:16,940
The kolar brothers
withdrew their bid.

571
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,942
That's good.
That's good.

572
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:21,945
Listen, by the way,
artie bucco's here to see you.

573
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:23,947
I gotta go, guys.
Take care.

574
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:33,957
Artie! Artie,
you all right?

575
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,462
I can't.
What are you
talkin' about?

576
00:41:39,712 --> 00:41:43,716
- We discussed this.
You gotta leave town.
- I'm sorry.

577
00:41:50,857 --> 00:41:53,359
This is unacceptable!

578
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,862
I had an 8:00 reservation
i made two weeks ago.

579
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:58,865
Sir, as i explained,
people are not leaving
their tables,

580
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:00,867
and there are five parties
ahead of you.

581
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:04,370
What would you like--
can i help you?

582
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:07,373
I tore her a new one.

583
00:42:07,373 --> 00:42:11,377
Why don't we go to
another restaurant
and eat?

584
00:42:11,377 --> 00:42:14,380
We're here.
Mr. Soprano, how you doin'?

585
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:17,133
Giuseppe, how you doin'?

586
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:20,637
Hey.
This way.

587
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:27,644
Sweetie pie, i'm hungry.

588
00:42:27,644 --> 00:42:30,763
- Hey.
- Tony, where are you going?

589
00:42:30,763 --> 00:42:34,517
- Hey. How are you?
- Good.

590
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:37,520
You come here?
When possible.

591
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:43,776
Hey, uh, listen,
those decorating tips
you gave me really work.

592
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:46,529
Good.

593
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:48,531
How you doin'?

594
00:42:53,286 --> 00:42:55,288
Nils. Nils.

595
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:58,291
Do you know
who that was?

596
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:01,294
Obviously, you do.
Is he a patient?

597
00:43:01,294 --> 00:43:03,680
You know i can't say.

598
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:10,303
Decorating tips--
yeah, right.

599
00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:12,305
Nils, shut the fuck up.

600
00:43:12,805 --> 00:43:16,059
Mr. Borglund, they're
setting up your table right now.

601
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,946
Whoa.

602
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:22,949
Who was that woman
tonight at the restaurant?

603
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,867
My decorator.

604
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:27,870
What? You're
redoing the garbage dump?
That's funny.

605
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,373
Hey, you better not be
messin' with that hat!

606
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:35,878
Goddamn! Come on!
That's j. F. K. 's hat!

607
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:38,381
I bought it
at that auction.
Gimme that!

608
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:41,384
Irina, jesus.

609
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:45,888
I know there is something
more intimate
between you and her.

610
00:43:45,888 --> 00:43:47,890
Nothing intimate.
We just talk.

611
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:50,393
Yeah.

612
00:43:58,017 --> 00:44:00,019
Mr. Soprano, buonasera.

613
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:02,522
Months we don't see you.
Where you been?

614
00:44:02,522 --> 00:44:05,525
Signora carmela.

615
00:44:08,778 --> 00:44:13,416
You know, sometimes,
life is good.

616
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,918
Life is often good.

617
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:18,921
True regaliali,
for example.

618
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:22,925
You been in good spirits
the last couple days.

619
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:33,936
Carmela,

620
00:44:33,936 --> 00:44:35,938
something i gotta confess.

621
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:43,946
What are you doing?
Getting my wine in position
to throw in your damn face.

622
00:44:43,946 --> 00:44:47,950
You're always with the drama.
You go ahead and confess
already. Get it over with.

623
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:54,457
I'm on prozac.

624
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:57,460
Oh. Oh, my god.

625
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,963
I been seein' a therapist.
Oh, my god!

626
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:03,966
I think that's great!
I think that's wonderful!

627
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:05,968
I think that's
so gutsy!

628
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:09,472
All right,
take it easy.
That's wonderful!

629
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:11,974
You'd think i was
hannibal lecter before.

630
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:14,477
I just think it's great.
Psychology doesn't
address the soul.

631
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:18,481
That's something else.
But this is a start.
I'm gonna shut up now.

632
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:22,485
I'll shut up now.
You're the only person
who knows.

633
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:25,988
The only reason
i'm telling you this
is'cause you're my wife.

634
00:45:25,988 --> 00:45:28,991
You're the only person
on this planet
i'm totally honest with.

635
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:33,496
Oh, please.
Goddamn it, i'm serious.

636
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:37,500
Wrong person finds out, i get
a steel- jacketed antidepressant
in back of the head.

637
00:45:47,877 --> 00:45:50,880
I didn't realize
you were so unhappy.

638
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:57,887
I don't know.
My mother--

639
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:00,273
you told him
about your father, right?

640
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:03,276
Who?
Your therapist.

641
00:46:03,276 --> 00:46:06,279
Yeah. Yeah, i told him.

642
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:10,783
Oh, good. But your mother
is the one.

643
00:46:10,783 --> 00:46:15,788
I don't know.
I feel like lately
my life's out of balance.

644
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:22,795
Our existence on this earth
is a puzzle.

645
00:46:23,296 --> 00:46:26,299
My own daughter hates me.

646
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:28,801
She doesn't hate you, carm.

647
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:31,304
We were best friends.
Mothers and their daughters.

648
00:46:31,804 --> 00:46:34,807
She'll come back to you.

649
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,929
Hello?
Jesus, i got through.

650
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:41,931
What's the matter,
no social life?

651
00:46:42,064 --> 00:46:43,566
Blow me.

652
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:46,068
Dad!

653
00:46:46,068 --> 00:46:48,070
I brought you
my primavera.

654
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,573
It's your favorite.

655
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:54,076
Who is it?
Christopher.

656
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:56,329
Friend of ours just got back.
Little pussy malanga,

657
00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:00,333
sometimes confused
with fellow mobster
big pussy bompensiero,

658
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:02,335
had just returned
from florida--

659
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:04,837
so it's gonna
go down soon?

660
00:47:04,837 --> 00:47:07,089
Don't worry about it.
I got a way
to put it to bed.

661
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:11,210
Come on, meadow!

662
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:13,596
Go falcons!

663
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:17,099
So, uh, when do you
need this by?

664
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,101
Right away.

665
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:22,972
Way to go, meadow!
Beautiful. Beautiful.

666
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:24,974
I think i can get a party
like that together.

667
00:47:25,474 --> 00:47:29,228
Side out? That ball
hit the line.
What are you doin', ref?

668
00:47:33,733 --> 00:47:37,236
Mom didn't come?
Didn't think
you wanted her to.

669
00:47:37,236 --> 00:47:39,238
Car's over there.

670
00:47:39,238 --> 00:47:41,240
Hey, mr. Dante.

671
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,242
Hi.
See ya, heather.

672
00:47:43,242 --> 00:47:45,244
You guys
played a good game.

673
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:47,246
That heather dante,
where'd she get
that spike?

674
00:47:47,747 --> 00:47:50,249
Dad, don't you think
it's unfair what mom is doing?

675
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,752
Now making this
movie scene out of it.

676
00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:58,257
The sad mom who can't
come to her daughter's
sports events.

677
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:04,513
Dad.

678
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:09,101
Don't you think
it's totally out there?
My aspen trip.

679
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:11,103
What is she thinking?

680
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:13,322
Dad?

681
00:48:19,779 --> 00:48:22,281
It's been years
since i been here.

682
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:25,034
Dad, please talk to her.
Please.

683
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:28,037
This is so stupid.

684
00:48:28,037 --> 00:48:30,039
Why are we sitting here?

685
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:34,543
Your mother thinks
you have the capacity
to be a top student,

686
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:36,545
and i agree.

687
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:39,548
What do you guys want,
perfection?

688
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,552
What are you looking at?

689
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:47,556
Your great- grandfather
and his brother frank,

690
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:50,059
they built this place.

691
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:52,061
Big whoop.

692
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:55,564
Stone and marble workers.
They came over from italy...

693
00:48:55,564 --> 00:48:58,567
and they built this place.

694
00:48:59,068 --> 00:49:02,071
Yeah, right. Two guys.

695
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:07,960
No, there were two guys
and a crew of laborers.

696
00:49:09,962 --> 00:49:12,465
They didn't design it...

697
00:49:13,466 --> 00:49:16,085
but they knew
how to build it.

698
00:49:18,471 --> 00:49:21,474
Go out now and find me two guys
who can put decent grout
around your bathtub.

699
00:49:58,377 --> 00:50:00,513
So i feel good.

700
00:50:00,513 --> 00:50:04,016
So i don't know if i'm
gonna be needing to come back.

701
00:50:04,016 --> 00:50:06,018
It's not the prozac.

702
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:08,437
Why not?

703
00:50:08,437 --> 00:50:10,423
You said you're
thinking clearer...

704
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:14,393
and your wife says
you seem to be better?

705
00:50:14,393 --> 00:50:16,896
It's not the medication.

706
00:50:17,897 --> 00:50:19,899
Prozac takes
several weeks...

707
00:50:19,899 --> 00:50:22,401
to build up effective levels
in the blood.

708
00:50:22,785 --> 00:50:25,287
What is it, then?

709
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:28,791
Coming here. Talking.

710
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:32,795
Hope comes in many forms.

711
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:34,797
Well, who's got time
for that?

712
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:37,800
What is it you want
to say to me?

713
00:50:47,226 --> 00:50:50,679
I had a dream last night.

714
00:50:52,314 --> 00:50:54,683
Uh...

715
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:58,687
my bellybutton was...

716
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:01,690
a phillips head screw.

717
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,693
And i'm workin'
unscrewin' it,

718
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:06,695
and when i get it
unscrewed...

719
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:11,834
my penis falls off.

720
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:20,342
You know, i pick it up.
And i'm holdin' it
and i'm runnin' around...

721
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,344
lookin' for the guy who used to
work on my lincoln--

722
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:26,348
when i drove lincolns--
so he can put it back on.

723
00:51:26,348 --> 00:51:28,851
And...

724
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:31,854
i'm holdin' it up,
and this bird swoops down...

725
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:34,857
and grabs it in its beak...

726
00:51:34,857 --> 00:51:37,359
and flies off with it.

727
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:42,531
- What kind of bird? -

728
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:47,036
i don't know.
Seagull or something.

729
00:51:47,036 --> 00:51:49,789
A water bird?

730
00:51:49,789 --> 00:51:52,291
I sawthe birds
last week on cable.

731
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:55,294
You think
that planted the idea?
What else is a water bird?

732
00:51:56,295 --> 00:51:58,798
Pelican. Flamingo.

733
00:51:59,298 --> 00:52:01,550
What about ducks?

734
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:10,509
Those goddamned ducks.

735
00:52:10,509 --> 00:52:13,145
What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

736
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:24,073
It was just a trip
havin' those...

737
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:27,076
wild creatures come...

738
00:52:27,576 --> 00:52:30,579
into my pool and have
their little babies.

739
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:41,090
I was sad to see'em go.

740
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:45,594
Aw, jesus! Fuck!
Now he's gonna cry.

741
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,553
Shit. Fuck me.

742
00:52:54,553 --> 00:52:56,555
When the ducks
gave birth...

743
00:52:57,056 --> 00:53:00,809
to those babies,
it became a family.

744
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:06,815
You're right.

745
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:09,952
That's the link.
The connection.

746
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:13,455
I'm afraid i'm gonna
lose my family...

747
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:16,458
like i lost the ducks.

748
00:53:17,826 --> 00:53:20,045
That's what i'm full
of dread about.

749
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:27,169
- That's always with me.
- What are you so afraid's
going to happen?

750
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,140
I don't know.

751
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:39,014
You work so hard.
You work so damn hard.

752
00:53:39,014 --> 00:53:42,518
And to see
your life's dream...

753
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:45,521
burn down.

754
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:48,524
Look at it this way.
You collect the insurance.

755
00:53:48,908 --> 00:53:50,409
Arthur, you gotta
say to yourself, it
could've been worse.

756
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,411
Yeah.
How could it
have been worse?

757
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:55,915
Fuckin' faulty stove!

758
00:53:56,415 --> 00:53:58,918
Suppose people stop coming
to the restaurant?

759
00:54:00,286 --> 00:54:03,172
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.

760
00:54:04,673 --> 00:54:07,676
He's right about that.
There's no insurance for that.

761
00:54:07,676 --> 00:54:10,179
But why would people
stop coming?

762
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:12,681
It's just starting
to catch on.

763
00:54:13,682 --> 00:54:16,685
Know what i'm
figuring out lately?

764
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:18,687
Talking helps.

765
00:54:18,687 --> 00:54:21,690
- That's right.
- He's right.

766
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:29,949
- Hope comes in many forms.
- Absolutely.

767
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:32,568
Come on.

768
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:35,070
Oh, geez.
Here, hold this.

769
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,073
Artie. Artie, come on.

770
00:54:38,073 --> 00:54:40,075
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

771
00:54:40,075 --> 00:54:42,077
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

772
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:45,581
I'll always help you.

773
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:49,084
Come on. Come on.

774
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:56,342
Go cook. Let'im cook.
He'll feel better.

775
00:55:07,853 --> 00:55:10,856
Someday i'll tell him
we torched the restaurant...

776
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:13,242
as the best solution.

777
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:18,614
Enough of this shit.

778
00:55:18,864 --> 00:55:20,833
What's wrong with you?

779
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:24,336
You know, a simple
"way to go, chris"...

780
00:55:24,336 --> 00:55:29,091
on the triboro towers
contract would've been nice.

781
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:41,470
You're right.
You're right.

782
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:46,975
I have no defense.
That's howiwas parented,
never supported.

783
00:55:46,975 --> 00:55:49,728
Never complimented.

784
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:52,731
You know, my cousin gregory's
girlfriend is what they call...

785
00:55:53,232 --> 00:55:55,234
a development girl
out in hollywood.

786
00:55:55,617 --> 00:55:58,120
She said i could sell
my life story-- make millions.

787
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,489
I didn't do that.
I stuck it out with you--

788
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:02,624
come here. I could
fuckin' kill you.

789
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,127
What are you gonna do,
go henry hill on me?

790
00:56:05,127 --> 00:56:08,630
You know how many mobsters
are selling screenplays,
screwing everything up?

791
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,632
She said i could maybe
even play myself.

792
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:13,135
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

793
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:18,640
Forget hollywood
screenplays.

794
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,642
Forget
those distractions.

795
00:56:20,642 --> 00:56:24,146
What do you think,
i haven't had offers?

796
00:56:26,648 --> 00:56:29,151
You got work to do.
New avenues.

797
00:56:29,151 --> 00:56:31,653
Everything's
gonna be all right
from here on in.

798
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:34,156
Come on.

799
00:56:34,156 --> 00:56:36,158
Look, it's
a beautiful day.

800
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:38,777
What could be bad?

801
00:56:40,779 --> 00:56:44,783
It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, junior.

802
00:56:44,783 --> 00:56:48,036
At least somebody
cares about me.

803
00:56:48,036 --> 00:56:51,540
These kids today.
I suppose he thinks...

804
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,293
once he has me locked
in a nursing home,
i'll die faster.

805
00:56:54,793 --> 00:56:57,296
And then he won't
have to drive me anywhere.

806
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:01,683
If his father
were still alive,

807
00:57:01,934 --> 00:57:04,937
he'd show more decency
and respect for his mother.

808
00:57:04,937 --> 00:57:08,440
My brother john
was a man among men.

809
00:57:08,941 --> 00:57:10,943
He was a saint.

810
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:14,813
Anyway, lots of things
are different now
from johnny's and my day.

811
00:57:15,314 --> 00:57:16,815
What do you mean?

812
00:57:17,316 --> 00:57:20,819
I'm not free to run
my business like i want.
Isn't that awful.

813
00:57:20,953 --> 00:57:22,955
Just this week,
your son stuck his hand in.

814
00:57:22,955 --> 00:57:25,457
Made it a hundred times
more difficult for me.

815
00:57:25,457 --> 00:57:29,461
- Plus, he thumbs his nose
at new york.
- Oh!

816
00:57:29,461 --> 00:57:32,965
What are you going to do?
He's part of a whole generation.

817
00:57:32,965 --> 00:57:34,967
Remember the crazy hair?

818
00:57:34,967 --> 00:57:37,469
And the dope.
Now it's fags in the military.

819
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,722
Stop it, junior!
You're makin' me very upset!

820
00:57:40,722 --> 00:57:43,225
I don't like to, livia,
but i'm allagita
all the time.

821
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:45,227
I'll tell you
something else,

822
00:57:45,594 --> 00:57:48,096
things are down
across the board.

823
00:57:48,096 --> 00:57:52,100
A lot of friends
of ours
are complaining.

824
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,603
We used to be recession- proof.
No more.

825
00:57:54,603 --> 00:57:58,607
You can't blame it all
on the justice department.

826
00:57:59,107 --> 00:58:01,610
Our friends say to me,

827
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:05,614
"junior, why don't you take
a larger hand in things?"

828
00:58:09,618 --> 00:58:13,005
Something may have to be done,
livia, about tony.

829
00:58:14,006 --> 00:58:16,008
I don't know.

830
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:24,766
There they are.
Hey, ma! Uncle jun'!

831
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:26,768
