3
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,195
Meadow, do you have a tampon?

4
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,958
I'm spotting and the dispenser is out.

5
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,790
You had an examination?

6
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,792
It's the middle of the month.
This never happens to me.

7
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,175
Here.

8
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,530
Imagine having your portrait
in a museum.

9
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,660
She's a rich merchant's wife.
It's how Rubens made money.

10
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:37,492
You talk the talk, Miss Art History.
I've never seen these grades from you.

11
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,207
Well, you take Intro to Semiotics.

12
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,086
If you spent less time
in Jackie's car...

13
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,499
Please.

14
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,468
That is so over.

15
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,759
Just like that? What happened?

16
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,878
Are you crying?

17
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,506
What's the matter?

18
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,376
I don't know. Just look at it.

19
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,890
<i>“Jusepe de Ribera. The Mystical
Marriage of Saint Catherine."</i>

20
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,150
That's the baby Jesus.

21
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,731
She's marrying a baby?
Good luck.

22
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,396
We all do.

23
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,610
- What?
- I shouldn't be sarcastic.

24
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,826
Just look at her.

25
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,413
The little baby's
hand against her cheek.

26
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,296
She's so at peace.

27
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:14,054
A beautiful, innocent,
gorgeous little baby.

28
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,059
Come on, let's go eat.

29
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,955
Tony!

30
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,334
Come on.
I'm sorry about what happened.

31
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,622
- You won't return my calls.
- Go fuck yourself.

32
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,131
Tony.

33
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,006
We have something too special
to just... over one argument.

34
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,808
One argument? You threw a fucking
dinner at my head, Gloria.

35
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,310
If you were a guy,
you know where you'd be.

36
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,144
But you were late.
You kept me waiting three hours...

37
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,732
What about the present?
You threw it into the Barnegat Bay.

38
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,649
All right, I...

39
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:21,034
I'm having a bad couple of weeks.
Shit with my family and other crap.

40
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:26,001
I was trying to act in control
and not dwell on it. It's no excuse.

41
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,756
- We can't talk about your problems?
- I didn't wanna bother you.

42
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,343
Well, I had a lot on my plate.

43
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,004
Can I see you later?

44
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,674
I'm late for my appointment.

45
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,272
Me and this broad, we're like...

46
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,229
leather and lace.

47
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,895
A burning ring of fire.
Whatever.

48
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,688
<i>Amour fou.</i>

49
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,775
As the French call it.

50
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,865
- Crazy love, all-consuming.
- That's it.

51
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,198
We push each other's buttons.

52
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,369
- Most people don't push your buttons.
- That's not true.

53
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:14,542
Now, I know you think I'm like a hard,
cold, captain-of-industry type.

54
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,877
That's not all there is.

55
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,714
I don't know.

56
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,603
She gets freaky.

57
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,307
Is she a full-blown
loop-do-loo or what?

58
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,977
- As you know, I cannot...
- Discuss another patient.

59
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,897
If I duke you a five?

60
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,738
I'm not charging you.
Last month you overpaid.

61
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,825
- You gave me good tips.
- I won't have it.

62
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,911
- Don't offer it again.
- All right. Jesus.

63
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,792
- Back to Gloria.
- She never wants money.

64
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,328
And you like this?

65
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:56,334
She's, you know, very
independent-minded. That I do like.

66
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,924
- You see her as independent, strong.
- She's not?

67
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,260
We're talking about your perceptions.

68
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,267
She made her own way in the world.

69
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,771
Irina was such
a helpless, fucking baby.

70
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,730
But Gloria knows a lot,
about a lot of shit.

71
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,609
Buddhism, and the movies...

72
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,451
She went to Morocco all by herself.

73
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,122
And those eyes.

74
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,453
Those dark, black eyes.

75
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,298
When she stares at you, it's like...

76
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,802
Like a Spanish princess
in one of those paintings. A Goya.

77
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,723
- Those eyes are deep.
- Complicated.

78
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,852
- Complicated? I said deep.
- You said dark.

79
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,514
Whenever I bring her up,
you get this weird puss.

80
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,021
You ask if she seems happy.
Like she's not.

81
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,064
Or if she reminds me of somebody.
Like you don't like it.

82
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,820
Amo-fo, or whatever you call it.

83
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,905
You've told me what you see in Gloria.
What does she see in you?

84
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,573
Oh, please, huh?

85
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,160
What does she see in me?

86
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:19,004
With all the faggots and crybabies
around. Whatever else I am, I'm not...

87
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,928
I'm more of...

88
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,093
Well, you know, like I said...

89
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,299
Captain-of-industry type.

90
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,224
- You're a tough guy.
- Oh, come on.

91
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,854
You can say it.

92
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,936
You embarrass me with that.

93
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,272
Does Gloria know
what you do for a living?

94
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,732
You mentioned fire.

95
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,525
Can we say that certain kinds
of people are drawn to fire?

96
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:48,787
Looking for an inevitable result,
like a moth to a flame?

97
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,039
And this is Gloria?

98
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,250
And I'm the flame?

99
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:59,461
Why would anybody hit you,
of all people, with a side of beef?

100
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,919
She's complicated.

101
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,461
I said complicated. Dark, you said.

102
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,880
No, I said her eyes are dark.

103
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,552
Nice. Not bad.

104
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,392
Since we're kicking up...

105
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,311
we were hoping you could,
you know...

106
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,355
watch our back?

107
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,409
350 buys you "Hello."

108
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,783
Watching your back...

109
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:36,789
That's gonna require
a little more initiative on your part.

110
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,120
Oh, look at the face.

111
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,755
What's he got to be frowning about?

112
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,002
Tell me, Romeo.

113
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,672
Now that you moved home...

114
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,768
you gonna be humping Tony
Soprano's girl on our couch?

115
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,269
Fuck her.

116
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:59,183
And Tony's stay-in-school shit. He
could have reached out to Rutgers.

117
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,441
He should break the dean's legs
because you won't read.

118
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,107
Now go ahead.
I gotta make some calls.

119
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,113
You did good.

120
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,902
Keep coming by.

121
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,118
Go. Go.

122
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:30,177
I knew a Moroccan guy once.
He hit and ran me. I tracked him down.

123
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,432
I never forget a face.

124
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,935
Jesus Christ!
That's the oldest joke in the book.

125
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,312
Jesus Christ!

126
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,980
Hello?

127
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,938
No, you have the wrong number.

128
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,983
What?

129
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,741
I thought it might be my sister.

130
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,995
That family shit
you were telling me about?

131
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,505
It's okay if you don't wanna talk
about it. Really.

132
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,884
She said I can never see
my niece and nephew again.

133
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:14,426
- Right before Christmas.
- We had a new Santa at our party.

134
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,185
- Wasn't good.
- I love those children.

135
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,762
So much.

136
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,770
She said I turned them
against their dad. I didn't.

137
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:27,354
Not that he doesn't deserve it.
Fucking crackhead sack of shit.

138
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,526
Hannah and Seamus go to this
alternative, private...

139
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,241
elementary school in Santa Monica.

140
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,124
- Where it's all about self-esteem.
- I hate that shit.

141
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:44,209
I ask Hannah, she's a third-grader,
"Will you be in the Christmas play?"

142
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,295
And she says,
"We call it the Winter Festival."

143
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:52,720
So I go, "Whatever."
I don't say anything.

144
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:59,056
"We can't say Christmas.
We call Christmas 'the C-word."'

145
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,722
And I fucking flipped out.

146
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,440
- What did Seamus say?
- What the fuck does he know? He's 10.

147
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,902
So my sister gets mad
because her husband...

148
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,787
teaches there, except he's
on leave for drug abuse treatment.

149
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,494
And one thing led to another and...

150
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,126
She said I always had it in for John.

151
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,790
- And she forbid me to see them again.
- He smokes crack?

152
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,294
Without those two kids...

153
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,476
Maybe we'll all get lucky.
The way these trucks go by out here?

154
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,938
- Maybe I'll get plastered on a grill.
- What?

155
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,107
I'm just kidding. It never rains.

156
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,444
I think they're gonna fire me
over at Globe.

157
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,572
Fucking Arnie Mills sexually harasses
me and then dares me to sue.

158
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,785
Anyway-

159
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,700
Fuck them.

160
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,871
- You like this song?
- It's okay.

161
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,713
- I love this song.
- Yeah?

162
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:53,008
Guys, if you're gonna smoke,
take it outside.

163
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,844
Fuck's the matter?
Speak English?

164
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,014
- Who are you?
- The owner is a dear friend.

165
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,229
- That should be enough for you.
- Fuck him too.

166
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,232
- What you fucking say?
- Chill! Relax!

167
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,567
Jackie. What are you doing?

168
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,073
It's under control.

169
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:21,031
Go find a fucking Taco Bell
before I cap your asses.

170
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,367
Get the fuck out of here.

171
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,912
- Oh, shit. Take this.
- Fuck, no. He's a made guy.

172
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,550
He'll flip when he sees this shit.
Roy's his aunt's cousin.

173
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,754
- What's up?
- Hey, Christopher.

174
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,891
- What the fuck happened?
- Ask your buddy.

175
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:47,562
Spics disrespected the place.
I had to straighten them out.

176
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,815
- Had to straighten them out. How many?
- Three.

177
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,897
- Goddamn fucking craziness.
- You all right?

178
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:59,070
Twenty years I'm collecting these.
What the fuck, it's only glass.

179
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,076
Have a seat.

180
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,503
- How's business? Making money?
- Doing all right.

181
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,424
- Why, got something?
- My favorite. A truck. Cigarettes.

182
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,132
Sounds good.
But we're kind of with Ralphie now.

183
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,797
Besides, wouldn't Tony go ballistic?

184
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,932
Unless they're paying you...

185
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,478
nobody can tell anybody
how to earn a living.

186
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,015
- Finally. Thank you.
- Ralphie, huh?

187
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:37,775
Well, if you ever think about
jumping ship, you know my number.

188
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,614
I need the paperwork
on the preowned C5.

189
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,124
- Mrs. Soprano?
- Yes?

190
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,873
The courtesy Van's stuck in traffic.
It should only be maybe 20 minutes.

191
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,171
Well, you know,
maybe I'll just call a cab.

192
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,803
Jerry, I'll give her a lift.
I'm going out anyway.

193
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,806
- Gloria Trillo.
- Carmela Soprano. You don't mind?

194
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,468
Give me a minute,
let me grab a demo.

195
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,850
This is sweet of you.

196
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:16,985
Don't believe it.
Everybody is a potential sale.

197
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,863
- So, what do you do?
- I'm a homemaker.

198
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,023
Oh.

199
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:26,323
You must make a very nice home
to drive a Benz.

200
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,706
- So you're married?
- Yes.

201
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,040
- Kids?
- Two. You?

202
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,414
No. To both.

203
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,171
Boys? Girls?

204
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,835
One boy, one girl.

205
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,347
The boy is still in high school
and my daughter's in college.

206
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,350
She's not too far away though.

207
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,312
She's in New York City.

208
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,907
- She's at Columbia.
- School of Broadcasting?

209
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:08,536
The university. It's in the Ivy
League, one of the top schools.

210
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,914
- I know. I was just kidding.
- Oh.

211
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,950
Right.

212
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,582
Boy, these kids today.

213
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,543
They got the world
by the you-know-what.

214
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,799
Yeah, tell me about it.

215
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:26,134
At least your daughter doesn't
need a man for success.

216
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,884
Thank God.

217
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,140
- That's a beautiful ring.
- Thank you.

218
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,104
- What does your husband do?
- He's in a few businesses.

219
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,645
- Sounds mysterious.
- No, no, it's not, really.

220
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,480
My daughter calls us bourgeois.

221
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,167
Thank you so much.

222
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:04,592
- No problem. It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

223
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,596
- Nice house.
- Thank you.

224
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,103
I tell you, the thing I like
about Moltisanti?

225
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,115
He'll even tell Tony Soprano
to go fuck himself.

226
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,946
The guy's fearless.

227
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,489
Who's fearless?

228
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,495
Chris Moltisanti.
Where's my mother?

229
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,952
She's an early riser.

230
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,160
What about Moltisanti?

231
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,127
We were saying he's young
to be made. That kind of shit.

232
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,294
He wanted it
so he stepped up and took it.

233
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,340
Like your dad and Tony Soprano.
Know how they made their names?

234
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,180
- How?
- We got any marshmallows?

235
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,846
Come on, what about my father?

236
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,317
When we was kids,
we had our own little crew.

237
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:11,076
Me, your dad, buon'anima,
Tony, Silvio Dante.

238
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:16,034
We'd do Mickey Mouse scores,
you know, moving pot...

239
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,496
swag. Bullshit stuff.

240
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,664
We thought we were
like the sixth family.

241
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,332
But who knew we was even alive?

242
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,093
Till one fucking night.

243
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,004
And I gotta give your father credit.

244
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:37,052
He had balls as big
as an Irish broad's <i>ass.</i>

245
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,012
There was this old...

246
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,352
old mustache named...

247
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,564
Feech Lamanna.

248
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,697
What Feech meant,
who the fuck knows?

249
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,076
But he was made on the other side,
so he was an original.

250
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,203
He was an O.G.

251
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,785
Whatever.

252
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,124
He had this Saturday night
card game...

253
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,256
and your father sees a chance
to rise to the A-league.

254
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:12,387
Connected or not, him,
me and Tony were gonna rob him.

255
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,382
We thought your father lost a marble.

256
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,052
- But he said, "Fuck it."
- Balls.

257
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,811
What happened?

258
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,390
They took it down and
walked away with 20 large.

259
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,729
Jesus Christ.

260
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,895
What do you mean, "they"?
You didn't go?

261
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,815
I'm still sick over it.

262
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,778
I caught the clap from some
hippie broad I was fucking.

263
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,448
My dick was dripping
like a busted pipe.

264
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,414
Anyways, the rest is history.

265
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:48,628
Your father and Tony was on the
fast track to being made, and I...

266
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,419
was still a little shit here,
like the two of you.

267
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:57,091
And of course I, whatever...
But that was a few years later.

268
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,260
- They get away with it?
- What could Feech do?

269
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,019
There was a sit-down.

270
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,808
And the right people
got some of their money back...

271
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,817
but the point was made.

272
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,072
Your father and Tony were rising stars
to be respected.

273
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,784
Cocksuckers.

274
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:22,116
All right, kiddies.
That's enough for tonight.

275
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,789
Oh, Jackie.

276
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:30,832
Rinse those plates before you put
them in the dishwasher. It clogs.

277
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:42,344
<i>We can't help but be amazed
at the instincts they possess.</i>

278
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:48,605
<i>To protect all manner of livestock.
To be protective of us.</i>

279
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,232
<i>What can we do to protect them?</i>

280
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,650
<i>Nurture their defenses...</i>

281
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,412
<i>musing the natural body
defense system in Pedigree.</i>

282
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,831
What is wrong with me?

283
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,332
<i>Pedigree.</i>

284
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,419
Cut it out.

285
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,878
Are you drunk?

286
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,684
- How about right here?
- You would, wouldn't you? Huh?

287
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,354
Does my car look slanted?

288
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,687
Oh, shit.

289
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,732
I have a flat.

290
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,152
Oh, my God.

291
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,908
Jesus Christ.

292
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,870
So creepy.

293
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,414
Why?

294
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,283
I don't know.

295
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,914
What?

296
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,586
- You know who did this, don't you?
- What?

297
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,051
I saw that look.
At least don't lie to me.

298
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,759
- What do I know about your tires?
- Fine.

299
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,052
Thanks for your help.

300
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,930
One time.

301
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:15,567
My ex-girlfriend, she got a little
jealous and she slashed my tires.

302
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,698
That thought went through
my mind just then.

303
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,659
- It couldn't have been her.
- The cunt that called?

304
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,492
- My car's fucked!
- You work for a dealer.

305
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,246
- You think I get free tires?
- So I'll pay for it!

306
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,003
Why offer if you didn't
have a guilty conscience?

307
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,834
About what?

308
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,129
I don't know. Tell me.

309
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,090
This is fucking bullshit.
I'm going home.

310
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,596
- Who else would do it?
- Kids, maybe.

311
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,850
- Ruin a great evening over this!
- Kids!

312
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,102
Maybe your brother-in-law.

313
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,515
Maybe Mr. Globe, since you're
America's sweetheart this week.

314
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,101
Where the fuck do you get off?

315
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,314
This immigrant, alcoholic,
probably HIV-laden slut...

316
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,198
Whoa with that!

317
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:05,863
Slashes my tires and you
call my life into question?

318
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,373
She wouldn't do it!
I slapped the piss out of her.

319
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,250
Oh. Did you?

320
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,338
Did you really hit her?

321
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,133
I don't know.

322
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:28,134
She's a poor, confused kid
from an underdeveloped country.

323
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,644
Even if she did do this.

324
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,649
I'll make some calls.
I'll have new Michelins in an hour.

325
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,904
<i>What are these'? 8541185'? What'?</i>

326
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,566
Jesus Christ.

327
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,490
All right, 17's!

328
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:53,998
Gene Pontecorvo's got a card game.
We could take it down now.

329
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,537
Are you crazy? He's with Ralph.

330
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,332
Essentially, that's Ralph's game.

331
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,093
Even better. Fuck him
and his rinse-your-dishes shit.

332
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,796
Know what?
I think he's a secret fag.

333
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,510
I don't know.

334
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:11,515
Maybe take Carlo. He's got a shotgun.
We wear masks.

335
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,726
We go in.
We're out in like two minutes.

336
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,233
- What if they find out it's us?
- We want them to.

337
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,861
Not right away,
but like Ralph said.

338
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,194
When they do, you know
it's gonna get squashed.

339
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,233
My old man was Jackie Aprile.

340
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,574
The worse that'll happen,
we give some back.

341
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,622
We pull this off...

342
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:37,079
we're like free agents.
We dictate the terms, not them.

343
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,043
Because we show balls.

344
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,378
Come on, call Carlo.

345
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,055
Fuck. There's no signal.

346
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,222
<i>I'd have to be pretty stupid
to write a book about killing...</i>

347
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,140
Use that phone.

348
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,398
Oh, yeah, this one.

349
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,734
Come on, hurry up, call Carlo.

350
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:09,280
- They show my favorite part yet?
- I think it's coming up.

351
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,990
<i>The answer's no.</i>

352
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:19,788
- Dude, move over. Give me some room.
- Fuck you, it's my house.

353
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,665
Here it comes.

354
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,591
Yeah.

355
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,757
<i>Like a cigarette, Nick?</i>

356
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,184
<i>- You two know each other?
- No.</i>

357
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:46,864
I saw a psychiatrist. That's why
Father lntintola said we should talk.

358
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,822
He said you were getting
a doctorate in psychiatry.

359
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,031
Psychology-

360
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:57,416
The psychiatrist told me my
whole life is a lie, and he's right.

361
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,294
And now I think I'm sick.

362
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,174
And if I die, I will never
be with God in eternity.

363
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,133
- You're ill?
- I think I have ovarian cancer.

364
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:14,471
- What does the doctor say?
- I haven't seen one.

365
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,977
I'm afraid.

366
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:22,393
- Why do you think you are ill?
- I'm spotting. Lower back pain.

367
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:28,156
My hormones are all over the place.
My cousin Kathy died from it.

368
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,363
God doesn't punish people
for mistakes that they've made.

369
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,496
He loves you more than you know.

370
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:41,165
Have you thought, with your symptoms,
you might be with child?

371
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,499
I know, that's another...

372
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:49,255
Would you be more comfortable
if we set this sacrament aside...

373
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,338
and stepped into my office?

374
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:11,027
The psychiatrist said
I should leave my husband.

375
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,951
When he said that, it seemed so right.

376
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,866
You made a sacred vow.
Divorce is out of the question.

377
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:24,287
Unless...
Is he abusive, your husband?

378
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,872
Not to me. But he is unfaithful.

379
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,376
He's a good man basically, but...

380
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,298
I talked to Father lntintola
years ago, and here I am.

381
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,384
- Do you love your husband?
- I do.

382
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,521
I love my husband.
And I love God.

383
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,229
But my life is financed by crime.

384
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,228
His crime.

385
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,575
Fifty thousand dollars
to my daughter's college.

386
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,325
The psychiatrist says
it's all blood money.

387
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,665
Now, to maybe bring another child
into this?

388
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:07,250
God understands that we all live
in the middle of tensions.

389
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:11,088
You say your husband has good in him.

390
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:16,263
What you have to do is learn to live
on what the good part earns.

391
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,139
The what?

392
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,597
There is a point inside yourself.

393
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:29,815
An inner boundary beyond which
you feel culpable.

394
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,823
You've got to come to an awareness
of where that line is.

395
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,611
And forego those things
which lay without it.

396
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:42,623
- The Church has changed so much.
- It's a complex world.

397
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:49,797
Learn to live on the good part.
Forego those things that lay without it.

398
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,132
I think I can do that, Father.

399
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,384
<i>I'll try.</i>

400
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,884
And go see an ob-gyn.

401
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,691
This mad-cow disease.

402
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,980
It's terrible the English government
didn't tell people.

403
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,116
Maybe they didn't wanna
create a stampede.

404
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,574
Oh, by the way...

405
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:26,709
guess which former medical student
no longer dates the Queen of Mean.

406
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,494
You're kidding.

407
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:34,133
- Jackie Jr. and Meadow are finished?
- Frankly, I am delighted.

408
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:39,593
Kevin told Angie Bonpensiero
that Jackie was smoking marijuana.

409
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,885
- And was caught cheating at Rutgers.
- Gee, that bad?

410
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,554
That black kid would've been better.

411
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:51,017
He's got a 4.0 and he's moving
to India for the U.N.

412
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,356
- I told you.
- That's my fault.

413
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,155
She wasted three months
with Jackie Jr.

414
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,026
- Hello.
- Mrs. Soprano!

415
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,447
- Gloria Trillo, Globe Motors.
- Hi, how are you?

416
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,375
I hope this is a good time.
The new E-320 just came in.

417
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,410
You might wanna take a look.

418
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:14,957
No, I don't think so.
I still have another year on my lease.

419
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,543
Maybe your husband will treat you.

420
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,212
Maybe I will.
Thank you for calling.

421
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,757
Okay, bye. Hope to see you!

422
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,387
Bye-bye.

423
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,271
Well, what a nice woman.

424
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,646
Who?

425
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:34,185
Just some saleswoman
from Globe Motors.

426
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,981
What?

427
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:45,492
She wants me to try the new wagon.
I'm not interested, but she was nice.

428
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,824
She took me home
while they serviced the wagon.

429
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,745
I should hold onto it another year,
don't you think?

430
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,414
Another year.

431
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,583
Yeah.

432
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,017
I was just wondering
if we could switch days off.

433
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,853
- Give me a minute.
- We could switch...

434
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,985
I got a customer coming in, all right?
Tony.

435
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,158
Are you out of your fucking mind,
talking to my wife?

436
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,998
I was upset about your ex-girlfriend.
I thought you should see my version.

437
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,460
I'm sorry, all right?

438
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,342
You drove her home. What the fuck?

439
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,130
Then you look right into my eyes
and don't tell me?

440
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:51,346
It's normal to be curious about
someone you love's significant others.

441
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,640
- It's not. It's fucking twisted.
- It is not.

442
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,059
I don't wanna argue.
You're upset.

443
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:00,897
I know it's on the margins
for someone like you...

444
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,235
and it'll never happen again.

445
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,650
No shit.

446
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:10,406
You can tell your shrink
you ruined eight relationships.

447
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,705
- What do you mean?
- It's fucking over.

448
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,665
Tony!

449
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:21,300
You see, Tuesday I can take my kid
to hear Raffi.

450
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,841
Left ovary.

451
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,518
Right ovary.

452
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,395
Just tell me right out.
Don't mince words.

453
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,686
<i>I didn't like people
knowing my personal life.</i>

454
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,197
Where is this asshole now?
What did he have, one song?

455
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,693
- What?
- We should do what we gotta do.

456
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,284
- Call Carlo.
- Who the fuck was Feech Lamanna?

457
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,869
You know what? Don't come.

458
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:58,746
You wanna spend your life with
your head up your ass, be my guest.

459
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:06,215
- How's your calamari salad?
- He's not using the right olive oil.

460
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,432
- You haven't said two words, Carmela.
- Sorry.

461
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,229
- I came from Dr. Rotelli's.
- Everything all right?

462
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,733
I've never been better.
Just a thyroid thing.

463
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,065
- Thank God.
- I thought I was pregnant.

464
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,481
Bite your tongue. At our age?

465
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,321
With the kids growing up and all...

466
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:32,784
I want a grandchild. Terry
and her husband are trying, but...

467
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:36,450
Speaking of kids, I am sick
about Jackie and Meadow.

468
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,586
I ask, he tells me
to mind my own business.

469
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,917
- So does she.
- They broke up?

470
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,132
Is Meadow okay?

471
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,922
She's so different than I was.
It rolls off her back.

472
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,593
- No weight loss or sleepless nights.
- Not like what we go through.

473
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,760
Because we married them.

474
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,977
It's not just us.
The president of the United States...

475
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,986
His wife put up with the
blowjobs and the stained dress.

476
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,522
Hillary Clinton? I can't stand her.

477
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,950
We could all take a page
from her book.

478
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,328
To be publicly humiliated
and go around smiling?

479
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:18,538
That is so false. I would dig a hole,
climb into it and not come out.

480
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,955
All I know is, she stuck by him,
put up with the bullshit...

481
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,795
and she set up
her own little thing.

482
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:31,009
She took all that negative shit
he gave her and spun it into gold.

483
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,549
You gotta give her credit.

484
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,638
Well, that's true, isn't it?

485
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,476
She's a role model for all of us.

486
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,696
No, the case is still pending.

487
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:53,532
They could try me on mail and wire
fraud, but they want a major RICO.

488
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,825
Tony. Line two.

489
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:01,835
- Who is it?
- It's a woman. I think she's crying.

490
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,758
Let me get back to you.

491
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,511
Hello.

492
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,057
Tony.

493
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,569
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't...

494
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,234
I can't understand you.

495
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,034
I can't take it anymore.

496
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,657
<i>Stay...</i>

497
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,620
<i>I don't know... l don't know why.
I don't know why.</i>

498
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,713
<i>Tony-</i>

499
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,210
Tony.

500
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,271
- Thanks for coming.
- All right.

501
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,450
- You want something to drink?
- No.

502
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,826
I'm sorry. There's no one else
I can talk to.

503
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,328
What about him?

504
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:30,583
- Laugh if you want. He helps.
- He's a Captain Marvel.

505
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,090
I just want it to be the way it was.

506
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,810
- I love you.
- Stop it.

507
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,269
- I'm sorry.
- Quit crying. I can't stand it.

508
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,651
- I wanna be with you.
- That's not gonna happen.

509
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,821
I know.

510
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,946
I know.

511
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:00,287
My life's a trip to nowhere.

512
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,823
You bring it on yourself.

513
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:08,086
You're a beautiful, talented woman.

514
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,085
But you...

515
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:15,510
- You push a man away.
- That's not gonna happen again.

516
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:20,469
The other night with the tires.
I'm a grown man. I've had other women.

517
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,476
- You think I lived in a freezer?
- Fine.

518
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:28,308
I'll sit back like a mute while you
screw every woman out there.

519
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,976
See, there's that tone again.

520
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,108
Look.

521
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,107
It's over.

522
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:42,154
I mean, we had our mo-fo,
or whatever.

523
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,164
And it was great.

524
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,747
And now it's time to put it to bed.

525
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,171
You think you can treat me like
some stupid goombah housewife?

526
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,432
You think I'll let some fucker
shit over me...

527
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:06,728
just because he buys me
some ridiculous, gaudy ring?

528
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,023
Where the fuck do you get off?

529
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,395
You don't care.

530
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:16,234
Think you're the only one with
problems? My life's a fucking picnic?

531
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,568
Poor you.

532
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,242
You got a dream life compared to mine.
Nobody cares if I'm alive or dead!

533
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,371
I didn't just meet you.

534
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,876
- I've known you my whole life.
- That's right.

535
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,420
Take a dump wherever you please
and walk away.

536
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,306
My mother was just like you.

537
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,635
A bottomless black hole.

538
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,724
The mother now.

539
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:53,396
I surrender.
Burn me at the stake.

540
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,935
You know what?

541
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,063
You're fucking crazy.

542
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,234
- All I ever asked for was kindness.
- Come here.

543
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:07,747
Listen to me, and listen good.
No more calls, no more nothing.

544
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,000
You see me, cross the street.

545
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,578
You're dangerous,
and I don't want you in my life.

546
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,088
<i>DOD'!</i>

547
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,712
I'll call your wife!

548
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,511
What did you say?

549
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,800
I'll go to Columbia.
I'll tell your daughter.

550
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,642
Come on!

551
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,439
Come here.

552
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,113
Now, you listen to me.

553
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,783
Go near my wife or my family,
and I'll kill you.

554
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,952
Understand? I'll kill you.

555
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,998
Kill me. Kill me, you cocksu...

556
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,883
You fucking bitch!

557
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,629
Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.

558
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,339
Kill me.

559
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,352
Kill me, kill me,
kill me, kill me...

560
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,396
Kill me.

561
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,085
All right, this is it.

562
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,843
I don't care if God comes by,
don't move the car.

563
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,925
- You do the talking.
- Me?

564
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,590
- Eugene will know me.
- Don't worry.

565
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,393
When they see this,
nobody will have to say a word.

566
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,850
What's the matter?

567
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,358
I don't know.

568
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,564
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Why?

569
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,027
Don't you?

570
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,404
Fuck it, let's go down the shore.

571
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,621
Let's do it before the crank
wears off.

572
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,842
- Ace high flush.
- Flush talks.

573
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,053
Anybody want a drink?

574
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,887
Nobody fucking move!

575
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,267
Take it easy, all right?

576
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:37,772
- Shit.
- Shut up!

577
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,771
Empty your pockets.
All of you!

578
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,313
- Come on!
- Very bad, boys. Very bad.

579
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:48,484
This is a low-level game.
All you'll get is practice.

580
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:52,119
- You hear what he said? Shut up!
- Take it easy.

581
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,114
You know who you're robbing?

582
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,244
- Give me your watch.
- Leave while you look good.

583
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,083
Just give it to him.

584
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,125
Victory has a hundred fathers,
but defeat is an orphan.

585
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,794
Shut up! Stop fucking looking at me!

586
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,587
Come on, hurry up!

587
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,427
Let's get out of here!

588
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:23,644
If you can keep your head
while those around you can't...

589
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:53,132
- Where the fuck is he?
- Shit.

590
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,471
Shit, come on!

591
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:04,476
- Get the fuck out!
- What are you doing? This is my...

592
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,074
Jackie!

593
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,530
Jackie!

594
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,997
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

595
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,999
Hey, cocksucker.

596
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:28,166
Chris, please.
We didn't know you were in there.

597
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,589
We're with Ralphie.

598
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,220
Please?

599
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:55,702
<i>If you're one of many men
with erectile dysfunction...</i>

600
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,363
<i>you know it's no laughing matter.</i>

601
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,875
<i>You might not know treatment
is covered by most medical plans...</i>

602
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:07,210
Dr. Freid. I'm sorry. Your service
said it was an emergency.

603
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,504
Hello.

604
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,594
Jesus Christ.

605
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,928
Not again, Tony.
I can't keep doing this.

606
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,388
I'm in the middle of a comm...

607
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:25,227
Can't he go to the emergency room?
I thought he had a green card.

608
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,280
You'll make him hit an artery!

609
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,907
Relax, let the sedative do its job.

610
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,910
Be glad they didn't hit
nothing important.

611
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:42,666
- This prick is really a doctor?
- Close. I'm a prick doctor. Get it?

612
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,246
Maybe he can give you a bulge.

613
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,629
Doc, see if you can remove
this ladies' underwear.

614
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,747
Ah!

615
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,424
It'll be all right.

616
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,601
Little motherfucker.
He's going, bigtime.

617
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,855
- Sure it was Jackie Jr.?
- I'll do him tonight.

618
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,432
- No, you're not.
- Why?

619
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,817
- Because I said so.
- Why?

620
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:14,277
- I don't gotta explain.
- Because he's Jackie Aprile's kid?

621
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,112
You're not gonna let this go.
You can't!

622
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:20,449
He shot at me, tried to kill Furio.
We're made!

623
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,205
Everyone you whack,
you risk exposure.

624
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,538
The feds ask for major murder
for Christmas.

625
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,126
- You're a fucking hypocrite.
- What did you say?

626
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,382
You preach this wise-guy shit...

627
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,302
meanwhile we're the only ones
who play by the rules.

628
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,467
I loved you.

629
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,798
What happens, I decide.

630
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,060
You don't love me, that hurts,
but too bad.

631
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:48,098
Because you don't gotta love me.
But you will respect me.

632
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,838
Ralph Cifaretto's here.

633
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,332
What'd we say?

634
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,230
- Ton.
- How you doing?

635
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,859
- It's terrible, huh?
- Yeah.

636
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:37,113
Ro's going nuts. She knows
he hangs around with Dino.

637
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,366
- Any word from her son?
- No, no.

638
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,699
All right, come on.

639
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,247
This kid.

640
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,881
- He did a terrible thing.
- Terrible.

641
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:01,380
- Your fucking card game.
- I know you're close to the family.

642
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,266
No, I feel for you.
You're living under the same roof.

643
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,597
And it was my card game.

644
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,731
But what happened to Sunshine...

645
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,766
is a disgrace.

646
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,239
But to tell you the truth, Tony...

647
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,741
I wanna give the kid a <i>pass.</i>

648
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:28,118
Yeah?

649
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,830
It's just me though.
I know you got bigger concerns.

650
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,415
You're the boss, and...

651
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,798
I'll make sure your orders are done.

652
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:41,803
I think you should go
with your instincts on this, Ralph.

653
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,589
You do?

654
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:51,099
But Furio took a hit. Chris.
These are made men.

655
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:55,100
I'll make sure they respect
your decision.

656
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,361
Because I'm sure
you'll do the right thing.

657
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,280
That's why I made you captain.

658
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,114
This is Rosalie's kid.

659
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:15,792
That's why I'll understand if you give
him a pass. Everybody else will too.

660
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:21,551
Who cares about shit they don't
have the balls to say to your face?

661
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,674
Kid disrespected you.

662
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,847
But they don't have
to live with your commitments.

663
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:40,399
But, hey, the decision
goes the other way?

664
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:44,657
The one thing you cannot do, Ralph,
you cannot do...

665
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,159
is blame yourself.

666
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,989
You took this kid under your wing.

667
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,284
You schooled him as best you could.

668
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,581
Didn't you?

669
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,801
Jack spoiled him.

670
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,173
I think this is yours.

671
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:13,185
The stupid kid was carrying it around
during the holidays.

672
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,889
She wanted me to fucking kill her.

673
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,099
Like suicide by cop.

674
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,935
So she set me up?

675
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,317
She saw me as only a fucking hammer?

676
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,228
She loved you.

677
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,905
She looked so good too,
that day in your office.

678
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,114
Just another Irina
with a college degree.

679
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,783
Ask yourself.

680
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:23,002
How did you recognize in Gloria,
under her layers of sophistication...

681
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:28,590
this deeply wounded, angry being
that would let you replicate...

682
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,426
your relationship
with your mother?

683
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:35,765
I don't wanna fuck my mother.
You're never gonna convince me.

684
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,519
Not fuck.

685
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,934
Try to please her.

686
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,940
Try to win her love.

687
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,272
Forty fucking years old.

688
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:48,611
We need to repeat what's familiar,
even if it's bad for us.

689
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,946
Gloria's need for drama.

690
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:56,326
The selfishness.
The incessant self-regard.

691
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,957
At one time...

692
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,620
in your mother's hands,
it passed for love.

693
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:07,633
All right, look. You're her doctor.
You tell me.

694
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,135
Do I gotta worry about this broad?

695
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,138
She says she's gonna
tell Carmela about us.

696
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,925
I honestly can't predict.

697
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,644
We should deal with...

698
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,649
why are you so attracted
to dangerous relationships?

699
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,856
Why do you put your marriage
in such danger?

700
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:32,074
- Maybe I'm looking for a way out.
- Anthony.

701
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,700
- You'll never leave your wife.
- Bullshit. There's a limit.

702
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,162
She might leave you,
but you'll never leave her.

703
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,665
Despite your mothering...

704
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:49,584
you made one good decision
in your life vis-a-vis women.

705
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,844
You won't throw that over.

706
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,927
Your own selfishness is too strong
to let that happen.

707
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,013
All right. All right.

708
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:04,019
Actually, in spite of everything
you're a very conventional man.

709
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,774
I said all right.

710
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,861
We have to stop now.

711
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,625
- Got pep, I'll give it that.
- Zero to 60 in under seven seconds.

712
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,055
What's the matter, you don't like me?

713
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:48,526
I'm not back, they call the cops,
standard operating procedure.

714
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:53,648
Here's standard operating procedure.
Stay away from Tony Soprano.

715
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:57,944
Shut the fuck up and listen.
It's over, capisce?

716
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,409
Over and done.

717
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:04,997
You call or go anywhere near him
or his family...

718
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,585
and they'll be scraping your
nipples off these leather seats.

719
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,170
And here's the point to remember.

720
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:17,179
My face is the last one you'll see.
Not Tony's.

721
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,174
We understand each other?

722
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,435
It won't be cinematic.

723
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,459
Any word, anything?

724
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,834
He probably went down to Florida.

725
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,208
Ro, I'm sure he's fine.

726
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,627
Ro, come on.

727
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,344
Sit down.

728
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:11,726
Look.

729
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:16,731
- This will be hard for you to hear.
- Jesus Christ!

730
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:20,367
No, it's okay. It's okay, it's just...

731
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,246
he has a very serious drug problem.

732
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,657
What?

733
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:32,338
It's coke.
He may owe some money to dealers.

734
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,506
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't wanna tell you.

735
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,880
Look, we're doing everything we can.

736
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,678
We're gonna find him.

737
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,939
We'll get him help.

738
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,520
We'll get him to rehab.

739
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:59,073
Let's just hope he's not too far gone.

740
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,675
Something smells good.

741
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,725
Lemon snaps for the
bake sale at church.

742
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,074
You look good.

743
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,489
I went to step today.

744
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:52,001
Is that why you don't have these
looney-tune moods when you exercise?

745
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,588
Where's your ring?

746
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,257
I had to get it sized.
It's a little big.

747
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,949
Hi, it's me. I'll be home
in about twenty minutes.

748
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,956
Yeah, I picked up the stuffed shells.

749
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,668
No, the Celantano's,
you just gotta heat them up.
